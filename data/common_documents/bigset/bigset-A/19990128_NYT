   NEW YORK _ When No. 8 from the University of Alabama was
introduced on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, the
smattering of boos were drowned out by the raucous applause. So
much for disgust and indignation. Latrell Sprewell, back from
basketball purgatory after more than a year, received the loudest
ovation of any New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   A buzz fell over the arena every time he touched the ball in the
first quarter. It was four minutes into the game when he hit his
first shot, a medium-range jumper from 17 feet. People pumped their
fists. Two hand-drawn ``Go Spree'' signs went up.
</P>
<P>
   All net. All forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks came back to the Garden for the first time since last
May, bringing all their assets and liabilities to bear in a
preseason game that meant nothing and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long wait,'' said Sprewell after he brought the
Garden to its feet in his debut. He had 27 points, including 17
during a third-quarter explosion. Putting a slow first half behind
him, he was mostly awesome in 30 minutes. The Knicks won, too,
holding off the New Jersey Nets, 88-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen months,'' he added. ``It's been an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a risky, Off Broadway production that needed excellent
opening-night reviews to make it through the next few months, the
producers that gambled on Sprewell opened their doors, free of
charge, and then prayed no one missed a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward took the public-address microphone and welcomed
everyone back, the referee Don Vaden looked at Knicks Coach Jeff
Van Gundy in the first period and said: ``Nice to see you. I could
kiss you.'' And, for a few brief moments, everything seemed as it
was when we last saw this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the basketball was awful. From slow-footed
veterans like Patrick Ewing to lost-looking Marcus Camby, the
Knicks were out of sync. The Nets were not much prettier, though
Jayson Williams clearly ate his Wheaties during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Given the layoff and the time it takes for chemistry to develop,
to gauge either of these teams' playoff hopes less than three weeks
into the regular season is premature.
</P>
<P>
   But even on Wednesday, times were changing. Three hours before
Sprewell was introduced, Buck Williams said goodbye. Another aging
warrior committed to memory, making way for the young and the
restless.
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference _ attended by a half-full room of
reporters, Van Gundy and the Knicks president Ernie Grunfeld _
Williams would not bite when asked to draw distinctions between
players from his era and, well, the new guys.
</P>
<P>
   That Williams's last day at the Garden was Sprewell's first did
not resonate with Buck. This was not a morality play. This was the
end of a long, distinguished career, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   He found satisfaction in the fact that the son of a North
Carolina sharecropper might one day send his daughter to the same
Connecticut private school that President Bush's children attended.
The National Basketball Association, he said, had been good to him.
</P>
<P>
   And, in turn, he was good for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have an obligation to the public to carry themselves
in a certain way and be held accountable,'' Williams said. ``I've
never wanted to do anything to embarrass myself, the organization
and my family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things really weighed a lot heavier than some of the
other issues I was confronted with through my career. It made me
want to be a role model and do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No one garnered more intrigue or attention than Sprewell, the
guy who choked his coach and missed the last 68 games because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   He got a new start with a new team on Wednesday night. In the
first half he had hit 2 of 5 shots, had 2 rebounds and lost 3
turnovers. He was looking as if he was trying too hard to fit in.
But less than a half-hour later, the roar of the arena had opened
up possibilities for him. He went back to being the same aggressive
player who carried a franchise at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third quarter, feeling that rush again after
hitting two shots in a row, he began waving his arms on the
perimeter, yelling at Ward to pass him the ball. Catch. Release.
Swish.
</P>
<P>
   He could not miss, and the Garden could not stay quiet for
several seconds, chanting his name as if he had played in New York
for eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, when he was asked if it felt good to be asked
questions pertaining to the game again, he smiled and said: ``Yeah,
it's all about basketball now. I don't want to rehash the past and
relive everything over and over. I know I'll have to do it
sometimes, but I want to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his second-half binge, it's way too early for
proclamations. Who knows where he goes from here, whether or not
the incident becomes the focal point, a footnote or somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   The best he _ and perhaps any player in the NBA _ can hope for
is to play hard for 17 years, go to the finals twice and make three
All-Star teams and gain and keep the respect of your peers. Just
like Buck Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a great career. Perhaps because he played only the
past two seasons in New York and because of Sprewell's debut, that
fact was overlooked. He scored more than 16,000 points and grabbed
more than 13,000 rebounds and always comported himself like he
cared.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's last night at the Garden. Sprewell's first. An ending, a
beginning and a season of uncertainty ahead. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ He sleeps soundly again, the pressures and demands of yet
another Super Bowl week notwithstanding. Gary Kubiak's life has
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   He's back in his comfort zone, a place of clear focus and easily
deciphered objectives. It's all X's and O's again _ no ?'s.
</P>
<P>
   That Kubiak will be a head coach someday remains a foregone
conclusion. He might even become the first head coach of an NFL
expansion franchise in Houston, should one be forthcoming for the
2002 season. But for now, he would rather follow than lead. He
would rather be charged with implementing a plan than scripting one
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, he still considers himself ``a young guy with a lot more
to learn.'' In his heart, he didn't believe he was ready to take
over at the University of Colorado. And so, never mind all the
money and prestige on the table, right there for his asking, he
chose to remain at the right hand of Mike Shanahan, his mentor and
the Broncos' mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``this is not a bad gig.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't. Kubiak is one of the highest-paid assistants in
the NFL, pulling down a very comfortable six-figure income, and he
works for a class organization that is a 7{-point favorite to
defend its world championship in Super Bowl XXXIII on Sunday.
Shanahan gives him a sizable piece of the (play) action, too.
Kubiak is more than a clipboard-toting, headphone-wearing parrot.
</P>
<P>
   While Denver's offense may be Shanahan's, it's heavily seasoned
with Kubiak's input. Which, of course, is why he has become such a
hot prospect for any program seeking a fresh face with a winning
pedigree. This is Kubiak's sixth Super Bowl, three spent as John
Elway's backup and three as the middle man between Shanahan and his
quarterback. (One of those came with San Francisco, where Shanahan
was offensive coordinator and Kubiak the quarterbacks coach.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones talked to Kubiak last year about taking over the
Cowboys. Carmen Policy talked to him this year about the new
Cleveland Browns' post. Colorado did more than talk. The Buffaloes
all but put a contract in front of Kubiak and handed him a pen.
</P>
<P>
   It blew his mind. Literally. He tossed and turned for five
nights. The circles under his eyes grew bigger and darker, causing
the Broncos to kid him about ``how bad I was looking.'' Ultimately,
after enduring extreme anxiety, he concluded he wasn't ready to
take the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest football decision I've ever had to make,'' Kubiak
said. ``It was a very tempting situation. Dick (Tharp, Colorado's
athletic director) could not have treated me any better. But what I
learned about myself is that I can't go in two directions at once,
and it wouldn't have been smart for me to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I followed my gut feeling. That was Mike's advice to me: Go
with my gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan didn't want to lose Kubiak, whom he trusts implicitly,
but it was Shanahan who made the original phone call to Tharp after
Kubiak expressed interest in the job. Because it's understood every
coach's goal is to be a head coach, those who have achieved said
stature are reluctant to stand in an assistant's way, no matter how
prized he may be.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Shanahan, although he admits he was
``pleasantly surprised'' when Kubiak told him he would be staying
put.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's a heck of a football coach,'' Shanahan said. ``I didn't
want to lose him. But as his friend, I had an obligation to help
him if that's what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it wasn't. Some now wonder if Kubiak's
reluctance to break out on his own, to cut the figurative umbilical
cord that has long bound him to Shanahan, will retard his chances
in the future. There has been fallout speculation that Kubiak lacks
the self-confidence and/or dynamism to head up a program, be it at
the professional or college level.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are expected to be utterly cocksure in order to be able
to impart same to their players. They're not supposed to be overly
introspective. That's for pointy-headed intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Kubiak says he is what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys could have made that transition (from the Broncos to
the Buffaloes) and never missed a beat,'' he said. ``They could
have taken care of business on both fronts at once without any
problems. But it would have been very hard for me, and I knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids (at Colorado) needed a coach who was ready to jump
in with everything he had and get them going on their offseason
program. What I would have had to do wouldn't have been fair to
them or to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems both the Broncos and the Buffs profited from Kubiak's
sending his regrets to Boulder. Colorado wound up hiring a proven
commodity in Northwestern's Gary Barnett, a gung-ho native of the
state, and the AFC champions got to keep their high command fully
intact _ sans distractions _ for the most important game of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another much-coveted ring is in the offing here. As Kubiak said,
it's not a bad gig.

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ When Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. walked into the Texas
Sports Hall of Fame on Wednesday night, he made it clear that
trying to acquire Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Roger Clemens still was
in his plans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I had looked forward to talking to Roger tonight,'' McLane
said. ``I wanted to apologize for what transpired in December and
say we still would love for him to be a Houston Astro.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane said he still hopes a trade can be worked out that would
bring Clemens, one of Wednesday's TSHF inductees, to Houston before
the start of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will be a real challenge,'' McLane said. ``Nothing new
has developed, but (Astros general manager) Gerry (Hunsicker)
continues to talk to Gord Ash (the Toronto GM). He told Gerry about
three weeks ago he would get back to us but it would take several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to reactivate it sometime next week and just see what
happens. The first step is you have to make a deal with Toronto.
He's not a free agent. We would have to make a trade that is
agreeable to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is one of the premier players in all of baseball, so
they are going to want some real talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros talked to the Blue Jays in December about a trade,
but the negotiations became acrimonious when Hunsicker held a news
conference to say that Clemens' financial demands for a contract
extension as part of the deal were unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Clemens said he never would play for the
Astros as long as the current management team of Hunsicker and team
president Tal Smith was in place.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens softened his stance last week in comments he made while
playing golf in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in California, saying
he still would like to play for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   McLane said he was encouraged by Clemens' comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when we had the difficulties that time heals a lot of
problems,'' McLane said. ``Then, Roger did a bold step Friday at
the Bob Hope tournament. I was shocked when I picked up the paper
Saturday and saw the positive things he said. Time has healed some
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who won his fifth Cy Young Award in November, said
Wednesday he still has mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My (original) statements still hold true,'' he said. ``I
thought there was a lot of distress for no reason, especially for
my family. But in our profession you have to have fairly thick
skin, and I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going on right now as far as I know, but as spring
training gets closer, we may know more. I'm not worried about
things that aren't in my control.''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked Clemens about a published report that said he
had called Astros second baseman Craig Biggio to apologize for his
earlier comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that came up, but I haven't talked to any
of those guys,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   The question infuriated Alan Hendricks, one of Clemens' agents.
``That may have been the jackass question of the offseason,''
Hendricks said. ``That was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks was asked where the situation stands between Toronto
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undetermined and dormant,'' Hendricks said. ``But I'm
never surprised by anything in this business. It's unknown until
it's over. I can't say if anything is on or anything is off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks emphasized that no serious discussion would take place
at the TSHF banquet, even though McLane and Hunsicker were in Waco
to see Astros manager Larry Dierker be inducted into the Hall.
Clemens sat next to Dierker on the dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the rules, we are not allowed to talk,'' Hendricks
said. ``We'll say hello (to McLane), and that's it. Besides, I went
to UH. I'm here for (1999 inductees) Hakeem (Olajuwon) and Clyde
(Drexler). Roger is just an added bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said he continues to be in contact with Toronto about
Clemens' status and wouldn't rule out a trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's still within the realm of possibility,''
Hunsicker said. ``The first thing that has to happen is Toronto has
to make a decision whether they are going to trade him. We have let
them know all along, and have continued to let them know, that we
are interested in bringing Roger to Houston if they are interested
in trading him. Our interest has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the ball is in Toronto's court. ``They clearly
have not been very aggressive in their efforts,'' Hunsicker said.
``Where it goes from here, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane said the Astros can't be proactive on Clemens because
commissioner Bud Selig stated Dec. 18 that the discussions must
come from Toronto. Anything else would be tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a grasp for where it is, but we certainly would
like to do it,'' McLane said. ``But we can't hurt our team in order
to do this. Toronto knows we can't give up a significant number of
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the summer, when we were trying to make a trade before
the first of August, they wanted five of our top players,
particularly our young players. They wanted (outfielder) Richard
Hidalgo and (pitcher) Scott Elarton, two people who we think are
going to be two of the best in baseball in a few years. We can't
trade away talent like that.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHARLES Barkley took one for the team, all right, but, hey, the one
he took did have six zeros behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley realizes this. He might be bald and his intentions pure,
but he's no Gandhi. He understands. He laughs about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is not so much fun about the game anymore is
too many people are complaining about money,'' Barkley said. ``It's
all about money for too many guys. I know young guys have to try
and make money, but I was in a situation where I could do something
and help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did. He took one. Million. He put his money where his
mouth was, literally. He signed with the Rockets at the bargain
price of $1 million, knocking down the first domino that cascaded
to Scottie Pippen's feet and helped make the Rockets what they are,
legitimate NBA title contenders.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Barkley agreeing to the cheaper contract instead of
the $2 million or $3 million contract he could have had, Pippen
would not be a Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets should thank Barkley and have. If Pippen earns his
seventh NBA championship ring in Houston, he should point to
Barkley as one of the biggest reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was a selfless act, sure. But it was not selfless like a
Secret Service agent taking a bullet or a father pulling three
shifts at the plant in order to sock away some bucks for his kid's
college fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley realizes the irony of it all, the skewed righteousness
of being a Million-Dollar Martyr.
</P>
<P>
   If taking a $1 million salary is the greatest act of
selflessness this state has seen since the battle of the Alamo,
like some would say Barkley's move was, then we should all don
coonskin hats, raise our muskets and take one for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Chuckster!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should remember this instead: The grandest thing
Barkley did during the long offseason had nothing to do with money
or ``sacrificing'' a couple of million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It had to do with the game Barkley always has loved and the way
he committed himself to it quietly during the lockout, when the
notepads were shut and the cameras off.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley sacrificed himself the way he did as a kid, the way
youngsters on the way to a scouting combine would sacrifice
themselves _ with the lonesome thumping of a basketball in a gym,
working on his game.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every day since undergoing offseason double hernia
surgery, Barkley would run in the morning, play golf in the
afternoon and lift weights in the evening. He put in the hours. He
mixed in some O'Doul's.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough regimen, and for this Hall of Fame-bound
multimillionaire, it might have been a tougher sacrifice than
taking a mere $1 million for one season.
</P>
<P>
   It was about basketball. It was about still playing, being
embarrassed about the way his play all but became a series of
predictable post-up moves a year ago. It was about chasing the
championship ring he craves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy took care of his body,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``He was on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest sacrifice Barkley made and maybe the reason a
championship is indeed on the horizon for these Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the bad Charles Barkley last year,'' he said,
referring to the pain in his lower abdomen that kept him from
flying to the basket, blocking shots or slashing through bigger men
to tip in an offensive rebound. ``I've been a quickness player my
whole career. I didn't feel explosive at all last season. When I've
got my back to the basket, I'm really not in an aggressive mode. I
don't want to back it in so much this year. I want to beat guys off
the dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   And there he was Tuesday night against the San Antonio Spurs,
taking it high over Tim Duncan, blocking shots, slashing through
the lane and beating guys off the dribble. After only one full day
of training camp, Barkley was trim, dominant and looking like a
Million Dollar Man and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The sacrifice looks like it will pay off, but not the sacrifice
that had to do with money. The likes of Cleveland Cavaliers star
Shawn Kemp and others entered the shortened preseason practically
sweating cheeseburgers; Barkley entered in the best shape in which
he has been in years and must have the league sweating bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs center David Robinson raved. He called him ``Mr. Barkley''
after Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said Barkley was ``very frisky'' and ``Charles
Barkley at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 22 points and 11 rebounds in 36 minutes. There was
all sorts of potential flying across the Compaq Center floor, and
Barkley, as much as Hakeem Olajuwon and Pippen, was at the center
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you make a million dollars for playing
basketball and people are complaining about it?'' Barkley said.
``You're making a million dollars for two hours of work a night.
There's something wrong if you don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   He took one for the team _ one shot, one sprint and one plate of
weights at a time.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Atlanta kicker Morten Andersen has to visualize each field
goal. At practice, he gets a scenario in his mind _ usually it's a
game-winner he's attempting _ then pictures the defenders rushing
at him as the ball leaves his foot and invariably flies smoothly
through the uprights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a ritual that worked in the NFC Championship Game as he
booted a 38-yarder in overtime to send the Falcons past Minnesota
and into the Super Bowl. Overall, it has worked 25 times for the
NFL's record holder for game-winning kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing went through my mind,'' Andersen said. ``I was just
reacting. I was on automatic at that point, and I just became a
kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the record for game-winners, it was Andersen's first in
a postseason contest. Then again, after playing his entire 17-year
NFL career in New Orleans and Atlanta, he has been in only seven
playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only tougher situation he faces is in training camp, when
if he misses the field goal in practice, the guys have to run
conditioning,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves joked.
</P>
<P>
   After the points go on the board, or in the rare instance the
kick misses, Andersen erases his mind, focusing instead on the rest
of the game. It's this ability that allows him to kick without
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball leaves your foot, and the kick leaves your mind,'' he
said. ``The pressure associated with important kicks is a perceived
notion, something created by the fans and media. As long as I'm
relaxed and at peace, then pressure is nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen finds peace in unusual places such as Nepal, where in
the not-too-distant past he took a mountain-climbing expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was the thin air, but it was an amazing experience,''
he said. ``The air was so crisp and clear. You're up in thin air.
It was a very spiritual thing _ the Buddhists, the Hindus. It
changed my life completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there, and it cleared my mind. It opens you up to a
whole different world how silly you sometimes are when you take
yourself too seriously. A simple life is what it's all about; a
simple life is a happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gave him perspective on his career, which should
eventually lead to a spot in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1 billion people in China who could care less about
what I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are several million in Georgia, however, who care a great
deal.
</P>
<P>
   And Andersen admits he's enjoying the records he's compiling. He
holds seven NFL records, including consecutive games scoring at
least one point (237), most 50-yard field goals (35), most
50-yarders in a game (three), most 100-point seasons (12) and most
Pro Bowl appearances by a kicker (seven).
</P>
<P>
   He is third on the career scoring list with 1,761 points, 241
behind leader George Blanda and 84 behind the Vikings' Gary
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, 38, has two more years on the three-year, $2.7 million
contract he signed with the Falcons. He would need to average 121
points in those two years to surpass Blanda. He has scored 120 or
more four times in his career and 91 or more every year since his
rookie season in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, any time I thought about the scoring record,
it was like, `Well, that's so far out there that it's pie in the
sky,''' Andersen said last February when he signed his most recent
deal. ``But suddenly, it's not so far off. I feel like I've put
myself in a special position, and getting the record has become my
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting records in the United States isn't exactly what Andersen
pictured as a boy. Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he was raised in
Struer, a town of 9,000. At age 17, he came to the United States as
a foreign-exchange student in Indianapolis. He was a star soccer
player with dreams of making the Danish national team when he was
first exposed to football through the family who housed him.
</P>
<P>
   His high school coach asked him to attempt a field goal, and he
easily booted a 50-yarder. He joined the team and eventually earned
a scholarship to Michigan State, where he set a Spartans record
with a 63-yard field goal during his final season.
</P>
<P>
   But while Andersen has had a spectacular NFL career, he hasn't
enjoyed a lot of team success. He was in the league six years
before the Saints made their first postseason appearance, and New
Orleans went to the playoffs four times during Andersen's 13
seasons there, losing each game. He was in Atlanta during the 1995
playoff season, and the Falcons also lost in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has made 11 consecutive postseason field goals,
including the game-winner in Minnesota, and is 14-for-16 for his
playoff career. He is perfect on 12 extra points in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the patience (to wait for postseason success),''
Andersen said. ``The longer you play, and it's not happening, you
start saying, `Man, another year's gone by, and it didn't happen.'
But then you line up the next year, and you go again. You get busy
in the offseason, and you prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt when Dan came in here that something special was
going to happen with this football team, and I never lost faith.
That's why we play, believe me. This right here is 17 years of
faith and hard work, and I'm just thrilled to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   If Andersen could script it, he would love to have a shot at
winning the Super Bowl with a kick, just as he did the NFC title
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dan (Stryzinski) and Adam (Schreiber), who are two
very important people in my professional career _ the snapper and
holder _ and they said it would be OK with them if we repeated it
this week,'' Andersen said. ``So we're going to try to do that.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Denver kicker Jason Elam would like nothing more than to
line up for a field goal that would give the Broncos their second
consecutive Super Bowl victory.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He would love an opportunity to kick the biggest field goal of
his life before the largest television audience, a field goal that
would give Broncos-crazy Colorado back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a little bit crazy to be a kicker in the first
place, so naturally you'd love to be in that situation,'' Elam said
Wednesday. ``As a kicker, you're going to be under a lot of
pressure sooner or later, so you might as well enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam is enjoying the best season of his six-year career. Not
only did he kick a 63-yard field goal to tie Tom Dempsey's NFL
record, but he scored 127 points and was voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Elam has a chance to earn a second Super Bowl ring.
If it were not for him, the Broncos might not have made it beyond
the AFC Championship Game. In a wicked wind at Mile High Stadium,
Elam kicked three field goals in Denver's 23-10 victory over the
New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, I envision every situation I could face in the
game,'' he said. ``When I get to the stadium, I look at every
angle. I want to know where the wind can be blowing from, where the
sun will be. I don't want to leave anything to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I make every kick. I never envision myself
missing. It's the power of positive thinking. Be positive, and you
will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam, who played at the University of Hawaii, says he has missed
only one game-winning kick in his career. That's enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was Matt Bahr who said, `The joy of making a kick
is nowhere near the anguish of missing one,' and I believe that,''
Elam said. ``Thank goodness I've only missed one big one in my
career. I know how bad I felt about that one, and it was in the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam felt terrible for his friend, Minnesota kicker Gary
Anderson, whose only miss in an otherwise perfect season helped
cost the Vikings the NFC Championship Game against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I really felt for Gary,'' Elam said. ``He's a great
kicker and a great guy. He's had a great career, and that was
something every kicker hopes never happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's miss wasn't all bad for Elam. He grew up in
Snellville, Ga., and the Falcons were his favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I've been a Falcons fan for as long as I can remember,''
he said. ``I was a fan when Steve Bartkowski was the quarterback
and Mick Luckhurst was the kicker. I used to live and die with what
the Falcons did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look on ESPN to see what they did. It's going to be
tough to root against them, but I'm going to have to root against
them one time. This game is going to be pretty special for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After each season, Elam packs up his family and returns to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We U-Haul it,'' he said. ``That long drive gives me time to go
back over the season. It's actually very relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we do it? Because that's my home. That's where my
family and friends are. I'm just Jason. I'm not Jason the football
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam's Super Bowl counterpart is Morten Andersen, one of the
greatest kickers in NFL history. But Andersen, whose overtime field
goal beat Minnesota, has kicked indoors in nine straight games,
which some believe will be an advantage for Elam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, but Miami's not a bad place to kick,'' Elam said.
``There's not a lot of swirling wind down here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does make a difference when you kick in conditions
you're used to. I know I have a problem kicking off (artificial)
turf if I haven't kicked on it in a while. When I was in college, I
had a problem going onto grass. It's a case of what you're used to,
but the best kickers don't have much problem adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   When he tied Dempsey's record this season, Elam got more
attention than for anything else he has done in a successful
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' he said. ``Nobody's going to get mad if you miss
a 63-yard field goal, so I just relaxed and crushed it. It was fun
when I made it, and it was fun for the week after it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elam would give up that record-tying field goal for one
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I'd rather have a perfect season than the
63-yard field goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos won their first 13 games before they were upset by
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told some people that, and they think I'm crazy,'' Elam
said. ``They wonder why I'd give up that field goal for a perfect
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why: The field goal made history, but it's an
individual thing. A perfect season would make history, too, and
it's a team thing.''

KNICKS BEAT NETS, 88-87 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As his awkward early appearance morphed into a sight
so sleek and silky on Wenesday night _ a Knick vision formerly
uncommon in Madison Square Garden _ Latrell Sprewell rode the
swells and curls of the crowd's mood swings like a surfer.
</P>
<P>
   He hung in there. And he went from the bumbling and booed
Sprewell who turned over the ball on an isolation play in the first
half to the supremely confident former All-Star who slashed to the
basket and dared anyone to play him on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   So it was true. Sprewell was prone to dangerous outbursts. This
one manifested itself as basketball excellence as he went on a
17-point spurt in the third quarter against a mystified and
injury-riddled New Jersey Nets team. Sprewell's game-high 27 points
led the New York Knicks to an 88-87 victory in their first of two
exhibition games before the regular season begins next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When Sprewell, who shot 11 of 14, went to the bench for a
breather with less than 11 minutes left, he received a standing
ovation. His teammates crowded around him, chest-bumped him and
embraced their new star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let fans know what he was before the Golden State
incident,'' Larry Johnson said. ``He was a player in this league.
And with the moves he made tonight, he brought all those memories
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The welcome mat had been extended, and Sprewell's 14-month exile
from basketball had come to a rousing end.
</P>
<P>
   Any dust that had settled on his acrobatic game had been shaken
off. But Patrick Ewing, who was 3 of 9 for 6 points and had 4
turnovers, was not so fortunate. He plodded through a clumsy
performance, looking like a soft shell of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sprewell, Ewing had not played a regular season game in
over a year. Like Sprewell, he was greeted with mixed reviews. One
All-Star had choked his coach. The other had squeezed the trigger
on the National Basketball Association lockout. Neither act was
forgotten by the crowd. But the treatment was relatively mild. Few
hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the admission was free. Perhaps that made the Knicks'
unsightly appearance in the first half a little easier to take. At
that moment, the redesigned Knicks looked far removed from a
completed project.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were harder to judge. They were facing the Knicks
without a Keith Van Horn, who had food poisoning, and Kerry
Kittles, who had back spasms and a knee injury. But they did have
Jayson Williams (9 points, 7 rebounds) springing up and down on the
court for 26 minutes, revealing why the Nets spent nearly $100
million to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Williams was proving himself, so was Sprewell. After he
blew an open 3-pointer and nearly missed a double-pump dunk in the
first half, Sprewell leaned on his good defense for inspiration and
turned in a shockingly strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my legs at first,'' said Sprewell, who made his
last nine shots. ``But the crowd, I thought, was still there for
me. It was great to get them behind me. I couldn't have asked for
anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing couldn't do it, Sprewell picked up the entire team.
His third-quarter performance _ decorated with back-to-back jumpers
and a nifty driving layup _ sent the Knicks into a groove. Until
then, the Knicks had been misfiring. They went from an 8-point
deficit to start the third quarter to a 72-63 lead as Sprewell
departed with 10 minutes 27 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's explosive,'' Allan Houston said. ``He makes
everyone around him better.''
</P>
<P>
   As union president, Ewing had spent the last six months in a
boardroom discussing revenue sharing. In his isolation, his weight
ballooned and muscles softened. At age 36, his body does not snap
to form the way it used to. That was visible as he began panting in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I was rusty,'' Ewing said. ``But I think I played
better than people thought I would.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. A livelier Williams was circling him for rebounds as
if he were a traffic cone for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Paging Charles Oakley. Oakley's absence was noticeable from the
beginning as the Nets had no fear in driving to the basket. The
more Ewing struggled with his ball-handling _ turning the ball over
and mishandling rebounds _ the more the Knicks needed his old
sidekick to prop him up. The Knicks were outrebounded, 44-37, for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who said we wouldn't be able to rebound this year
were right tonight,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Right now, we
have about three guys who we're going to rely on but who are not in
NBA shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Sprewell looked like a man who had not played in over
a year. As expected, his layoff showed in his offense more than
defense. He rebounded well, but his shooting and timing were out of
sync. Still, Sprewell's conditioning was not the issue, not as it
was for Ewing. As the game went on, Sprewell looked stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some good things,'' Van Gundy said. ``He attacked the
basket, which is good. I thought offensively, he was better than I
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   For one night, whatever reservations the crowd had about
Sprewell at tip-off _ when he was received with a tepid response _
quickly disappeared by the end of the game. What incident with P.J.
Carlesimo? The way he played last night was a perfect indication of
how quickly fans can forget and forgive.

DAVENPORT UPSET BY UNSEEDED MAURESMO 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The brush fire that has transformed
unseeded men's tennis players into world beaters jumped genders on
Thursday, and Lindsay Davenport was the star who got burned in the
semifinals of the Australian Open against a 19-year-old Frenchwoman
named Amelie Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo's 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 upset of the No. 1-seeded Davenport on
a humid afternoon at Melbourne Park sent yet another shock wave
through the year's first Grand Slam tournament and earned Mauresmo
a place in Saturday's final against No. 2 seed Martina Hingis or
No. 6 seed Monica Seles, who were to play in Thursday's second
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I got my foot through the door and thought I was
going to get through to the end, it got shut on my foot,''
Davenport said. ``It's disappointing. I haven't had a match slip
through my hands in a long time, so it's hard to take, especially
in the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was a struggle from the beginning, when Davenport had
to save five break points just to hold her serve at 0-1. She would
soon take a 5-2 lead, often pushing the French teen-ager onto her
back foot with her relatively flat power from the baseline. But the
first sign that it would be an unusual afternoon came when
Davenport served for the set and was broken when Mauresmo fired a
forehand return winner cross court.
</P>
<P>
   The American would close out the set but she would prove unable
to close out another one against the athletic Mauresmo, ranked
29th, whose aggressive ground strokes, well-struck first serves and
line-to-line court coverage created problem after problem for
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   In their only previous match, Mauresmo defeated Davenport in
straight sets on clay in at the German Open last spring. That
tournament, one of the more prestigious on the WTA Tour,
represented Mauresmo's breakthrough as a professional. She had to
qualify to reach the main draw and though she lacked the
consistency to back up that performance the rest of the year,
Yannick Noah thought highly enough of her abilities to select her
to play Fed Cup singles against Switzerland in July, passing over
Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat in the process.
</P>
<P>
   With her broad shoulders and strong chin, Mauresmo is a
physically imposing figure, but unlike other power players, she
flows around a tennis court. Her footwork is one of her strengths,
and she is not afraid to take risks by pushing forward.
</P>
<P>
   After saving two match points in the first round against Corina
Morariu of the United States, she has upset No. 8 seed Patty
Schnyder, No. 11 seed Dominique Van Roost and now Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from match point, my coach told me that
usually when it happens like this, players are winning the
tournament and going very far, so I guess he was right,'' Mauresmo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauresmo's coach, Christophe Fournerie, has not been with her
for long. She hired him in December, shortly after separating from
her South African coach Warwick Bashford. She came to Melbourne
with Fournerie and her friend Sylvie Bourdon, who works in the
Saint-Tropez and is the reason Mauresmo moved there recently.
</P>
<P>
   A former world junior champion, Mauresmo is part of the fine
generation of young French women's players known as the ``class of
`79'' for the year of their birth dates. It also includes
Anne-Gaelle Sidot and Nathalie Dechy, but Mauresmo is now in a
class of her own, as her poised and powerful performance on Center
Court made clear.
</P>
<P>
   In her first Grand Slam semifinal, she showed few signs of
nerves, and in the third set, in which she was twice down a break,
she rallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's acting like a champion out there,'' Davenport said.
``For as good as she played, I still let it get away at the end,
which is disappointing. But all credit to her.''

 Gold as a standard of stability  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One traditional January staple that has been conspicuously
absent from the airwaves is the blitz of commercials touting gold
as a good investment bet.
</P>
<P>
   Usually about this time of year the glories of gold are being
pitched regularly by radio hucksters to those looking for a hot New
Year's tip on how to make some quick money.
</P>
<P>
   Past ad campaigns seemed designed to appeal to two basic groups.
One was clueless novices, who perhaps awakened New Year's morning
thinking now is the time to start building a nest egg after
delaying for too long. The other was die-hard goldbugs, who were
being reminded to recommit because the end of gold's blahs was
near.
</P>
<P>
   Could the dearth of gold investment commercials be a contrarian
signal of a buying opportunity because gold's price has actually
hit bottom? It would be hard to make a convincing case for this
argument. Besides, with the Internet-related sector of the stock
market making such fantastic gains, gold is starting to look
downright quaint.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold now is pretty much where it was last year.
It's trading in much the same range as last January, while the
performance of gold investments has generally tracked the metal
itself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting insights to emerge concerning gold
from the welter of recent investment analyses came from John
Dessauer, who's one of the more prescient seers in the business.
Dessauer predicted in a recent client advisory that as the dollar
recovers this year, gold would come under increasing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that as lackluster as gold was during the past year,
its price still had held up better than most other commodities.
This may change, however, and gold could begin the same sort of
slide as oil and other commodities have experienced. If so, he
mused, $200 an ounce ``is possible'' in 1999, which would be about
30 percent off its current price.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario, he said, also would lead to lower interest
rates, because the Federal Reserve would have no choice but to
follow the trend of the markets and cut rates again.
</P>
<P>
   The bane of goldbugs is what is making the world so much
brighter for most other investors and speculators. Inflation at the
retail level is under control because business competition has
diminished the pricing power of most consumer-oriented enterprises.
Meanwhile, many of the commodities and other inputs used to bring
products to retail market are in a deflationary mode.
</P>
<P>
   As long as inflation isn't a threat, it's nearly impossible for
gold and other precious metals to yield any significant investment
rewards. Gold, silver and other precious metals are currently
nothing more than commodities in a world of commodity deflation.
Thus, gold's historic role as a store of value has become a tenuous
thing for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold has historically been viewed as a barometer of
the world's anxiety level. If this is still a valid economic role
for gold, its price behavior over the past couple of years is
conveying a welcome message: Despite problems in Asia, Russia and
Latin America, the world remains relatively calm in the face of
turmoil that in the not-so-distant past would have sent the price
of gold soaring.

FORD SEEN IN DEAL FOR VOLVO CAR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. plans to announce on Thursday that it will
acquire the passenger car operations of Sweden's A.B. Volvo for
between $6 billion and $7 billion, the latest step in the
consolidation of the global auto industry, people close to the
talks said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers around the world are rushing into deals because they
fear a coming shakeout in the industry, in which the only survivors
will be the lowest-cost producers with the greatest economies of
scale from large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   Close to a decade of massive investment in new assembly plants
in places like South Korea, Thailand and Brazil have left the
global industry with the capacity to produce 75 million cars and
light trucks a year, yet global demand is only 50 million vehicles
a year and steadily eroding as a result of economic crises in East
Asia, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's deal follows last year's $33 billion
acquisition of the Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany
and a series of smaller deals, like Volkswagen A.G.'s acquisition
of Rolls-Royce. More deals seem likely: the Nissan Motor Co.,
deeply in debt, has been in talks to sell a stake to the new
DaimlerChrysler A.G. or to France's Renault, while Fiat S.p.A. has
been looking for ways to expand through acquisitions, including an
unsuccessful bid for Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly noteworthy about the Volvo and Chrysler
deals is that they involve financially strong companies with many
popular models. Neither company had to merge to remain independent.
Yet in each case, the costs of developing new cars and new engines
for a global market seemed enormous, and too difficult to spread
over the limited number of vehicles they sold.
</P>
<P>
   Feverish speculation about further mergers in the auto industry
is actually increasing the likelihood of additional deals. Big auto
makers like Ford have been reassessing whether they can buy
well-known but low-selling brands like Volvo and then expand sales
dramatically by using their own huge and often underutilized
factories to build the new models.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that other auto makers might snap up the remaining
independents first has prompted executives to move much faster than
they would have otherwise, and with a less thorough examination of
acquired companies' ledgers than might otherwise be the case, said
a top Detroit auto executive who insisted on anonymity. ``Once one
girl on the dance floor has been taken, the rest suddenly look
prettier,'' said the executive, using a sexist analogy popular in
the Motor City.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said two weeks ago at
an industry conference that auto makers selling fewer than a
million cars a year could not remain independent indefinitely.
Volvo sold 399,700 cars worldwide last year, while Ford sold 6.8
million and Fiat sold 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's purchase of Volvo could still face obstacles in Sweden. A
planned merger of Renault and Volvo collapsed in late 1993 after
mid-level Volvo managers publicly complained that French auto
executives were already ordering them around, and small Swedish
investors in Volvo responded by organizing a campaign against the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of similar protests this time was a critical
factor in Volvo's decision to reject a slightly higher bid from
Fiat earlier this month, people close to the negotiations said.
Volvo executives were worried that Fiat would try to play a more
direct role in managing the Swedish auto maker than Ford, which
bought Jaguar a decade ago and has spent billions of dollars to
revive it while replacing relatively few managers.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat is not nearly as wealthy as Ford, and would have been under
much more pressure to cut Volvo's costs and start reaping profits
quickly to recoup its investment. Fiat has only $1.5 billion in
cash, compared with Ford's massive $23.8 billion, one of the
largest corporate cash hoards anywhere in the world, accumulated
mainly from eight years of steeply rising sales of high-profit
sport utility vehicles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the world's second-largest auto maker, but the addition
of Volvo will not be enough to make it bigger than the General
Motors Corp., the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has long been interested in buying Volvo's car operations.
Volvo is strong in northern Europe and among affluent urban buyers
in the northeastern United States, two markets where Ford is weak.
Ford also hopes that Volvo's reputation for safety can be
transfered to other Ford brands.

YAHOO SAID TO BE BUYING GEOCITIES IN UNION OF TOP SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move meant to defend its position as the world's leading
site on the Internet, Yahoo Inc. has agreed to buy Geocities,
another popular site, financial executives briefed on the deal said
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Yahoo scheduled a conference call with analysts
for Thursday. But Diane Hunt, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to
comment on the call's topic on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities executives did not return calls on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The executives would not comment on the price that Yahoo will
pay. But analysts said that the transaction would most likely be
similar to the At Home Corp.'s recent agreement to buy Excite, one
of Yahoo's chief competitors. In that all-stock deal, At Home paid
a 40 percent premium over Excite's average stock price in the 30
days before the deal. Geocities has a market value of $2.3 billion,
and thus a 40 percent premium would value it at about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Yahoo fell $15.375 on Wednesday, to $335.875;
Geocities rose $4, to $75.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the top-rated of the Internet sites that have come to
be known as portals because they serve as gateways to a wide range
of information and on-line services. But most of its competitors
have recently been bolstered through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   At Home is starting to offer fast Internet services over cable
television wires. Netscape, with its Netcenter portal, was bought
by America Online. Infoseek, another portal, was partially bought
by the Walt Disney Co. and folded into its new portal, the Go
Network. The Microsoft Corp. has redoubled its efforts to promote
its MSN portal. And just this week, the Compaq Computer Corp.
announced plans to expand and partially spin off its Alta Vista
portal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the acquisition of Excite last week, the perception was
that Yahoo had to do a deal,'' said Paul W. Noglows, an analyst at
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``Geocities would not only give
them incremental traffic but also the most significant player in
the community space.''
</P>
<P>
   Geocities is the leading service that creates electronic
communities of people who share various interests. It mainly allows
people to set up their own home pages on the Internet on any topic
from family photos to sports-car collecting. With more than three
million members, it is among the most popular sites on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Geocities.com was the third-most-visited Web site,
with 19 million unique visitors, according to Media Metrix. The
top-rated site was America Online's site, Aol.com, with 28 million
visitors. Yahoo was No. 2 with 27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities hopes to profit by selling advertising that appears on
these home pages. But its revenue growth has been slower than other
Internet companies because many advertisers are shy about placing
their messages on pages that Geocities does not have direct control
over.
</P>
<P>
   Such community features, however, are increasingly being folded
into the broader array of services offered by portals. Infoseek,
Lycos and Excite have all bought smaller community-oriented
services.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo tried to buy Geocities last year but was rebuffed when
Geocities chose to make an initial public offering instead. Yahoo
already has a small stake in Geocities, and the Softbank Corp. of
Japan has investments in both.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the venture capitalists who have backed a variety
of specialized Internet start-ups are encouraging the companies in
their portfolios to combine into larger entities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers has major stakes
in both Excite and At Home.
</P>
<P>
   The executives briefed on the transaction said that Geocities
would most likely remain an independent unit of Yahoo, retaining
its brand name, its management and its offices in Santa Monica,
Calif. Yahoo is based in Santa Clara, Calif., in Silicon Valley. &QL;

BOY, 4, GETS EARLY START ON GOAL TO BE FIREFIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FERNANDO, Calif. -- Andrew Quezada wants to be a firefighter
when he grows up, just like his grandfather. But the 4-year-old
didn't have to wait nearly that long to be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the little boy from suburban Sherman Oaks in the
San Fernando Valley area northwest of downtown Los Angeles was
honored for discovering a fire in a relative's home New Year's
night and getting everyone out. Firefighters said he saved the home
and was probably the reason why all 25 people at a family
celebration were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said he wasn't afraid. He just followed what his granddad
told his preschool class during a fire-safety presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandpa told me to say FIRE! He told me to go out and save
all the people. I said FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!'' Andrew emphasized
the word, as he had done that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud of him,'' said his grandfather, Ed Gonzalez, an
18-year veteran in the Los Angeles Fire Department. ``I couldn't
wait to see him and let him know how important that was. Andrew is
a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firefighters, sponsoring the ceremony, agreed with
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The little boy with a crew cut and gleaming brown eyes was with
relatives celebrating New Year's Day in Hollywood. During a
barbecue that night at a cousin's home, Andrew was playing inside
with two cousins, Elena Lopez, 5, and Gabriela Maraga, 4. ``We were
trying to make a tent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he heard a smoke detector blaring, so he left to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smelled fire, and I heard the bell ringing. That means there
was fire,'' Andrew said matter-of-factly. ``I went looking and I
saw fire, and I went to get all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He spotted flames where a candle had tipped onto a heater and
ignited. He closed the door behind him -- as his grandfather had
instructed -- and went to get his cousins. Then he led the other
kids outdoors to alert the adults, again on his grandfather's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us were outside the house when these kids started
screaming there's a fire, there's a fire!'' said his paternal
grandfather, Luis Quezada. ``At the beginning we didn't pay too
much attention because kids say so many things. Then I could see
the look on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed to the blaze, the adults managed to extinguish it
themselves. It caused only minor damage to the house and was out by
the time firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times we teach our kids, not knowing if they're going
to remember anything. You hope one thing sinks in,'' said Gonzalez,
47, of Canyon City. ``That day Andrew remembered everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department spokesman Capt. Steve Ruda said the incident
illustrates the need for working smoke detectors in the home. More
important is knowing what to do if one goes off.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Andrew's deed, Gonzalez and the other firefighters
from Station 75 returned Wednesday to St. Mark's Preschool in
suburban San Fernando in the valley, where they had given a safety
presentation to Andrew's class in October. This time they brought a
replica fire helmet and yellow firefighter's coat for the
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little hero,'' said Andrew's mother, Alishea Quezada. ``He
knew not just to run out himself, but to get his little cousins out
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her son clamors to visit Gonzalez at the fire station.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to wear my dad's stuff. He loves to put his feet in
the boots. He won't take his hat off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Andrew donned his own miniature turnout coat Wednesday,
someone asked what he wants to do for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a fireman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attaboy,'' said his beaming grandfather. ``I hope I'm still on
the job when he's old enough to be.''

CHRIS CHANDLER FINDS MORE THAN SUCCESS IN ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Chris Chandler is doing his darndest to focus on the
now.
</P>
<P>
   In four days, the quarterback from Everett (Wash.) High School
and the University of Washington will lead the Atlanta Falcons into
Super Bowl XXXIII against the defending champion Denver Broncos.
It's a tossup as to which is more surprising: His team's rise to
its elite status, or the fact that Chandler has been so vital to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody pinch this guy, right? It wouldn't help. Chandler's
skin has turned tortoise tough during a trying NFL career that saw
him play for five teams in his first nine seasons before finally
finding a home, and feeling at home, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It's a past that won't let Chandler forget. No matter how hard
he tries.
</P>
<P>
   Each day this week, his interview sessions have started with,
and been peppered with, questions about events that prompted him to
bounce from the Indianapolis Colts to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to
the Phoenix Cardinals to the Los Angeles Rams to the Houston
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, Chandler attempts to stay his current course by
explaining how his attention must be on the Broncos, and the
biggest game of his career and that of a franchise with a past as
dreary as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, there has been another question about what happened
in Indy. Or Tampa. Or Arizona. Or L.A. Or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They are stories worth retelling, if only because they tell so
much about how far Chandler has come.
</P>
<P>
   Those were emotional times and, unfortunately for Chandler, he
was an emotional player. Too emotional for his own good on too many
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handled it better as I got older,'' Chandler said Wednesday.
``Early on, I was probably the worst guy at handling it. I talk
about being immature, and that's kind of what I'm talking about. I
became the effect of things that happened to me that were actually
out of my control.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost did him in.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who grew up the ninth of 10 childrren, credits a
couple of people with helping him become the player and the man he
is. But even that didn't come easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Jerry Rhome, his quarterbacks coach with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his background caused him to be very, very suspicious
and not trusting,'' said Rhome, who has coached for several NFL
teams including the Seahawks. ``I don't think he trusted coaches.
He was kind of fighting the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 season, Rhome met with Chandler to suggest that
the quarterback take part in Rhome's offseason program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Chris, I don't think you're really listening to me.
I'm having trouble coaching you. I don't think you're going to be
successful the way you are,' '' Rhome recalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, of course, bristled and walked out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still kind of felt like I knew everything that I needed to
know,'' Chandler said. ``I kind of left that meeting with the big
ego that I had at the time, thinking, `Maybe I'll be back, maybe I
won't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rhome: ``I didn't think I'd ever see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Chandler was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make football fun,'' Rhome said. ``He needed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The next to offer helpful hints was John Brodie, the former
49ers quarterback who is Chandler's father-in-law. When Chandler
married Diane Brodie in 1994 he didn't plan on also getting
surrogate parents in the deal. It just happened. Chandler's own
father died of lung cancer in 1991 and his mother of breast cancer
a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``John just really makes me feel good about what I can do on the
football field after I talk to him,'' Chandler said. ``It's not any
one specific thing he says ... he just has a way of talking and
after I get done talking to him I feel confident and I know I can
go out and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie first started tinkering with Chandler's shaken confidence
in 1993. He continues to supply regular maintenance with
twice-weekly telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   It must be working. Chandler's career has settled into a purr
that was definitely missing during the rocky road that led him to
the Falcons before the start of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Chris is how he feels about himself, not how
we feel about him,'' Falcons wide receiver Terance Mathis said.
``If he feels comfortable with himself, he can be a great player
without Terance Mathis, Tony Martin or Jamal Anderson. He has a
home. It's his team. All he's wanted throughout his career is to
have his own team, not to be looking over his shoulder at some
youngblood looking for his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler not only has found a home, he's making himself at home.
He signed a four-year, $25 million contract extension in September,
and used some of the $6 million signing bonus to buy a new house
for Diane and their three children. On the field, he has earned
back-to-back Pro Bowl berths and is 19-4 over the past two years in
games he has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea Chris was as good a player as he is,'' Falcons
coach Dan Reeves has said several times this week. ``I mean, I'd
love to say I knew all along. But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler has been so good, in fact, that the talk this week is
that John Elway will not be the best quarterback in Sunday's game.
Of course, you won't catch Chandler saying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an absurd thing to say that anybody is going to
play better than John Elway,'' said Chandler, shaking his head as a
smile spread across his face. ``I've been playing really good
football the last two years. But to say I'm playing better than
John Elway, I think that's stretching it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it is good to see Chandler finally be able to smile
after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELS AND TRAVAILS
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Washington quarterback Chris Chandler
played for five teams in his first nine NFL seasons before finally
finding a home in Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   Team (years) What went wrong
</P>
<P>
   Colts (1988-89) An all-rookie pick after being a third-round
draft choice,
</P>
<P>
   the Colts made Jeff George the No. 1 pick overall in 1990
</P>
<P>
   Bucs (1990-91) Tampa Bay gave a first-round pick in trading for
him, then
</P>
<P>
   released him at midseason in '91 to go with Vinny Testaverde
</P>
<P>
   Cards (1991-93) Started 13 games in 1992, but the Cardinals then
signed
</P>
<P>
   Steve Beuerlein as a free agent and started him in 1993
</P>
<P>
   Rams (1994) Despite signing him as a free agent, the Rams
decided
</P>
<P>
   to go with Chris Miller and Chandler was released
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (1995-96) He passed for then career-highs of 2,460 yards
and 17 TDs
</P>
<P>
   in 1995, but the Oilers already had drafted Steve McNair

TUGGLE NEVER WAIVERED DESPITE FALCONS' STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ People used to take one look at Jessie Tuggle and shake
their heads. They felt sorry for the guy. Pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans in other stadiums would always tease me. I'd hear it in
malls, grocery stores. `Jessie, I can't believe you're still
playing with the Falcons. Why don't you go and get yourself on a
good football team?''' Tuggle said Wednesday, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And players on other teams would do the same thing. `Man, you
think you guys can win six games this year?' I would tell `em we
were going to win 10, but there were a few 3-13 years, a few 6-10
seasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? This year, we made believers out of
everybody. The Dirty Birds are for real.''
</P>
<P>
   As we wade through the rivers of hype and glibness that engulf
Super Bowl XXXIII, we come upon this man named Jessie Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one reason to root for the Falcons come Sunday _ and
we're not suggesting there aren't others _ look no further than
this linebacker with a penchant for hard hitting and idealistic
living.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia native, Tuggle was born in a place called Spalding and
played Division II ball at Valdosta State _ not your basic football
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 12 seasons, after five Pro Bowls and after racking up
so many tackles he is the NFL leader among active players, Tuggle
has made it to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   He is here in the belly of one of sports' biggest events,
smiling and strong and charismatic in bringing an important message
about pride and loyalty, about paying your dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be part of the solution,'' he said. ``It's
easy to walk away and try to jump on a team through free agency and
be an instant winner. But you can appreciate it more when you've
been part of a team so long, and all of a sudden the work really
pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sporting year saw Tony Gwynn and the Padres in the World
Series, we now have Tuggle and the Falcons in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, like Gwynn, is a one-franchise player. He is a throwback
in an era when 23-year-old NBA players and major league baseball
stars squawk for a trade to a contender the minute they smell
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, man. That next generation behind us is a now
generation. They want everything now, more so than being willing to
work hard, pay the price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with free agency and everything in all the sports,
everyone wants to be a champion right now. But sometimes you have
to pay the price. It's sweeter. It's so sweet to me right now, it's
unbelievable. I can hardly put it into words because I know what it
takes to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he does know. This Falcon organization can be summed up as
33 years of bloopers, bleeps and blunders.
</P>
<P>
   It has had not one Hall of Famer to call its own. It has never
produced back-to-back winning seasons. The Falcons also have had to
live with knowing they once had Deion Sanders and Bret Favre _
arguably the best defensive and the best offensive players in the
NFL in the '90s _ only the Falcons didn't see much reason to keep
the fellas on board.
</P>
<P>
   Their history is studded with ``Typical Falcons'' anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, when running back Dave Hampton racked up a 1,000-yard
rushing season, he handed the ball to the trainer for safekeeping,
then went back onto the field where he was dropped for a 6-yard
loss on the next carry. Hampton finished the season with 997 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, after coach Marion Campbell was fired, assistant Jim
Hanifan was asked to take over for the last four games. At which
point Hanifan asked, ``Will this count against my overall NFL head
coaching record?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, yes it will, Hanifan was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I don't want the job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, the Falcons suffered the ``California State
Trophy'' incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when Jerry Glanville was the coach. We played almost
every team out there on the West Coast and beat all five of them.
So the next year we brought back the California State Trophy,''
Tuggle said.
</P>
<P>
   This trophy was not an official piece of NFL hardware. This was
a Glanville invention, something he was using to motivate his team.
Not a very good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That trophy was a mistake. The next year, every team in
California really beat us up,'' Tuggle said.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. Glanville had the temerity to lug the outrageous
trophy out to San Francisco and stick it on the sideline during a
game against the 49ers. What happened that day at Candlestick?
</P>
<P>
   ``We got waxed,'' Tuggle said about the 56-17 drubbing. ``So we
put that trophy thing behind us. I never saw that trophy again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the worst was yet to come. In '96, a year after the
Falcons went to the playoffs, they unraveled in a disastrous 3-13
season. Jeff George was seen (by millions on TV) screaming at
then-coach June Jones, weeks before George was released without the
Falcons getting any players or draft picks in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what direction this organization was going,''
Tuggle said, until Dan Reeves was hired as coach and the same old
Falcons started turning into contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Without complaint, Jessie Tuggle has waited 12 years for this
day.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when Tuggle and his crew line up against the defending
champion Denver Broncos, the Falcons might gain some confidence
knowing that, next to upending 33 years of their own futile
history, stopping Terrell Davis is like a day at Miami Beach.

L.A. CITY COUNCIL APPROVES ORDINANCE TARGETING GUN TRAFFICKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN, TERRI HARDY AND DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In an effort to crack down on gun violence, Los
Angeles became the first city in the nation Wednesday to limit
handgun purchases to make it harder for criminals and gang members
to obtain weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that takes
aim at ``straw buyers'' of handguns who resell the weapons to
felons, children or other people prohibited from owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   By banning multiple handgun sales, officials hope to slash the
number that enter the black market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will have a significant effect,'' said Councilman
Mike Feuer, the author of the ordinance. ``By preventing straw
purchasers from reselling guns illegally on the street it will
reduce the flow of guns that get into the hands of criminals and
kids, and as a result will help reduce gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun owner rights activists challenged the ordinance, saying it
trespasses on state authority to control firearms, will be
ineffective and unfairly restricts the rights of legitimate gun
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all political smoke and mirrors,'' said Ed Worley,
California grass-roots coordinator for the National Rifle
Association. ``Before we start passing more ordinances we can't
enforce, perhaps they should use some elbow grease and track down
illegal gun sales under existing laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance is part of an explosion of local gun control laws
that officials say stems from frustration at a plague of gun
violence and lack of state action to regulate firearms access.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 California cities have gun control laws on the books,
and proponents are hopeful that a recent state Supreme Court ruling
and Democratic gains in the state Legislature will revive efforts
to draft a statewide policy.
</P>
<P>
   Prior municipal ordinances limit types of guns, such as assault
weapons or cheap Saturday night special handguns, restrict
ammunition sales, or require the sale of safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles became the first city to restrict how many guns
people can buy in a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Between 25 percent and 30 percent of guns recovered by the LAPD
are purchased legally, often in bulk, and then sold on the street,
police and other experts said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 multiple handgun sales take place each year, out of
an estimated 2,000 total firearms sales a month, said LAPD
Detective Steve Mulldorfer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those sales involve three to six handguns, Mulldorfer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But registration records have documented purchases of up to 70
guns at a time, some of which later turn up at the scenes of
shootings, homicides and other violent crimes, said Julius Wachtel,
a former investigator with the U.S. Department of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, who compiled a landmark study on sources of crime
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Between 25 percent and 30 percent of handguns recovered by the
Los Angeles Police Department are purchased legally, often in bulk,
and then sold illegally on the street, according to Wachtel and
Mulldorfer.
</P>
<P>
   While police can track those guns back to their original owners,
they must witness the unlawful sale of a weapon to prosecute. That
requires costly and time-consuming investigations, Mulldorfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new ordinance, Los Angeles gun dealers will be
required to check a state Department of Justice database to see
whether a prospective buyer has purchased a handgun anywhere in the
state in the previous 30 days. If so, the person can't buy another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has got to be the finest ordinance written to
attack gun trafficking anywhere in the state,'' Mulldorfer said.
``It's specifically targeted for the gun trafficker. I find it very
equitable for everyone. It still allows the citizen to buy one gun
a month for protection. I don't know of any situation that would
require a person to buy more than 12 guns a year for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun rights advocates say such limits violate the rights of
law-abiding citizens to bear arms, and suspect the real aim is to
disarm the public entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States one is innocent until proven guilty,''
said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation in
Washington state. ``You don't take people's rights away if they're
not doing anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA and the Second Amendment Foundation also plan to sue the
city, arguing that the new ordinance is pre-empted by the state's
power to control gun trade.
</P>
<P>
   The State Supreme Court recently refused to hear an appeal of
the city of West Hollywood's ban on Saturday night specials, a
decision local gun control advocates say vindicates their position.
But gun control opponents said they believe that ruling won't
affect their complaints against the Los Angeles ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb also took issue with exemptions in the new law, which
allow multiple purchases for collectors or entertainment industry
companies who need the handguns for productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we don't have equal protection under the law,'' he
said. ``They've created two classes of people: People who can buy a
product based on the occupation they're involved in and other
people who can't.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, some 200,000 handguns were purchased in 1997, the
most recent year for which statistics are available from the
California Department of Justice. During that year, about 1,800
attempted purchases were denied. Total sales have dropped more than
half since 1993, when handgun purchases peaked at 433,000.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, has introduced a
bill that would put a stop to gun dealers selling multiple handguns
to a single person. The lawmaker said the Los Angeles Police
Department has found that a significant number of the handguns used
in street crime are purchased legally through licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said some buyers then resell the guns to gang members, drug
dealers and underage youths who cannot obtain them through legal
channels.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: who cannot obtain them through legal channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no legitimate reason why anyone needs to
purchase an unlimited number of handguns in a very short time
period,'' Knox said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers this year have proposed their own gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, wants to make it a
misdemeanor to manufacture, import or sell cheap handguns known as
Saturday night specials.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, has introduced a
bill that would establish a tax credit for purchasers of firearm
trigger locks. Strickland said quality trigger locks can cost in
excess of $70, making them too expensive for some, especially those
in disadvantaged areas who need more protection.
</P>
<P>
   And during his campaign Gov. Gray Davis promised to sign a bill
that would strengthen a current law banning assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Knox cited statistics from the California Department of Justice
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, covering
1988-1995:
</P>
<P>
   Handguns sold as part of a multiple sale made up 24 percent of
handguns sold in California.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent of all purchasers of handguns in California
purchased more than one gun in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   People under 21, the legal age for purchasing or possessing a
handgun, possessed 16 percent of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-two percent of those involved in the survey _ 13,181 guns
_ were part of two-gun purchases; 18 percent were from purchases of
three or more.

NIEUWENDYK REMAINS CATALYST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In a part of his mind, Joe Nieuwendyk is flashing down
the ice as fast as ever, his legs strong, his head crystal clear,
his shot among the deadliest in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the back of his mind _ and in his aching right knee _
that the Curse of Bryan Marchment still haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after Marchment ran the Stars' center into the end
boards, wrecking Nieuwendyk's knee and, essentially, Dallas'
chances to go all the way in the playoffs, there's still no
forgetting the San Jose bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there never will be.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, however, Nieuwendyk and the Stars gave a sellout
crowd at Reunion Arena a taste of what might have been _ and what
yet might be _ by opening the second half of the season with a 3-2
victory against the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Nieuwendyk, back on the ice after missing five
games with tendinitis in the knee he had surgically repaired in
May, who rammed home the game-winning goal in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between our team with him and without him is
dramatic,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock pointed out. ``When you take
a quality player like that out of your lineup, you go back to the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the play he made tonight. We hammer that play all the
time and can't get it in, but it always seems to go in for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Nieuwendyk's 10th goal of the season and perhaps his most
satisfying, because it comes at a time when he needs a shot of
confidence. He is still feeling his way with a knee that sometimes
aches like a rotten tooth.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't have it yanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong tonight,'' he said, the knee wrapped in an ice
pack after the game. ``I didn't feel any weakness in the knee at
all. Now, I have to be smart about it and keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the player he was before Marchment so rudely
interrupted a terrific season. That does not mean he can't be as
good as he ever was.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that Nieuwendyk was seventh in the league
with 39 goals last season and second with 11 game-winners, a
specialty of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he got hurt, he was our best player last year,''
Hitchcock said. ``He was a 40-goal scorer and those people are hard
to find. If he's even three-quarters of the player he was for us
last year, then he can be huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that 75 percent of the player he was is the
best that Nieuwendyk can hope to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mental adjustments that he has to make now,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's been very stubborn at times. He wants to
practice every practice, play every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing for us is to be sure that he's ready for the
playoffs. On the other hand, there's no point in having him ready
for the playoffs if his game is not in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Nieuwendyk has to get smarter. He has to learn when
to give it everything he has and when to ease up and rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a stretch where we're playing four games in six
nights and I don't know that I'll play all of them,'' Nieuwendyk
conceded. ``Maybe it's best, if I'm feeling some fatigue in the
knee, to sit out for a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words do not come easy for a player like Nieuwendyk, who
has always prided himself on playing full out, every ice minute of
every game. But that was B.M.
</P>
<P>
   Before Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to understand that I'm probably different from the
other 23 guys in this locker room now,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Two
knee surgeries in the last year \Rthe left was operated on, too\S
will do that to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I still want to go out there every game. But now I
have to listen to my body and play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   He played both smart and good last night and it was the
difference in the Stars getting a win, instead of turning a sure
victory into a tie or a loss with a couple of dumb plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to turn a pretty comfortable win into a very
intense finish,'' Hitchcock said. ``But I thought Nieuwendyk's
group gave us a lot of energy. I thought Joe went into some tough
areas and paid the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars led 2-1 when Nieuwendyk skated in on the right side,
took a feed from Richard Matvichuk from behind the nets and beat
Kings' goalie Stephane Fiset at point blank range.
</P>
<P>
   ``A highlight film goal,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   It came from a highlight film kind of player who may be just as
big a key to the Stars' playoff hopes this year as he was B.M.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we all know what that stands for now.

BRYANT TO GET LUCARATIVE EXTENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kobe Bryant says he's a ``Laker for life,''
and soon he'll be set for life as well, with a lucrative contract
extension. The Lakers are aiming to have a multi-million dollar,
multiyear deal wrapped up before the season begins Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll have something pretty soon with that,'' Lakers
executive Jerry West said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal is not complete, Bryant is expected to earn
the maximum allowed under the NBA's new labor agreement _ $9
million in the first year of the contract, with annual raises of
$1,125,000.
</P>
<P>
   If he signs for the maximum six years, Bryant will earn
$70,875,000 _ the same deal signed this week by fellow class of '96
stars Allen Iverson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim. Alternatively, Bryant
could opt for a three-year deal, then sign a more lucrative
contract after that _ as a six-year veteran, he'd be eligible for a
starting salary of at least $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without an extension, Bryant would become a free agent this
summer. Teams have until about mid-March to sign players to
extensions, then the negotiating window closes until the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the window will close on this,'' West said. ``I
think that's something that's imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is in the last year of his three-year rookie contract,
which pays him $1.3 million this season. His new deal should make
him the team's second-highest paid player behind Shaquille O'Neal,
whose seven-year contract averages $17.1 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being just 20 years old, as a rising star, Bryant
figured to net a deal well over $100 million. But the league's new
labor deal, reached after the six-month lockout, imposed maximum
salaries for all players, costing Bryant at least $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I didn't really like the (labor) deal too much,''
Bryant said recently, though he declined to confirm reports he
voted against it. ``I still get paid a lot of money to play
basketball. I mean, I'd play this game for a penny. Just to get
paid, period, feels like I'm robbing somebody. . . . I'm not going
to demand something astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last spring, it seemed uncertain whether Bryant would make
his fortune as a Laker or elsewhere. With West contemplating
retirement, some believed Bryant might bolt. West has since signed
his own contract extension, but Bryant said he never planned to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be here for my whole career,'' he said. ``Jerry West .
. . is kind of like a father figure to all of us. To see him leave
would have been disappointing, but at the same time, it's the
Lakers. I have to be loyal to my team. I wasn't going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, ``I'm a Laker for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Said West, ``That sounds good to us.'' And with Bryant vowing
never to leave, maybe the Lakers could keep him for less?
</P>
<P>
   Joked West, ``What's the living wage, $12.50 an hour?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Exhibitionists: O'Neal scored a game-high 31 points, and Rick
Fox hit seven 3-pointers and scored 26 points _ 16 in the final
period _ in a five-period intrasquad scrimmage before about 8,500
at the Forum. The event was free.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had 23 points, Travis Knight and rookie Ruben
Patterson scored 20 apiece, and Derek Fisher had 18.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Sam Jacobson played just one quarter before leaving with
a strained hip flexor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played a little better (than in Monday night's
scrimmage),'' coach Del Harris said. ``All in all, a little more
under control, a little less sloppy.''

MAVERICKS HAVE FULL COURT OF PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Because Cedric Ceballos surprisingly came crawling
back, the Mavericks might shockingly be inching closer to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to attract a long-term, big-money contract from any team,
Ceballos settled yesterday for a one-year deal worth approximately
$2 million. As recently as Friday, Mavericks coach/general manager
Don Nelson closed the door on re-signing Ceballos when the 1995
All-Star rejected an offer of three years at $6.75 million in
search of a three-year deal worth $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up with them making us an offer we couldn't refuse,''
Nelson said. ``As the market spoke and he didn't get one of the big
contracts and then the $1.75 million exceptions started
disappearing, we found ourselves back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but the Mavericks might have too much depth.
</P>
<P>
   Their first unit is Steve Nash, Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki,
A.C. Green and John Williams, backed up by a second team of Robert
Pack, Hubert Davis, Cedric Ceballos, Samaki Walker and Shawn
Bradley. That leaves Gary Trent, Erick Strickland, Chris Anstey and
Reeves looking for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Ceballos' arrival, Nelson said he was tinkering with
the idea of using a 10-man rotation, one or two more than most NBA
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth is certainly our strength,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, who generated minimal interest from New York, Orlando,
Atlanta and Miami, retains his Bird exemption rights by signing the
one-year deal, meaning the Mavericks will be able to offer him more
money than any other team can after he becomes a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Nellie flipped a coin, and it came up Ced,'' Ceballos
joked of the on-again, off-again negotiations. ``I didn't want to
wait an eternity and I didn't want to be locked into a long-term
deal. I knew I'd fit in here, so I took the most comfortable offer.
This gives me a chance to prove myself now, and then test the
market next summer when things aren't so out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the Mavericks a proven backup to rookie Nowitzki
and adds fuel to their playoff optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is'' a playoff team, said Ceballos, who was
acquired Feb. 18 from Phoenix for Dennis Scott. ``We have a lot of
talent and a whole lot of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ceballos' arrival, the Mavericks played their best
basketball last season. They went 4-5 in his nine starts,
increasing their scoring average from 89 to 99. Ceballos and Finley
combined to average 41 points per night before Ceballos tore knee
ligaments March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Should the 20-year-old Nowitzki, whom Nelson indicated would
remain the starter, falter, the Mavericks now have a veteran scorer
to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes us a better team; it's that simple,'' Finley said.
``Last year, we saw what we could do together, and I think we liked
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos' arrival also gives the Mavericks 14 players with
guaranteed contracts. Given the extenuating circumstances created
by the lockout, the league is allowing teams to keep 14 players on
the active roster the first two weeks of the season. When that
number drops to 12, however, the Mavericks will likely trade backup
guard Khalid Reeves and put a couple of players on the temporary
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with our team before. Now the talent level has
certainly gone up,'' Nelson said. ``Ced lessens the pressure on
Dirk and really makes us solid at every position.''

CHANDLER BLOSSOMS INTO A TRUE BLUE-LIGHT SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Last week, John Elway was the second-most prominent
American to be publicly accused of high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   But once Dan Reeves backtracked and decided to drop all charges,
this seashore Super Bowl gathering has settled into bipartisan
harmony and bliss among the Denvers and the Atlantas. Some would
also call it forced hype.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Henry Hyde shows up, it figures to stay this way until
Sunday's kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But even as strange as it would have been for Elway to be
continually defending his character this week, the future
Hall-of-Famer is now dealing with yet another oddity.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to national media ink and air time, Elway rates a
distant second to the ``other'' Super Bowl quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Chris Chandler is the better story, but it's also not
exactly a SportsCenter scoop to declare Chandler the better
quarterback than Elway _ for this one season, plus playoffs,
Chandler has been. That's just football fact, without any shock
element attached. And once the two clubs kick it off Sunday, the
only Elway-Chandler comparison that matters will be performance
over the next 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Flip, however, to the NFL big picture.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a coach or scout in the NFL who at the moment isn't
attempting to figure out the puzzle that is Chandler's 11-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of futuristic scouting, talent evaluation and
coaching, how could so many NFL types been so wrong for so long
about a player at the most important position on the field? This
kind of talent isn't supposed to drift aimlessly for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was dumped by five teams during his first nine years in
the league. Think how stupid the whatever-they-call-them-now
Houston Oilers must feel. They traded Chandler to Reeves two years
ago for various trinkets. Officially, it was fourth- and
sixth-round draft picks, which amounts in football to key chains
and fingernail clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves looks like a genius, but he's too honest to lead anyone
in that direction. Every day this week, and about every week for
the entire season, Reeves has been quick to say, ``I had no idea he
was this good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Chandler himself may have to start paying copyright fees to
the estate of Jerry Gracia, if there is such a thing. The
quarterback's stock answer on his career is something along the
lines of ``It's been a long, strange trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves saw enough after the '97 season to reward Chandler
with a four-year, $25 million contract, including a $6 million
signing bonus. Not exactly Elway-Young-Aikman-Favre money, but more
than Chandler ever dreamed of making. And at the moment, an
outrageous bargain for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, a former NFL head
coach, chuckled yesterday, saying, ``I bet there wasn't a GM or
coach in the league who didn't privately wonder if Dan had gone
crazy when they heard about that money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks added that the contract may have been the final
turning point in what had been Chandler's Kmart career:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more than the amount of money, which was ample, this was
the first time a coach and a team had ever made the complete
commitment to Chris. Here was Dan saying to him, `You're our guy.
You are our franchise quarterback. Our team is in your hands.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris had been a vagabond quarterback. Always the stop-gap
quarterback while a team looked for or groomed a guy to take over.
Dan gave him a football home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the question of how the Colts,
Buccaneers, Cardinals, Rams and Oilers completely blew it. And why
a dozen other teams weren't wise enough to grab him. The talent is
obvious. At least now it is. There's arm strength, smarts, enough
mobility and size, and for aerial accuracy, Reeves puts him in Troy
Aikman's class.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't always health. Chandler had a career problem
answering the work whistle over 16 games. Plus, he's the first to
admit the heart and the head weren't always in the right place. He
says he was headstrong and became discouraged easily.
</P>
<P>
   But four years into the NFL, Chandler hooked up with Jerry
Rhome, the Dallas native who was the quarterback coach in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who turned my whole career around,'' Chandler
said. ``He taught me how to play quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Chandler waited for the right opportunity. Reeves
finally provided that. Next stop: the Super Bowl on Sunday.

PARADE MAGAZINE SLIGHTS TEXANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE IVEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am not from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If I were, though, I would be embarrassed. And not simply
because it happens to rain dirt here every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I would be embarrassed is because only three of the
56 student-athletes on this year's ``Parade'' magazine All-American
high school football team hail from the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Three!
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a statistic to hang your Stetson on, is it?
</P>
<P>
   The only Texans deemed worthy of the honor this season were
defensive back Gerome Sapp, linebacker Cory Redding and offensive
lineman Alfio Randall (who all happen to be from Houston, by the
way), at least according to the Jan. 24 issue of ``Parade''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' you say. ``Perhaps the editors at ``Parade''
are trying to put together a geographically balanced team _ one
that encompasses players from all over the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice thought, but it is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the players are from California and five are from
Florida, the two states other than Texas that are generally
considered to be the major hotbeds of high school football. As if
that were not a big enough slap in the face of Texas football, even
Alabama boasts four players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama? Whoa, Nellie!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, ``Parade''? This is Dave Campbell speaking. Immediately
cancel my subscription.''
</P>
<P>
   The only good news, Texans, is that your high school football _
the fabled institution chronicled by Pulitzer Prize-winning author
H.G. (Buzz) Bissinger in ``Friday Night Lights'' and by Hollywood
in the current MTV film ``Varsity Blues'' _ is not considered the
worst in America.
</P>
<P>
   With three All-American selections, Texas is equal to Georgia
and slightly ahead of Arkansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia,
which all have only two.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah! In your face, Maryland!
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury is that one high school in California _
Long Beach Polytechnic _ produced two All-Americans. And a single
community in Louisiana _ Monroe and West Monroe _ also produced two
All-Americans. That is one fewer than the entire, football-mad
state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Surely this is a joke. (It is certainly more laughable than the
magazine's lame ``Howard Huge'' cartoon, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The publication's 56 All-Americans are broken down by position
as follows: linemen (17), running backs (10), linebackers (8),
quarterbacks (7), wideouts (6), defensive backs (4), kickers (2)
and all-purpose players (2).
</P>
<P>
   Their top quarterback is Texas-bound Chris Simms. It is hard to
argue with that choice, based on his superb statistics and NFL
bloodline, but were there really six other quarterbacks who had
better seasons in 1998 than Brownwood's Colby Freeman?
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, the ``Star-Telegram'' Offensive Player of the Year,
piled up more than 2,700 yards of offense and accounted for 29
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly where is Wyatt defensive end Donald Burrell? The
``Star-Telegram'' Defensive Player of the Year registered 108
tackles, including 48 tackles for loss and an incredible 21 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other area players who could make a strong case to be included
on the All-American list include defensive linemen Kevin Young of
Duncanville and Cedric Hilliard of Lamar, defensive back Sterling
Kazee of MacArthur and the record-breaking Stephenville combo of
quarterback Kelan Luker and wide receiver Cody Cardwell.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. What more could one really expect from a magazine that
generally is found in the Sunday paper somewhere between the comics
and a Wal-Mart ad? &QL;

TEXAS-ARLINGTON FORWARD FINDING COLLEGE BASKETBALL DEMANDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The knock on Texas-Arlington junior forward
Dewayne Marable is that he could work a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   This comes from a pretty good source _ Marable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't used to this when I came here from junior college,''
he said. ``This is a lot more demanding. I don't know how to
explain it, except that I need to do more in practice. I need to
work harder in games.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation for Marable, a 6-foot-8, 215-pound forward from
Lawson State (Ala.) Community College, comes at a time when
teammates and coaches say they need him most. Texas-Arlington
starting forward Bill Washington has played fewer minutes the past
two weeks because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Junior-college recruit Leonard Osborn did not gain eligibility.
That leaves one player on Texas-Arlington's bench taller than 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   That guy is Marable, and he might be the key to Texas-Arlington
turning around a frustrating season and making a run at the
Southland Conference tournament. The Mavericks (5-11, 3-5 in
conference) are eighth in the SLC. Six teams go to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dewayne has improved a lot this season, and that has to do
with him not worrying so much,'' said Keith Greene,
Texas-Arlington's leading scorer and Marable's roommate. ``He
stopped thinking about what coaches are going to say to him and
just started playing basketball. We need him. He's the only other
big man we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Marable was high on Texas-Arlington coach Eddie McCarter's wish
list in the late signing period last year. After waiting until the
night before signing day, Marable choose Texas-Arlington over
Jacksonville and Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he has lived up to his repTexas-Arlingtontion of an
athletic big man with a good shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   In five of Texas-Arlington's past eight games, Marable has
scored in double figures, including a 19-point performance against
UT-San Antonio. In conference games, he is averaging 11.4 points
and 5.4 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington coaches might even move Marable into the
starting lineup for Saturday's 7:30 p.m. game at Nicholls State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dewayne needed some time to get used to Division I
basketball,'' Texas-Arlington assistant coach Tony Stubblefield
said. ``He still needs to get stronger, but Dewayne has looked a
lot better in the past few games. He's going stronger to the basket
and doing things we expected him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marable said he has waited a long time for some good things to
happen for him.
</P>
<P>
   His first game at Texas-Arlington was against Baylor, and
Marable turned in a 1-for-13 performance in Texas-Arlington's 64-59
loss.
</P>
<P>
   He had six points in Texas-Arlington's 66-45 loss against
Southwest Texas State's 6-11 center Jeff Foster.
</P>
<P>
   A 47 percent shooter from the 3-point line in junior college, he
is currently 0-for-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game against Baylor still bothers me,'' Marable said.
``Every time I see them on television, I think about how I played
in that game and how we should have won. I lost it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates remind Marable that he helped win the SLC opener
against Sam Houston State. He wasn't supposed to play because he
missed practice the day before, but the game went to triple
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Marable scored eight points in the first overtime, and
Texas-Arlington left with a 125-123 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being asked to do the same things I did in junior
college,'' Marable said. ``The difference is the speed of the game
and the intensity. Those are things I'm still getting use to. It's
a lot harder. It's more work.''

JEFF BURTON READY TO START `BEATING UP' ON OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR stars Mark Martin and Jeff Burton not only settled in as
Winston Cup teammates last year, they also apparently began cloning
their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Martin tells everyone who asks that Burton, the 1994 Winston Cup
rookie of the year, is the series' best driver.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says that Martin remains the undisputed champion of Roush
Racing, despite the fact he never has won the seasonlong Winston
Cup points chase.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing shop space in Mooresville, N.C., week after week
undoubtedly has allowed some of Martin's self-incriminating outlook
to rub off on Burton. Because even though he won two races and
finished fifth in Cup points last year, Burton admittedly spent the
off-season beating up on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the most positive person in the world,'' said Burton,
rising star of team-owner Jack Roush's five-car Ford Taurus stable.
``Yeah, we spent the off-season beating ourselves up. We spent a
lot of weeks last season beating ourselves up. A lot of races we
let ourselves down last year. We can't do that, and perform at a
level that is going to make us happy.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how can Burton and crew chief Frankie Stoddard find
happiness in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is a multiple-choice answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is I've got to be a better qualifier,'' said
Burton, who scored his initial career Cup victory at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth in April 1997. ``I can't get us into stupid
wrecks, and I got us into some stupid wrecks last year. We've got
to be better at making changes during the race, to make our car
better. We've got to be better on pit road, and we can't have
mechanical problems. And our superspeedway program has got to be
better. Those are things that are real clear to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That also is the type of no-nonsense check list made famous by
Martin, who finished second to Jeff Gordon by 364 points for the
Cup championship in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's a lot to be said about being very humble about
your team and yourself,'' said Burton, who at 31 is nine years
younger than his mentor. ``Because when you are willing to look at
the negative things, then you can fix stuff. If you're willing to
look at the things that aren't working _ including yourself _ then
you can make the deal better. If you aren't willing to do that,
then how's your deal ever going to get better?''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, how's your deal ever going to close the
Gordon gap?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's third championship in four years was punctuated by a
record-tying 13 victories in 1998, a whirlwind season that more
than offset Martin's career seven-win year. Count Burton among
those who refuse to buy into the theory that Gordon and crew chief
Ray Evernham are due for a bruisin' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look at Gordon and his race team and say, `This
is what they did. They have the possibilities of doing it again.
What are we going to do to stop them?' '' Burton said.
QUICK HITS
IROC FIELD SET
</P>
<P>
   Seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt and his
son, reigning NASCAR Busch Grand National champion Dale Earnhardt
Jr., will race against each other for the first time in America in
the upcoming International Race of Champions series.
</P>
<P>
   The four-race schedule matching 12 of the world's best drivers
in identically prepared stock cars kicks off at the Daytona
International Speedway on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and Little E. did compete against one another in the
NASCAR exhibition race at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan on Nov. 22.
This will be their first run against each other in the United
States, with Earnhardt Jr. scheduled to make his official Cup debut
during the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the field for IROC XXIII features NASCAR stars
Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin, Dale Jarrett, Rusty Wallace and Jeff
Burton; Kenny Brack and Eddie Cheever Jr. of the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League; and Al Unser Jr., Greg Moore and Adrian Fernandez of
the Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series.
ROLEX 24 TO ROLL
</P>
<P>
   An 83-car field has been entered for the 37th annual Rolex 24 at
Daytona, North America's premier sports car endurance race.
</P>
<P>
   The car-count, as sanctioned by the U.S. Road Racing
Championship, includes 22 entered in the headline open-cockpit
Can-Am class. It is the second-largest prototype field at Daytona
International Speedway, trailing only the 29 GTP cars entered in
1985 under the International Motor Sports Association banner.
</P>
<P>
   A Ferrari 333SP co-driven by Gianpiero Moretti of Italy, Arie
Luyendyk of the USA, Mauro Baldi of Monaco and Didier Theys of
Belgium was the overall victor by eight laps around the 3.56-mile
combined oval-road course last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 314 drivers expected to compete in Can-Am, GT3, GT2 and GTT
encompass 22 nations, 2,078 victories and 185 titles. And 137 alarm
clocks.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to knock Jeff Gordon off of his throne, or
anything else. I'm just looking for a teenie-weenie little bitty
piece _ a little slice _ a little corner of the pie. That's all I'm
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Darrell Waltrip, three-time Winston Cup champion, and driver
of the new No. 66 Big Kmart-Route 66 Ford Taurus
RECORD ATTENDANCE
</P>
<P>
   Motorsports fans in Fort Worth-Dallas, you're hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing attendance in North America recorded another
increase in 1998, when 17,079,004 fans filled grandstands, suites
and infields at 12 series monitored by the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber
Co. The figure is up from 16,861,291 in 1997 and represents an
increase of 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, NASCAR's 33-race Winston Cup Series _ which included a
stop at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth _ topped the overall
attendance chart at 6,301,027. That is an increase of 3.4 percent.
In addition, approximately 188,979,000 loyalists tuned in to Cup
races on ABC, CBS, ESPN, TNN and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series enjoyed a stout
8.2 percent increase. A total of 2,102,000 fans witnessed the
maturation of Dale Earnhardt Jr. into a third generation champion,
beginning with his first career BGN victory at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   The Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Championship drew
2,529,995 fans on four continents _ an increase of 1.6 percent over
1997. Two new events, including a street race in downtown Houston,
aided CART's rise.
</P>
<P>
   National Hot Rod Association attendance also increased 1.6
percent to 2,204,194. Average attendance for 22 national events,
including two drag races at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis, was
100,191 per race.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series posted a 2.0 percent increase
over 1997 as 938,775 fans attended the season's 27 races, including
a June night visit to the reconfigured and repaved TMS.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, two notable attendance declines among
events contested in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Pep Boys Indy Racing League expanded its schedule from eight
to 11 races in 1998, including a September date in Fort Worth. But
the IRL's overall attendance of 1,291,653 represented a drop of 4.1
percent from 1997.

   Rain forced the Pennzoil World of Outlaws Series to cancel seven
of its scheduled 72 Sprint Car races, including the annual fall
extravaganza at the Devil's Bowl Speedway in Mesquite. That led to
an attendance drop of 1.7 percent to 1,575,200.

   Incidentally, Stu Grant, Goodyear's general manager of worldwide
racing, announced that after 27 years, the company was ceasing
publication of the report. Goodyear would like the sanctioning
bodies to crunch their own numbers next off-season.

<P>
   SCHOOL-PILLS (Boston) _ The world of school nurses has changed
greatly. Nowadays, they juggle the traditional triage of student
who feel sick with a host of growing demands: handle drugs for
attention deficit disorder and increasingly common asthma inhalers;
help medically fragile students with catheters or tube feedings;
teach children to wash their hands frequently, or persuade

more. By Carey Goldberg.

   PRESTO-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ National Presto Industries rarely

central to the domestic universe that Tom Wolfe, writing in acid
admiration in ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' in 1987, described it as
``this gloriously stuffed little planet.'' Yet during a recent
visit to the Mt. Kisco model home, not one person in a steady
stream of visitors stepped across the threshold into the living
room. Instead, they made a beeline straight back to the
double-height family room, a congenial open space adjacent to the
kitchen, where they chatted amiably on Dumbo-sized couches or
gathered about its unlit fireplace as if it were a 51-inch
television screen. By Julie V. Iovine.

   MANHATTAN-RENT (New York) _ In Manhattan these days, finding the
rental apartment you want is only the beginning. Prospective
renters can find themselves in a bidding war _ for a rental _ and
by the time the dust settles, agreeing to pay hundreds of dollars a
month more than the asking price and putting up one month's rent
and three months' security in advance. And finding themselves
required to produce the extraordinary financial credentials that
made them acceptable candidates to pay a high rent. By Tracie
Rozhon.

window that magnifies three and a half times _ enough power to
enlarge a line on a restaurant bill from a blur to legibility. By
Phlip Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING-FEVER (New York) _ Spring fever can begin in strange
ways. It hit me hard last week, when a friend brought over a bunch
of Swiss chard purchased at an expensive natural-foods store. The
leaves were a deep plush green, with vermilion veins coursing
through them like rivers bursting with life. And in my memory at
least (alas, we ate the evidence), they were not crinkled and
glossy like most Swiss chard, but smooth, almost as if crossed with
a collard green. As we chopped the leaves and sauteed them with
garlic, the sensual pleasures of spring on the farm rushed into my
Red Hook kitchen. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN-LOFT (New York) _ Two years ago, when Arnold Lehman
left Baltimore to become the director of the Brooklyn Museum of
Art, he and his wife, Pamela, knew exactly what kind of home they
wanted. In Brooklyn, they found what they wanted: a
3,000-square-foot floor-through loft on a high floor in what was a
1920's Gothic Revival office building. It's two blocks from the
Boro Hall subway stop and 10 minutes by car or subway from the
museum. And light? It pours in through 30 windows. By Elaine Louie.

PEPPERDINE OUTLASTS NO.1 UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now it can be told: Al Scates voted for
Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest USA Today/American Volleyball Coaches Top 15 poll,
No.5 Pepperdine received one first-place vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was Scates, coach of No.1 UCLA. His reasons? ``They're
undefeated and they have the returning player of the year in George
Roumain. Everyone above them lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, No.3 Brigham Young is listed as 6-0. But maybe other
coaches will follow Scates' lead and vote for the Waves after their
15-13, 15-11, 5-15, 4-15, 15-11 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Conference victory over UCLA on Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   And, true to form, Roumain led Pepperdine (6-0, 2-0) with 39
kills, including four in the deciding fifth game, when the match
went to rally scoring (teams score a point on every serve).
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, Scates said, that rally scoring hurt the Bruins
(3-2, 1-1) after thoroughly dominating the Waves in the third and
fourth games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifth game is a coin toss,'' Scates said. ``Momentum is a
funny thing. The team that serves first loses about 70 percent of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess who served first? UCLA, and the Bruins actually took a 1-0
lead on a Danny Farmer kill. He finished with a team-high 23.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine looked beaten after the fourth game but tightened up
its serve-receiving, which Waves coach Marv Dunphy said made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a second wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some might think Roumain did, too, but UCLA always brings out
the best in the 6-foot-6 senior. His career high in kills was 42,
against the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best team in the nation,'' Roumain said. ``You
always want to bring out your best. We had to bring it together. I
guess they got a little overconfident on their court.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Roumain, rally scoring meant nothing. Neither did the
ease with which UCLA won the third and fourth games.
</P>
<P>
   Roumain made sure the Waves would be competitive in the fifth
game, getting the team's first point on a kill.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a block for a 4-2 lead, a kill that made it 8-5,
and two straight kills to put the Waves at match point. Brandon
Taliaferro hit wide to end the 2 hour, 20 minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wong and Don Killian each had 16 kills for Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Williams had 19 kills and Adam Naeve added 18 kills for
UCLA, followed by Evan Thatcher with 15.

DRAFT SLIGHTS ARE FUEL FOR DAVIS, ANDERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The NFL draft's late rounds are traditionally about
``throwing darts'' and ``taking fliers,'' about ridiculous long
shots, about selecting somebody's cousin and the gimmicks that
allow John Havlicek and Carl Lewis and Dave Winfield to forever
include ``drafted by the NFL'' on their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the NFL draft's late rounds are about Terrell Davis and
Jamal Anderson, currently football's two most successful running
backs. Super Bowl XXXIII's marquee matchup is Davis vs. Anderson,
both selected in the last two rounds of the draft and both making a
splash in the NFL because of their I'll- show-you-mentality in
addition to their running prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two years in the league, I think people looked down
on me,'' Davis said. ``I think now they don't see me as a
sixth-round pick. I think now people look at me as Terrell Davis.
There's not a label on me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Anderson was discussing the label and the place in
the NFL pecking order that goes with it with the Super Bowl media
in Miami. He compared his perspective to that of an NFL rookie this
season who was passed over in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys talk about Randy Moss being mad. I've got five years'
worth of anger,'' Anderson said. ``People make mistakes. Boy, do
they make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was chosen in the sixth round of the 1995 draft, Anderson
in the seventh round of the 1994 draft. Their draft-day snubs seem
so obviously mistaken now. But how did these two _ each of them a
Pro Bowl player, each of them finalists for the league MVP award,
each of them the likeliest of candidates to be selected the
standout of Sunday's finale should their team win _ begin their
professional careers as second-day second thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   Two similar tales of two similarly successful NFL superstars:
Davis, the 196th player taken in his draft, and the 21st running
back; and Anderson was the 201st player taken, and the 25th running
back.
</P>
<P>
   Davis seems an ideal combination of speed, power, athletic
ability and character _ and now, performance. He's a muscularly
built 5-foot-11, 210 pounds. He's the 1998 NFL MVP after being
honored as last year's Super Bowl MVP. As a rookie in 1995, he
rushed for 1,117 yards and scored eight touchdowns. In '96, he
totaled 1,538 and 15 touchdowns. In '97, he totaled 1,750 and 15
touchdowns. And this season he finished with 2,008 yards and 23
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the pros, having elevated himself from an
underprivileged background (his family members have been jailed for
violent crimes numerous times) to earn a spot at the University of
Georgia should have counted for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my background gave me a certain toughness, a certain
resilience,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Georgia's history of producing great running backs may
have hurt Davis. Recent first-round runners from the University of
Georgia include Herschel Walker, Rodney Hampton, Robert Edwards and
Garrison Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was largely an unknown quality coming out of Georgia
because of the excellence of the guy who, in Davis' junior year,
played ahead of him. ``Terrell didn't have the speed of Garrison,
and the feeling was that there was a dropoff when he came in,''
said Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley. As a senior, the job
was Davis'. But he missed three games because of a groin injury and
that, along with a feud with his coach, Ray Goff, cemented his
subpar reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But Broncos assistant Gary Kubiak had a friend at Georgia who
recommended Davis. And Kubiak and Denver coach Mike Shanahan viewed
Davis as a decent fit into their system.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 234-pound Anderson comes in a Davis-like package,
lacking only blazing speed. The bullish runner finished fourth in
this season's MVP voting after rushing for 1,846 yards and 14
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   His celebrity-studded background (his father has served as a
bodyguard for everyone from Muhammad Ali to Richard Pryor to Diana
Ross, and Jamal considers many of those stars his pals) should have
counted for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was from those kind of people that I learned how to have
respect for others, and for myself,'' Anderson said. ``Those people
are winners. They all knew how to try to persevere. That rubbed off
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as with Davis, scouts saw the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact he came out of the University of Utah, hardly a
mecca for NFL talent, Anderson was derided as a ``tweener,'' he was
too small to be a fullback and too slow to be a halfback. ``A
bowling ball,'' Falcons personnel director Reed Johnson calls him.
</P>
<P>
   Even upon his arrival in Atlanta, his skills went somewhat
unnoticed. In '94, the Falcons were careful to re-sign Erric
Pegram, a running back. And they acquired Craig Heyward, another
running back. And in '95, they traded to get Eric Metcalf, a
part-time running back. And they acquired Blair Thomas, another
running back. In '96, they drafted Richard Huntley, a running back,
in the fourth round. In '97, they drafted Byron Hanspard, a running
back, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they stuck with me,'' Anderson said. ``And I stuck with
it. Eventually, coach \RDan\S Reeves came along and realized I
could be a featured back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons clearly didn't know what they had right under their
noses, though. In Anderson's rookie year, he totaled three games
played, started none and had two carries for minus-1 yard. Even in
his second year, he appeared in all 16 games, mostly as a kick
returner, carrying the ball just 39 time for 161 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It still stuns. Does it still sting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think you can see it in the way guys run,'' Anderson
said. ``Run with a purpose. Run hard every down. Run hard every
carry.''

DUCKS BLOW LEAD

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ One-goal leads in today's NHL are nice,
two-goal leads are nearly insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try telling the Mighty Ducks. Wednesday night they
squandered a two-goal lead in a 4-3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche
before 15,011 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have struggled to hold leads all season and they gave
up four consecutive goals to the Avalanche after taking a 2-0 lead
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rucchin made it close with his second goal of the game and
16th of the year at 16:13 of the third period, but Colorado held on
to win its sixth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche is unbeaten since defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh ended
his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were less than a second away from taking a two-goal
lead into the second period when Valeri Kamensky blew down the left
side, around Jamie Pushor and snapped a short shot through Guy
Hebert's pads with .3 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point Hebert, who was back in the lineup after a
lengthy bout with the flu, looked as sharp as ever. He stopped the
first 11 shots, including saves on point-blank shots by Stephane
Yelle and Adam Deadmarsh early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had several opportunities to regain the two-goal lead,
but Patrick Roy stopped Marty McInnis twice from the slot, Tomas
Sandstrom just missed on a two-on-one break and Anaheim managed
only one shot on a three-minute, 48-second power play.
</P>
<P>
   However, Anaheim was successfully protecting its slim advantage.
The Avalanche had managed only three shots in the period before
Peter Forsberg turned and flipped a harmless-looking shot from the
right circle that deflected off Fredrik Olausson into the Ducks'
net at 16:21.
</P>
<P>
   That was a very bad sign for the Ducks. The Avalanche were
26-1-7 in the previous 34 games that Forsberg has scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Forsberg they improved on that mark when the Colorado
center helped set up two goals in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg assisted on Greg DeVries' go-ahead goal scored at 3:15
and picked up his third point of the night at 5:55 when Joe Sakic
scored on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   DeVries' goal was the crusher. The defenseman jumped down to the
right circle and scored his first goal of the season, beating
Hebert on the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly refreshed from the All-Star break, the Ducks jumped
out to a quick lead at 2:34 of the first period. Teemu Selanne
intercepted a weak pass by Adam Foote in the left corner and
flipped a sharp-angle shot at Roy. The Colorado goalie turned that
aside, but Rucchin was there to jam home the rebound for his 15th
goal of the year.

REBUILDING THE MARTHA GRAHAM LEGACY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for MARTHA-GRAHAM-DANCE)  
 (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The incestual bed that Isamu Noguchi designed for
Jocasta and her son, Oedipus, in Martha Graham's ``Night Journey''
is no longer parked in a corner of a studio; it has been packed
away. Outside, the earth in Graham's beloved garden has been dug up
in anticipation of the wrecker's ball.
</P>
<P>
   Monday one day before opening a three-week season at the Joyce
Theater, the Martha Graham Dance Company will vacate the school and
studios at 316 East 63rd Street where Graham taught and
choreographed for 40 years before she died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The small brick building will be demolished and sold to pay off
debts, retire a $1.5 million mortgage and establish an endowment.
The original gate that welcomed thousands of dancers and students
from around the world to the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary
Dance has already been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all these dramatic omens are only a preface to the
remarkable story of the Graham company's institutional turnaround
in the last year. The artistic health of the troupe, held together
against all odds by Ron Protas, Graham's handpicked successor, is
not in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The onstage hosts for a gala benefit on Tuesday will include
Twyla Tharp, Tony Randall, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach (Graham
students all), who will introduce a season that has an unusually
strong cluster of Graham's greatest works.
</P>
<P>
   The financial picture in recent years has been more uncertain.
Rebirth, nonetheless, is a favorite Graham theme, and the story to
be told is one of renewal, ostensibly providential but achieved
through determined effort.
</P>
<P>
   At its most evocative, it is a tale of two daughters. One is
Rose Caiola, who as a child studied with Graham. Now director of
her own dance school, she persuaded her father, Benedetto Caiola,
an East Side developer, to buy the Graham building when it came on
the market and to rehouse the company and school in the apartment
house that her family's firm will build on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the $3 million sale and a donation from Caiola, the
company can afford its first New York season since 1995 and plans
to return in a year from a temporary location in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The company's other major benefactor in recent years has been
Delores Barr Weaver, who became a board member after her daughter,
Leigh, spoke of her admiration for Graham's work and dancers. That
Mrs. Weaver and her husband, Wayne Weaver, are owners of the
Jacksonville Jaguars, the Florida football team, and contributors
to the Graham company, does not strike anyone who knows them as
odd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like personal challenges,'' Mrs. Weaver said recently,
adding that the Weaver family will announce a $250,000 challenge
grant to the company. ``If we believe in something, we'll stand toe
to toe to the very end. Ron is the reason Martha Graham is still on
the scene, and we can't let Graham die a second time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stiff-jawed world of corporate and foundation giving,
such personal touches are rare. In her lifetime, Graham's charisma
attracted individual patrons like Katherine Cornell, Baroness
Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace, Doris Duke and
Halston.
</P>
<P>
   But government and foundation grants came her way infrequently
in the 23 years before she died at 96. In 1984, she publicly
protested that the issue was age discrimination. Who could believe
that a 90-year-old woman, even if acknowledged as one of the 20th
century's greatest artists, could still choreograph and oversee her
repertory?
</P>
<P>
   The dance world waited for Graham to die, but she did not, and
the Joyce Theater season includes major productions from the 1980s
and the works from the 1920s and 1930s that she agreed to revive at
Protas' urging.
</P>
<P>
   In their abstract form and spare structures, early works like
``Heretic'' and ``Steps in the Street'' can stun with their fusion
of strict form and deep emotion. Simplicity masks complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The 1931 ``Primitive Mysteries'' is an initiation rite from the
American Southwest, symbolized by the adoration of the Virgin. It
is also one of modern dance's most celebrated masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a time when she herself should have been celebrated in
her later years, Graham was criticized in modern-dance circles for
changing a ruffle on a dress or for changing her own choreography.
``If the dance will be destroyed, it will come from within,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that initially rejected her challenge grant
application at the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984
consisted mainly of dancers and choreographers. That the
modern-dance world parodies Graham through a good-natured female
impersonator in a downtown club today is true to form. The child
rebels against the parent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet modern dance has only one international icon of Graham's
stature. The ballet world is shrewder, identifying itself with the
Balanchine it deified after his death.
</P>
<P>
   It is for a future generation to discover Graham in all the
genius of her repertory, and it is to this end that the company has
just undergone a major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Protas, the company's artistic director, and
Todd Dellinger, formerly development director and now managing
director, a new institutional framework will clearly define the
fiscal and artistic responsibilities of the company directors for
donors. It will also place the rights to Graham's dance works, now
owned by Protas, in a foundation after his death.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Protas, who was Graham's closest associate starting in the
1970s, said he would resign as artistic director by the summer of
2000. He will be succeeded by Janet Eilber, a former leading dancer
in the company. Protas heads the newly formed Graham Trust. Modeled
after the Balanchine Trust, it will license the rights of Graham
works to other dance companies. Like the Balanchine Trust, the
Graham Trust can withdraw a work if it is not performed according
to agreed-upon standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor have allowed their
modern dance pieces to be performed by ballet companies, Protas was
skeptical about ballet dancers' ability to master the Graham idiom.
But the Colorado Ballet's production last fall of ``Appalachian
Spring,'' which was coached by leading Graham dancers and Protas,
as well as Graham productions at the Paris Opera Ballet, convinced
him otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trust conditions, at least 60 percent of the Graham
company's repertory must consist of Graham's choreography. New
works, however, will be commissioned. The Joyce season includes the
New York premiere of ``Not for Me'' by the Broadway choreographer
Susan Stroman.
</P>
<P>
   A suite titled ``Duets for Martha'' includes a commissioned work
by Lucinda Childs and an excerpt from Maurice Bejart's ``Notre
Faust'' as well as excerpts by Twyla Tharp and Robert Wilson; both
created premieres for the company after Graham's death.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said the best news is that the sale of the studio
building allows the company to start the year clear of all debt in
his three-to-five-year plan. Last spring, he said, the Graham
company was $800,000 in debt and was also required to pay back the
$1.5 million it had borrowed against its building. U.S. Trust held
the mortgage, and while banks have been known to partly forgive
loans to arts organizations (American Ballet Theater is an
example), U.S. Trust did not.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to appeals made directly to the mayor's office from
Graham loyalists like Gregory Peck and Betty Ford, and advice from
Schuyler Chapin, the cultural affairs commissioner, the city came
up with a $200,000 challenge grant. If the city gives a variance to
the Caiola firm, M-1 Properties, that relaxes zoning restrictions,
two floors will be added to the new six-story building, adding more
studio space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the Graham school will stay open at Musical
Theater Works, a studio space at 440 Lafayette Street opposite the
Public Theater. Dellinger said that the $3 million sale and an
additional gift of $300,000 from Caiola will wipe out the debts and
mortgage, as well as start an endowment with $400,000 and leave
money to apply to the Joyce season and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Tour bookings have also jumped now that the company, considered
as expensive as a ballet company, has agreed to appear as a smaller
unit, as does American Ballet Theater. It will have 17 dancers
instead of 24 on tour, an arrangement that Protas and Dellinger
call temporary but cuts the company's tour fee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the facts and figures there is also a human face. Alfred
Caiola, Caiola's son and a partner in M-1 Properties, will lease
5,000 square feet back to the Graham company for high-ceilinged
basement studios at a ``modest rent.'' If the city grants
permission to build extra floors, the company will own, not rent,
7,500 square feet of which 2,500 will be on the ground floor. The
firm will also build a black-box theater. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caiola, who owns Studio Maestro, a dance school and
rehearsal space at 48 West 68th Street, had no difficulty
explaining why she talked her father into the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started at the Graham School when I was 8 and was inspired
by Martha when she came in to teach,'' she said. ``The building is
not an optimum business investment but the company must continue. I
told my father something must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone, her father agreed. ``I'd like to do something,
I'm getting bored,'' Caiola said with a laugh. ``It's also because
of Rose. She takes after me. She works hard.''

BRINGING TONALITY, AND FANS, TO CONTEMPORARY MUSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them neo-Romantics, neo-tonalists or post-modernists. None
of the labels are adequate. All are attempts to define the music of
those American composers _ Richard Danielpour, Aaron Jay Kernis,
even John Adams _ who look to the past for inspiration and care
little about the modernist obsession with originality.
</P>
<P>
   No one is bolder in his embrace of a tonal, lyrical and Romantic
past than Lowell Liebermann. And not coincidentally, perhaps,
Liebermann, 37, a New Yorker, has been blessed with enthusiastic
audiences and big-name performers, many of whom rarely champion
contemporary music.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, Liebermann seems to be everywhere at once. His opera
``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' based on the novel by Oscar Wilde,
will receive its American premiere on Friday at the Florentine
Opera in Milwaukee. The English maestro Steuart Bedford, who led
the premiere in 1996 at the Opera de Monte Carlo, will conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and its music
director, Andrew Litton, appointed Liebermann
composer-in-residence, a three-year position to take effect in the
fall. The residency includes one major commission per season. (To
celebrate the orchestra's centennial in 2000, Liebermann is to
write a large symphony with chorus and organ.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Philharmonic has scheduled the premiere of his
Trumpet Concerto in May 2000. And BMG Classics recently released a
disk of his flute music, played by James Galway.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard modernists dismiss Liebermann's music as reactionary,
and 20 years ago, when he was studying composition at the Juilliard
School, his stylistic tendencies were even more unfashionable. In
the early 80s, he had an epiphany, he said recently. ``I was
studying Berio and Nono, and learning to play the Boulez Second
Piano Sonata, and suddenly I said to myself, `I'm really not
enjoying this music.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No longer would Liebermann clothe his compositions in drab,
angular and dissonant garb. He returned to tonality and adopted
traditional genres like sonata and concerto as frames for his
compositions. He even went so far as to assign his works opus
numbers, a custom so archaic that Stravinsky, for one, had
dispensed with it in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a statement that I saw myself as part of the continuum
of the Western classical tradition,'' Liebermann said. ``I realized
that I was taking a risk and that part of the compositional
establishment would simply not be interested in my music just
because of the titles and opus numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Liebermann embraced full-blown Romanticism. The Flute
Concerto, though unabashedly tonal, was lightly scored. But the
Second Piano Concerto was a big-boned, grandiose effusion in the
best 19th-century manner. Litton, the conductor, and Stephen Hough,
a pianist, both former Juilliard classmates of Liebermann, were
pleasantly shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard Lowell's Second Piano Concerto, it struck
me that it could have been Rachmaninoff's Fifth or Prokofiev's
Sixth,'' Litton said, ``what the next concerto might have sounded
like had they lived to write it. I thought, `How fantastic that
someone had the nerve to do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hough, who gave the concerto its premiere and later recorded it
for Hyperion, elaborated: ``I don't know another piece in the
repertory with the same visceral thrill. It's an absolute gift for
pianists. It's unashamedly part of the tradition of the great
Romantic piano concertos. I think there's a real progression from
Liszt to Tchaikovsky to Rachmaninoff to Prokofiev to Barber to
Liebermann. The piece gets an extraordinary reception every time I
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galway receives a similar response when he performs the Flute
Concerto. ``It's music that appeals to people, because it runs the
gamut of human emotions,'' he said. ``Every time I've played the
sonata or concerto, there's been thunderous applause, and often a
standing ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might wonder whether this rapturous reaction simply
reflects the music's seeming familiarity. It is not that the piano
or flute concertos quote from any earlier work, but they speak in a
language rich with historical resonances, one not likely to
challenge listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proved that no musical language can challenge an
audience beyond a certain point and be successful,'' Litton said.
``The death of 12-tone music is a key example. We can deride
Strauss for `Rosenkavalier' or Copland for `Appalachian Spring,'
but they were guys who realized, `I've gone as far as I can go.'
Lowell simply said, `This is how I'm going to write music and
remain true to myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, nagging questions persist, and they are hardly unique to
Liebermann's work. If his music alludes so generously to
Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Bartok and Rachmaninoff, what makes it
more than derivative? And what brands it as music of the 1990s,
rather than, say, the 1930s or 40s?
</P>
<P>
   Liebermann, his supporters insist, reinterprets the past by
filtering it through a contemporary sensibility. His music, Hough
has stated, looks ``not backward (italics)at(end italics) tradition
but forward (italics)with(end italics) tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer himself responds testily to the word
``derivative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's music of our time simply because it's written in our
time,'' he said. ``All I can say is that my work is being performed
by musicians of the stature of James Galway, Stephen Hough, Steven
Isserlis and James Levine. Their good opinion means more to me than
anyone who tries to level that charge against my music.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time everything that can be done with 12
tones has been done. I don't know that it's possible or necessary
to be absolutely original. A composer's style is a compendium of
different elements that come from the continuum of the past, but a
living organism has digested them and made them into something his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to specify contemporary aspects of Liebermann's
musical style, his admirers typically point to the intricate
underlying structures. ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' for
instance, is based entirely on a 12-tone row, which is used
tonally. The key of each of the 12 scenes is determined by the
order of the pitches of the row. Since the row also happens to be a
recurring motif associated with Dorian Gray and his portrait, it
acts as both a large- and small-scale unifying device.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a misconception that if you are writing accessible
tonal music, there is nothing more intellectual going on beneath,''
Liebermann said. ``People assume you're writing this sloppy
tonalism, that you're stringing tunes together and there's no
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no one denies that ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' is
an astonishing operatic debut. Like Britten, whose first opera was
``Peter Grimes,'' Liebermann has burst forth fully formed as a
theatrical composer. In the end the drama is so compelling and the
structure so taut that the question of influence pales in
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto, which Liebermann produced himself, leans heavily
on the vividly theatrical dialogue of Wilde's novel. The 12 scenes
are clearly defined, each focusing on a single dramatic event. And
Liebermann has an intuitive sense of pacing that enables him to
build inexorably to the shattering climax.
</P>
<P>
   His model is clearly Teutonic: the orchestra assumes a role of
Wagnerian importance, developing the motifs associated with
characters and events. Rejecting the episodic nature of Italian bel
canto, Liebermann links the scenes by means of seamless orchestral
interludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the opera to be continuously unfolding and symphonic
in its unity,'' he said. ``I didn't want the action to stop
musically when it stopped dramatically. So it had to be
through-composed rather than a succession of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Never ashamed to revel in hummable tunes, Liebermann presents
vocal lines of soaring, expansive lyricism. He mostly shuns
recitative and avoids the generic, colorless parlando that defaces
so many American operas. The stage seems occupied by
flesh-and-blood characters, not cardboard cutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' is the work of a
composer who wields a virtuoso technique with self-assurance and
conviction. The subject ideally suits his musical predilections.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's overripe, faded decadence finds a counterpart in
Liebermann's opulent textures and bittersweet melodies. If Mahler
simultaneously mocked and mourned the dying traditions of
fin-de-siecle Vienna, Liebermann also yearns for the irretrievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work can be nostalgic in the way it looks back to the
past,'' he said, ``although it's not about trying to recreate the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Liebermann is clearly enamored of Wilde's extravagant if
self-indulgent estheticism. Recent photos show him in a Wildean
boudoir, lounging in a silk smoking jacket and velvet pants. He is
rendered almost incidental by a Zeffirellian profusion of sumptuous
brocade, ornate gilding and Victorian kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   Liebermann is too sophisticated to look back without a healthy
dose of ironic detachment. But his eyes, which never lose a certain
melancholy cast, hint at some deeper longing. It's the same wistful
regret one senses in photos of another composer who lamented being
born a century too late: Johannes Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet 40, Liebermann has many years of stylistic growth ahead
of him. Yet one suspects that like Samuel Barber, he will never
abandon his essentially lyrical, Romantic orientation. Mention of
Barber prompts Liebermann to align himself with his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People also claimed that Barber's music was not of its day,''
he said triumphantly. ``Only now do we realize that he was very
much a man of his time.''

By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a brief period in the spring of 1898, Arnold
Schoenberg, then 23, thought that his music just might be received
by the public with some degree of sympathy. His String Quartet in
D, a piece steeped in Brahms but using a more wide-ranging harmonic
language, was performed by a new-music ensemble in Vienna and
greeted with something approaching enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to last. Schoenberg's ruminatively beautiful
string sextet ``Transfigured Night,'' the next work he submitted
for the ensemble's consideration, was rejected as too radical. And
when several of his songs were presented in Vienna in late 1900,
vehement protests erupted in the audience. Schoenberg soon became,
as he put it, ``everyone's whipping boy.'' For the rest of his
life, he met with incomprehension at best, outright hostility at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Schoenberg probably gets the nod as the most reviled
composer in history. So when the Metropolitan Opera presents its
first production of his masterpiece ``Moses und Aron'' on Feb. 8,
more of the animosity the composer's music has always attracted
will undoubtedly be whipped up.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Schoenberg tried to numb himself to the attacks. ``I
have become indifferent to public abuse,'' he wrote in 1915 to
composer Alexander Zemlinsky, who, though just three years older,
was the closest thing the essentially self-taught Schoenberg had to
a teacher. In truth, the abuse embittered him. When it came from
musicians and critics, he suffered pangs of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And the abuse could be merciless. ``I suffered physical pain, as
one cruelly abused,'' a Berlin critic wrote in 1909, on hearing the
composer's Second String Quartet. New York Times critic James
Gibbons Huneker, reporting on a performance of ``Pierrot Lunaire''
in 1913, wrote that Schoenberg's music conveyed an ``aura of
original depravity, of subtle ugliness, of basest egoism, of hatred
and contempt, of cruelty and of the mystic grandiose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schoenberg clung to his belief that however radical, the
evolution of his musical language into free atonality, and his
subsequent invention of the technique of 12-tone composition,
represented inevitable stages in the development of the great
European classical tradition. That is not the way things panned
out. Still, Schoenberg would probably be amazed by the imposing
place he now occupies in music history.
</P>
<P>
   Though Huneker's condemnation may seem laughably excessive
today, many present-day listeners essentially agree. The Met
production of ``Moses und Aron'' will be seen as a brave act of
principled programming. But the New York City Opera proved that
``Moses und Aron'' does not have to be box-office poison when it
presented the work's New York stage premiere in 1990. Ticket sales
were strong, though they were driven in part by a daring
production, which included a steamy enactment of Israelites
engaging in orgiastic dancing and naked coupling before the idol of
the golden calf.
</P>
<P>
   Little word has emerged about the Met's production, by Graham
Vick, but publicity photographs suggest a spare, vividly colorful
approach. James Levine, who reveres the opera, will conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If anything of Schoenberg's has the potential to engage those
unfamiliar with his music _ intimidated by the 12-tone idiom,
perhaps, but at least curious _ it is this viscerally powerful,
dauntingly complex yet often hauntingly beautiful opera, for which
Schoenberg also wrote the libretto. It is the composer's most
directly personal statement.
</P>
<P>
   The drama turns on a debate. God has instructed Moses to lead
His chosen people from the bonds of oppression. Moses profoundly
understands that the omnipresent God is ultimately ``unperceived
and unrepresentable,'' but he despairs of being able to communicate
this idea to his wary, downtrodden followers. God tells Moses to
seek help from Aron, his verbally adroit brother. But Aron
empathizes with the doubting Israelites and their need for
something tangible to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Aron represents graspable reality, which can be perceived
through the senses and shared. Schoenberg, accordingly, conceives
the role for a plaintive and, ideally, powerful tenor. Philip
Langridge is the Met's Aron. Moses deals with incomprehensible
phenomena, which cannot be explained. In a bold stroke, Schoenberg
conveys Moses' lack of verbal eloquence by having him deliver his
part in a sort of notated speech. (Rhythms are exact, but pitches
are marked on the staff with X's, to indicate that they should be
spoken and suggested.) The bass John Tomlinson, in his Met debut,
portrays Moses.
</P>
<P>
   The biblical story spoke to Schoenberg's deep spiritual
cravings. Perhaps because his life's work involved contesting the
absolutes he had inherited in music, Schoenberg sought others in
religion. He completed two acts of the opera in 1932. (A third was
intended but never composed.)
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Hitler's rise to power in Germany and the Nazis'
persecution of Jews provoked a powerful reaction in Schoenberg.
Born and raised Jewish in Vienna, he had converted to Lutheranism
in early adulthood. But in 1933, at 59, he openly re-embraced the
Jewish faith. ``Moses und Aron'' anticipated his reconversion and
grippingly expressed the fervor behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of hearing ``Moses und Aron'' will no doubt
evoke terror in many listeners. Why has Schoenberg's musical
radicalism engendered such continuing hostility, when the
radicalism of Stravinsky and Bartok has long been embraced?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because Schoenberg is viewed, simplistically, as the
main culprit behind the powerful challenge to the system of
tonality that had for centuries brought at least some degree of
commonality to music from diverse cultures, and because he is
blamed, rightly or wrongly, for driving a wedge between
20th-century composers and the public. Even Schoenberg's
pre-12-tone music represented, in the words of a Berlin critic in
1910, a ``methodical negation of all heretofore accepted musical
rules.'' Schoenberg ``kills tonal perception,'' the critic added.
``Debussy only threatens; Schoenberg carries out the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, to be sure, an element of truth in this critique, and
Schoenberg has never been forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, he revered the tradition and the stylistic unity
it made possible. Despite his defensiveness about his work, he
never intended to tear down the entire tonal system. He moved to
the United States in 1933 and eventually settled in Los Angeles,
where he briefly became a friend and tennis partner of George
Gershwin, whom he respected immensely. There was nothing
patronizing about this respect. Schoenberg simply felt that the
serious music of high culture operated on a different plane from
other music, and radical currents had been sweeping through serious
music for some time.
</P>
<P>
   He felt compelled, almost against his will, to dismantle
existing procedures and devise new ones. It was a dirty job, in
other words, but somebody had to do it.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, needed to be done? Before the century was a
decade old, the system of tonality was in crisis, and whatever one
ultimately thinks of Schoenberg's solutions, his analysis of the
problem was astute, convincing and courageous.
</P>
<P>
   Although tonal music is ubiquitous, the concept of tonality is
hard to describe. In its most common manifestation, music using
major and minor keys, tonality is a system of organizing pitch in
accordance with acoustical principles. A certain pitch (say, the C
of the C major scale) is fundamental. The other pitches of the
scale relate to that fundamental in an audible hierarchy of
importance. Whatever happens, the music has to keep referring back
to that fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   Variety and creativity in the tonal system come from playing
with expectations and introducing ambiguity. By the mid-19th
century, this game was getting out of hand. Schoenberg correctly
perceived a work like Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde'' as music that
daringly and ingeniously frustrated, even negated, the sense of a
clear tonal center. In the music of Richard Strauss and Max Reger,
Schoenberg felt, the system of major and minor tonality had lost
all its functionality. He knew that such was the case with his
music as well, and although others had made similar observations,
few dared to face the daunting implications.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Schoenberg tried to write in a harmonic language
unhinged from tonality: atonality, it has been called, although
Schoenberg hated the term. Works like his Three Piano Pieces (Op.
11), from 1909, were written with the harmonic equivalent of free
association. It is not coincidental that during this period of a
free-roaming musical language Schoenberg wrote a lot of vocal works
with texts: most famously, ``Pierrot Lunaire.'' A text would give a
listener at least something to hang onto; in similar fashion, movie
audiences will accept all manner of dissonance and chaos in a
score, because it is heard as lending expression to a cinematic
story.
</P>
<P>
   But Schoenberg tired of writing music with texts and knew he had
reached a dead end. So he took a conceptual leap that was audacious
yet, in a sense, thrillingly logical: if all 12 pitches in the
octave (together, the chromatic scale) are to be used more or less
equally, he reasoned, then why not devise a system that insures
equality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the old hierarchy or his new free-for-all, he
specified that the 12 pitches be put in an order, or row, or set.
Once a pitch was sounded, it was not to be repeated until the
entire row had unfolded. And since chords, the vertical element of
music, were also built from the tone row, the system would insure
absolute equality between the horizontal (or melodic) and vertical
(or harmonic) elements of music.
</P>
<P>
   There were many ways around this system. A composer could
transpose the rows, go through them backward or upside-down, break
them into halves or thirds, and play mix-and-match.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds brainy and mathematical, and in a way it is. But for
Schoenberg it was liberating. With equivalency of pitch made almost
automatic, he could achieve subtlety, complexity, nuance, tension,
tenderness or whatever quality he was after through other musical
elements: rhythmic gesture, texture, density, contrapuntal
inventiveness, accent, dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as crazy as it sounds. When I taught music appreciation
in college, I won over a lot of skeptics with a simple
demonstration. I would play a Bach musette on the piano, then play
the Musette from Schoenberg's Suite for Piano (Op. 25), a
thoroughly 12-tone work. In every aspect except for the way the
pitches were picked, the Schoenberg musette was just like Bach's:
the same short-short-long rhythm; the same bagpipelike drone
characteristic of this 17th-century French dance form; the same
skipping, playful character. And when students stopped fretting
about tone rows, they would hear the elements of the Bach musette
in Schoenberg's stunning transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, pleased with the facility his new technique afforded,
Schoenberg wrote to a colleague, ``I find myself positively enabled
to compose as freely and fantastically as one otherwise does only
in one's youth, and am nevertheless subject to a precisely
definable esthetic discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, then and now, would scoff, and charge that Schoenberg
was simply writing by default, according to the dictates of some
pitch chart. But whole spans of tonal music in Haydn, Mozart and
Beethoven are written with an equivalent degree of automatic
selection: standard accompanimental patterns; passage work based on
scales; rhythmic riffs; even melodies (to say nothing of
automatic-pilot sonata form and the like). Invention and
ingeniousness lie in the music's details, just as they do in
Schoenberg's 12-tone works.
</P>
<P>
   In his initial excitement, Schoenberg wrongly predicted that his
system would insure the continued supremacy of Germanic music for
at least another century. Yet his work and that of his disciples
Alban Berg and Anton Webern captured the imagination of countless
composers in later decades. During the 1960s and '70s, their method
was championed in many of the most prestigious university music
departments, though with a dogmatism that is, in retrospect,
regrettable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were other ways to inject freshness into
tonality, as Stravinsky, Bartok, Shostakovich, Britten and others
showed. And the universe of music is probably destined to be, if
not strictly tonal, at least tonally rooted, since the hunger for
tonality is built into the properties of sound and, thus, into the
ear itself. So Schoenberg's 12-tone music and that of his followers
are best heard as playing with (or against) the innate expectation
of tonal grounding. Music written with 12-tone procedures
discombobulates, befuddles, challenges and, ideally, delights the
ear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, Schoenberg was a visionary musical
genius, as would have been clear whatever his method of
composition. He would have wanted us to experience ``Moses und
Aron'' without even thinking about tone rows.
</P>
<P>
   Why the opera was never completed is a sad tale. Schoenberg
eventually got a job at UCLA. The man who had once taught Berg and
Webern now had classes of relative beginners. But he forged on. In
1944, at 70, he was forcibly retired. Since he had taught for just
eight years, his pension was a pitiful $38 a month. From his second
marriage, he had three children to raise, aged 13, 8, and 4. In a
heartbreaking letter to the Guggenheim Foundation he applied for a
grant so that he could, among other things, complete ``Moses und
Aron.'' He was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft Schoenberg left for the third act, the power
conflict shifts. Moses imprisons his brother, charging that by
misrepresenting the unknowable God, Aron has led his people into
the wilderness, literally and metaphorically. When Moses orders
Aron's release, Aron falls dead. Moses affirms that in the desert,
paradoxically, his people will truly find unity with God.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two acts composed are powerful and do not seem
incomplete. At the end of Act II, the anguished Moses confronts the
fact that God is ultimately unknowable, and that people, craving
proof, will always be vulnerable to leaders, like Aron, who give
them what they want. True faith requires an intuitive, almost
irrational commitment. Moses understands this but cannot convey it.
So what else is new? End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg may have used systematic procedures to compose this
work, but the resulting music is often sensuously beautiful, as in
the eerie, soft-spoken, sustained passages for chorus. Schoenberg's
text is stern and preachy, but the words are set with a humane
poignancy. At one point, for example, Aron asks Moses, ``How can
you worship what you cannot represent?'' On the page the question
is blunt. But as set musically, Aron's words are plaintive and
moving.
</P>
<P>
   And for sheer, driving, ferocious power, nothing in opera _ not
the opening storm scene of Verdi's ``Otello,'' not the music that
evokes Siegmund fleeing his enemies through the wind-swept forest
in Wagner's ``Walkure,'' not the angry crowd scene in Britten's
``Peter Grimes'' _ packs the wallop of Schoenberg's frenzied music
depicting the sacrifices and sex before the golden calf.
</P>
<P>
   For some listeners, the difficulty with ``Moses und Aron'' may
come less from the 12-tone idiom than from the composer's extensive
use of speech and quasi-speech, not just for Moses but also for
extended passages in the chorus. All that shouting can seem
melodramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses und Aron'' lacks the dramatic sophistication of Berg's
``Wozzeck'' and ``Lulu.'' Unlike Schoenberg, Berg was a born man of
the theater, who devised a way to soften his mentor's 12-tone
technique with hints of tonal harmony. The music of ``Moses''
retains some two-dimensional qualities, suggesting the oratorio
Schoenberg first thought it might be. But a good production can
leave a listener shattered. And under Levine's direction, the Met's
superb orchestra and chorus are presumably poised to give one.
</P>
<P>
   Some opera fans will pass the poster for ``Moses und Aron''
outside the Met, curse Schoenberg's name and go inside to buy
tickets for ``Aida.'' They will miss the work of a composer placing
everything on the line, maybe crossing that line but not caring, so
powerful was his compulsion to create this opera.

<P>
   Rather like the hero of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' who rescues
doomed French aristocrats from the jaws of the guillotine, Robert
Longbottom seems to have saved the musical by Frank Wildhorn and
Nan Knighton from certain death.
</P>
<P>
   After opening to overwhelmingly negative reviews in November
1997, and playing for months to dwindling audiences at the Minskoff
Theater on Broadway, the show was on the brink of closing when new
producers, led by Radio City Entertainment, bought the production.
They asked Longbottom, the director and choreographer of last
season's ``Side Show,'' to resuscitate it, and when it reopened
this past November, most critics agreed that he had done just that.
</P>
<P>
   The retooled ``Scarlet Pimpernel'' has given theatergoers a rare
glimpse of the critical role played by the directors of Broadway
musicals. Yet when you talk to them about what they do for a
living, they resort to simple metaphors that belie the complexity
of their task. They will tell you the job is about finding a
rhythm, seeing a picture, hearing a motor. Or maybe making an arc,
weaving a spell, taking a journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a musical succeeds, it looks effortless,'' said James
Lapine, the director and writer, with Stephen Sondheim, of the
musicals ``Sunday in the Park With George'' and ``Into the Woods.''
``But it's a totally bizarre art form. There are no rules to go
by.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the form's most venerable practitioners, like Harold Prince
and Tommy Tune, have had to contend with fiascoes; artists of
genius, like the choreographers Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris, have
been humbled in their attempts to direct Broadway musicals
(``Singin' in the Rain'' and the recent ``Capeman,'' respectively);
and for young directors trying to gain a foothold in the
profession, it has become harder and harder to find an acknowledged
master to understudy.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the century, directors of musical comedy,
as the genre was called, usually staged book scenes, while the
choreographer attended to dance sequences and the musical staff
took care of the songs. The results would not pass muster today,
Prince once said in an interview: ``Big stars stood center stage,
legs nicely apart, and belted great songs greatly. And you went to
hear that great music and have a nice buoyant experience.'' The
director was a minor part of the success _ or failure _ of a given
show.
</P>
<P>
   As musicals came of age in the middle of the century, shows like
``Oklahoma!,'' ``Carousel'' and ``Pal Joey'' pushed the form into
darker, more dramatic territory, giving directors new importance.
And concept musicals like ``West Side Story,'' ``Company'' and
``Sweeney Todd'' completed the transformation of the director into
the musical's primary creative force. But the old guidelines, which
had been pioneered by Prince's mentor, George Abbott, could no
longer guide.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was as renowned for his ability to prescribe remedies for
other directors' ailing shows as he was for staging his own. But
Longbottom did not want to doctor ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' Still
heartsick about the failure of ``Side Show,'' which had not won an
audience despite critical support, and eager for a new project, he
told the producers that Peter Hunt's original staging would need a
complete overhaul. ``You can't fix a few moments,'' he said he told
them. ``You need to really address the beginning, middle and end.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that someone who has been
sharpening the musty Radio City Christmas show since 1994 _
Longbottom is the director _ would be able to put a glossy finish
on an old-fashioned period musical. But, he said, the most useful
skill he got from working at the Music Hall was the ability to
direct and choreograph quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So his bosses knew he could do the job in the 75 hours they gave
him to rehearse the ``Pimpernel'' cast. Another help was his
background in summer stock: ``Putting up `South Pacific' in nine
days is not very fulfilling, but it's good to know you can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom, whose passion for the theater first manifested
itself when, as an 8-year-old in Maine, he began tap-dance lessons,
also apprenticed as a gypsy in touring Broadway shows. ``Watching
the process, how shows were put together, fascinated me much more
than dishing in the dressing room,'' he said. ``When I wasn't
onstage, you'd find me out behind the tech table, eavesdropping as
much as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing may help, noted Jerry Zaks, who directed the current
``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and is preparing the next Wildhorn musical,
``The Civil War,'' scheduled to open on April 22 at the St. James
Theater on Broadway. ``But the only way to learn is trial and
error. Music has its own power and its own set of rules. And
learning to integrate all of a musical's elements is very much an
ongoing process,'' he said. ``There are so many pieces. You learn
how each one can tell the story and you learn to make sure they're
not fighting each other. The task is always to weave some sort of
spell, and in a musical, you have more tools to help _ and more
things to coordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   The coordinating is a skill in itself. ``The director walks a
fine line between being a visionary and a diplomat,'' Longbottom
said. ``You've got to make sure everybody on the team is seeing the
same show. But you need the skills of the diplomat to navigate the
different egos and temperaments, because they make contributions
that are essential to its success. You don't write music, and you
don't write lyrics. So it's critical that these people be totally
inspired to do their best work.''
</P>
<P>
   The confidence to put together a team and manage it well is
rarely given to neophytes. In an interview before Julie Taymor won
the Tony Award last June for directing her first effort for the
commercial Broadway theater, she pointed out that she had been
honing her skills for more than two decades in the nonprofit arena:
``I had the experience, the guts to be able to say, `Believe me,
I've done this before, I know it works,' '' she said of being in
command of the many contributors to ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   With its visual splendor, ``The Lion King'' is a persuasive
example of the importance of a director's design sense to the
overall effect of a musical. Prince has said that ``visual concepts
are probably the largest part of the concept musical.'' And like
many directors, Longbottom thinks in images: ``If I can't see
something once I've read a scene, it usually means there's a
problem with the way it's written.''
</P>
<P>
   Picturing ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was easy for Longbottom,
since the sets and costumes were already in place. But what made
him believe he could improve it? ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I
was terrified. But I knew I couldn't make it any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking on the project, he watched Hunt's original
version, which he had first seen when it was still in previews.
(Hunt did not respond to several requests for an interview.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Since everyone else was focusing on what was wrong with the
show,'' Longbottom said, ``I went in there deliberately making
myself focus on what appealed to me about the story. And there was
a lot.'' He was most taken by two of its elements: the comfortable
English aristocrats so moved by the plight of their French
counterparts during the Reign of Terror that they risk their lives
to help them escape, and the triangular love story.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Material, Lapine said, is the key to directing a musical: ``If
the material doesn't work, I don't think (italics)anybody(end
italics) can make it fly. But you have to help shape it. Nobody's
ever handed in a show that didn't need more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom felt he knew exactly how he could make the
18th-century adventure story meaningful to a contemporary audience.
``I wanted to highlight what it takes for all of us, as citizens,
to get involved, to do more than just write a hundred-dollar check
at Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wanted to accentuate the character of Marguerite, the
French actress who is suspected by her bridegroom, Sir Percy
Blakeney, of being in cahoots with his enemies in France, both
personally and politically. ``She was the center of the story,''
Longbottom said. ``To me, the motor of the show was the love
triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   To let the audience in on this, he replaced the musical's
opening, in which a vengeful Parisian mob had literally sung the
praises of the guillotine as blue bloods went to their deaths. ``I
had real problems with that,'' Longbottom said. ``I didn't object
to the gore. But I had no idea what was going on. And I thought
that that song had such a singular point of view that it should
belong to one character, not an ensemble. Within the first five
minutes of any show, you've got to know where to look and what the
characters want. I felt a better door to get into that was through
Marguerite.''
</P>
<P>
   So he turned a street song she sang in the second act into a
fanciful Ziegfeld-style number for the character, whose final
performance in a Paris theater now opens the show as Percy and her
former lover, the heartless radical Chauvelin, watch. Longbottom
also recast the roles of Marguerite and Chauvelin, hiring Rachel
York and Rex Smith to join Douglas Sills, whose Percy in the
original production had earned him a Tony nomination. (Sills is
scheduled to leave the musical on March 7.)
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring the ``Pimpernel'' book with Ms. Knighton,
Longbottom recalled, they ``didn't really shuffle the songs so much
as think, `What's the new thrust here? How are we going to propel
these three people into this journey?' The plot came first.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Galati, the director of plays and operas, who turned his
hand to the Broadway musical for the first time with the current
``Ragtime,'' said that narrative is the crucial ingredient in
directing a musical, as it is in directing a play. ``There are so
many elements that contribute to the experience _ songs, scenery,
costumes, dance, lighting, special effects, atmosphere. But in
order to really engage and lift an audience out of themselves, the
fundamental is to tell a story. The key is storytelling,
storytelling energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom discovered that getting the right energy into the
Pimpernel story required extensive cutting _ the script went from
112 pages to 80 _ and many of his cuts were jokes. ``People looked
at me like I was crazy when I said there were too many laughs,'' he
said. But he felt they were distracting the audience from the arc
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Directing a musical is just about rhythm,'' said George C.
Wolfe, the director of ``Jelly's Last Jam'' and ``Bring In da
Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' whose recent revival of ``On the Town,''
closed this month after mixed reviews on Broadway. In ``On the
Town,'' he was troubled by two scenes that took place in the
apartments of two of the show's New York women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious parallel structure,'' he said, ``but it was
crafted with the rhythms of 1944. By intercutting the two scenes, I
was able to infuse them with a much more contemporary feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time that first note is hit, you're off on this
journey that is defined exclusively by rhythm. You need that rhythm
_ of music, of dance, of words, of scenery _ to keep the audience
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the audience. ``If there's anything that makes me a good
director of musicals,'' Lapine said, ``it's that I have a short
attention span.''
</P>
<P>
   When, in ``Passion,'' he and Sondheim did a show that tried to
ignore the familiar rhythms of scene-song-scene-song, they found
audiences unwilling to go along. ``It's important to let the
audience laugh,'' Lapine said. ``It's important to let the audience
applaud. It's an incredible release for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom felt that ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' ``needed to have
a real infusion of Broadway sensibility. It didn't have a bona-fide
production number or showstopper, even though the ingredients were
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number,'' he said, ``has an agenda, takes the story
from one place to another. Even in the Christmas show, where most
of the numbers are divertissements, I try to infuse them with
storytelling. So from the top of a number to the end, the Rockettes
will go somewhere.'' In ``Pimpernel,'' he decided that the best
opportunity was ``The Creation of Man,'' the song in which Percy
persuades his aristocratic friends to disguise their
counterrevolutionary activities by pretending to be fops. But he
was puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the costume designer, Jane Greenwood, `Why is your
statement such a soft one here?' And she said, `There was a whole
set of costumes that were rejected.' Bingo!'' said Longbottom. New
costumes based on what Ms. Greenwood described as her
``over-the-top'' sketches help the restaged number ``land'' every
night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience needed that. There's a great deal of exposition
in the first act. So by the time you put the pieces together,
you're an hour and 10 minutes into the show. You need a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Longbottom sees these as ``the seismic ups and downs'' of a
musical. ``If there are too many flat lines, you have a problem.
You need to have a steady climb to the end of the first act, and
you have to make sure the second act gets back up to where the
first left off. It's all very tricky,'' he said. ``It's
instinctual. It's not anything you can read anywhere.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HIGH TECH COMES TO THE HIGH ALPS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>

   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Each year, a bunch of big shots gathers at
this ski resort to ponder the fate of the world. When I first
started attending these meetings four years ago, wearing a plain
white badge that identified me as a ``media leader,'' few of the
poohbahs who plunk down upwards of $40,000 to spend a week here
with their fellow poohbahs paid any heed to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, in this rarefied realm, keyboards that link users to
the Internet were seen as best left to flunkies. To allow the
leaders stay in touch between annual
</P>
<P>
   meetings, Geneva-based organizers of the World Economic Forum
pushed a proprietary contact system. But it was poorly received by
the attendees, not because it was quite costly but because it would
have required them to use a video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. This year, anyone with access to the
Internet can watch the main proceedings as they occur by clicking
on an Internet site (http://live99.weforum.org).
</P>
<P>
   Having been asked to park their security teams away from this
crowded Alpine campus, the visiting brass appear quite content to
parade before virtual crowds. In any event, they do their real
business behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Davos has been discovered by the digital divas. Rich
folks seen plodding through the snow include such founding fathers
of cyberspace as Microsoft's Bill Gates, computer maker Michael
Dell, Steve Case of America Online, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and
Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   They skirt Russia's Yevgeny Primakov and South Africa's Nelson
Mandela to join in seminars on how to spread the ``info
revolution'' and how to deal with the ``technology trap.''
(Research shows that the new technologies, while speeding contacts
and compressing time, can also aggravate conflict and foster an
``argument culture.'')
</P>
<P>
   The info-billionaires have also plunged into a seemingly
continual round of hi-tech schmooze sessions. (Their informal
discussions would no doubt be of interest to Joel Klein, who heads
the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department. Klein,
invited to attend, felt obliged to stay back in Washington to
monitor the Microsoft trial, where the ``argument culture'' remains
on display.)
</P>
<P>
   No matter what their exalted station in life might be, each
participant at this year's gathering walks around carrying a tiny
networked computer, hidden within his or her credit card-sized
plastic badge.
</P>
<P>
   These ``smart cards,'' the organizers assure us, ``allow a
superior level of identification and security within the (meeting
hall). They will be further developed in
</P>
<P>
   future years to become the central piece of an integrated
computing structure allowing participants to seamlessly register
for sessions, access their e-mailbox, and
</P>
<P>
   perform several other personalized applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Such computerized badges must make the Dells and the McNealys
and their kindred cybersouls feel at home in the Swiss Alps.
Thoroughly in touch, they trudge off to inform the forum about how
to do business in the digital economy, at a session televised on
the Internet and aptly moderated by Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard
Graduate School of Business.

 NEWS AND FEATURE No 2516 - January 28, 1999  
<TEXT>

   1. BUDDHISM AND SCIENCE The ancient teachings of Buddhism have
some remarkable similarities with modern science. Both are founded
on profound scepticism and both seek explanations to the great
questions. While science is steadfastly objective and Buddhism
highly subjective, both lay claim to understanding the universe in
ways that may be complementary. From GEO Magazine. By Hanne Tugel.
1,700 words. (English translation available.)

<P>
   2. WHEN CHILDREN LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE Surprisingly good
things happen when kids are exposed at home and at school to a
second language : increased self-esteem, better concentration,
improved scores in mathematics and an appreciation of different
cultures. Children are best able to absorb a second language when
they are under 6 years old. By Lynne S. Dumas. Child magazine.
1,400 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
INTRUDER IN THE HEART Miguel never recalled when his feeble,
quivering heartbeats actually began. The first attacks were brief.
Doctors finally determined he was suffering from Chagas disease,
caused by Tryponasoma cruzi, a single-celled protozoan that can
burrow into heart muscle. Claire Panosian, a professor of medicine
in the division of infectious diseases and director of travel and
tropical medicine at UCLA Medical Centre, reports on treating
Miguel. From Discover magazine. 1,100 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
FAT-BLASTERS FOR MIDDLE-AGED METABOLISMS Is your weight giving you
a midlife crisis? This article explains how you can fight back (and
offers a helpful sidebar on ways to cut 100 calories.) By Julia
Califano. McCall's. 900 words + 200-word sidebar.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
RUSSIAN DRIFT Today Russia is closer to bloody conflict than it has
ever been since the terrible civil war of 1918-20. For 70 years,
the Soviet Union operated a strong state apparatus, anchored by the
KGB and the Communist Party. Now its disintegration has created a
power vacuum that has yet to be filled. By Steven R. David. Foreign
Affairs Magazine. 1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________
</P>
<P>
   6. WATCH OUT, RUSSIA IS STILL ON THE BRINK Winston Churchill's
description of Russia as a ``riddle wrapped in a mystery in an
enigma'' was a reference to the total obsessive secrecy of Stalin's
regime. That's all gone, but Russia remains a dilemma. By Flora
Lewis. 800 words.

   A. UNLOCKING THE MIND : Even people who are completely paralysed
can teach their brains to type. By Jonathan Knight. 500 words. B.
TURNING THE TIDE : Italy has abandoned a plan to erect giant
barriers to protect Venice from flooding. Has it surrendered the
city to the sea, or is it taking the first step to an ecological

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Mom and Pop play the market
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is at least one thing on which Bill Clinton and the
congressional Republicans are somewhat in agreement: The Clinton
plan to allow baby boomers to invest a portion of their Social
Security taxes in the stock market. Whatever that portion turns out
to be in dollars, Republicans already don't think it's enough.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's too much. Although the total dollars amount to only
a fraction of Wall Street holdings, by any other human standard the
amount is huge. Mom and Pop ought to have lots of fun playing the
market, which lacks only neon to rival Las Vegas for amusement
value. It finally fell to good old cautious Alan Greenspan to ask
if this wasn't a tiny bit much.
</P>
<P>
   There are already enough fly-by-night stock schemes being
offered America's seniors from phone boiler rooms on any given
morning to give you the terminal willies. What will happen to Mom
and Pop's retirement savings if the market blows them out? They
must be drooling in the shark pools.
</P>
<P>
   What will we say to Mom and Pop? Sorry folks, but you should
have known better than to put everything into goldbubble.com? Lost
the old homestead? Awful sorry, but you can't live here?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Is the American political system heading South?
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been a fair amount of chin-pulling and other
histrionic musings in recent years over the suspected
``Southernization'' of America, by which it is generally meant that
the whole nation is taking on the characteristics associated with
the South _ and usually its worst ones: a hidebound moralism,
anti-intellectualism and a social and political conservatism that
stops, if it stops at all, just a hair short of the outright
reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those supposed characteristics are more like stereotypes
than archetypes and the anecdotal evidence often looks more
assembled than weighed. Still, if you're after further suspicious
trends, consider the drift in national attitudes toward treating
politics mainly as a spectator sport, useful only for whatever
passing entertainment it provides and otherwise meaningless or even
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   For generations after the Civil War, the South's one-party
Democratic politics and its dead weight of leaden racist
demagoguery reduced elections to an empty exercise in form without
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Laws and custom both drove potential voters away from the polls.
The South's turnouts were usually the nation's lowest. Personal
rivalries and cooked-up differences substituted for the honest
differences of honest partisanship. Voters were walk-ons in staged
dramas. The ``big mules'' _ major landowners and others with
business interests _ used political gofers to keep schooling weak
and labor cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Politics became not a means for working a broad public will for
the better but instead the occasional source of mere treats for its
players _ a road here, a dinky college there. With most voters
fatalistic and sidelined, the electorate settled for political
gossip and tales of the shenanigans of elected characters. Voters
traded their franchise for good seats.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. The old South swapped its political yarns in barber shops
and courthouse halls. The new America hears its political stories
from late-night TV jokers, radio slimers and political wrestling
shows like ``McLaughlin Group.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 Pew Research Center poll found that a fourth of voters
learned about the presidential campaign from Leno, Letterman and so
on. And since the biggest targets are the easiest, presidents are
the butts of most yuks and cheap outrage. Last year, according to
the Center for Media and Public Affairs, President Clinton was hit
1,721 times on the four leading late-night TV shows; Kenneth Starr
139 times.
</P>
<P>
   National voter participation has fallen to historic lows. After
all, why not? Politics, we are tutored, is pointless _ didn't
Ronald Reagan teach us no problem is so bad it can't be made still
worse by any effort to solve it? _ and politicians are only a
troupe of scamps, charlatans and clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Hyper partisanship is as off-putting as one-party politics once
was. Since politics is a means to no end but itself, why not study
it in the circle of Hollywood detritus assembled nightly by
``Politically Incorrect''?
</P>
<P>
   We are selling our franchise for channel-surfing. Southern or
not, it's a lousy deal.

 &HT;    Dixie on Dixie
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Who ever would've guessed that Julia
Sugarbaker _ she of ardent opinion and arched eyebrow _ was a woman
of minced words?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the fewest lines of anyone on the show,'' drawls Dixie
Carter, discussing her role as the cynical grande dame on Designing
Women. ``I'm actually quite proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud because subtle asides and nail-on-the-head facial
expressions (``they cut to me a lot for reaction'') made her
character memorable. Not reams of sitcom blabber or slapstick
antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show was written just for us,'' she says, referring to
original cast co-stars Delta Burke, Annie Potts and Jean Smart.
``We all thought we were the prettiest and the funniest.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Carter doesn't have to vie for prom queen.
That's because her cabaret act of comedy, song and Southern
anecdotes is a solo gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing now is the real McCoy,'' she says. ``A live
audience is the reason I went into performing. It's just me, the
material and the people in the room. I can't get that from a
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   (Carter, by the way, is chatting by phone from Beverly Hills.
She's just gotten her hair ``cut off, off, off''' and has a
BellSouth Yellow Pages shoot today. ``I am,'' she jokes, ``tres
chic.'')
</P>
<P>
   The actress, it seems, has always been on stage _ and not just
in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   She was valedictorian at her high school in Huntingdon, Tenn.
(and nabbed the math award, too). Swept cooking competitions at the
fair. Won beauty pageants through college. And even took first
prize in a 4-H Club personality contest (``now that was
something!'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a total goody-two-shoes, but I had this spirit that made
me see how much I could do,'' recalls Carter, 59. ``I've always
been nice, but kind of bossy. I was an ambitious little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The middle kid of retailer Halbert Carter and his wife,
Virginia, the actress was born and raised in McLemoresville, Tenn.,
about 100 miles northeast of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is still home
</P>
<P>
   She spends several months a year in the Volunteer State,
fiddling with her home in Harrison (the one in the BellSouth
commercials) and filling up on Southern cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even, by the way, get her started on food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, I just plunge in! Bacon drippings. That's the
great thing to put in the skillet. I love fried catfish. I love
turnip greens cooked with a little fatback. I love a wonderful
crust on my cornbread that you cannot get without grease. Oh,
honey!
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have to break off an ear of corn in the garden,
run to the house while you're stripping the silk and throw it right
into the pot. If you do that, you don't need butter. Save that for
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes, lemon meringue pie. And icebox pudding. You know,
with black walnuts, not English. And sausage and country ham and
fresh stewed tomatoes. Oh, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my! How does she stay so thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoga,'' replies Carter, who released a workout video in 1992.
``And I don't eat that way in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous vittles though, ain't all she hankers for from her
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the kindness. Even from strangers, you'll hear `I'm
sorry' or `excuse me.' In an ordinary day _ at the supermarket, a
department store, a traffic snarlup _ people are polite and
considerate. I can't imagine being from anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in New York, you may get a punch in the kisser, but at
least you know where you stand. In California, though, there's this
surface adoration. `Have a good day!' `We love you!' Then you'll
hear later what was really said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, in the South, we talk about people, too,'' she
concedes. ``But if you end your comments with `bless her heart,'
you're off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Followed her big dreams
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a Southern belle with big-city ambition, moved to New
York in the early '60s. She had an English degree from then Memphis
State University (now the University of Memphis) and had been a hit
in college theater, but she yearned to sing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was four, I started dreaming that I'd perform at the
Met,'' recalls Carter, who listened to Metropolitan Opera radio
programs as a kid. ``I was sure that was my destiny. As I got older
I felt a little less secure because I started to realize that my
voice was not this enormous sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carter did have enormous presence, which didn't escape
Joseph Papp, founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that some of the biggest successes in New York were
country bumpkins because they were so unsophisticated, they'd try
anything. I began to think I was in some pretty tall cotton.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after her 1963 off-Broadway debut in ``A Winter's
Tale,'' the hazel-eyed brunette met her first husband, newspaper
publisher Arthur Carter. ``The day after I met him he sent me a
dozen dozen roses.'' (That's 144.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, y'all, his name was also Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember not wanting to get married because I didn't want to
change my last name,'' she says. ``Back then, you didn't think
about another option. So I became Dixie Virginia Carter Carter.
Talk about luck!''
</P>
<P>
   After about eight years, though, her luck ran out _ at least
where Arthur was concerned. So Dixie left her husband and took her
two daughters, Ginna and Mary Dixie (now 28 and 26), to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out to L.A. scared to pieces, but I just kept plugging.
I couldn't very well live off my ex-husband for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter quickly found an agent, a TV job and a new man.
</P>
<P>
   A brief second marriage to actor George Hearn followed in 1978,
along with her first TV sitcom role, April Baxter on CBS's ``On Our
Own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Designing Women'' a hit
</P>
<P>
   Then came small parts on ``Out of the Blue,'' ``Filthy Rich,''
``Diff'rent Strokes'' and finally, her big break: ``Designing
Women'' from 1986-93.
</P>
<P>
   Carter never lost her Southern accent, though, unless a role
demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, people who went North and lost their
accents were considered turncoats,'' she says. ``That was never
actually spelled out, but the implication was that if they talked
different, they weren't proud of where they'd come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride, obviously, was never much of a problem for Carter. Until,
that is, she met actor Hal Holbrook, now 73, on the 1981 set of the
CBS flick ``The Killing of Randy Webster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I blushed. I was totally strange. I was humiliated and
embarrassed, and I was sure he could tell I'd lost my cool,'' she
recalls. ``I figured he'd think I was Southern phony. Super polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I ended up with the flu, and I was so sick I didn't care.
I started to relax, and he started to laugh at me.''
</P>
<P>
   And fall in love with her. The pair married three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Universal themes
</P>
<P>
   Whether she ran a fever because of Holbrook or the flu, she's
not sure. But tales like these, Carter says, unite everyone _
regardless of where you're from or what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about show business in my act because that
experience is particular to me,'' she says, referring to her
cabaret show. ``I talk about love lost and love found. Innocence
lost and innocence reclaimed. Families. Childhood memories ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Has saucy Dixie Carter, aka Julia Sugarbaker, softened up a
smidgen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to like aggressive tactics,'' she replies.
``The nice people of the world, those who were raised as I was, do
not get up and yell and scream. So yes, I speak my mind, but in a
gracious way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentility is a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   BOX

 &HT;    Sensitivity alert: Classes dissect world of -isms
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Think you're pretty sensitive? Not if
you commit linguism. Yes, linguism, yet another new, politically
correct buzz phrase: It means prejudice or discrimination against
people who speak another language.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the next time you're staring (or glaring) at an
uncomprehending store clerk from Pakistan or a cabdriver from Iran.
One false grunt, and you could be accused of being a . . .
linguist?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a capital offense, so far, but it's enough to set off
Ilene Allgood's diversity radar. ``People are pretty closed to
foreigners,'' she says. ``Even if they're trying to learn the
language, we're impatient with them.''
</P>
<P>
   You think Allgood should keep her lectures to herself?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Allgood is the new assistant regional director of the
Anti-Defamation League. She's also in charge of education there.
One of her major goals is to bring the ADL's diversity programs to
more people in more places, particularly schools.
</P>
<P>
   So, there's a good chance that even if you don't hear from her,
your kids will. She'd rather talk to them anyway. ``Adults are used
to being comfortable,'' she says. ``Most kids are more receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   What they're receptive to are the lessons of ``diversity
education,'' the latest twist on what used to be called sensitivity
training. Maybe you call it something that can't be printed here.
</P>
<P>
   By whatever name, the idea is that most of us can learn to work
and even live harmoniously with people of different ethnic
backgrounds, colors, religions and sexual preferences with a little
reprogramming.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that sort of thing vanished with the '80s, but
it didn't. Increasingly complex laws and court rulings have kept
the heightened sensitivity business booming, and the ADL has been
at or near the fore.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to thousands of corporate employees, police officers
and bureaucrats, the ADL estimates nationally that it has trained
more than 110,000 teachers, who have passed along what they learned
to more than a million students. Their job is to spread the message
to others.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the message?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a right to your attitudes,'' Allgood says. ``The
problem is when you act. We don't tell you that you have to like
everyone. But you can't discriminate or break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a tad more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL's World of Difference Institute hones its programs to
fit a variety of settings: a workplace of difference; a campus of
difference; a classroom of difference. (You get the idea: we're all
different!)
</P>
<P>
   Brochures for each are illustrated by PC-perfect pictures of
smiling participants.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unreal, until Allgood offers a real-life illustration
when she brings her training program to the Adult Education Center
in West Palm Beach. There, crowded into Room 403, is the new
portrait of America, spanning several continents and the entire
skin-tone palette.
</P>
<P>
   These approximately 30 students, ranging from late teens to
mid-60s, were chosen by their teachers because they appear to be
class leaders capable of replicating the exercises with other
students. Most are working toward high school equivalency diplomas.
They're from Peru, Haiti, Colombia, Korea, Finland, and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of white, native-born Americans are very much the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone appears to be as happy as the people in the brochures,
but it's a little hard to tell: Most don't speak much English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were well-educated, professional people in their own
countries, but here, they're the ones who don't get the job or the
apartment,'' Allgood explains. ``This should help give them
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Allgood tackles the two-day seminar with help from two
experienced trainers, Morris McDaniel and Miriam Lorenzo. McDaniel
is certain this will be an easier audience than the cops he's used
to dealing with. (``There's a reason we don't let them bring their
guns into the room.'')
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel conducts a lesson in the vocabulary of prejudice by
asking the class to supply definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotype? ``When you tell people you're from Colombia, they
think you smuggle drugs,'' says a Colombian student.
Discrimination? ``No one will deliver pizza to my house in Riviera
Beach,'' another offers.
</P>
<P>
   When he asks about racism, a Peruvian interrupts with a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What race I am?''
</P>
<P>
   Others jump in, all wondering about this peculiar American
insistence on ethnic labeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me: `You're Hispanic, but are you white
Hispanic or black Hispanic?' '' says Yohanka Cabezas. ``Why do they
care? I tell them, `You're looking at me. You decide.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's little lecturing, and white males sensitive to being
demonized would hear little to wince about.
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, the ``linguism'' matter.
</P>
<P>
   Allgood offers the term in response to a Haitian grocery cashier
who says she's often taunted by a co-worker because of her accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not have to accept a hostile work environment,''
McDaniel explains.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the workshop also offers examples of why
multilingual endeavors lead to frustration.
</P>
<P>
   When Lorenzo leads an outdoor exercise that requires
participants to move from place to place depending on their
answers, she finds many simply follow others.
</P>
<P>
   And when she asks who would feel uncomfortable working with
people of another race, Peter Hiltunen, who arrived from Finland a
month before, steps out boldly. His movement is so sure, his answer
so much in the minority, that he is asked to tell the class more
about his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say,'' he answers. ``I don't speak well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lorenzo moves on, Hiltunen asks someone behind him to
repeat Lorenzo's original question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' he says. ``I thought she asked if you are
comfortable, not uncomfortable. I gave the wrong answer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cabezas, though, the class is an American marvel. It is not
only her first lesson about diversity, it is her first experience
with it. After leaving Cuba, her family moved to Idaho and has been
in Florida for just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cuba, I was with Cubans,'' she says. ``In Idaho, we were
the only Cubans. This is really the first time I met so many
different people from different places. I was afraid, but now I'm
not. I felt confident in this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Allgood had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   How sensitive are you? Here are some terms the ADL uses in
diversity training, with abbreviated definitions:
</P>
<P>
   _ STEREOTYPE: A stereotype is a preconceived or oversimplified
generalization about an entire group of people without regard for
individual differences. Although not always negative, stereotypes
always have a negative impact and can feed into discrimination.
Even when stereotypes are positive, the impact of stereotyping is
negative.
</P>
<P>
   _ PREJUDICE: Prejudice is a negative or hostile attitude toward
a person or group formed without just or sufficient knowledge and
based on negative stereotypes. Prejudice is the result of
``prejudgment'' and can lead to discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   _ DISCRIMINATION: Discrimination is the restrictive treatment of
a person or group based on prejudiced assumptions of group
characteristics, rather than on individual judgment. It is the
denial of justice prompted by prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   _ RACISM: Racism is prejudice or discrimination based on the
belief that race is the primary factor determining human traits and
abilities. Racism holds that genetic or inherited differences
produce the inherent superiority or inferiority of one race to
another. Institutional racism is racial prejudice supported by
institutional power and authority used to the advantage of one race
over others.
</P>
<P>
   _ RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY: Religious bigotry is prejudice or
discrimination against one or all members of a particular religious
group based on negative perceptions of their religious beliefs and
practices or on negative stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ANTI-SEMITISM: Anti-Semitism is prejudice or discrimination
against Jewish people, based on negative perceptions of their
religious beliefs and/or on negative group stereotypes.
Anti-Semitism can also be a form of racism, as when Nazis and
others consider Jews an inferior ``race.''
</P>
<P>
   _ SEXISM: Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on gender.
Like the other isms, sexism can be both personal and institutional.
</P>
<P>
   _ HETEROSEXISM: Heterosexism is prejudice against people who are
gay, lesbian or bisexual. Homophobia (fear of such persons) can
lead to discrimination and violence against homosexuals or people
perceived to be gay, lesbian or bisexual.

 &HT;    `This is sort of the art of being a woman'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lesley Friedman is a self-made woman.
She created a temporary-lawyer business in New York, sold it and
became a multimillionaire, then retired early and moved to Palm
Beach, Fla., four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then she took a look at herself.
</P>
<P>
   She never had the time before, she says. She and other women at
the law firm had purposely dressed conservatively, even matronly.
She got manicures when she remembered to, and she let her naturally
curly hair be. Makeup and styling really didn't make a difference,
she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes on dates, I would wear my business suit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She was too busy to bother. ``I had the attitude of, `This is
me, successful and smart. People are going to like me no matter how
I look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She never married. When she retired, she realized that the
young, natural look starts to go in the mid-30s. And if she was
going to take the trouble to correct it, she figured, wouldn't it
be nice to have someone around to admire the work?
</P>
<P>
   So, a year and a half ago, she got started. She lost 25 pounds
on a variety of diets and hired a New York fashion consultant at
$100 an hour. She shipped her entire wardrobe by UPS to New York,
and the consultant threw almost everything out. Friedman, nervous,
learned to get used to low-cut necklines and tight pants. For the
first time in her life, she teetered on stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   As she changed she tackled dating, to a degree (73 blind dates
in one year) that the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page feature
story about her new ``job.'' She got hundreds of calls, some very
odd, but also a book deal. The topic: ``How I'm using my business
skills to find a mate.'' There's talk of a movie, and if that comes
about she wouldn't mind Meg Ryan in the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   She's finding, though, that her transformation is neither
complete nor permanent, and it certainly isn't cheap. It takes
hours of maintenance, and last week she was willing to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   With classical music playing softly and a vanilla aromatherapy
candle flickering, she lies back in a chair at Deborah Koepper's
Palm Beach salon and waits for her newest treatment, a light
electric current that is supposed to tone the facial muscles _ at
$75 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman is refreshingly open. The only thing she keeps quiet
about is where she gets waxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I didn't care about this s---,'' she says.
``But when things started happening to me, it got really
bothersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman lives alone in Palm Beach and travels often to New York
or California, where she grew up in a Los Angeles suburb and
skipped dating to study.
</P>
<P>
   When in town, she spends her days working out at Mar-a-Lago,
visiting the salon, dating, going to parties, working on her book
and wondering if she started all of this a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman won't quite reveal her age. ``That's like asking a man
about his net worth,'' she says. She only admits to 37 and told the
Wall Street Journal she only admits to 39.
</P>
<P>
   Size is easier. She is a 6 or 8 on top and a 8 to 10 on the
bottom, and she still wants to lose another 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With the weight loss and the straightened and colored hair and
the dental work and the contact lenses, she looks nothing like her
driver's license photo anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She walks into the salon in slim black pants and a peach-colored
scarf around her neck one day, and the next she comes in wearing a
lime-colored tank minidress. ``I wouldn't have worn this dress
before,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her New York fashion consultant, Sheila Grant, remembers meeting
Friedman with her ``sacky'' dresses and her ``long, kind of bushy''
hair. ``She had no real sense of fashion or style, to be honest
about it,'' Grant says. ``As much as she was sort of reluctant, it
was a very exciting process.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a tall blonde who admits to having had a face lift at 47,
is used to seeing women like Friedman. ``Many, many women wake up
at age 40 and say, `My God, I don't have a life.' It's a panic
button. For Leslie, she had made all this money and was wonderful
and independent, but she wanted a personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   After dumping most of Friedman's clothes, Grant took her on a
three-day shopping spree for a 77-piece fall and winter wardrobe,
and even went with her to the hairdresser. In that first year,
Friedman spent into the six-figure range on clothes alone.
</P>
<P>
   Grant would dress her for her dates, and the two still talk
nearly every other day. Last week, Friedman needed to a buy a coat
for a romantic weekend in the Hamptons, and Grant described what
she needed over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Friedman thought the clothes were too young, too sexy.
``I want to be taken very seriously, for my brains,'' she says. But
she squeezed into the 3-inch stilettos and the strapless cocktail
dresses just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still fiddle,'' she says, ``but I try not to do it in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Her seasonal wardrobes are bought to mix and match. For one
season, she says, they bought four pairs of tight pants, three
cashmere turtleneck sweaters and four blazers. The spring corner of
her walk-in closet is full of lime greens and peaches, which go
well with her skin tone, and the usual black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Grant taught her to wear long jackets (``You're hippy''), high
heels with pants and low-cut tops (``I have a good chest'').
Friedman used to buy what was trendy or cute. Now she gets what
flatters her body shape, and when it doesn't she has learned to use
a tailor.
</P>
<P>
   She shops at Luca Luca, Escada, Celine, and Armani, but she can
walk just as easily into Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and the Gap.
``You can find a copy of an Armani at Ann Taylor,'' Friedman says.
And she goes to Nine West for ``great knockoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   About accessories, she knew zip. ``I didn't understand you don't
take a purse like this out at night,'' she says, pointing to her
beige Charles Jourdan bag. She went to Books-A-Million and bought a
book on how to tie a scarf, and packs about 15 scarves when she
travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the French women do it,'' she says, as she gets a
pedicure. ``They spend a fortune on accessories, and clothes-wise
they have just a few pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   She switches chairs, tissue paper stuffed between her toes, to
get her blow dry and manicure done simultaneously. At 11 a.m., two
hours after walking into the salon, the blow dry is over and the
base coat is on. ``I'm going to be here three hours today,'' she
says, marveling at the time. ``It's ridiculous. But I'm not gonna
cut back.''
</P>
<P>
   She grabs a phone. Usually she checks her messages, or chats, or
plans what clothes she will pack for an upcoming trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is flying to New York for a date? Wow, it must be
nice!'' Deborah Koepper says to Friedman, preparing her for makeup.
</P>
<P>
   She dabs on concealer _ ``She had the facial yesterday, so her
face is nice and plump and moisturized'' _ and peach-colored blush,
to show off Friedman's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All Friedman will have to do the rest of the day, Koepper says,
is touch up her Glossy Maple lipstick (Koepper's own brand). And
she's right _ lipstick is usually the only makeup Friedman carries
in her purse.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items for her weekend getaway are already laid out
on the table in her living room. Among the jewelry is a copy of
``Chic Simple's What Should I Wear?'' She's more confident in her
judgment now, but a little help is nice.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, not finished with her changes. ``She's not
willing to accept any imperfections now,'' Grant says. They consult
about getting her ``undereyes'' done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like this is my creative expression,'' Friedman
explains. ``Before, I was doing nothing, just being casual. But
this is sort of the art of being a woman.''

 &HT;    Bit by bit, Lamott has forged a vision of humane spirituality
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anne Lamott, author of the quirky new ``Traveling
Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith,'' is reverent in a free-spirit,
leftist-liberal, recovering-addict, single-mom kind of way. She
doesn't walk gently toward a state of grace; she ``staggers.'' She
doesn't have a leap of faith; she has a ``lurch.'' And if religion
and humor are not traditionally interwoven, well, they should be,
says the 44-year-old California author and online essayist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think being religious means that you can't also be
funny,'' Lamott says. ``And if God's not funny, then I'm not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamott wrote four novels before her first book of nonfiction _
``Operating Instructions,'' a journal of her son's first year _
sold 100,000 copies in 1993. A year later, her second book of
nonfiction, ``Bird by Bird,'' sold 200,000 copies. Subtitled ``Some
Instructions on Writing and Life,'' that book made her something of
a cult figure among writers and readers _ ``a rock idol of the
literary world,'' one bookseller put it _ and made it possible for
her to quit teaching weekly writing classes, cleaning houses,
teaching tennis, waitressing and writing restaurant reviews. In
1997, she began writing biweekly essays for the hip online magazine
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Through those essays and her nonfiction books, readers have
followed Lamott through the death of her father, the birth of her
son, Sam (now 9 1/2), the death of her best friend, her eating
disorder, drug and alcohol addictions, loves lost quickly or
endured too long, rampant neuroses, bad thigh days and religious
epiphanies. Clean and sober since 1986, the writer has learned to
bow her dreadlocked head and prey on the insecurities that once
threatened to destroy her. From her home near San Francisco _ which
she shares with her son, a dog, a cat, an iguana and a goldfish _
she took a few minutes to talk about her ``very ordinary'' life,
her inspiration and her ``Traveling Mercies,'' a uniquely Lamottian
mix of painful insight and laugh-out-loud confessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a single interesting theological thought in my
head,'' Lamott says. ``I don't understand very much, and I don't
have a position I want to get people to. All I can do is tell
people my own truth and my own version of things, and that tends to
come out kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it help or hurt a writer to actually have some financial
success?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it makes life a lot easier. It's a relief not to always
be sweating where the rent's coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your daily writing routine?
</P>
<P>
   A: I try to sit down at the same time every morning _ 9 o'clock
_ and work until about 11:30. Then I stop and take a break until
about 1. I'll walk my dog, eat, catch up and hang out, check in on
the impeachment proceedings. ... Then I work until a quarter to 3,
when I leave to pick up my son from school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has motherhood changed your writing?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's certainly a lot more efficient before you have children,
when you're only responsible for yourself. But it so profoundly
changed me as a person, in terms of changing the whole geography of
my heart and my spirituality ... it gave me a depth that I was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the idea for ``Traveling Mercies'' come about?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been on a book tour every year since 1993, and
everywhere I went people were really glad to talk about writing,
but I noticed that they also really wanted to ask me about faith,
to tell me about their own faith or to express appreciation that
somebody on the left was a person of faith, that somebody who was
not conservative or Moral Majority was talking out loud about God
and faith and religion. I just started to feel there was a real
hunger in the world _ even in the reading world _ for somebody like
me to talk about these things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of things do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A: I used to read really wonderful, esoteric, fresh new voices
... and then I had a kid. ... I'm secretly looking forward to the
new John Grisham _ none of my friends would ever cop to reading
John Grisham. I just finished reading ``King of the Gypsies,'' a
25-year-old book by Peter Maas, and I'm reading ``The Orchid
Thief'' by Susan Orlean. ... And I read The New Yorker and the New
York Observer religiously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concept of family _ in the broadest possible sense _ has
always seemed important to you. Have there always been people
around you to serve that function?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always understood that the secret of life is friendship.
Everything else can come and go, but if you have a strong community
of support around you, your fortunes can change and you'll still be
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The chapter on your aging mother in ``Traveling Mercies''
surely will touch a chord with a lot of readers. That had to be
difficult to write.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was difficult to write, and it was difficult for her to
read. Our relationship is imperfect and it always was. ... I'm not
like my mother much at all, but I'm very devoted to her and have
put a lot of time into this relationship. It's just what it is. ...
I think she was really grateful for a daughter who could tell the
truth and love her and be loved by her for what is rather than for
the great fantasies we had all those years _ what it should be
like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're obviously very close to your son, whom you write so
much about. Does he have any problem with people knowing so many
details of his life?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always check with him before I write something. I make sure
he doesn't mind, to cover myself in any future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, what inspires you as a writer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's wonderful when writers tell the truth and help
me understand life a little more. I try to do that myself. ... When
a writer makes me laugh or catches me by surprise, that always
inspires me to do it myself.

   VEGAS-BELLAGIO _ LAS VEGAS _ Every major hotel in Las Vegas has
a theme, whether it's Hollywood glitz at the MGM Grand or ancient
Egypt at the Luxor. At the Bellagio _ a 3,005-room
hotel/casino/entertainment complex that is Las Vegas' grandest
project to date _ the theme may be best described as ``high
class.'' Developer Steven Wynn clearly intends to outclass his
neighbors with such offerings as an art gallery filled with the
works of European masters, a permanent multimillion theater built
for Cirque de Soleil's underwater production ``O,'' and the most
dazzling line-up of restaurants this desert city has seen.
Near-replicas of the finest eateries of New York (Le Cirque and
Osteria del Circo), San Francisco (Aqua) and Boston (Olives) are
just the beginning. The jewel in the crown is Picasso, where $37
million of the Spanish's master's work hangs on the walls and San
Francisco's most celebrated chef cooks full time. You can spend a
glorious few days at Bellagio _ dining, gaming, viewing art _
without once stepping outdoors. (Kessler, Atlanta

truth is it has just as many nickel slots and dollar roulette
wheels as any casino in town. We'll take a look at the chioces for
gaming in Bellagio. And has it been a while since you last dropped
a quarter in a slot machine? Then you may be surprised by the
bells, whistles and high-tech video screens of today's slots.

resembled television's Cleavers and role models never went into
drug rehab.
</P>
<P>
   The former history teacher at College Park High School also
remembers how much fear and prejudice bubbled beneath that veneer
of normalcy. AIDS was unknown then, but in the years before Jonas
Salk's vaccine, polio was a mysterious disease that struck terror
in the hearts of families every summer.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of fear, mingled with the magical innocence of a
1950s childhood, is the theme of Devoto's debut novel, ``My Last
Days as Roy Rogers'' (Warner, $20).
</P>
<P>
   Set in Alabama in 1954 _ the last ``polio summer'' _ the novel
chronicles the coming of age of Tab Rutland, a headstrong
10-year-old white girl who chooses the celluloid cowboy as her
ideal. With her black playmate, Maudie May, Tab uncovers a scandal
involving stolen money intended for polio victims and exposes a
racial injustice as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-publication review, Booklist magazine describes Devoto
as ``writing as if she were the literary love child of Harper Lee
and Mark Twain.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the book grew out of a long-ago conversation Devoto
had with her mother about the AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my mother what, if anything, in our lifetime had been
comparable to the fear of AIDS,'' Devoto recalls. ``She immediately
said, `The polio summers in the late '40s and early '50.'''
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Devoto went to the library the next day to research
the period. And, although she had never written more than a couple
of short stories, she began taking notes for a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing started right after I divorced about nine years
ago,'' says Devoto, 59. ``The more I read about polio, the more I
found that my mother had not been exaggerating. During a polio
summer, the movies might close, the pools always closed, and rumors
ran rampant. If someone came down with polio, parents wanted to
know what had they eaten the night before and who had they been
playing with? People lived in dread every summer that there was an
outbreak in their town.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman told her about being raised in Oklahoma, where her
father was a doctor. ``She said she would never forget the night
her father came home and had her mother burn all the clothes he had
on because one of his patients had died of polio that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Other families would use antiseptic throat spray and wear
surgical masks whenever they drove through a town where there had
been a polio outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Devoto's sister, Joanne Walker, 63, recalls how scared she and
her friends would get if they got a sore throat, since the early
symptoms of polio resembled those of a cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towns used to spray DDT to try to control the outbreaks,''
says Walker, a free-lance writer who lives near Auburn, Ala. ``We
had no idea DDT was harmful. All we knew was that it was yellow
dust, and we were warned that it might stain our clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker says her sister asked her what she remembered about those
summers, but she had no idea Devoto was writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she asked me to read it, I said to myself, `Oh, Lord, I
don't want to do this.' She had never shown an interest in writing
and I expected the worse. I was reading Lee Smith and a lot of
Southern writers at the time, but I put their books aside and read
Pat's. I was amazed. I told her, `This is it,' but since I was her
sister, she took my opinion with a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Devoto sold the manuscript to a small press in Alabama, but
financial problems forced them to reconsider. Then, last May, she
got a call from her agent telling her that Warner had bought the
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thrilling,'' Devoto says, ``but I had no idea how much
more work there was to be done. I had written it in first person,
present tense, and they wanted me to do it in past tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now on the road to promote the book, Devoto says she has been
surprised by the strong reaction to the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has memories about those summers,'' she says. ``The
stories aren't so much about polio as they are about the fear that
the disease caused. But then, that's really one of the main themes
of the book, how fear convolutes our lives.''

&HT;     HEARST AND WOMEN.COM ANNOUNCE NEW ONLINE VENTURE FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Women.com Networks and Hearst New Media &AMP; Technology,
a wholly owned unit of The Hearst Corporation, announced Thursday
that they are forming a joint venture that will own and operate the
largest online network for women.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Women.com Networks will each own approximately 50
percent of the new enterprise, which will include the Women.com
network and the HomeArts.com network.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture will be called Women.com Networks and will
enjoy the highest reach among women's sites, with 6 percent of the
Internet audience as measured by Media Metrix, and well over 4
million women each month.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief executive officer of
The Hearst Corporation, said, ``Both HomeArts and Women.com have
built impressive and promising online franchises. The combination
of the companies will provide women with the largest and most
comprehensive portfolio of services and brands anywhere on the Web.
We believe that Hearst's strong magazine brands have been and will
continue to be a powerful attraction to women on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture will have distribution rights for the Hearst
women's magazine sites; promotion in Hearst's leading women's
magazines; on-air promotion from Hearst's television properties and
interests (which include Lifetime, A&AMP;E, The History Channel, and
the Hearst-Argyle group of network-affiliated television stations);
capital; and Astronet, the world's leading online astrology site

Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Women.com and HomeArts ``will deliver
increased value to our audience, as well as to the advertisers who
want to reach women _ the most important market on the Web,''
McDaniel said. ``The cross media synergies that Hearst brings to
the venture add an exciting new dimension to the new Women.com
Networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Sikes, president of Hearst New Media &AMP; Technology, predicted
that the joint venture ``will create a new standard for destination
sites on the Internet, securing leadership in serving both
consumers and advertisers.''

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THIS CASH COW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is possible that you were so preoccupied exhaling a huge sigh
of relief that Dennis Rodman is going back to work that you missed
the story of Lucy the cow.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy is an 8-year-old Holstein (for all you bovine-challenged
folks, that is a make of cow, sort of like a Chevy Vega, only with
better acceleration) who lives at La-Foster Farm in Rowan County,
N.C. Lucy made (small) headlines recently for (possibly) setting a
new international record for milk production in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmer Terry Foster and his wife, Sarah, said Lucy
produced 75,275 pounds of milk in a 365-day period. For those of
you who don't buy your milk by the pound, that translates to 8,753
gallons, or an average of almost 24 gallons of milk each day.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Lucy was feeling particularly generous and produced
nearly 30 gallons of milk, which is 5 times what other Vegas -
excuse me, Holsteins - usually produce.
</P>
<P>
   I will admit at the outset that I am not an agricultural kind of
guy. In fact, the only knowledge I could share with you about dairy
farms is that you should roll up your window when you drive by one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even someone who thought 2-percent milk came from
2-percent cows can be deeply impressed and humbled by Lucy's
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The question, to me, is not how but why Lucy produced so much
milk. Does she come from a long line of overachievers? Do the
Fosters offer perks, like extra hay or, perhaps, monogrammed
bathrobes to cows that go the extra mile, or quart, as the case may
be? Or has the whole Monica Lewinsky thing got Lucy so upset that
she's producing extra milk simply as a means of relieving her
anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   (There was no mention in The Associated Press story as to
whether Lucy is a Democrat or Republican, nor does it say how North
Carolina cows, as a group, feel about impeachment. By my guess is
that they've been subjected to Clinton-like behavior many times
around the barn yard and consider it no big deal.)
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Lucy does what she does very well, and she
does it without drawing a lot of attention to herself, which is
refreshing in these days of overexposed celebrities. Although Lucy
had the kind of year at the milking machine that Mark McGwire had
at the plate, she has not hired an agent, asked to be traded to a
bigger-market dairy farm nor signed an endorsement contract with a
major shoe company.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse - and you can put me down in the ``for
better'' column - dairy cows, even record-setting dairy cows - are
not as popular as professional athletes. When, for example, was the
last time you saw 70,000 people pack a stadium to watch a cow eat
grass? While it could be argued that such a spectacle would be more
exciting that your average Super Bowl, the fact remains that dairy
farming, like World Cup soccer, has thus far failed to generate
much interest among average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucy delivered her world-record 8,753rd gallon of milk,
fans did not fight each other for the plastic jug like they did for
Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball. When Lucy heads to the barn
after a hard day of cud-chewing, she isn't besieged by hordes of
autograph-seekers. Whether this is because dairy cows are uncool or
because autograph-seekers are averse to getting their shoes dirty
is hard to say; all I know is Lucy has thus far escaped writer's
cramp from signing too many T-shirts and visors.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is unsung, Lucy's accomplishment is every bit as
amazing as McGwire's. If you think it's hard hitting a 500-foot
home run, try producing 30 gallons of milk in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Way to go, Lucy. You earned your extra hay, and your monogrammed
bathrobe, too.
</P>
<P>

CORD BLOOD COULD SAVE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Feb. 4)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my daughter was born a few years ago, I had heard about a
new procedure that involved donating umbilical cord blood to help
cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I might, I couldn't get any of my doctors interested in
it. I mentioned it to my ob/gyn, my pediatrician, and finally, the
hospital nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anybody collect umbilical cord blood around here?'' I
finally said during labor, as a last-ditch attempt. ``They can have
ours if they need it.'' Everyone looked at me with amusement, as if
women in labor were always blurting out odd questions like that.
</P>
<P>
   So, I figured the procedure was either too expensive, or there
were enough women having babies around that when and if these stem
cells are needed, doctors just pop into a delivery ward and talk
someone into making a spontaneous donation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two years down the road, my daughter's only trace
of an umbilical cord is a very cute belly button that she likes to
have tickled while hanging upside down.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure is getting a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few headlines I've clipped over the past month: ``Study:
Umbilical cord blood can save cancer victims.'' ``A Birthday Gift:
a new medial technology _ the use of umbilical cord blood,'' and
``Umbilical Cord is Link to Survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but several of the articles suggest banking your
own baby's blood, in case he or she needs it later.
</P>
<P>
   So, I started researching it, just so I could feel REALLY bad
about not banking Adam or Sarah's baby blood.
</P>
<P>
   And here's what I found.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of parents are doing this. In fact, it's becoming
positively trendy. Private banks are springing up all over,
charging $1,200 to $1,500 and then another $100 or so a year as a
storage fee. The families are looking up the frozen blood as
``biological insurance policies,'' in case siblings or other family
members need it for bone-marrow transplants to fight leukemia or
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have public banks that will store donated umbilical
cord blood, which will be available to anyone in the world who
needs it.
</P>
<P>
   The first cord blood transplant was successfully performed in
Paris in 1988. Since then, more than 1,500 umbilical cord stem cell
transplants have taken place, according to the National Institutes
of Health. Cord blood is high in stem cells, the building blocks of
the blood and immune system. The blood is retrieved by inserting a
needle into the vein of the cord after delivery, and drawing out
about 2 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't everyone do it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, like most things that go with parenting, it isn't that
clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in cord-blood transplants say most parents shouldn't
spend the money to store their newborn's cord blood.
</P>
<P>
   The blood would be a last option for the child, should he or she
get sick later, because the relapse rate is much higher when a
person's own stem cells are used in transplants.
</P>
<P>
   And the chances that the blood will ever be needed by someone in
your own family are 1 in 10,000, says Dr. Paul Root Wolpe, or the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money to be made in autologous blood storage
and quite a lot of overselling is occurring,'' said Wolpe, who
co-authored the article, ``Ethical Issues in Umbilical Cord Blood
Banking'' in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception, he says, would be families who already have
a child with leukemia or some other disease that may eventually
require a transplant. Siblings have a one in four chance of
matching their brother or sister's cord blood. For families with
ill siblings, most public banks will collect, process and store the
cord blood for free.
</P>
<P>
   Also, families who donate umbilical cord blood to public banks _
at no charge to the donor _ could use the blood later as needed _
as long as the cord blood wasn't matched to another family first.
</P>
<P>
   For information on family banking of cord blood with the Cord
Blood Registry, or for an application to donate to the Cord Blood
Donor Foundation (dedicated to banking a mixed ethnicity bank of
cord blood stem cells) call 888-CORDBLOOD, or find information on
the Web at www.cordblood.com.

   IMPEACH-CLASS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Professor Martin Edelman welcomes
more than 100 students to ``Sex, Lies and Impeachment,'' a course
where the hallowed edicts of the Constitution mingle freely with
the murky realities of politics. The State University of New York
at Albany class examines current events, even the salacious ones,
as they're unfolding. By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   FAILING-STUDENTS (Albany, N.Y.) _ It sounds simple enough: If
you fail in school, you don't promote. But when President Clinton
raised the idea of a national policy to end so-called ``social
promotion,'' educators say he oversimplified an issue far more
complex than the either-or proposition of promoting or holding back
students. By JAY JOCHNOWITZ.

   SF-LOBBYISTS (San Francisco) _ The lobbying business has
exploded under Mayor Willie Brown as corporate and other interests
doubled their spending _ to more than $3.3 million a year _ on
hired guns at City Hall, records show. The bulk of the money,
described alternately as a scourge on democracy or the welcome
by-product of robust times, has gone to a trio of lobbyists with
close ties to the local Democratic establishment. By CHUCK FINNIE.

   BOOK-INTERVIEW-BALL (San Francisco) _ Promoting the paperback

this time around. ``The crowds are bigger,'' he says, ``and the
emotions are more developed, not as raw.'' By BERNADETTE FAY.

   SUPER-BOWL-ADS (Undated) _ Long after the game, the advertising
that airs during the Super Bowl will be remembered. Take Apple
Computer's ``1984'' ad, which presented an Orwellian vision of an
IBM-dominated world that not only predicted the personal computer
boom, but also set the Super Bowl as the ultimate advertising
stage. By MARK McGUIRE. (For release Sunday, Jan. 31.)
</P>
<P>
   SUPER-BOWL-FOOD (Undated) _ The first commandment for hosting a
Super Bowl party is one worth memorizing: Keep it simple. Sunday is
not an occasion for spending hours in the kitchen putting together
tasty dishes that will wow your friends. It's a day for simple fare
_ like chip dip. By DOUG BLACKBURN.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-CRIME (San Francisco) _ To help the old-school
detectives on the critically acclaimed ``Homicide: Life on the
Street'' navigate through the intricacies of an on-line crime
investigation, ``Homicide'' writers turned to Alex Wellen and Luke
Reiter, two young lawyers who host the ``CyberCrime TV'' broadcast

   SAVEUR-COOKS (Undated) _ Heaven on a bun is a bacon

people's lives, Andrews and his Saveur colleagues have crafted
``Saveur Cooks Authentic American'' (Chronicle Books, $40). By DAI

<P>
   FBN-SUPER-ANDERSON (Miami) _ Jamal Anderson of the Atlanta
Falcons is basking in the warmth and shine of joining the Denver
Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. Two seasons ago, his first as a
starter in the National Football League, the Falcons went 3-13. ``I
enjoy the situation we're in right now,'' Anderson says. ``There
are no bad days for Jamal Anderson.'' By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-SUPER-BUCHANAN (Miami) _ Ray Buchanan arrived at just the
right time, etching himself between the this-coach-hates-that-coach
angle and the actual kickoff of Super Bowl XXXIII. He's a shot of
inspiration, a compelling character in a week when just about
anything is considered interesting. He's fresh, and that counts for
plenty because the Super Bowl gets stale long before it ever
begins.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-RANKINGS (San Francisco) _ David Duval's 59 made history
Sunday at the Bob Hope, and now it may even change history. It's
that 59, combined with the number ``2'', that has PGA Tour players
and fans conspiring to overthrow the World Golf Rankings, which
have Tiger Woods in the top spot this week and Duval at No. 2,
11.58 points to 11.38. By SUSAN FORNOFF.
</P>
<P>
   HKO-HOCKEY-SLUMP (Philadelphia) _ Four years ago, hockey was
labled as the sport of the '90s and beyond. Yet television ratings
of hockey have fallen and a recent survey shows that golf may
overtake the puck as the nation's No. 4 sport. Until hockey is
accepted into the mainstream, it will be a hard climb. By PETE
DOUGHERTY.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ You want to exorcise someone? Try
Kenneth Starr. Starr isn't evil on a grand scale, unless you're
looking at him from the president's perspective. But he's foremost
among those I'd try to exorcise, just to see what fly-sized angels
of darkness flutter out. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ For years now, pro-choice
advocates have tried to drive home a truth about the violence that
is inflicted on abortion providers and their clinics. Last week,
Hillary Rodham Clinton called it was it is _ terrorism. By

   I keep wondering about the AGM-130. That's the missile that went
astray last week and into a residential neighborhood in Basra,
Iraq, reportedly killing 11 civilians and giving Saddam Hussein a
soapbox for his rantings.
</P>
<P>
   That the Pentagon admits we may have made a mistake means that
we did make a mistake. A mea culpa does not bring back the dead,
heal the wounded or silence Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   My knowledge of missiles is limited to those I was involved with
on firing ranges in the New Mexico desert during and just after the
Korean War, where I was a radar operator. Nothing about the
missiles was accurate in those days and, apparently, they aren't
today, either.
</P>
<P>
   It was my later understanding that we had become so
sophisticated with our missile technology that we could thread a
needle on Mars with one of them.
</P>
<P>
   As we found out during Desert Storm and, more recently, Desert
Fox, we haven't totally mastered the field of ``pinpoint
accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the AGM-130, that rocket-propelled bomb that was
launched from an F-15 fighter. As soon as I heard of our possible
``error,'' I wanted to know if we could get our money back from the
Boeing Company, which manufactures them in Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we paid good money for those suckers _ and they ought
to work.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to hit something else, something without women
and children in it. Apparently, it went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release by Boeing as recently as Jan. 20 _ Basra was
hit Jan. 25 _ the manufacturer described the AGM-130 Standoff
Weapon System as a ``guidance, control and propulsion kit that
makes a 2,000 pound bomb `smart.' The weapon, operated by the U.S.
Air Force, uses a television or infrared seeker to enable an
aircraft's Weapon System Operator to guide the bomb to a specific
target aimpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   In reading other information gleaned from the Web, it became
quite apparent that the crew of the F-15 takes control of the
weapon, watches its course on TV and steers it to its target.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 30, 1997, Boeing news release reporting on the test of
an AGM-130 near Eglin AFB in Florida, the company said that as soon
as the weapon entered ``the terminal phase of its flight ... the
weapon system officer took control of the missile ... and manually
guided the weapon to impact on the target.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear then that while the missile might be
sophisticated, eventually a human gets his or her hands on it. And
it is that human who either can or cannot hit the side of a barn,
or in this case, perhaps did hit the side of the barn _ while
trying to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is an error and we are going to catch heat for it, from our
allies and, certainly, from our detractors and enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, we have been treated by high-ranking military
officers holding premature news conferences to tell us how we hit
all of our targets, only to find it had not been the case. I am not
astonished that we cannot thread a needle on Mars; I am astonished
that we have supposedly responsible people telling us that we are
doing just that but not using missiles in sensitive areas that
override potential human error.
</P>
<P>
   Put this in your memory bank: According to Boeing in June 1997,
the company has built or is on contract for more than 675 AGM-130
missiles for the U.S. Air Force inventory. I don't know how many
already have been expended over Iraq but I've got a problem with a
system, despite all its sophistication, that still relies on the
human element to guide it to a supposed pinpointed site.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who understands bureaucracies should know that the way to
get a cushy job isn't to make yourself desirable but to make
yourself undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, while we're suffering through a national crisis over
alleged favors to Lewinsky, the one person who clearly has enjoyed
a big payoff--at taxpayer expense--is Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was a secretary at the White House, a holdover from the
Bush administration. When she began to look like trouble, she was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Pentagon is no surprise. Although
conservatives who inveigh against overpaid, do-nothing federal
bureaucrats probably have in mind the Department of Health and
Human Services, if your urgent need is a government job in general,
rather than anything in particular that job might accomplish,
apparently the Pentagon is your best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a military force of one and a half million people, the
Defense Department employs about 800,000 civilians. Linda Tripp is
one of them, holding the position of public affairs specialist with
a civil service ranking of GS-15, Step 6. That puts the 49-year-old
high-school grad at the top of the Pentagon's middle management
ranks. Like all GS employees, she just received an
across-the-board-pay increase. Tripp's raise, including a
``locality'' adjustment for working in the Washington, D.C., area,
was 3.68 percent, bringing her salary to $94,098 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For which she does ...? Since March 1998, nothing. Although she
has supposedly been working at home, she was stripped of her
duties--but not her pay or her title--shortly after the scandal
broke. Tripp has characterized this as a politically motivated
``demotion.'' It will strike many as a demotion devoutly to be
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's title at the Pentagon was confidential
assistant to the assistant secretary for public affairs. Her job
was writing press releases, for which she was paid $33,000. Note
that Lewinsky got this job as a payoff for being undesirable to a
presidential aide, not for being desirable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Tripp is the public affairs specialist for a program
called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, an arguably
worthwhile annual propaganda effort that takes 60 civilian ``public
opinion leaders'' on a weeklong tour of military operations. Tripp
had primary responsibility for the paperwork involved in the
selection process, for making travel and hotel arrangements, as
well as for other logistic odds and ends such as the week's
kick-off banquet. According to the New York Times, before Tripp
took the job, this position was part-time.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for more detail, the person now doing Tripp's job
used the word ``coordinating'' a lot, but that was about it. There
is, it turns out, no official description of the job. Writing one
is among the tasks Tripp is being paid to perform now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are official descriptions of other GS-15 public
affairs specialist positions. For instance, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights is currently looking for someone to ``assist in the
reviews and analysis of numerous requests for speeches; to develop,
clear, release, and distribute a wide range of information and data
concerning the nature and objective of the Commission's programs;
(and to) prepare press releases, fact sheets, etc. and arrange
press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: PR grunt. Salary: $80,658 to $104,851.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get some sort of independent measure of what these
jobs are worth, I called Kelly Services, the nationwide temp
agency. Without mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon, I described her
job there to the woman at Kelly. Oh, she said, that's high-end
secretarial. How much would you have to pay somebody to do a job
like that, I asked. Oh, $18 to $25 an hour, she said. That's
$36,000 to $50,000 a year--roughly half of what Tripp is being paid
not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folks on duty in the skies over Iraq make about half
of what Linda Tripp makes. Indeed, Tripp pulls down more than all
but a handful of the U.S. military's most senior officers. She
earns more than a ballistic missile submarine commander and is on a
par with aircraft carrier skippers in the Persian Gulf and Army
generals ready to lead thousands of troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Bob Barr and Henry Hyde would say if Monica had got
a deal like that.

   Twenty-six years after man last set foot on the moon, a
grassroots movement is now under way to go back. Alan Binder, a
planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, wants to start factories
on the moon, churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks: the moon as
industrial park. David Gump, the former publisher of a
space-industry newsletter who has founded LunaCorp, wants to build
a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled from
Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade in an
amusement park somewhere. Should we study the moon, strip-mine it
or turn it into a theme park? Fred Guterl, a senior editor of
Discover magazine, reports.

   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb. Blood was the
first commodity on the market, and it is still the most commonly
sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn from $50 to
$500 per pint; those with rare blood types or components may get
more. Think of it as a commodities market for the 21st century,
reports free-lance writer and editor Karen Wright.

   ``On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye,'' writes neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor. ``I
got up to begin my morning routine and jumped onto my
cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would banish the throbbing
inside my head.'' But when she stopped exercising, she knew
something was wrong. ``When I held my hands up in front of my face,
I felt as though my consciousness was suspended somewhere between
normal reality and some esoteric space ... Time seemed to stand
still. I was disturbingly aware that the intricate networks that
operate the different functions of my mind were shutting down. I
tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next instant
my right arm went totally dead. In that moment I knew I was having
a stroke.'' Bolte Taylor describes in detail the events of that day
-- and how her life had changed.

   Twenty-six years after man last set foot on the moon, a
grassroots movement is now under way to go back. Alan Binder, a
planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, wants to start factories
on the moon, churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks: the moon as
industrial park. David Gump, the former publisher of a
space-industry newsletter who has founded LunaCorp, wants to build
a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled from
Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade in an
amusement park somewhere. Should we study the moon, strip-mine it
or turn it into a theme park? Fred Guterl, a senior editor of
Discover magazine, reports.

   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb. Blood was the
first commodity on the market, and it is still the most commonly
sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn from $50 to
$500 per pint; those with rare blood types or components may get
more. Think of it as a commodities market for the 21st century,
reports free-lance writer and editor Karen Wright.

   ``On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye,'' writes neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor. ``I
got up to begin my morning routine and jumped onto my
cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would banish the throbbing
inside my head.'' But when she stopped exercising, she knew
something was wrong. ``When I held my hands up in front of my face,
I felt as though my consciousness was suspended somewhere between
normal reality and some esoteric space ... Time seemed to stand
still. I was disturbingly aware that the intricate networks that
operate the different functions of my mind were shutting down. I
tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next instant
my right arm went totally dead. In that moment I knew I was having
a stroke.'' Bolte Taylor describes in detail the events of that day
-- and how her life had changed.

<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He
also knows firsthand how difficult it is to get the lunar bandwagon
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, Mendell and his colleagues spurred
NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

<P>
   There's a bank in central Boston that offers its customers a
unique investment opportunity. For an initial outlay of $2,500 and
yearly fees of $95, investors can realize returns of incalculable
value _ or, more often, no returns at all.
</P>
<P>
   The institution in question is Viacord, the nation's largest
commercial banker of blood from fetal umbilical cords. In recent
years cord blood has become something of a hot commodity, as
medical research has demonstrated its potential for treating
leukemia and certain immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Private bankers like Viacord can guarantee expectant parents
future access to their own baby's blood, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a match should the child or a relative someday need
to restore a crippled immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Viacord's 1,400-plus samples of frozen cord blood could
represent roughly $3.5 million in revenue for the company. But no
one knows what cord blood will be worth to the families who have
paid to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was the first commodity on the market, and it is still the
most commonly sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn
from $50 to $500 per pint; those with rare blood types or
components may get more.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Red Cross Societies and other international
organizations have expressed concern that the financial incentives
offered by the blood trade constitute a subtle form of coercion for
impoverished or otherwise disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about donor exploitation have not succeeded in
halting blood buying and selling. Part of the reason may be that,
in legal terms as well as popular perception, blood is more a body
``product'' than a body ``part.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which in 1984
banned interstate commerce in organs for transplant, specifically
excluded ``replenishable tissues such as blood or sperm'' from its
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   NOTA was passed in response to the transplant successes of the
late 1970s. Before the transplant act, there were cases of would-be
donors advertising for potential buyers, and of organ brokers
offering to match the two in exchange for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   While NOTA has shut down organ brokers here, however,
unregulated _ and poorly documented _ markets for organs are
believed to flourish elsewhere, mostly in India and Brazil. And
while the act prohibits traffic in organs for transplantation, it
allows such commerce if the body parts in question are to be used
in research or product development and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 businessman John Moore sued his doctor, the University
of California and several pharmaceutical companies for using,
without his consent, tissue from his cancerous spleen to create a
commercial cell line now valued by some at $3 billion in potential
profits. Moore lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the California Supreme Court ruled that patients do not
have property rights to their tissues, since granting such rights
would ``destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical
research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next of kin have a lot more authority over your dead body
than you have over your live body,'' says George Annas, professor
of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.
There are laws protecting the inviolability of cadavers but almost
none to protect what happens to tissues and organs removed from a
patient who's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complicated issues in body-shop policy is the
traffic in fetal parts, which are gleaned almost exclusively from
fetuses that have been electively aborted. (Miscarried or stillborn
fetuses tend to have defects and are harder to harvest).
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue has been a prized medical resource ever since
research demonstrated its potential for treating Parkinson's
disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as spinal-cord injuries
and hemophilia. Combined markets for cures of these diseases have
been estimated at more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when a company began in the mid-1980s to develop a treatment
involving transplanted fetal cells, right-to-life protests erupted,
and in 1988 Congress passed the only amendment to NOTA, extending
the act's restrictions to include fetal organs and tissues. Of
course, fetal body parts are still being collected for use in
research.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of the body-parts market prices the goods and
services for assisted reproduction. At present, money can buy sperm
($50 to $100), eggs (starting at $2,000), embryos (market value
varies), and a place to put them (gestational surrogates start at
$10,000, not including brokers' fees).
</P>
<P>
   The story of cord-blood banking may present an object lesson in
commercialization, though the moral of the story is not quite
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert has predicted that the average person's
chance of ever needing to use the blood banked is 1 in 200,000.
Nevertheless, the idea of cord-blood banking seems to be taking
off. More than a dozen companies, in addition to Viacord, now offer
banking services.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying. At first, Viacord's customers were mostly
families who had a present or foreseeable need for stem-cell
transplants. Now more than half of Viacord's families have no
apparent need for the blood at all.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of cord-blood banking maintain that they have turned a
medical waste product into a valuable resource. But critics of the
trafficking in human anatomy claim that no matter how many lives
are saved (or created), any such commerce inevitably violates the
sanctity of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, animals engineered with human genes and
tissues have already been patented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery, would seem to prohibit the
patenting of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a human part, or a part-human, become a
full-fledged person? The ever-expanding scope of biomedical
commerce is forcing answers to such improbable questions. As the
market races forward, issues that were once the province of the
very ill or the very thoughtful may soon become every body's
business.

 By JILL BOLTE TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But I could visualize how I did things before. And I believed
that if I held on to the memory of what it felt like to perform
basic actions, I could more quickly reestablish the connections
that had been broken before they completely deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years have passed since my stroke. Besides having a
beauty of a scar, I still have some cognitive impairment. I can
handle only elementary mathematical calculations, and when I'm
tired I have trouble finding the right word.
</P>
<P>

want to accomplish with the finite time I have.

<P>
   Shortly after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
was formed in 1958, its engineers began visiting elementary schools
in the leafy suburbs of Washington, D.C., to practice inspirational
speeches in front of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The space program hadn't yet hardened into a race against the
Soviets. It was still pictured as a journey of exploration, one
that would eventually lead to colonizing first the moon, then Mars
and the rest of the solar system. At least, that's the way Gregory
Bennett remembers the message the NASA guy gave to his third-grade
class.
</P>
<P>
   From that day on, Bennett was wedded to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his late 40s, Bennett is an employee of Boeing, NASA's
primary contractor for the International Space Station. On evenings
and weekends, Bennett is one of the leaders of what you might call
a lunar underground, a group called the Artemis Society, which is
bent on circumventing the politics and bureaucracy of NASA and
striking out on its own for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure we can put a man on the moon for about $1.5
billion,'' he says matter-of-factly. After an awkward silence, he
adds: ``We're going to do it. We are going to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his cohorts are not the only ones packing their
bags. Suddenly just about everybody is trying to get to the moon,
including a motley collection of entrepreneurs and dreamers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except NASA: They have their hands full with
the space station, and their eyes cast in the direction of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   With NASA on the sidelines, and with no Cold War in sight, those
listening to Bennett's pitch could be forgiven for wondering how a
new lunar program might be structured and who, in this day of
budget cuts and belt-tightening, would be willing to pay for it.
And why?
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Mendell attended the Twenty-Ninth Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference last March at the Johnson Space Center, as he
has attended just about every moon conference since the mid-1960s,
when he was a planetary scientist for the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   Mendell still works for JSC's Planetary Science Branch, and he
is one of the leading advocates for putting people on the moon. He
also knows firsthand how difficult it is to get the lunar bandwagon
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, Mendell and his colleagues spurred
NASA-affiliated engineers and scientists to think about and plan a
return mission to the moon. The result was the first Lunar Base
Symposium in Washington in 1984. Momentum flagged after the
Challenger explosion in 1986 but picked up again in 1989 when
President Bush made a Kennedyesque speech challenging NASA to go to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   NASA responded with a 30-year plan that used the space station
and the moon as starting points. Unfortunately, the price tag _
$500 billion to $600 billion _ triggered the gag reflex in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendell has quietly continued to plug the moon, writing
articles such as ``Lunar Base _ Why Ask Why?'' He wants to go not
for national pride but for another equally old-fashioned reason:
knowledge. The moon has much to teach us, he says, about the
origins of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon is a geologic time machine,'' he says. ``It underwent
some of the processes that Earth underwent, but then it just
stopped. It is a record of the early days of the solar system, just
waiting to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in January, only weeks before the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference convened, the Lunar Prospector orbiter had
arrived in lunar orbit and started making detailed maps of the
surface. The biggest jewel in a treasure trove of scientific data
was the first incontrovertible evidence of water on the moon _
about a billion tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Water on the moon has given the lunar underground a fillip.
``Primarily, the existence of water opens people's minds to going
to the moon,'' Alan Binder says. ``It's like finding gold.
California could have been settled without the gold rush, but it
sure helped.''
</P>
<P>
   A planetary scientist turned entrepreneur, Binder was the
driving force behind the scrappy, 650-pound Prospector orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Binder wants to start factories on the moon,
churning out hydrogen or basalt bricks. He's not talking about a
moon base but a whole industrial infrastructure in space _ the moon
as industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's LunaCorp, a private firm cofounded by David Gump,
the former publisher of a space-industry newsletter, who wants to
build a moon rover with ``telepresence,'' which would be controlled
from Earth via joystick _ preferably by an adolescent in an arcade
in an amusement park somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks bigger than Greg Bennett, though, when it comes to
mining the moon's entertainment resources. In his vision, tourism
is the sine qua non of the development of the moon, and the entire
solar system for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting people up there would cost, oh, maybe $100,000 per
person,'' Bennett says. ``It'd be like a luxury capital tour of
Europe. It's about what you'd spend to go to Mount Everest. If you
had a resort on the northeast corner of Mare Crisium, there's a
place called Angus Bay where you could go spelunking.'' Bennett
envisions a network of gondola chairs that would take people around
to the most interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will prevail on the moon? Mining or tourism?
Production or consumption? Although nobody is even close to leaving
Earth, already it seems clear that the final arbiter of what we
should do with the moon will most likely be the free market. If the
coming decades are anything like this one, don't count
entertainment out.

   There's a bank in central Boston that offers its customers a
unique investment opportunity. For an initial outlay of $2,500 and
yearly fees of $95, investors can realize returns of incalculable
value _ or, more often, no returns at all.
</P>
<P>
   The institution in question is Viacord, the nation's largest
commercial banker of blood from fetal umbilical cords. In recent
years cord blood has become something of a hot commodity, as
medical research has demonstrated its potential for treating
leukemia and certain immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Private bankers like Viacord can guarantee expectant parents
future access to their own baby's blood, thereby increasing the
likelihood of a match should the child or a relative someday need
to restore a crippled immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Viacord's 1,400-plus samples of frozen cord blood could
represent roughly $3.5 million in revenue for the company. But no
one knows what cord blood will be worth to the families who have
paid to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in medical technology have created a marketplace for
everything from organs and tissues to genes and sex cells. Prices
vary: $300 for a pint of plasma, $50 for a sample of sperm, $10,000
for a nine-month lease on a surrogate mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was the first commodity on the market, and it is still the
most commonly sold body product. Paid blood donors typically earn
from $50 to $500 per pint; those with rare blood types or
components may get more.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Red Cross Societies and other international
organizations have expressed concern that the financial incentives
offered by the blood trade constitute a subtle form of coercion for
impoverished or otherwise disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about donor exploitation have not succeeded in
halting blood buying and selling. Part of the reason may be that,
in legal terms as well as popular perception, blood is more a body
``product'' than a body ``part.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which in 1984
banned interstate commerce in organs for transplant, specifically
excluded ``replenishable tissues such as blood or sperm'' from its
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   NOTA was passed in response to the transplant successes of the
late 1970s. Before the transplant act, there were cases of would-be
donors advertising for potential buyers, and of organ brokers
offering to match the two in exchange for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   While NOTA has shut down organ brokers here, however,
unregulated _ and poorly documented _ markets for organs are
believed to flourish elsewhere, mostly in India and Brazil. And
while the act prohibits traffic in organs for transplantation, it
allows such commerce if the body parts in question are to be used
in research or product development and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 businessman John Moore sued his doctor, the University
of California and several pharmaceutical companies for using,
without his consent, tissue from his cancerous spleen to create a
commercial cell line now valued by some at $3 billion in potential
profits. Moore lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 the California Supreme Court ruled that patients do not
have property rights to their tissues, since granting such rights
would ``destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical
research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next of kin have a lot more authority over your dead body
than you have over your live body,'' says George Annas, professor
of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health.
There are laws protecting the inviolability of cadavers but almost
none to protect what happens to tissues and organs removed from a
patient who's still alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complicated issues in body-shop policy is the
traffic in fetal parts, which are gleaned almost exclusively from
fetuses that have been electively aborted. (Miscarried or stillborn
fetuses tend to have defects and are harder to harvest).
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue has been a prized medical resource ever since
research demonstrated its potential for treating Parkinson's
disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as spinal-cord injuries
and hemophilia. Combined markets for cures of these diseases have
been estimated at more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But when a company began in the mid-1980s to develop a treatment
involving transplanted fetal cells, right-to-life protests erupted,
and in 1988 Congress passed the only amendment to NOTA, extending
the act's restrictions to include fetal organs and tissues. Of
course, fetal body parts are still being collected for use in
research.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of the body-parts market prices the goods and
services for assisted reproduction. At present, money can buy sperm
($50 to $100), eggs (starting at $2,000), embryos (market value
varies), and a place to put them (gestational surrogates start at
$10,000, not including brokers' fees).
</P>
<P>
   The story of cord-blood banking may present an object lesson in
commercialization, though the moral of the story is not quite
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert has predicted that the average person's
chance of ever needing to use the blood banked is 1 in 200,000.
Nevertheless, the idea of cord-blood banking seems to be taking
off. More than a dozen companies, in addition to Viacord, now offer
banking services.
</P>
<P>
   And people are buying. At first, Viacord's customers were mostly
families who had a present or foreseeable need for stem-cell
transplants. Now more than half of Viacord's families have no
apparent need for the blood at all.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of cord-blood banking maintain that they have turned a
medical waste product into a valuable resource. But critics of the
trafficking in human anatomy claim that no matter how many lives
are saved (or created), any such commerce inevitably violates the
sanctity of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, animals engineered with human genes and
tissues have already been patented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which outlawed slavery, would seem to prohibit the
patenting of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   But when does a human part, or a part-human, become a
full-fledged person? The ever-expanding scope of biomedical
commerce is forcing answers to such improbable questions. As the
market races forward, issues that were once the province of the
very ill or the very thoughtful may soon become every body's
business.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On the morning of Dec. 10, 1996, I awoke with a pulsing pain
behind my left eye. I got up to begin my morning routine and jumped
onto my cardio-glider. The exercise, I thought, would get my blood
flowing and banish the throbbing inside my head.
</P>
<P>
   While I exercised, however, the pain became more intense. Within
a few moments I started to feel very peculiar _ confused, yet
clearheaded and alert.
</P>
<P>
   When I got off the machine, I noticed that I was slightly off
balance and feeling strangely detached from my body. I climbed into
the shower, my movements slowed and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   When I held my hands up in front of my face, I felt as though my
consciousness was suspended somewhere between normal reality and
some esoteric space. The running water of the shower felt like
little bullets spattering into my flesh.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was very wrong with my brain. I dimmed the
lights, because they made the throbbing behind my left eye worse.
</P>
<P>
   Time seemed to stand still. I was disturbingly aware that the
intricate networks that operate the different functions of my mind
were shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to visualize myself driving to work, and in the next
instant my right arm went totally dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment I knew I was having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I was 37 years old and, testifying to the impact of my
scientific training, my next thought was ``Wow, this is so cool!''
I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But I could visualize how I did things before. And I believed
that if I held on to the memory of what it felt like to perform
basic actions, I could more quickly reestablish the connections
that had been broken before they completely deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years have passed since my stroke. Besides having a
beauty of a scar, I still have some cognitive impairment. I can
handle only elementary mathematical calculations, and when I'm
tired I have trouble finding the right word.
</P>
<P>
   I have also shifted away from being a superanalytical, confident
risk taker who relied on the analytical skills housed in my brain's
left hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I experienced a fascinating and pleasurable shift in my
perspective. My brain's right hemisphere is now dominant. I am much
more mellow and secure in my understanding of who I am and what I
want to accomplish with the finite time I have.
</P>
<P>
   I have crossed the bridge from the academic description of
illness to personal insight, and my resolve is stronger than ever.
Now I enjoy helping people understand what it is like to experience
mental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, I have great compassion.

I am a trained neuroanatomist, and this was an opportunity for me
to study my brain _ from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   I witnessed the breakdown of my higher cognitive skills. I could
no longer integrate and associate my thoughts with the incoming
sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   Although I felt no sense of urgency, I understood that the
prognosis of stroke is often determined by how quickly a patient
gets to the hospital. To save my life, I had to make a plan and
then consciously hold it in my memory long enough to execute it.
But I kept forgetting what it was I was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   After minutes of effort, I dialed the phone number of the
Harvard Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, where I worked. I tried to
ask for help, but my throat wouldn't form the words. I simply
grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I blurted something out, but it was unintelligible. I
heard my colleague speaking, and I knew that I knew what was being
said, but I couldn't grasp the meaning. Fortunately, he sensed the
danger of my condition and assured me that he would send help.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I found myself at the hospital and in a CT
scanner. The resulting images revealed that I was indeed having a
stroke, with severe bleeding in my left temporal lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Later I learned that 10 percent of people who experience this
kind of stroke die immediately. Another 50 percent remain in a
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Most strokes are caused when a blood clot lodges in an artery
that is supplying life-giving oxygen-rich blood to the brain. The
artery that is blocked determines which cells will be starved and
die. For some people there is extensive neurological destruction,
while for others there is minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   My stroke, however, was not caused by a clot but by an
arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Normally, capillary networks _
fine-mesh structures of tiny blood vessels _ function as a buffer
zone between sturdy arteries, in which blood flows forcefully, and
thin-walled veins, which return blood to the heart and lungs. With
an AVM, there is a shortcut between arteries and veins, and a
low-pressure vein is directly hooked up to a high-pressure artery.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the condition and never have symptoms. But in
others the direct connection between the artery and the vein
becomes so weak that the connection bursts.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, the hemorrhage occurred over a fold in the left
hemisphere of my brain: the superior temporal gyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in my brain placed pressure on certain nerve
fibers, blocking my ability to speak or understand spoken language.
The most lasting injury occurred in a nearby region that allows for
the performance of both simple and complex mathematical
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon I regained full consciousness and
discovered I was completely mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days after the stroke, I underwent brain surgery at
Massachusetts General Hospital. The brain swelling from the
hemorrhage had receded, but my doctors needed to open my skull and
remove the affected tissue and residual debris.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke from surgery, I faced the challenge of rebuilding
my brain. A small amount of tissue had been permanently destroyed.
Neuronal connections that had been broken by the injury would have
to be reconnected, and in some cases I would have to build entirely
new pathways.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the marvels of the brain that neurons can be
recruited to take on new functions. The recovery would not be
swift: It would be two years before we would know how well I would
recover from both the stroke and the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Some tasks came back more easily than others. Although I could
remember what it felt like to do simple things like walking
smoothly, my body wouldn't cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But I could visualize how I did things before. And I believed
that if I held on to the memory of what it felt like to perform
basic actions, I could more quickly reestablish the connections
that had been broken before they completely deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years have passed since my stroke. Besides having a
beauty of a scar, I still have some cognitive impairment. I can
handle only elementary mathematical calculations, and when I'm
tired I have trouble finding the right word.
</P>
<P>
   I have also shifted away from being a superanalytical, confident
risk taker who relied on the analytical skills housed in my brain's
left hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I experienced a fascinating and pleasurable shift in my
perspective. My brain's right hemisphere is now dominant. I am much
more mellow and secure in my understanding of who I am and what I
want to accomplish with the finite time I have.
</P>
<P>
   I have crossed the bridge from the academic description of
illness to personal insight, and my resolve is stronger than ever.
Now I enjoy helping people understand what it is like to experience
mental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, I have great compassion.

THE SIXTIES ARE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slide and black and white photo of actress Julia Stiles in a
scene from the NBC miniseries ``The Sixties.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The '60s are back.
 &HT;    But you can relax. It's only on TV.
 &HT;    It was probably inevitable: The baby boom generation are now
running the country. They're also producing its movies and
television, and the '60s for them was the best of times.
 &HT;    Says Lynda Obst, producer of ``The Sixties,'' the four-hour
miniseries airing Feb. 7 and 8 on NBC: ``The music that gave tempo
to that (decade), the community that was forged at that time, the
values that were stirred up at that time still live with us, and
inside of all of us.''
 &HT;    She's not alone. Two other '60s projects are already established
in the TV season or coming up.
 &HT;    On Lifetime the much praised ``Any Day Now'' goes into its
second season with Annie Potts and Lorraine Toussaint as childhood
friends from the segregated South of the '60s reunited in a much
different America of the '90s. Child actors Mae Middleton and Shari
Dyon Perry co-star as the childhood friends as the action veers
between the black-and-white past and the full color present.
 &HT;    On TNT, ``Passing Glory'' airs Feb. 21 starring Andre Braugher
as a Catholic priest in a Southern town trying to get his high
school basketball team a game against the town's all-white
champions.
 &HT;    Also taking up the issue of race, Obst follows two American
families, one black and one white, through the travails of the
Vietnam War the civil rights movement, and brings them out more or
less intact on the other side.
 &HT;    ``I loved making this miniseries more than I've loved doing
almost anything in my entire career, '' she confesses. ``I was
going to say, in my entire life, but I think living the '60s was
more fun than actually making them again.''
 &HT;    At the Paramount Ranch in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, she
re-created the pivotal moment of her favorite decade when she
presided over the new Woodstock. Obst attended the real thing back
in 1969 _ ``I remember driving my car in reverse for about 12 miles
to get out of the mud'' _ so she insisted that every detail be true
to life.
 &HT;    As an army of studio workers unleashed a rain storm, some 300
extras milled around with long bleached hair, tie dyed shirts,
headbands, bodies draped in U.S. flags _ and that was just the men!
 &HT;    The women with flowers in their hair were in ankle-length
dresses and bell bottoms. Psychedelically painted buses stood
nearby, the ``bummer tent'' lay open for kids having bad trips, and
incense burned throughout. The odor of pot was missing, of course,
to keep everything legal.
 &HT;    Defying the adage about the '60s _ ``If you can remember it, you
weren't there'' _ Obst can recall those years in obsessive detail.
 &HT;    ``In many ways I've wanted to find a way to tackle the '60s for
all of my career,'' she says. ``I did a book on it (`The Rolling
Stone History of the Sixties') but TV is the right medium because
we received the '60s through television, from the Kennedy-Nixon
debates, where we got to see what beauty and charisma meant on
television....to the pictures from Vietnam, and the kids we saw
getting beaten up by cops on TV. ''
 &HT;    Obst's working class white family, the Herlihys, lose their
daughter when she gets pregnant by a rock musician and ends up in a
commune in Haight Ashbury. One son goes off to Vietnam. The other
becomes a peace activist.
 &HT;    The other family is no less split. Rev. Willie Taylor is burned
out of his home in Greenwood, Miss. and moves to California where
his son is recruited by the Black Panthers. The son becomes a
bodyguard and narrowly avoids being killed at the 1968 Democratic
Convention in Chicago.
 &HT;    Real-life Black Panther David Hilliard was an adviser to the
production and the cast includes a mixture of new and familiar
faces: Charles Dutton, Cliff Gorman, (as Father Daniel Berrigan)
Julia Stiles and David Alan Grier.
 &HT;    While Obst says she tried not to romanticize the decade, she
insists there is an enduring positive legacy from the controversial
decade.
 &HT;    ``I think there's great beauty in trying to re-imagine what it
felt like to be engaged in the world without apathy, and I want
more than anything for this series to be an invitation from my
generation to my son's generation.... to see what it's like to be
involved in speaking up, and finding out that your voice does make
a difference.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer plays a blind man who regains his sight. But this
fact-based drama, loosely based on a metro Atlanta couple, never
finds its focus. Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the
chemistry between the stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry
setting.2 hours, 8 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations whose careless waste management caused leukemia in a
dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent. Travolta is
miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus is. Still,
it more than makes its case with intelligence and old-fashioned
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle
</P>
<P>
   (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty'' R (profanity, violence, gore, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elijah Wood, Jon Stewart and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox
News Service)1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ghosts of Dickens' Past'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christopher Heyerdahl
</P>
<P>
   In this earnest but dull family film, the young Charles Dickens
(Christopher Heyerdahl) recounts a ghostly encounter with a young
girl w2ho inspired ``A Christmas Carol.'' It's well intended, but
it drains the magic out of the Christmas classic. 1 hour, 30
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but contains sexual themes and
brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center.1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' R (sexuality, violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson, Billy Crudup and Patricia Arquette form a love
triangle in this uneven but absorbing drama set in the fading West
in the years after World War II. Arquette is miscast, but director
Stephen Frears (``The Grifters'') is an expert at building tension
that you know just has to erupt. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Emily Watson (``Breaking
the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous cellist who
died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths plays her
sister, Hilary, who swapped a career for cozy domesticity.2 hours.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' R (profanity, violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn and Meg
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   A terrific acting ensemble, a terrible script. Sean Penn and
Kevin Spacey are the unstable center around whom circle hangers-on
(Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling) and disposable women (Meg Ryan,
Robin Wright Penn). Set in 1980s Hollywood, the movie is about
things like sex, drugs, misogyny and maleness. It's actually a saga
in free-fall that ends up in a talky, coked-up tailspin. 2 hours, 2
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' R (violence and disturbing themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' meets ``The
Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette Bening) is harassed
in her dreams by a child-murdering pyscho. For at least an hour,
the movie is truly eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging.1 hour, 40
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film, alas, is a
fairly feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse on stage. See it for Horrocks; check out the concession
stand in between her numbers. 1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (RachaelLeigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and
a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4 million in cash.
Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to a chain of
increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids).2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' R (sexuality, profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly and Bill Nighy.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliantly acted comedy with poignant undertones. Twenty
years after giving in to factions, jealousies and divine
intervention, a fictional '70s British rock group named Strange
Fruit attempts a reunion tour. The movie is both a celebration and
an elegy, telling us that rock 'n' roll dreams die hard. The
ensemble cast is terrific, with Bill Nighy a standout as the lead
singer, a tremulous has-been heartthrob. 1 hour, 36 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line''R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Less a war movie than a meditation on life, death, love, hate,
man and nature. Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the
drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from
the Japanese during World War II. Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous
images and sudden violence, it's superbly strange, an epic that
feels intimate but distant at the same time. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The new IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a
fictional story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a
budding teenage paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her
dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be
a dinosaur egg into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally
cracks it and is thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big
beasts roamed the earth.40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>

   HAVANA _ An imposing structure from the outside, the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital is Havana's premier healthcare facility and one
of the few high-rise buildings positioned along this city's famed
seaside boulevard, the Malecon.
</P>
<P>
   But, inside, the facility is much-less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The lights are off in the spacious, but darkened, lobby, and the
air-conditioning isn't working in most parts of the building. In
operating rooms, surgical gloves are generally reused. Everywhere,
antibiotics are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are so underpaid that some are contemplating leaving
their fields altogether to work instead in the tourism industry,
where they can earn more from foreigners in daily tips than they
can from the government in monthly incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there's even a running joke about a woman who frets to a
psychiatrist that her husband suffers from delusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps claiming to be a waiter, when everybody knows he's
only a brain surgeon,'' she worries.
</P>
<P>
   The average yearly salary for a doctor in Cuba is about $240.
</P>
<P>
   The ails of the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital are a microcosm of
the ails afflicting this island's once world-renowned healthcare
system.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shining jewel of President Fidel Castro's revolution,
Cubans have seen their benefits flit away like leaves on an autumn
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many shortages that people try to avoid going to
the hospitals in Cuba at all costs because of all the problems that
exist in them,'' said Max Castro, an expert on Cuba at the
University of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   At many of Cuba's 273 hospitals, surgeons use acupuncture
instead of anesthesia during operations. Patients supply their own
food and bed sheets. Aspirin is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans blame deficiencies on the U.S. economic embargo, which
has made it increasingly hard -- and expensive -- to import
desperately needed medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent takeovers of non-American pharmaceutical and other
medical companies by U.S.-based ones have made it even more
difficult to import medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Existing U.S. embargo regulations permit only the licensed sale
and donation of medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs three times as much to buy medicines from other
sources than it would if we could buy them from the United States,
so we can't afford them,'' said Dr. Bartolome Arce Hidalgo, vice
director at the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faced a lot of difficulties due to the blockade,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy toward Cuba, such as Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., argue that U.S. licensing regulations are
prohibitive, and they want the embargo on medical sales lifted
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Dodd plans to revise and
re-introduce legislation that failed to win approval last year
allowing for unencumbered medical-related sales to this communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we hope to have even more than the 29 co-sponsors
we had before,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   But many Clinton administration officials blame Cuba's
foundering healthcare system not on the stifling U.S. embargo, but
on Cuba's foundering socialist economy, which they say is in worse
shape today than it was in 1959, when Castro took power.
</P>
<P>
   They retort that Cuba simply doesn't have the hard currency it
needs to make major purchases of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Cuba lost 85 percent
of its export market, forcing it to cut spending on healthcare by
between 70 and 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a step some Cuba experts saw as ground-breaking under the
existing embargo, the Clinton administration late last year gave a
small Denver-based medical company permission to test a new product
in Cuba. Cuban officials are currently conducting a three-month
test of a needle-free vaccine injector developed by Genesis Medical
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first U.S. company that's been allowed to go in and
make our presence known in such a way,'' said Robert Jones, the
company's president. ``It's been good for us because preliminary
reports show the Cubans are impressed with the inoculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Cuba's healthcare system still functions as well as it
does in the face of massive budget cuts is testament to how strong
its foundation was in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has long been known for impressive strides in public
health. Its 63,000 doctors have eradicated most common infectious
diseases, such as measles and tuberculosis, and the average life
expectancy here is 75 years, same as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most medicines and treatments -- even plastic surgery -- are
made free of charge to Cuba's 12 million or so people.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still has more doctors per capita -- one for every 185
citizens -- than any country in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba even exports some of its doctors, with 1,000 physicians now
working abroad, including more than 400 in South Africa's grossly
under-serviced rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly for Cuba's esteem is that the state-run
biotechnology industry is still breaking new ground. Recently,
Cuban scientists expressed hope that this will find vaccines for
AIDS and some types of cancer within the next seven years or so.
Health Minister Carlos Dotres has been even more optimistic, saying
in December that an AIDS vaccine would be ready within two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotechnology industry is still a very gung-ho industry,
and Cuba seems to have an army of engineers and scientists at work
in this area,'' said Florentino Chacon Puig, who works here for the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists already have developed a vaccine for
meningitis C, one of the last childhood killers, and are working on
a vaccine to fight cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite Cuba's shortages, doctors at the Ameijeiras
Brothers Hospital have performed 94 heart transplants over the last
10 years, as well as cornea, kidney, and bone marrow transplants,
advanced procedures unavailable in many other developing countries.
In the hospital's basement, doctors use four hyperbaric chambers --
that are worth $45,000 a piece -- to treat patients with all sorts
of common and acute conditions using concentrated levels of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hospital room is equipped with a television and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital still needs sutures, anesthetics, and drugs
such as the cancer-fighting Tamoxifin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Tamoxifin from China, so you can imagine how
expensive it is,'' said pharmacist Robin Garcia, referring to high
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The dire need for foreign exchange in recent years has led many
of Cuba's better hospitals to market some of their beds to foreign
patients, who now pay $20 million a year in hard currency for
various treatments, according to Cuban government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuban government officials say no more than 5 percent of
hospital beds is set aside for foreigners so that there's still
plenty of space for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1,000-bed Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, only 50 beds are
reserved for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money that's collected is devoted entirely to keeping the
rest of the health-care system alive,'' said government spokesman
Roberto de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anti-Castro critics blast Cuban hospitals for treating
foreigners with ample supplies of food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that foreigners are treated with the best care and
the best drugs when the average Cuban must suffer from extreme
shortages?'' asked an angry Frank Calzon, director of the
non-profit Center for a Free Cuba in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But Armas said hospitals must provide foreigners with good care
because their money is the glue that holds the entire health-care
system together.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our hospitals, the material conditions have deteriorated --
the beds are old and the paint is peeling,'' he said. ``But every
bed and every hospital is still open and the equipment still works,
and that's saying something.''

 &HT;    BACK TO BEIRUT: AMERICANS TRICKLING INTO ONE-TIME HAVEN FOR
HOSTAGE-TAKERS
 &HT;    With Photos in the International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Jan. 30 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Like other college freshmen, American Cara
MacAdam goes to class, gets visits from her mother, and relaxes at
local pubs after a day full of classes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, during the country's 15-year civil war, her
school was targeted for kidnappings and assassinations. In those
days, the American University in Beirut was no place for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam is one of just a couple hundred Americans who, after the
lifting of a U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon, choose to live in the
war-scarred country.
</P>
<P>
   MacAdam, 18, was here as a toddler when her father was on the
AUB faculty. By the time she left in 1984, Lebanon's civil war had
turned against Americans and AUB took a lot of losses.
</P>
<P>
   One president of the university, David Dodge, was kidnapped and
another, Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated. An engineering professor
and hospital administrator were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Radical groups pulled Americans and other foreigners off the
streets, including reporter Terry Anderson, Rev. Benjamin Weir and
hostage negotiator Terry Waite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the U.S. State Department outlawed travel to Lebanon by
Americans. During the ban, thousands of Americans managed to go
anyway, careful to keep Lebanese border stamps out of the their
passports. Mostly, though, they were Lebanese-Americans or people
married to Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the university, once with a majority-American student
body, lost its American students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 1997(CQ), the state department lifted the ban, citing
progress in ``restoring order.'' A travel advisory still warns
Americans not to go to Lebanon without ``compelling reasons'' and
notes that someone fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the
embassy grounds in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are trickling back in. There are scores there now,
though probably less than 200.
</P>
<P>
   There's the manager at the TGIFridays, some business executives,
the occasional journalist and a small group at the at the
136-year-old university _ nine students among the 5,000 enrolled
and about five faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The campus of green lawns and giant Banyan trees is an enclave
of quiet in the traffic-jammed Beirut downtown. From its hilltop,
it overlooks the Mediterranean and it has its own beach. While
Beirut still has entire blocks of bombed-out buildings, the damage
at AUB has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a part of my past that I don't even know,'' says
MacAdam, who was too young to remember Beirut when she left.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends in Princeton, N.J., wondered why she did not go to
school in the United States, but she was bored there. She said her
Lebanese peers wonder, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely an element of, 'What are you doing here,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a heavy military presence. On the streets of
Beirut, one sees propaganda from the radical Hezbollah, troops from
the Lebanese army and machine gun-toting secret service from Syria,
which exercises control over Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is occupied
by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of gotten used to Israeli jets breaking the sound
barrier. Initially, it was very disturbing,'' says student Kevin
DeJesus, from Providence, R.I., referring to a recent string of
Israeli fly-overs that created window-shaking sonic booms.
</P>
<P>
   But, the kidnappings stopped long ago and there is almost no
common street crime in Beirut. Bars and restaurants are popping up
in the rebuilt-downtown.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is probably the most liberal Arab capital. DeJesus, 28,
enjoys a disco called ``Acid.'' But, he says the two earrings he
wears -- both in one ear -- are still a ``source of discontent to
many.''
</P>
<P>
   History professor John Miloy(CQ), from California, said any
danger he might face is nothing compared to what Lebanese faced
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who decided every day whether to send their
kids to school or whether to cancel a lecture because a shell
landed nearby,'' says Miloy, 39.
</P>
<P>
   American Monte Palmer, 64, heads the school's Center for Arab
and Middle Eastern Studies. He was in Beirut in the 1970s, and
returned last year from Florida State University in Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He's irked to see some of the changes, including a McDonald's
now downtown. He is careful about where he travels, but does not
fear for his safety and he recently talked to former hostage
Anderson about bringing a group of American journalism students to
the school this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, though fragile, seems to be getting back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think Beirut is the best kept secret in the
world,'' he says. ``My assessment was that if things are going to
break down, there will be ample time to leave.''

EVERY TIME I QUIT SMOKING, MEAN LITTLE JUNKIE BUTTS IN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here she comes, I thought to myself yesterday as I
stood in line at Walgreen's.
</P>
<P>
   She started off slowly, sliding in a slight, almost unnoticeable
slither up my spine. She began calling me, louder and louder until
it was impossible to ignore her. I felt the touch of anxiety that
she shot my way, and then it hit me like a 50-foot wave.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, I was under, swimming in a craving that had
seeped into every cell of my body, clawing at me from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   I could only think about one thing: I WANT A CIGARETTE.
</P>
<P>
   NOW.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 10 days since I've had a cigarette, 10 days since I've
sucked that smoke into my lungs and held it there until the mean
little junkie in me was satisfied. Ten days, going colder than the
turkey my mother got on sale in November and put to sleep in the
deep freeze inside her garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOW!'' the mean little junkie screamed.
</P>
<P>
   This was not good. I was standing behind a woman so old that I
was sure she had dated Moses. After she had hoisted $15 worth of
laxatives and hard candy onto the counter, the mean little junkie
trembled with hate when I realized the old woman was paying for her
stuff in nothing but quarters. Bumping around in my hands was a box
of Nicorette gum that I just wanted to pay for, rip open and shove
so much of it into my mouth that it looked like I was sucking on a
softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four twenty-five, four fifty, four seventy-five,'' I heard the
cashier count as he dragged each coin across the counter.
</P>
<P>
   That was when I completely lost control. I couldn't help it when
a tear slipped out the corner of my right eye and I began to cry. I
was still crying when the cashier swiped the box of Nicorette over
the scanner and told me that it cost $32 for (begin ital) gum. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   Like almost every smoker, I've quit before, and battled the mean
little junkie head-on as she hissed, spit and snarled through the
first two weeks of withdrawal. Wound up in a tight ball of hate,
anger and irritation, I purged her in the hardest fight of my life
several years ago, when a portion of a puffy Cheeto got lodged in
my throat but I thought it was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, our house was robbed, and before I had finished
dialing 911, there was a cigarette firmly planted and lit between
my lips. The mean little junkie was back, fiery and alive,
demanding that I feed her at least a pack a day. She laughed at me
as I looked at my yellow fingers, tasted my own rotten breath and
listened to my lungs scream like a rape whistle when I tried to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was there when you caught your ex-boyfriend trying to move
out of state without telling you?'' she demanded of me as I watched
another insipid anti-smoking commercial on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was there when your last boss said, `Don't look so scared.
You're not fired. Your position has just been eliminated.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was there last week when you walked around Trader Joe's
with your dress tucked into your panties? Me. Me! ME!!! And I don't
care if you just coughed so hard that you threw up! Find the
lighter and give the devil her due!''
</P>
<P>
   When the price of cigarettes zoomed up to nearly four bucks a
pack, it was just too much. Although I wasn't looking forward to
withdrawal and ending my affair with the mean little junkie, I
figured that if it cost me $3.75 a day to see my husband, I'd drop
him, too.
</P>
<P>
   I secured a prescription for Zyban, but became a little hesitant
after I discovered that it was quite similar to an antidepressant,
and that I would have to continue taking it for three months.
Frantically, I imagined that my next 12 columns would begin with
the words, ``Everyone is beautiful, in their own way'' . . .
``Today, I smelled a flower. . .,'' or ``Have you ever really seen
the colors of a rainbow?'' and quickly dumped the prescription in
the trash.
</P>
<P>
   When she suspected that I was thinking of quitting again, the
mean little junkie scoffed and declared, ``You put a patch on me
and I'll shove a Nutty Ho-Ho in your mouth with every breath you
take. You try that nicotine inhaler and I'll turn your bowels into
concrete. You undergo hypnosis and the first words that will come
out of your mouth will be about a particularly horrifying dream you
had about bearing Bob Saget's children in 1991. You just try it.
You just try to kill me, sister!''
</P>
<P>
   Then I coughed. And I sneezed. Before I knew it, I was down,
sweating more than a fat cop after chasing a perp for a block, my
lungs thick with congestion, my head pulsing with a fever. The flu,
it seemed, would be my method of least resistance in quitting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three days, the mean little junkie stayed dormant
as I kept coughing up things that appeared to be vital organs and
possibly glands. But in a couple of days I got better, my lungs
cleared, the sneezing stopped, and she was ready to show herself.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the craving wave had just hit me when my husband lit
up not three feet from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you please not do that in front of me?'' I pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, taking a drag, ``withdrawal is completely
psychological. If you believe it hard enough, it won't bother you
that I'm smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor thing. My husband did not know the mean little junkie
like I did. Before I knew it, she had my husband in a chokehold and
had a utensil in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychological, huh?'' the mean little junkie said, her mouth
frothing. ``Then I guess it won't bother you when I psychologically
stab you in the forehead with this fork the next time you wrap your
lips around that butt!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, this isn't so bad,'' I said as I later applied
ointment to the four round wounds on my husband's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen the mean little junkie this morning. It
could be worse. At this very moment, there's a little old lady
somewhere in Phoenix, sitting on her potty with six dollars in
change and a pound of Pep-O-Mints crashing together in her colon,
just screaming to get out.'' &QL;

GOOD NEWS ON THE TELEPHONE FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you travel to London or Rome, Helsinki, or Hong Kong, the
first thing you notice is that everyone's on the mobile. Mobile
telephony is quickly becoming the personal communications tool of
choice in Europe and Asia. In the next 10 years, it should become
the European and Asian standard for telephony. People who live and
work there won't have a ``home phone number'' and ``an office phone
number.'' They'll just have a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for the hard-wired phone companies in Europe and
Asia and very good news for American consumers. Why? Because
success breeds imitation and the success of wireless telephony in
Europe and Asia is now breeding highly competitive product here in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in US wireless telephony actually occurred last
year when AT&AMP;T introduced its ``Digital One Rate'' plan. The plan
allows users 600 minutes a month of talk time for $90, with no fees
for so-called roaming charges (out of network calls) and no
long-distance charges. Pay $150 a month and you get 1,400 minutes.
AT&AMP;T is also offering unlimited ``local'' wireless service in test
markets for as little as $40 per month. Sprint PCS, Omnipoint,
Nextel, and others are scrambling to match the AT&AMP;T plans.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, service can be spotty, particularly here in the
Northeast. But in three to five years wireless service is expected
to be all but universal in the United States and the connections
are likely to be crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   Once that happens, and assuming stiff price competition
continues unabated, the choice between wireless and wired telephony
will quickly become a no-brainer. Do you want to pay Bell Atlantic
$75 for local phone calls and AT&AMP;T another $75 for long distance?
Or would you rather pay AT&AMP;T Wireless or Sprint PCS one flat fee of
$120 for all calls and pay no additional charge for paging, text
mail, voice mail, caller identification, and call waiting?
</P>
<P>
   Already, some corporations are beginning to convert. Many
companies that reside in cities with fully developed wireless
systems, such as San Diego and San Jose, are now wireless for
``voice communications.'' Employees wear ``holsters'' for their
cell phones and do all their phone work and personal business
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The savings for companies that have converted are not yet
substantial, but the productivity gains are enormous. The old dodge
game of ``he (or she) just stepped away for a moment'' no longer
applies. Employees, unless they have their phone shut off, are
always ``on call.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward wireless is causing regional Bell operating
companies (RBOCs), like Bell Atlantic, to sit up and take notice.
Bell Atlantic recently offered to buy AirTouch, a California
wireless company with over 8.4 million US customers. Vodafone, the
leading European wireless firm, promptly trumped Bell Atlantic's
bid with a staggering offer of $97 per share. Bell Atlantic's
defeat in the AirTouch bidding war was a jarring wake-up call for
the RBOCs, because the more ubiquitous wireless becomes, the more
competitive local telephony becomes.
</P>
<P>
   More competition in local telephony is devoutly to be wished.
Competition in telecommunications has been a boon for the US
economy. Since the break-up of Ma Bell, long-distance rates have
declined by 70 percent. Long distance rates are likely to fall even
more, as Internet technology incorporates telephony. The cost of
mail, thanks to the Internet and electronic mail, has also dropped
dramatically. Only two communications monopolies remain to be
smashed; the regional Bell operating companies and cable television
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 gives the federal government (specifically the FCC), and
not state regulatory authorities, jurisdiction over the RBOCs.
Traditionally (although not in all cases), state regulatory
authorities have been quite cozy with the Baby Bells and have
granted them the benefit of most every doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Clinton, the FCC has been adamant that local
telephony be deregulated. In granting the FCC jurisdiction, the
Supreme Court has increased the likelihood that the last great
telephone monopolists will finally have to join the real world and
compete.
</P>
<P>
   The RBOCs might begin by cutting prices. They might also push
ahead with their ADSL modem roll-out. ADSL modems offer lightning
fast Internet connections, which reminds consumers of the value of
hard-wired telephony. Wireless modems, which are scheduled for
roll-out this year, will not be competitive with ADSL any time
soon. The sooner Bell Atlantic rolls out ADSL modems and cuts
prices on local telephony, the more likely it is they'll be able to
beat back the wireless challenge.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't get with the program, they'll soon be looking out
the window at their customer base chatting it up on wireless
phones. Whatever happens, the cost of telephony can now only go in
one direction: downward, onward, for years to come.

BUSINESS CROWD IMPATIENT WITH TRIAL'S COST, DURATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the crowd lunching on slabs of meat and
salads laced with blue cheese dressing, the bottom line in the
year-old investigation into presidential sex and skulduggery is the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   As waiters in white jackets refilled their bread baskets and
coffee cups, businessman after businesswoman at the Savoy Grill
expressed contempt for the millions of tax dollars spent to bring
Bill Clinton to trial in the US Senate. They bemoaned the money
wasted, not to mention the time. More than a few say they would be
embarrassed to run a business as inefficiently as the impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That went for the entrepreneur in conservative suit and tie who
wants Clinton removed from office, as well as the advertising
account manager in shirt sleeves who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Their audit of Washington was both affable and angry, one
straight-shooting opinion after another, punctuated by jokes, such
as the one about the pope refusing to hear Clinton's confession in
St. Louis for lack of time.
</P>
<P>
   No one at the Savoy Grill, where the speciality of the
96-year-old house on the edge of downtown is seafood, was
ambivalent about what to do and when to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been punished. He has been humiliated, whether he
thinks he has or not,'' said Clinton supporter Robert Sullivan,
vice president for sales and marketing at a local brewery. ``Enough
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his lunch companion, advertising executive Perry Beal:
``What he did was not right, but they should stop it right now.
It's costing us too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   A table over, however, office equipment manager David Lesher
said that so much money has already been spent _ more than $40
million by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr alone _ that the
Senate has little choice but to continue the trial unless Clinton
fesses up completely. ``At this point, we may as well see it
through,'' Lesher said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one was pleased about the closed-door sessions in
Congress, with one likening it to a public company holding private
annual meetings. That's just bad business, more than one said.
Whatever happens, whether the trial ends tomorrow or continues
indefinitely, the consensus was that the people paying for the
process have a right to know what compromises are being made and
why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled that it has gone this far, but I'm not
surprised,'' said Matt Hicks, a private investor who dislikes
Clinton but opposes the Senate trial as ``just not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The table where the talk was harshest was filled by four older
men who meet for lunch every so often. Friends long enough to cut
each other off midsentence and to moan at each other's punch lines,
the four wanted Clinton impeached and now want him out of the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   As Les Wood, a retired airline vice president, put it to his
friends' guffaws: ``I thought he was a phony with a capital F when
he was running. I say we give him a fair trial and hang him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Les, why don't you just say what you really think?''
interjected Chuck Peterson, a retired airline pilot who described
himself as conservative but not ultraconservative. ``But this is
not a man who should be in office, no matter what his credentials
are, and I don't mind saying so either.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a corner table covered in white linen, beneath one of
the restaurant's themed murals, the men spoke of old-fashioned
morality and political muscle and gossiped about whether Hillary, a
``smart cookie,'' will leave Bill ``like a dirty shirt'' regardless
of how he exits Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Each said he thinks that D.C. Democrats got carried away with
their clout. Then again, they don't much like the behavior of
anyone on Capitol Hill. ``I have a difficult time with Congress,''
Peterson explained. ``They're politicians, not gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually their conversation wound its way back to the bottom
line. None of them said he expects Clinton to be ousted from
office, although none of them wants the Senate trial cut short,
either. Still, they said they are aghast at the money spent to hold
Clinton accountable, only for them the fault lies with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really puckers me up is when Democrats complain
about the cost of all of this,'' said Max Norman, a retired
executive with the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. ``I
mean, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Wood: ``He had it in his power to nix the whole thing a
year ago. If he'd told the truth, we'd have said, `OK, Bill, don't
do it again.' At least we might have.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next table, Michael Boyce said he, too, had considered
forgiving Clinton. Initially, he even opposed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had any guts, he'd resign, but he doesn't have any
guts,'' said Boyce. ``But no matter what happens, it's going to be
hard for there to be a winner in this whole thing, including the
American public. Either way, we're paying for this.''

SWAGGART CONTINUES HIS QUEST FOR CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The sign on busy Interstate 10 giving
directions to Jimmy Swaggart's Bible College is gone, and the
Sunday throngs at his Family Worship Center have dissipated. But
the voice, rasped by overuse and kissed by the bayous, endures on
the radio, pleading, as ever, for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Won't you help us?'' Swaggart asked the other day during a
fund-raising ``radiothon'' on his flagship station, WJSM in Baton
Rouge. ``In November we had a $4,000 deficit. We're looking at a
$150,000 deficit for the year . . . We're not a money-making
operation. I wish we were. If we could get more money, we'd use it
for Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   A $25 pledge comes in from down the river in Donaldsonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you! That's wonderful! Is this station a blessing to
you? I'm waiting to hear from you in Franklin and Houma and Lutcher
and Denham Springs,'' he says, reeling off the names of several
south Louisiana towns.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after his disgrace, the 63-year-old
evangelist continues to carry on his quest for money and lost
souls. But Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, once a far-flung empire that
collected about a half-million dollars a day during its heyday, has
been reduced to a regional mission that reaches out to a dwindling
following from its base in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of tragicomic episodes, with Swaggart lurching
from one crisis to another, the minister has settled into humbler
times. The prince of Pentacostalism is now mostly a merchant for
his business enterprises. Increasingly, he turns over his pulpit on
Sundays to his son, Donnie. His weekly television show, which once
commanded an audience of 2 million households across the nation,
relies on reruns and is thought to be limited to a few stations
with weak signals in Louisiana and Texas. The river of dollars has
dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Swaggart has become a nonentity,'' says Ed Pratt,
religion editor for The Advocate, the daily newspaper in Baton
Rouge. ``At his peak, he had three to five thousand people at two
regular services every Sunday. But his son and his wife have shut
him up. There's virtually nothing at his Bible College, and it's
not accredited by the Assembly of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister who reveled in his fame in the 1980s rarely
ventures beyond his moated mansion behind walls along Highland Road
or his business complex on Bluebonnet Boulevard here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a blanket policy of giving no interviews. That policy
has been in place for a lot of years,'' says Linda Westbrook, an
officer for Jimmy Swaggart Ministries who dismissed a reporter's
request for information about the scope of the ministry and a
meeting with Swaggart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no access to the press,'' says Gus Weill, a Baton
Rouge publicist who once handled the Swaggart account. ``It's a
closed shop, impossible to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear contemporary Swaggart, one must tune to 88.5 on the FM
dial in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio commentary, Swaggart equates himself with a
Biblical apostle. ``I'm like Paul, fighting devils and demons,'' he
says, making it clear he believes reporters are the agents of the
devil. ``Every week,'' he says, ``there's another newspaper article
with ridiculous, ribald stories. It's all outlandish, ridiculous
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to give his radio station's telephone number, to call
for more pledges. ``You can use your credit card,'' he says. ``I
hear the Holy Spirit. If you hear God pressing you, and you don't
have the full amount, you can still help.'' He advises that a $100
commitment can be paid off in $10 monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday, we raised $24,000. So far...we've raised $34,815. I
believe in the Lord's power to raise $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he is counting on the faith of his listeners. Then the
voice drops an octave. ``Satan,'' he says, ``didn't want this
ministry to work.''
</P>
<P>
   At his height, Swaggart could raise $140 million a year. A child
of Ferriday, La., a working-class town across the river from
Natchez, Miss., he grew up to become a bigger phenomenon than his
two singing first cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis (``Great Balls of
Fire'') and Mickey Gilley (``Looking for Love, in All the Wrong
Places''). As Carol Flake wrote in ``Redemptorama,'' a 1984 book
about televangelists:
</P>
<P>
   ``For devotees of good-ol'-boy gospel, swaggering Jimmy
Swaggart, who topped the religious TV ratings in 1983, offered
brow-mopping, piano-banging Pentecostalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies helped red-jacketed Swaggart security forces
handle the crowds that flocked to his Sunday services at the
futuristic Family Worship Center on the eastern edge of Baton
Rouge. It was the epicenter of a worldwide ministry televised in
145 countries. He commanded more than 500 missionaries and a staff
of 2,000. His Bible College graduated hundreds of disciples a year.
</P>
<P>
   Swaggart's downfall began after he became embroiled in a strange
holy war involving the high priests of televangelism. He
characterized Jim Bakker, a North Carolina preacher who wound up in
prison, as ``a cancer on the body of Christ that needs to be
excised.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his fire on another rival, an Assembly of God
minister in New Orleans named Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart purged
from the denomination with accusations that Gorman seduced the wife
of a fellow preacher as well as other parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, Gorman's son trapped Swaggart with a prostitute
at a seedy motel along Airline Highway in New Orleans in the fall
of 1987, flattening the tires on his car so Swaggart couldn't
escape until Gorman arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Swaggart, who had written that ``pornography titillates and
captivates the sickest of the sick,'' in his book ``Rape of a
Nation,'' was confronted with charges that he regularly paid $20 to
a prostitute with a tattooed cross on her arm to assume provocative
poses in front of him while he masturbated.
</P>
<P>
   In a tearful confession that was captured on film and came to
symbolize hypocrisy among television's prophets, Swaggart told his
congregation: ``I have sinned against you, my Lord, and I would ask
that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain until
it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness, never to be remembered
against me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   His prayer was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Assemblies of God defrocked Swaggart for refusing to abide
with a one-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Within the year, his consort, Debra Murphree, posed for raunchy
photos and sold her story to Penthouse magazine for $210,000 (her
agents, lawyers, and the IRS got all but $54,000). ``To me, he was
kind of perverted,'' she told the magazine. ``I wouldn't want him
around my children.''
</P>
<P>
   His tribulations persisted. Saying that he had been falsely
accused, Gorman won a $10 million judgment against Swaggart in a
highly publicized defamation trial in New Orleans in 1991. Gorman,
who acknowledged only one instance of adultery, said Swaggart
orchestrated a campaign to undermine Gorman's reputation by
charging him with scores of infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   After appeals prolonged the case another three years, court
records indicated that Swaggart's insurance company settled with
Gorman for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swaggart's still worth $100 million,'' says Hunter Lundy, a
Lake Charles lawyer who represented Gorman and has written a new
book on the case, ``Let Us Prey.'' ``They try to hide as much
information as they can, but last year he bought five new black
Mercedes. And he's still buying TV time across the country, most of
it's c.o.d.. (cash on delivery).''
</P>
<P>
   With his collection plates gone fallow, Swaggart's wealth is
based on real estate holdings in Baton Rouge, where he owns about
100 acres of prime commercial property next to the giant Mall of
Louisiana. He also makes money from a ministry building leased to
the state Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after he reigned over the Arbitron ratings, an aura
of Oz still lingers around Swaggart.
</P>
<P>
   His television programs are produced on the grounds of his
ministry, a complex of low-slung stone buildings with bunker-like
slits for windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who monitor Swaggart's work, many shows use
recycled tapes from the glory years when thousands came to
Swaggart's camp meetings. In later productions from the Family
Worship Center, Swaggart's cameramen focus on tight shots of the
congregation to avoid showing rows of empty pews.

DENVER HIGH ON CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Decades after miners emptied gold, copper, and silver
from the nearby Rockies, a frontier spirit burns brightly here once
again.
</P>
<P>
   This time it has fueled downtown makeovers, high-tech startups,
and a mayor who is not afraid to take a flier at landing the
ultimate media-op: the year 2000 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   It has also inspired scenes unimaginable a decade ago, including
a gawky, former oil-hunting geologist swirling a glass of
chardonnay with young Turks at an art museum benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same way Denver has taken a turn from mining mecca to
a Western hub of culture and tourism, that geologist _ a local
visionary named John Hickenlooper _ evolved into a beer baron and
pioneer of preservation after plummeting oil prices ended his first
career. He wound up launching the country's largest microbrewery,
and helping to turn skid row into LoDo, a lower downtown stretch
where the trendiest restaurants, galleries, and residential lofts
have sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have remade ourselves,'' says Hickenlooper, born a
12th-generation Philadelphian. ``We took a stodgy cowtown and
mostly through our own efforts _ not with big government grants _
recreated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention bid that started as a whim in 1996, when Mayor
Wellington Webb was looking for hometown headlines at the Chicago
convention, has grown into an earnest effort. As is the case with
Boston, few expected Denver to be a serious contender, much less
going head-to-head with Boston and Los Angeles as the final three
vying for the lucrative political bash.
</P>
<P>
   After cutting its teeth on such worldly events as the visit of
Pope John Paul II in 1993 and the Summit of the Eight (formerly
G-7) in 1997, Denver leaders say the viability of the city's bid
for the Democratic National Convention should not be too
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to take it to the next level,'' says Steven
Farber, a Denver lawyer and member of the city's convention site
committee. ``We have shown we can play with the big kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Denver boosters still see their bid as a longshot
behind Los Angeles and Boston, because Colorado remains a largely
GOP bastion. But the city's ace is Roy Romer, a former Colorado
governor who is the Democratic National Committee's general
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As a ``new American city'' and gateway to the West, Denver is
cast by supporters as offering a launching pad for the Democratic
Party to expand its base. As Denver's convention point man Mike
Dino says: ``We are a battleground and our message is, `Don't give
up on the West like the Democrats once gave up on the South.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's bid for the convention caps a growth spurt that saw
home sales rise 81.5 percent in 1998, office vacancies plummet, and
jobs proliferate to a supply of 1.5 for every city resident, by
city calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism draw is only expected to increase as more
entertainment destinations are completed, including a Six Flags
amusement park and an aquarium to join a newly minted downtown
retail and entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   The building binge goes on with enough superlatives to make a
Texan blush. There is the new airport, said to be the largest in
the country, and the largest performing arts center under one roof,
not to mention the Pepsi Center, already being touted as the most
technologically advanced arena when it opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon is a light-rail spur for downtown, to stanch the
flow of cars to big events, and a $180 million football stadium for
the Super Bowl-bound Broncos. The stadium is slated to cost roughly
half the price of the Patriots' planned new home in Hartford, and
is funded by a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Given a migration rate into Colorado that grew 18.2 percent from
1990 to 1997, much of it into the four fastest growing counties in
the nation, there should be no shortage of patrons for all the
attractions, according to the Center for the New West, a Denver
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Key to that growth is what Mayor Webb, a liberal Democrat
described by Ebony magazine as one of the 100 most influential
African-Americans in the country, calls the ``Denver attitude,''
which takes a decided disinterest in social pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The city's up-by-the-bootstraps ethic contrasts with convention
rivals Los Angeles, which leans on Hollywood moguls, and Boston,
still reliant on a blue-blood establishment. Denver stands tall on
Horatio Alger potential in a city that is not obsessed by image,
ancestry, or Ivy alma maters, its supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no limits here; people are very comfortable with who
they are,'' says Richard Higgins, 27, who, as head of a thriving
software company, is intent on hiring graduates from the business
schools back East that rejected him.
</P>
<P>
   Webb says his administration is equally broad-minded, whether a
developer is Republican, Democrat, or ``blue-eyed monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to know, `Do you have the intellect and the work
ethic to make the deal work?' '' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its growth and budding sophistication, however, nothing
drives home Denver's cowtown heritage like the annual National
Western Stock Show. Below the gleaming skyscrapers of US West and
Amoco last week, bronco-busters from the largest rodeo in the world
mingled with buttoned-down biomedical conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say the animal pungence that pervades the Rocky
Mountain air these days emanates from the stables at the Coliseum.
Others say it's just the persistent eau de Denver, an ambient cloud
that wafts between the tannery and the Purina Dog Chow factory.
</P>
<P>
   None of that should be confused with the brown cloud that slope
winds can trap in the Mile High valley and bring LA-level smog to
mind. But when a visitor raises either aerial subject, it is
quickly changed to the preferred topic of whether Denver has 300 or
310 sunny days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its growth, Denver has struggled to assemble enough
hotel rooms within a short drive to meet the DNC's standards. The
city now says it well surpasses the required 20,000 rooms, tallying
30,000, including rooms in Boulder. The convention's site committee
even went on helicopter rides last summer to check on the hotel
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The other bid weakness, in a state where GOP congressmen
boycotted President Clinton's State of the Union speech last week,
is a financial commitment by the Republican state government.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the city is putting up $6 million and the rest of
its $33.9 million bid would come from private sources. Denver would
prefer to be in Boston's shoes, with $6 million pledged by the city
and another $6 million from the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Denver figures it has muscled the maximum in pledges without the
final decision, which after impeachment delays is expected by
mid-February. ``If Denver is awarded the convention, the money will
come,'' Webb says.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has taken an amicable attitude toward Boston in the
convention sweepstakes, a respite from its LA-bashing. Denver would
see an LA victory as a slap against the West, from which it
considers Los Angeles a world apart, while a Boston win could be
seen as a logical response to the GOP choice of Philadelphia for
its convention.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is ``perceived as too Democratic and we're seen as not
Democratic enough,'' says Webb, who is incoming president of the US
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Webb sees Boston as a proper peer because its bid is also
mayoral-driven, unlike the private committee in LA that must
guarantee services from police and public works departments run by
a Republican mayor.
</P>
<P>
   To Webb's way of thinking, mayors are the key to any campaign.
``The only way you win the war is with ground troops,'' Webb says,
``and that's from the mayors.''

PRETEND PLAY ENRICHES DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In years gone by, children in Cheryl Silveira's family daycare
in Windham, N.H., would get very excited if she found a
refrigerator box. They could play for hours pretending it was a
boat or a house or maybe a space ship.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when she proudly plunked a refrigerator box into the
play area, the children's response was far different.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything,'' says Silveira. ``When I said, `Wow!
Isn't this a great box, we can pretend all kinds of things with
this!' they said, `But it's just a box.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Silveira crawled inside and pretended it was a school bus. The
six children, ages 1 1/2 to 5, were happy to crawl in and out with
her but, says a disappointed Silveira, ``They never got carried
away with it. It never was more than a box to them.''
</P>
<P>
   When a box is only a box, preschoolers may be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to create make-believe worlds lays the foundation
for academic learning and healthy development, according to
researchers. ``Being able to pretend is not a luxury, it's a
necessity,'' says Yale University psychologist Jerome Singer. One
of the nation's leading authorities on children's play and coauthor
of a classic on the subject, ``House of Make Believe'' (Harvard
University Press), Singer is sad but not surprised to hear what's
happening in Silveira's Bugle Bear Day Care. Unfortunately, he
hears it from teachers all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Smith, who runs a three-day-a-week laboratory preschool
at Ipswich High School as part of the child development curriculum,
sees the lack of imagination most in children's artwork. ``It used
to be that kids would prefer a blank piece of paper for coloring
and they'd create elaborate stories to go with the drawing. Now,''
she says, ``they either want a coloring book or they want us to
tell them what to draw.'' Smith, who has worked with preschoolers
for seven years, laments, ``They look to the adults for how things
should be rather than pretend how they'd like them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no single, overarching reason why teachers are seeing
less pretend play. Silveira attributes it to too much TV and
computer time. Singer says it's that, plus too many programmed
activities at too young an age, and overworked parents with too
little time to play. Early childhood educator Mary Mindess of
Lesley College has another theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society in general doesn't value play as a learning process,''
she says. ``We want results, as in test results, so we push
academics too early, letters and words at age 3. The message kids
get is that pretending isn't valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way for adults to understand pretend play is to
think of it as a filter that enables young children to view the
complicated pieces of their world up close and transform them into
pieces they can manage. Because it is every-day experiences that
loom largest, these are what children most need to examine and own.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how the preschooler watches several times a day as mom
stops what she's doing and gets very busy in the kitchen with her
noisy, shiny objects. What is she doing? Why can't she play
anymore? This must be very important.
</P>
<P>
   By playing kitchen herself, a preschooler not only imitates the
role of mom, she becomes mom, says early childhood educator Edgar
Klugman. ``First, she studies the person. Then she imitates the
actions, even the speech and movements. The more mom engages with
her _ `To scramble an egg, I crack it against a bowl' _ the more a
child learns rules of the role,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The more imagination a child brings to the play, the richer the
experience. Indeed, research shows that elaborate imaginary play
leads to increased language comprehension, vocabulary,
problem-solving skills, attention span, cooperation, empathy, and
social skills, according to Klugman, a professor at Wheelock
College who is known for his research on children's imaginary play.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the coin, research shows that children who
have little or poor experience with imaginary play are more
aggressive in later years, have less self-control and less success
with learning.
</P>
<P>
   The positive payoffs begin to accrue as early as kindergarten
and first grade and continue through adulthood, says Klugman.
``Without the rich experience of imaginary play as a child, an
adult is very limited. Leaders tend to have had very good play
experiences,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how make-believe play fosters development in three areas:
</P>
<P>
   --Emotionally. ``Because a child plays out feelings as well as
roles, it has a cathartic effect: The things he's worried about
will play out,'' says Mindess, who is coordinator and founder of
the New England Kindergarten Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was in a car accident with daddy. In his play, he'll
re-create the accident over and over, she says, until he has
control of the events and the feelings are less scary. Parents
typically don't even realize this is happening, partly because
we're too literal and don't recognize the play for what it is, says
Mindess, and partly because children don't need realistic props.
``They're very good at using objects as symbols, a block for a car,
for instance,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Intellectually. As he observes something and acts it out, he
learns about it. Every week, the 4-year-old goes to the grocery
store. At first, he is intrigued by the cashier, then watchful of
him. One day in his imaginary play, he is the cashier. The next
trip to the store, he watches more carefully because his play has
made more aware of nuances. He sees something he didn't see before,
perhaps the numbers on the register. Next time in his play, he says
to the make-believe customer, ``You owe me 10-teen dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's a misunderstanding in the learning, it
doesn't matter, because it's a self-correcting process,'' says
Mindess. ``He'll learn correct numbers another time. What's more
important is that the pretending gives the brain the opportunity to
make more and more links.'' The more links there are, the more
information the brain can take in, and that makes a child more open
to more experiences. In other words, Mindess says, the concrete
provides the basis for pretend play, but the pretending helps a
child make it her own and learn.
</P>
<P>
   --Morally. Because children use play to work through their own
issues, pretending may start off as imitation but quickly branch
out to reflect a child's perceptions. It's in this way that values
get absorbed, says Mindess. She gives an example of a preschooler
with a new-born brother who is caring for her doll, much like mommy
cares for the baby, except that suddenly she hits the doll and
says, ``You're a bad baby!'' It's through that process, she says,
that a child's conscience develops: She's working out for herself
the moral value of knowing it's wrong to hit the baby at the same
time she's coping with feelings of jealousy. ``Without the
opportunity to hit the doll, the feelings are pent up and the child
won't be as free to incorporate the positive values,'' or to keep
from acting on the negative ones, says Mindess.
</P>
<P>
   The more parents or caregivers can engage in pretend play with a
child, the more likely it is a child will make believe on her own,
and the more learning will occur. ``Sometimes you just need to
provide objects and show an interest,'' says Klugman. Other times,
as with the children in Silveira's care, ``You have to literally
show them,'' says Singer.
</P>
<P>
   It takes energy, interest, and know-how and some parents are
either clueless or uncomfortable with pretending. It's so
important, though, that Singer has a new project in New Haven to
teach low-income parents how to encourage imaginary play. Most
popular is the restaurant game:
</P>
<P>
   ``You imagine you're in a restaurant and you sit at the table
and you take turns being the waiter and the customer: `Oh, I have
two friends with me, so I need three seats.' Suddenly your child's
not just having fun playing with you, he's learning numbers and
words, like appetizer, and he's learning social amenities,'' says
Singer. ``We pitch that it helps with school readiness, which it
does,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's even more basic than that. Pretend play is practice of
real-life skills. ``It's a rehearsal,'' says Mindess.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --As important as it is for parents to be encouraging and
involved in pretend play, it's also important to back off once her
imagination is ignited. There's no bigger damper to creativity than
a parent who takes over the play.
</P>
<P>
   --Children don't need store-bought toys for pretend play.
Improvising with whatever is around the house is often better.
</P>
<P>
   --Observing a child's pretend play can give you a window into
the issues she's working on, but even if you don't like what you
see, don't scold her for the content of her play. If it's
troublesome to you, talk to a professional about it.
</P>
<P>
   --There's nothing wrong with a 3-year-old who only piles blocks
up and knocks them down, but you can try to engage his imagination
with a story around his play: ``Once there was a big tall tower
that was the biggest building in the city, but one day there was a
giant who had such a powerful sneeze he could make buildings fall
down. One day he had a terrible cold. . .''
</P>
<P>
   --By age 4, children typically engage peers in elaborate pretend
play where they use props. Interacting with each other _ ``Don't
you know waiters don't say that?!'' _ they learn from each other
ways to interpret various roles.
</P>
<P>
   --Reading daily to your child or telling her stories is the best
way to encourage pretend play.

`SHE'S ALL THAT' NOT ALL THAT GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``She's All That'' isn't much. One of the
approximately 150 high school comedies coming out this year, it's
as bland and generic as ``Varsity Blues'' was calculated and
pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Frightening as the prospect may be, at least we might remember
``Varsity Blues'' by the time the millennium gets here. No chance
of that happening with this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All That'' was written by former ``Meego'' staff writer R. Lee
Fleming Jr., with a tip of the hat to George Bernard Shaw; it's
essentially ``Pygmalion'' in the Palisades, minus the wit. The
director, Robert Iscove, has garnered some acclaim for his TV
specials ``Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein's Cinderella'' and ``Romeo &AMP;
Juliet on Ice.''
</P>
<P>
   They prove a good team for toothless teen traumatics. As for
telling a story, well, that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   What barely goes on here is that big man on campus Zack Siler
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) is so shocked when his popularity princess
girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (``Nash Bridges' '' Jodi Lyn O'Keefe)
dumps him for a spring-break fling, he takes the bet of smarmy
rival Dean Sampson (Paul Walker) to turn the school's biggest dweeb
into prom-queen material.
</P>
<P>
   Since designated drudge Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) looks
like Winona Ryder's cute little sister even before her glasses are
removed, there's no question that Zack will really fall for her _
and that, once made over, she'll win cliques of cool friends and
give the wicked Taylor stiff election competition.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, real problems like Dean's come-ons and the inevitable
revelation of the whole wager scam threaten the budding romance.
But how can it not work out? After all, apparent super jock Zack
has his adorably vulnerable side, too. He's been accepted to so
many Ivy League colleges, the secretly brilliant, sensitive
dreamboat really is struggling over which school to attend.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes to a head on prom night. Doesn't everything?
</P>
<P>
   Though the two leads defy the odds to give their characters a
few recognizably human traits, many of the film's actors apparently
were instructed to imitate balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also boasts the usual, post-``Clueless'' tin ear for
flip teen dialogue. However, some members of the huge, young cast
evidently got around this by making up good lines of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Usher keeps things lively as the gossipy DJ of the
school's ``90210''-ish radio station. And ``Scream's'' Matthew
Lillard steals every scene he's in as Taylor's embarrassing new
boyfriend Brock, a boneheaded former resident of MTV's ``Real
World'' who thinks he's not merely a celebrity but a talented one.
</P>
<P>
   A movie about that peculiarly deluded kind of loser would have
been fun. But Brock's few scenes are as peculiar as ``She's All
That'' dares to get. Even though its heroine is a nominal
individualist, the movie is all about fitting in with the in crowd
_ a crowd in which everyone strives to be the same as everybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   It's that movie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The upper east side of Manhattan in January is ground
zero for the American antique trade. It's here that trends are
spotted and auction records set in sweaty-palmed bidding wars. Top
dealers paraded their finest treasures here at the Winter Antiques
Show, which ended Sunday. ``The tremors in that room spread to all
corners of the antique world,'' said Clark Pearce of Essex, Mass.,
an antique furniture consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, ``save
their best things that turn up during the year'' for American
decorative arts auctions held during the show's 10-day run, said
Dean Lahikainen, a curator at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem,
Mass. Lesser shows and auctions surround these behemoths like
pleasure boats accompanying the QE2 into harbor. During this annual
gathering of the clan, the excited buzz of dealers, scholars, and
collectors builds to a consensus that elevates the finest
decorative objects to the status of art.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to an 18th-century Newport secretary which
sold at Sotheby's Jan. 17 for $8,250,500, 10 times the catalog
estimate and the second highest price paid for a piece of American
furniture. Like many a masterpiece, it has ``a provenance,'' which
means a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Stardom arrived partly because the stately mahogany secretary
was a new face on the auction stage. It had spent 200 years hidden
away in France, and it made a dramatic entrance when it reached
Sotheby's only days before the auction. Like many other previously
undiscovered treasures, it surfaced through unsolicited photographs
that owners sent Sotheby's for appraisal, said John B.A. Nye,
senior cataloger of the American Furniture and Decorative Arts
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It had been in the same family for eight generations, beginning
with the Rev. Nathaniel Appleton, who was minister of the First
Church in Cambridge, Mass. from 1717 to 1784 and a Harvard officer
for almost as long. His heirs took it with them when they went to
France on a diplomatic posting in 1800. They stayed there. So did
the Newport secretary.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the photographs, Sotheby's Leslie Keno and his
staff began their own six-year diplomatic initiative to coax the
family into sending the heirloom to auction, all under the greatest
secrecy. It was photographed in Paris and the catalog entry was
necessarily written without a thorough examination of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived in New York, infrared revealed the rare penciled
signature ``Made by Christopher Townsend.'' He was a founder of the
premiere family of American cabinetmakers, and the signature
immensely increased the secretary's value. Then experts discovered
peg holes from missing rounded feet. Within 24 hours, Sotheby's had
replacement feet made that restored the piece to its full 9-foot
height. The Newport piece was looking better and better. The
last-minute drama of these discoveries riveted attention as the
auction approached.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-carved doors characteristic of great Newport furniture
and the slanted desk front both open to reveal valanced pigeonholes
and drawers for filing documents and writing instruments. Its
height, domed top, and construction entirely from very expensive
and dense ``plum pudding'' mahogany (usually used only on the front
of even fine furniture), further marked it as exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only early piece of American furniture with silver
hardware,'' said Keno. ``Any original handles this old are rare,
and never have we seen any so beautiful, delicate, and expensive.''
The lopers that support the deskfront writing surface are cast as
vigilant falcon-like birds with green stone-inset eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware bears the rare stamp of Samuel Casey, a Rhode
Island silversmith whose talent couldn't save him from ruin when
his goldsmith's forge set fire to his house and shop. Insolvent,
Casey was arrested for counterfeiting dollars in 1770 and sentenced
to be hanged. The night before his scheduled execution, ``a
considerable number of People . . . with Faces black'd'' broke into
the jail and freed him, reported the Nov. 10, 1770 Providence
Gazette. After nine years as a fugitive, Casey was pardoned and
able to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Townsend, as the patriarch of a large and
industrious Quaker dynasty, led a quieter and more prosperous life,
schooling his numerous progeny in the craft of making fine
furniture. The deeply lobed shell front carvings in this early
secretary became the family trademark and, eventually, an American
icon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical sum paid for this secretary by an anonymous
private collector, which follows an all-time $12.1 million record
three years ago at Christie's for another Newport secretary by the
same Quaker family, illustrates how the best decorative arts are
gaining the same respect accorded fine paintings, even if such
status was the last thing on the minds of their makers when they
were struggling to keep the wolf from the door.
</P>
<P>
   As with fine arts, the top folk art and decorative pieces often
nowadays go straight from owner to auction house to buyer, leaving
traditional antique dealers out of the loop. But the best dealers
are still savvy trendspotters who indicate where collecting is
heading and what kinds of objects will be considered tomorrow's
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Multiculturalism was the greatest trend apparent at the 45th
Winter Antiques Show, which benefits the East Side Settlement
House. There was an intriguing focus on historic artifacts from the
collisions of cultures which eventually produced today's global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 opening of a new wing devoted to Asian export art at
the Peabody Essex Museum is evidence of swelling interest in Asian
art, particularly the portion that intersected with American and
European history to produce new hybrid visions.
</P>
<P>
   (So is the four-year-old International Asian Arts Fair, which
includes a dozen dealers who handle antique China Trade porcelain,
and which is scheduled for March 25-30 at the same Seventh Regiment
Armory where the Winter show was held.)
</P>
<P>
   Martyne Gregory's booth at the Winter show was devoted entirely
to early 19th-century portraits and harbor scenes painted in Canton
but commissioned by Europeans for export. They combined both
Western and Chinese visual styles.
</P>
<P>
   So did Marc J. Matz Antiques' furniture and objects made for
export in China, India, and Ceylon during the 18th- and early
19th-century colonial period.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Indies trade furniture and decorative arts, though
western in design, was reinterpreted by the artists in those
countries to create new forms, such as an English-style Indian pier
table with carved lotus flowers. Everything becomes new,'' said
Matz, who also maintains a shop in Cambridge. ``Museums, which have
neglected this area until recently, have bought all my most
important pieces in recent years.''

ONLY PERLMAN'S PERFORMANCE KEEPS `TINSELTOWN' ON THE MAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 1/2 STARS  
 
  
BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
LOS ANGELES _ ``Tinseltown'' is a misfired comedy about talentless
show-biz wanna-bes trying to hustle their way into the Hollywood
movie game. Some jokes about the people responsible for making the
film could be made here, but it would not be fair to do so. Not too
far off the mark in some of their cases, but still unfair.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on the play ``Self Storage'' by director Tony Spiridakis
and Shem Bitterman, the no-budget movie indeed spends a lot of time
inside one of those high-rise, concrete structures where people
lock up their excess stuff. These warehouses make singularly ugly
movie locations.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, on Christmas Eve, homeless would-be screenwriters Tiger
and Max (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) break into one of the buildings
to spend the night. They're surprised to discover many other people
living in the cramped units.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it? The storehouse manager Cliff (Ron
Perlman) is a failed actor who reads one of the guys' awful scripts
and loves it. He also may be the serial killer who's terrorizing
Hollywood by dressing up his victims' corpses in silly costumes.
But, hey, Tiger and Max figure, that only makes their new friend a
great source of screenplay material.
</P>
<P>
   Assorted other lowlifes _ Kristy Swanson's amoral film-school
careerist, Joe Pantoliano's producer who sleeps in the park _ try
to horn in on the action. Like the bad writers, they're all fairly
well-acted, but they never transcend the show-biz cliches they're
built to represent.
</P>
<P>
   The black comic idea here, that these bums are so desperate
they'll let a killer run amok if it gets them a movie deal, isn't
exactly cutting edge, either.
</P>
<P>
   We all saw ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was crueler. And smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tinseltown's'' one saving grace _ and he is a substantial one
_ is Perlman. He puts his imposing, cro-magnon form to frightening
good use here, but he also exhibits the film's only compelling
emotions and genuinely cagey intelligence. While most of
``Tinseltown'' is lazy satire that seems to have come from a dusty
old trunk, Perlman's performance is like a treasure found at a yard
sale. &QL;

 NEW YORK: ... recent years.''

<P>
   The centerpiece of Matz's display was a luminous 1833 oil
portrait by the great Philadelphia painter Rembrandt Peale of the
Rajah Rammohun Roy, an early Indian reformer who the admiring
artist painted in London, where Roy was campaigning for Indian
rights shortly before he died. ``To me it brings together all the
threads of east and west,'' said Matz.
</P>
<P>
   Another collision of cultures was recorded in the 9-foot oil
``The Crows Attempting to Provoke an Attack From the Whites on the
Big Horn River, East of the Rocky Mountains.'' It was painted by
Alfred Jacob Miller in 1841 after he witnessed the event on a
western expedition with Sir William Drummond Stewart. Tucked away
ever since in the Stewart family castle in Scotland, it, too, was
new to the market. Dealer Peter Tillou gave it a $8.5 million price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Several exhibitors devoted themselves to Native American crafts,
such as a beautiful Acoma ceramic olla, priced at $16,500, offered
by Morning Star Gallery of Santa Fe. If colonial American
cabinetmakers struggled to survive, one can only wonder what
dispossessed Native Americans would make of such prices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antique dealing is an inherently peculiar trade which a few
decades ago had, with notable exceptions, a reputation for veracity
only slightly higher than used cars sales. Much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 every item displayed at the Winter show has been
examined by teams of curators, scholars, and art restorers before
opening night and anything questionable removed, or ``vetted out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great increase in scholarship has helped the market,''
said Madison Avenue dealer Leigh Keno. It has also upgraded the
status of antiques. Now a piece can be described as an 1880 Acoma
ceramic olla instead of ``an Indian pot,'' or a 1745 Newport
secretary by Christopher Townsend instead of an ``old mahogany
desk.'' An eastern woodland Indian war club in the Guthman
Americana display can be carbon dated, and was, to prove its
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Like these treasures, the American antique trade itself has a
history. In this case, one that began in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Street was the national hub of the American antique
market for the first 60 years of its existence, beginning in 1876
when Americans began to prize original colonial furniture instead
of associating it with rural backwardness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickers'' would drive their wagons out to rural Concord and
Lexington, going door to door to ask if the inhabitants had any
``old furniture'' to sell. Early Boston and surrounding New England
towns were especially rich in antiques because their Puritan
culture and bustling Yankee trade fostered fine craftsmanship.
Cultural conservatism also inspired owners to hold onto family
pieces for many generations. While more style-conscious New Yorkers
regularly threw out the old to make way for the new, Bostonians
followed the once-popular adage: ``We don't buy hats. We have our
hats.'' They already had their furniture, too, and didn't care if
it was old.
</P>
<P>
   As antique American furniture gained wider appreciation, much of
it was sold by dealers to wealthy clients in Manhattan. During the
Depression, most of the top dealers migrated there, including
Israel Sack, whose family antique business became the country's
most successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston remains a player in the trade it once dominated. New
England antiques still command center stage, and many of the major
dealers and collectors have New England addresses. More antiques
still leave New England than arrive here, but the flow is hardly
one way, as it is with many provincial capitals.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH-TV's successful program, ``Antique Roadshow,'' invades
auditoriums around the country, inviting locals to bring their
treasures for on-air appraisals. National in scale, yet
Boston-produced and featuring many local experts, it's the latest
example of how Boston antiquarians manage to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you're not in the market for a masterpiece. What are
the new collectibles? Minor trends abounded at the Winter show,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --Cocktail broaches from the 1950s. Barbara Macklowe of Macklowe
Gallery in New York calls them ``mommy pins'' because Mom used to
wear them. Also re-emerging from their long hibernation in the rear
of family jewelry chests are Mom's classic pearls and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   --Ivory and scrimshaw are hot again. Hyland Granby Antiques of
Hyannis, Mass. had a tiny bone guillotine (with a female victim)
carved by French prisoners from their soapbones, and a remarkable
whale's-tooth scrimshaw carved by a Marine aboard the HMS Beagle
when Charles Darwin was aboard that sold for a record $65,000. Marc
Matz had a circa 1770 engraved Indian ivory jewel cabinet and
dressing mirror with English scenes that for $12,000 to $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Garden statuary has really taken off. Barbara Israel Garden
Antiques of Katonah, N.Y., had a pair of 1880 cast iron lions for
$19,500. Or a pair of carved stone sphinxes for $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Young couples are buying antique Victorian engagement rings.
Just the thing for a Valentine's Day proposal.
</P>
<P>
   --The age of celebrity has sent document collectors scurrying
for big names, reported Kenneth W. Rendell, who offered a $3 check
signed by Marilyn Monroe for $5,750. ``But something with real
content by a person who's not famous, like a soldier's Civil War
diary, is a better value.''
</P>
<P>
   --``Really great painted furniture has gone through the roof,''
reported Winterthur Museum scholar Brock Jobe.
</P>
<P>
   --Art and artifacts related to western expansion. A first
edition report on the Lewis and Clark expedition commanded $65,000
at Bauman Rare Books. (Owner David Bauman picked first editions of
``Angela's Ashes'' and ``Cold Mountain'' as future collectibles.
But don't lose the dust jackets.)
</P>
<P>
   --Early 19th-century silk embroidered pictures. They kept young
finishing school ladies busy long after they finished all those
alphabet samplers.
</P>
<P>
   --Antique walking sticks. Highland Granby Antiques had canes
that contained watches, guns, telecopes, swords, and watercolor
paintboxes. Wayne Pratt of Woodbury, Conn., had a fantastic German
cane stand carved with writhing snakes and grotesque animal and
demon heads on consignment from the owner, who had brought it into
WGBH's ``Antique Roadshow.''
</P>
<P>
   --Anything related to hit movies. Letters by World War II
figures such as Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower command
even greater cache and cash after Steven Spielberg's ``Saving
Private Ryan'' this year. Rendell quickly sold a $25,000 floor plan
of the first class sections of the Titanic which were sent to the
London parents of a prospective passenger. He decided not to go.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   CAPE TOWN _ The theory was simple. After putting my own garden
to bed for the winter, I'd flee to the Southern Hemisphere, where
the seasons are reversed. I'd enjoy other gardens while not
neglecting my own.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I didn't escape the guilt. Autumn offered no free
time to cut back, tidy up, or mulch, and my garden is filled with
brown stalks that stare at me accusingly every morning. But I
didn't give my own grounds a thought while I was in South Africa,
where I marveled at the glories of Kirstenbosch, one of the world's
greatest gardens, met an eccentric plantsman at the University of
Stellenbosch, and talked with a remarkable young woman whose
contribution to post-Apartheid society is teaching disadvantaged
people the florist's art.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Town was founded as a garden. In 1652, a young merchant
named Jan van Riebeeck was sent to the Cape by the Dutch East India
Company. His mission: to plant a 43-acre vegetable patch in what is
now the center of town, to grow fresh produce for the crews of the
ships on the long voyage to the East Indies. You won't find any
veggies in the ``Company's Gardens'' nowadays, just a tranquil
oasis of fountains and flower beds, a place where Cape Town
residents feel free to lie on the lawns.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer variety of South Africa's flora is mind-boggling. More
than 8,500 species grow on the Cape, a relatively tiny area which
is the smallest by far of the world's six floral kingdoms, but has
the greatest variety of plant species. It is particularly rich in
``fynbos'' _ hardy plants that include the king protea, South
Africa's national flower. The protea is a sturdy, spikey,
sculptural bloom known for its ability to regrow quickly after a
fire _ an appropriate symbol of the new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest of all South Africa's botanical gardens is
Kirstenbosch, which sprawls at the base of Cape Town's Table
Mountain, the city's symbol. The meandering, asymmetrical design
here is the opposite of the Euclidean borders of Cape Dutch manor
house gardens, although some of Kirstenbosch's ``natural'' rock
formations conceal elaborate drainage systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstenbosch was once the property of Cecil John Rhodes, prime
minister of the Cape in the 1890s, who planted a grand allee of
ficus, camphor, and other nonindigenous trees from the farthest
reaches of the British Empire. If you snap a camphor twig in two,
it becomes an instant inhaler to clear your sinuses. (You are not
allowed to break branches off trees, of course, and I didn't. But
my official Kirstenbosch guide did.)
</P>
<P>
   When Rhodes died in 1902, he left Kirstenbosch to the people of
South Africa. Rhodes had imported plants; ironically, his estate
was to become the world's first major botanical garden devoted to
local plants. Part of Kirstenbosch's purpose nowadays is to
convince South Africans who grew up thinking that the English
perennial border was the zenith of the gardener's art to choose
indigenous plants instead, plants able to survive disease and
drought. Heaven knows there are enough of them: Kirstenbosch grows
nearly 6,000 species of southern African plants, with another 900
growing wild.
</P>
<P>
   The garden also has an active program of reintroducing species
threatened by illegal collection in the wild. Cycad-snitchers use
that plant for medicinal purposes or in private gardens: You
actually need a permit to own a cycad in South Africa, and one in
Kirstenbosch has a cage around it, to prevent unscrupulous
collectors from hacking bits of it off.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstenbosch boasts a new state-of-the-art entrance where you
get your first glimpse of the garden's logo _ the fan-like profile
of the bird of paradise. A yellow bird of paradise has been
christened ``Mandela's Gold.'' Part of the entrance is the new
shop, with a world-class selection of garden ornaments and
accessories: palatial birdhouses, plant pedestals clad in rugged
bark, stone sculpture. The urns would be difficult to lug back to
America, but a big Zulu basket can become carry-on luggage, I've
found: You just put everything else inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A glorious new conservatory at Kirstenbosch houses one third of
the world's succulents. Collected from the drier areas of southern
Africa, they couldn't live outside in Cape Town's wet climate. The
conservatory's centerpiece is a century-old, 7-ton baobab tree,
accompanied by a display of ``Things You Can Do With a Baobab''_
including weaving its bark into hats or bags. Here you'll also read
legends including the one that accounts for the baobab's
upside-down appearance. It seems that God gave each animal a tree,
and the hyena, which got the last of them, a baobab, was so upset
he planted it upside down. The baobab is the world's largest
succulent, and hollowed out trunks have been used as stables, pubs,
and a 30-person bus shelter. At the other end of the succulent
spectrum are plants so tiny you might miss them, and plants that
camouflage themselves, blending right in with the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor gardens are divided into specialized sections
including a ``Braille Trail'' for the blind, with a rope to hold
onto and flowers chosen for their fragrance and feel. Another
section is devoted to the plants used by the Khoi people, who
inhabited South Africa long before white settlers arrived. The Khoi
ate some plants and used others as medicine, dyes, teas, and even
bedding. A ``Water Wise Garden,'' just a year old, features
agapanthus, freesias, pelargoniums, aloes, and other plants that
thrive on little water. A free pamphlet on this garden offers a
valuable how-to even for gardeners from northeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   And there's an ``Evolution Garden'' _ wire sculptures of plants
from 200 million years ago _ that gave me ideas about doing the
same in my suburban Boston yard, and the heck with all that unruly
stuff I keep killing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wim Tijmens had a tough time creating a botanical garden for the
Mountain Kingdom of Lesotho. The king's sheep have grazing rights
there, so they eat the plants. And Tijmens had to work around the
location where a sacred circumcision ritual is held.

DIPPING VS. STRIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to take off all the woodwork and doors in my house and
have them dipped, so I can have a natural finish rather than paint
as they are now. Is there anything as far as damage I should be
alerted to?
</P>
<P>
   DIERDRE MANNING, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's an ambitious project, but worth doing instead of
trying to strip them in their place; that is a nightmare. There are
two things you should be alerted to: Do not dip anything that is
glued, because the stripping material will dissolve it. Woodwork is
not glued, and doors are usually not glued, so that shouldn't be a
problem. Secondly, make sure that the dipping process does not turn
the wood gray. You should get that in writing from the dipper. Lyes
and other strippers may turn the wood gray, and while it might be
able to be sanded to reveal new wood, it is a tedious process. If
you varnished the gray wood, it would turn very dark.
</P>
<P>
   If the wood comes out nice and new looking, you can apply two
coats of a satin polyurethane varnish. Use a water-based
polyurethane, which will darken it less than oil-based
polyurethane, but you have to apply it very, very thinly; too thick
a coat of water-based polyurethane can stay cloudy. This is
especially critical for the second coat. If you have qualms about
this, use an oil-based polyurethane; it is less convenient to use
because it will smell longer as it cures, and cleanup is a pain.
</P>
<P>
   If you want the wood a little darker, use a penetrating oil
stain before varnishing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My carbon monoxide detectors are showing elevated levels. The
higher levels occur between 9 and 11 a.m. The boiler is 31 years
old, but I don't know how old the oil burner is. The fire chief
suggested servicing the oil burner to make it burn cleaner. I did
that, and made sure the smoke pipe leading to the chimney is sealed
properly and is sound. The carbon monoxide levels are lower, but
still elevated. The oil man said the problem is not the burner but
the car in the attached garage. Could that be possible?
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN EINSTEIN, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sure could, to give a short answer to a long question. In
the morning, when you back the car out of the garage and close the
door, you may be trapping a cerain amount of carbon monoxide,
despite moving the car out quickly. When the burner comes on, it is
pulling air from the garage and anywhere else it can get air that
it needs to burn the oil, and some of that garage air containing
carbon monoxide gets into the house. In the afternoon, when you
drive the car into the garage and shut it off quickly, you may be
producing less carbon monoxide than in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is multifaceted. First, get in the habit of leaving
the garage door open for longer than you have in the past. Second,
open windows in the basement just a tad so the burner can use air
in the basement without pulling air from the garage. Third, since
open windows in the basement can cool it off excessively, provide
the burner with its own outside air. Extend a PVC pipe or any other
kind of duct from a basement window or other opening leading
directly to the burner.
</P>
<P>
   Then check your detectors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting coincidence, relating to Steven Einstein's
problem with carbon monoxide: Betsy Amsel of Melrose, Mass. said
her oil burner man told her that burning oil does not produce
carbon monoxide, and that she does not need a carbon monoxide
detector. ``How can that be?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   How can it be indeed, because it isn't. Any fuel _ solid,
liquid, and gaseous _ produces carbon monoxide when it burns. Some
produce more than others, but all produce some. So, go ahead and

   Q. I am replacing the ceiling tiles in my bathroom. I found the
flat, smooth, painted tiles you mentioned that are washable (as
opposed to acoustical tiles with holes or fissures), but the people
at Home Depot said the tiles will not hold onto the ceiling in a
damp environment. I am concerned about that because part of the
ceiling is over a tub shower. Will the tiles work in that area, and
more important, will they hold?
</P>
<P>
   ED TAKACH, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing much of anything will stick well on a damp surface,
but you should be able to put up the tiles with adhesive if the
surfaces are dry, because most adhesives for ceiling tiles are
water resistant, and are generally unbothered by moisture. And, if
you are reluctant to use adhesive, you could install 1-by-3-inch
strapping to the ceiling, then staple the new tiles to that
strapping.
</P>
<P>
   And, while you are at it, consider putting in an exhaust fan.
Properly used, this fan will keep the bathroom as dry as it every
will be.

LIVING WITHOUT TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago my husband, Jack, and I were looking for
something on TV that would interest us. I saw an ice skating show
and Jack caught sight of the Celtics. Immediately we abandoned our
lofty goal to compromise. We couldn't agree. We wouldn't back down.
``OK, let's just get rid of the TV,'' I exploded. ``Fine with me!''
he replied.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, with no entertainment but each other.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, I settled down at home alone to watch TV in
secret. No matter which buttons I pushed, there was nothing but
snow on the screen. That's when I realized that without telling me,
Jack had disconnected the wire that led to our rooftop aerial. I
really couldn't blame him. TV used to hold me hostage. I'd choose
to watch one show and hours later, I'd still be compulsively
circling from one dreary channel to another. Jack would have to
break the spell by dragging me away from the set; I would
eventually thank him for rescuing me. It was not a scenario he
enjoyed repeating night after night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I missed TV, especially when Jack was out. Having finally
noticed that I was often home alone, I felt sorry for myself. I was
jealous that he had more places to go than I did. I was low on
energy. I didn't want to go out after dark. I moped a lot.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, however, I noticed how many interesting classes
and programs were offered in our town. I taught a course at our
church. I started sewing again. I finally had time to read for
pleasure. I founded the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project and
used my time in the evening to make calls. Jack and I often went to
a movie at our local theater or rented videos. We lit a fire and
settled down on the couches in front of the wood stove to read or
play cards. We talked to each other.
</P>
<P>
   My life began to feel more spacious.
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day, I realized I was no longer tired after
dinner. I began to understand that the spell which TV casts begins
before you turn on the set, in that moment when you look inside
yourself and find that you have no energy for anything else. In the
meantime, like a cult, TV has weaned you away from anything else
that might nourish you. It's hard to give it up if you no longer
have faith in your ability to amuse yourself or have come to
believe that it's too much trouble to seek other people out.
Seduced into passivity, you're left with the feeling that TV is
your only true, dependable, and undemanding option.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after Jack and I were watching TV in his hospital
room as he recovered from an illness last winter that we actually
experienced how alien sound bites, laugh tracks, constant
commercials, rapidly shifting images, gratuitous violence,
pointless discussions, and stupid jokes are to our nature. Not only
did the general flow of TV images fail to appeal. It actually felt
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of what you're missing,'' friends occasionally say to
us, as if with every choice we make, good or bad, we aren't always
ruling out a million alternatives. Our local video store has
Masterpiece Theatre tapes and HBO specials. Jack watches sports at
a friend's house. I listen to books on tape and catch all the news
I can handle on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I think I'm catching more news than I can handle. I
don't want strangers' voices in my head anymore. Thoreau said,
reflecting on the media in 1845, ``If we read of one man robbed or
murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel
wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the
Western Railroad . . . we need never read of another. One is
enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care
for a myriad instances?'' How many more opinons about impeachment
can I absorb before my head explodes?
</P>
<P>
   I want to lower my daily dose of global input, to replace my
second-hand opinions about far-flung events and concentrate on the
life around me. For too long I've treated my mind like an empty
container, filling it with expert opinions and lurid stories about
celebrities, as if keeping attuned to this flow of information was
to my benefit. Now I want to see why I feel so uneasy with silence.
</P>
<P>
   My father always said, ``Take one step and if it feels good,
you'll know you're heading in the right direction.'' I'll still
turn to NPR in the morning, but I've already started listening to
music while I'm making dinner in the afternoon. If the world comes
to an end, I'm sure someone will call and tell me. A lifelong media
junkie, I never expected to find myself walking away from the
myriad distractions this culture offers, but it's time to find out
what happens in my soul when I can hear myself think.

   Each year millions of fans bet on the Super Bowl. It's the
biggest betting day of the year in Las Vegas, where gambling on
football is legal. No one knows exactly how much is wagered
illegally on the game, but conservative estimates are in the
neighborhood of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There's so much ``action'' that the betting propositions have
gone far beyond a simple win or loss. This year bettors can wager
on dozens of propositions, some of them odd, to put it mildly. For
example: Will Denver Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith catch more
passes against the Falcons than Bruins' Ray Bourque scores goals
against Carolina?
</P>
<P>
   If there's money to be made, why not consider some additional
propositions?

<P>
   Dale Bumpers will be summoned to give a halftime pep talk to the
Falcons: 5-2.

<P>
   Number of fans at Pro Player Stadium injured while trying to do
a tsunami ``wave'': Over/under 5,000.

<P>
   Which contains more cubic feet of hot air: The Goodyear Blimp,
2-1; Pat Summerall, 5-2; John Madden, 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan will announce at halftime that he quit basketball
in order to become an NFL quarterback: 20-1.

   TAKE-BOS  
 CAPE TOWN, South Africa: ... is held.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the names of the rare species he cultivates at the
University of Stellenbosch, Tijmens's rather daunting title is in
Latin: He's Praefectus Horti, Hortus Botanicus. What this boils
down to is that he runs what he calls an ``outdoor laboratory''
filled with plants, including many extremely rare ones. While
Kirstenbosch cultivates South Africa's indigenous plants, Tijmens
brings plants from all over the world to South Africa. He also
lures gardeners from all over: They come to see a world's worth of
species in one place. And he leads tours, to the ``Impressionist''
gardens of France and the Silk Road in China, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   He's particularly proud of a Welwitschia mirabilis, his rarest
plant of all, from the Namibian desert. A stump of the plant has
been carbon dated to over a thousand years old. ``It grew in a
place where there is no rain,'' Tijmens says in an awed tone. He's
also pleased with his Pelargonium collections, which have lured
some visitors he doesn't want to attract: A perfume manufacturer
stole a cutting recently. He's working on breeding a yellow
geranium, and grumbles about the possibility of someone secretly
snipping off some of it.
</P>
<P>
   He's a zealot. ``We'll do anything to teach people about
plants,'' he says. ``We link students from all disciplines with
plants.'' He even organizes exhibitions of plant art _ a show of
Chinese paintings of flowers during my visit. He's so ardent about
plants that he trails after me as I leave his garden, talking all
the while, as we pass by yellow camellias from China, ginkgos from
Japan, and California redwoods. When he stops at the garden's edge,
though, he's surrounded by one of the most beautiful of South
African trees _ the blue jacaranda. When in bloom, it is the South
African equivalent of cherry blossoms in Japan _ an event. On the
day I talked to Tijmens, the jacarandas were shedding their
startlingly lovely lavendar blossoms onto the grass below, creating
an opulent tapestry of color.

   Alison Soanes was an out-of-work personnel manager with a
fondness for flowers when she took a humble job at the least humble
hotel in South Africa _ Cape Town's legendary Mt. Nelson. She began
by washing out vases, but soon graduated to the post she's held the
last five years, that of head florist. Responsible for all the
flowers in a hotel that is an outpost of the British Empire,
stylistically speaking, she designs the kind of extremely full
arrangements you might encounter in a great British country house.
</P>
<P>
   She's also been innovative, incorporating vegetables, fabrics,
fruits, sheaves of wheat sparkling with silver stars, locally made
crafts, or even toys into the flower arrangements she creates for
the hotel and for private clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen of Denmark had one of Soanes's vast arrangements of
proteas wrapped up in brown paper, to take home on the plane.
Princess Michael of Kent had a bed of Mt. Nelson agapanthus dug up,
to take back to England.
</P>
<P>
   Soanes spends far more time with disadvantaged people than with
European royalty, though. A missionary preaching a gospel of flower
power, she's instituted an apprenticeship program for uneducated
hotel workers stuck in the most menial of jobs. She takes them to
restaurants, museums, and theaters where they couldn't have gone in
the Apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a florist, you have to understand music, architecture,
and poetry,'' she says. ``Floral design is about composition and
color.'' It's also about the designer's own life, so she starts by
having her students make flower arrangements that represent their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry about the `Rainbow Nation' is that it will all
blend,'' she says. She tries to get her students to cherish their
differences of style. The Cape Malay community, for instance, loves
vivid color, and paint their houses bright blue, yellow, and red.
``They even spray-paint their flowers,'' Soanes says approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   She's organized flower-arranging classes for children and made
her workshops a movable feast, taking them to impoverished areas. A
Soanes student has opened a florist's shop in a township, one of
the sprawling shanty towns that ring Cape Town. ``You have to have
beauty around you to keep your dignity,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She's also a champion of local plants. ``Plants we'd think
boring fascinate outsiders,'' she says. ``We've been very British
in our gardening. That's changing. We're now using indigenous bulbs
that people used to ignore or slight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Mt. Nelson has lost its colonial ambience, indoors
or out. To celebrate its centennial this year, the grande dame is
introducing a new rose, imported three years ago from American
breeders Jackson and Perkins and nurtured by South Africa's biggest
commercial nursery, Malanseuns Pleasure Plants of Pretoria.
Initially identified only as BC 89 009934, it has been rechristened
``The Mount Nelson Rose,'' and, yes, the frilly bloom is pink with
white highlights, to match the colors of the hotel's famous facade.
Strolling through the hotel grounds, Soanes stops to sniff a Mt.
Nelson Rose _ and sneeze. ``I have the most terrible hay fever,''
she confesses.

<P>
   Elizabeth Scholtz has been leading garden and wildflower tours
to her native South Africa for more than three decades _ not very
often at first, for political reasons. ``I was told I was
supporting a white supremacist regime,'' she says. ``But plants and
gardens don't have anything to do with politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholtz, director emeritus of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, has
increased the frequency of her tours in the post-Apartheid era.
She's going annually now, usually in September, which is autumn for
us but spring in South Africa _ and peak wildflower season. Her
tours visit Kirstenbosch and other botanical gardens, as well as
private gardens and wildflower fields. She includes a stay at one
of the luxurious private game reserves for which South Africa is
rightly famous, and she chooses first-rate hotels. The tours last
about 2 1/2 weeks and have cost around $6,000, including airfare.
</P>
<P>
   Dates for the tour are Sept. 12-27; the exact itinerary is still
in the works. For information, contact Elizabeth Scholtz at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Ave., Brooklyn, NY

BE SURE YOU UNFREEZE YOUR PIPES, AND KEEP THEM THAT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It ain't ever gonna freeze this winter, it seems, so I wonder if
the tulips will bloom nicely this spring. Those bulbs, you know,
need a period of freezing before they bloom.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense worrying about that, though, because there is
nothing you can do about it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Well, then I guess I don't have to worry about freezing pipes
this winter because they won't freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of winter left, and Mother Nature has a
habit of hitting with all she's got at us at unseasonal times of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   So it's time to worry about freezing pipes, and to do something
about them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thawing them out &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, what to do when they do freeze? Sometimes, if water
freezes in a straight run of pipe, you won't get a leak or a burst,
so you can just wait for it to thaw out.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, a freeze will occur at a bend in the pipe,
increasing the chance of a burst or leak. You might not get a leak
as long as the water stays frozen, but once it thaws, watch out!
And, if water freezes in a heating pipe, you really have to do
something, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   First locate where the freeze is, and turn on the faucet served
by the pipe. Second, apply heat to it. When thawing out a frozen
pipe, apply the heat nearest to the faucet, so that the melted
water can flow out the faucet. If the pipe is thawed out further
from the faucet, you could get serious pressure problems caused by
solid ice turning to steam.
</P>
<P>
   If the pipe is exposed, usually in the basement, where most
freezing occurs, wrap heavy towels around the pipe and pour hot
water on the towels. Move the process down a little and pour on
more hot water. Melted water will flow from the open faucet,
signaling success.
</P>
<P>
   Another heat source is a putty torch, a small electric coil
designed to soften window glazing putty. But don't put it directly
on the pipe. Intense heat turns the ice to steam, which has enough
pressure to burst the pipe. Hold it a few inches away from the
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Hot air will help, but do not use a hot- air gun (too hot); a
hair dryer will do, but you also might burn it out with prolonged
use.
</P>
<P>
   Or, hang a 100-watt trouble light (an extension cord with a bulb
in a cage) on the pipe. Use the cage to keep the hot bulb from
direct contact with the pipe, or just hang it on the pipe. This is
a slow process, but it also is a good way to keep the pipe from
freezing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the pipe is not visible, hidden in a wall, set up a
floodlight with a good reflector, or any large-wattage bulb to aim
at the wall. This technique is slow but steady.
</P>
<P>
   If you thaw out a pipe that has burst or has a leak, be sure to
shut off the water after the thaw. Then make repairs, or call your
favorite plumber.
</P>
<P>
   OK, those are the things you can do in an amergency to get you
back in business. But you're not through yet. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Insuring for the future &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now your priority is to make sure the same pipes, or any others,
don't freeze in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Most pipes are in the basement, and are unlikely to freeze
because even in an unheated house, the temperature in a closed
basement rarely gets below 40 degrees Fahrenheit in winter.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes pipes go perilously close to a concrete or stone
foundation. This masonry is a cold sink (the opposite of a heat
sink), getting as cold as it is outdoors. As a result, the nearby
pipes freeze.
</P>
<P>
   A quick solution is to provide those pipes with a permanent or
at least a winter-long heat source. A trouble light with a 100-watt
bulb hung on the pipe will keep it from freezing. Use one or more.
It's a rather expensive way to do it, but it is better _ and
cheaper _ than trying to heat the whole basement.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent solution is to relocate the pipes two feet or more
from any large amounts of masonry.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't move the pipes easily, insulate them. For water
pipes, use the foam- type tubes that wrap lengthwise around the
pipes. They can be cut to turn corners, too. Be sure to cover every
trace of pipe, and cover all joints with duct tape. Do vertical
joints, where the tubes butt each other end to end, and horizontal
joints, where the tube is slit lengthwise. Be sure to buy the
right-sized tube to fit the pipe snugly.
</P>
<P>
   Where pipes go through a very cold crawl space, it might be wise
to use a special compressed fiberglass insualtion tube, which gives
much more insulation. It is sold at plumbing supply shops.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your pipes are not subject to freezing, it's a good idea
to insulate them: The water in an insulated hot-water pipe will not
cool off as fast, saving you water- heating costs. And insulation
on all pipes will help prevent condensation on them in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, most water pipes were exposed. Most of us
over a certain delicate age can remember the water pipes _ and
steam and hot-water pipes _ going up the wall and exposed for all
to see. But they didnt freeze, did they?
</P>
<P>
   Then builders started putting the pipes in walls, not paying
attention to where they are located.
</P>
<P>
   When pipes tend to freeze in the wall cavity, keeping them from
doing so is difficult. If they are in an uninsulated cavity, blow
insulation in that cavity, and of course all others, which will
save you heating costs.
</P>
<P>
   If the pipe is nearer the outside wall than the inside wall,
then insulating the cavity might not work; if the pipe is near the
outside wall in an insulated cavity, this won't help much, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you will have to open up the cavity to see just what
is there. You can move the pipe to the inside wall and insulate the
cavity. This is a lot of work but it cannot be helped. At least you
will be virtually guaranteed that those particular pipes will not
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. Until you are able to take down the wall surface
covering a suspected freezing pipe, you can try this: Cut a hole in
the cavity at the top and bottom; put a decorative grille over
them. Warm air from the house will circulate in that cavity,
insulated or not. There will be some, but not a lot, of heat loss,
and your pipes will not freeze.

ADVERTISERS LOOK AT SUPER BOWL AS A WINNING FORUM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Super Bowl may be the only show on television where people
leave the room during the program, but make sure they are back by
the time commercials come on.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole? Not by much. Super Bowls can be blowouts, and the
plays and games quickly become clouded memories. But it is the ads,
which cost as much for 30 seconds as the average person will make
in 60 or so years, that linger long after we have forgotten the
names of the games' most valuable players.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the conversation at the office Monday: Will it be
more about Atlanta's run defense and Denver's ground game, or the
TV ads? Could you blow $1.6 million, which is what advertisers pay
for a half-minute Super Bowl spot, in 30 seconds? Tick ... 40 BMW
Roadsters ... tick ... 80,200 copies of any CD from K-tel (plus
postage and handling) ... tick ... 22,857 Juiceman juicers.
</P>
<P>
   If you got in on the ground floor in the first bowl (which
wasn't even called the Super Bowl) in 1967, a 30-second spot would
have cost $42,000. But no matter how you look at it, buying a Super
Bowl spot is a crapshoot for advertisers. Sometimes the money is a
waste, especially in the second half of a one-sided game, or if the
commercial is not good enough to rise above the pack. The ones that
stick out do earn their money. And are able to burn their way into
America's cultural conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Apple's ``1984'' ad in, appropriately, 1984. The
brilliantly stark spot presented an Orwellian vision of an
IBM-dominated world, and not only predicted the personal computer
boom but also set the Super Bowl as the ultimate advertising stage.
</P>
<P>
   As far as more recent commercials go, the front-runners include
the nation's foremost pitchman, Michael Jordan. Jordan scored
back-to-back hits in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Nike's ``Hare Jordan,'' a duet with screen legend Bugs
Bunny, not only helped sneaker sales but spawned the movie ``Space
Jam.'' The next year, Jordan teamed up with old court nemesis Larry
Bird in the funniest game of Horse ever seen in McDonald's
``Showdown.'' The spot added the phrase, ``Nothing but net'' to the
nation's vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the two most memorable commercials were Budweiser's
unveiling of the lizards vs. the frogs, and McIlhenny Tabasco's
Pepper Sauce mosquito ad (which actually debuted in 1997).
Tabasco's clever ad featured a mosquito that quickly vaporized
after biting a man who had just ingested Tabasco. It did wonders
for the small company.
</P>
<P>
   This year, that's what Hotjobs.com is counting on. The small
Internet company is going against its largest competitor,
Monster.com, in a high-stakes, first-of-its-kind shootout between
two on-line job-recruiting outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never would have expected the Super Bowl to turn into a
battle ground for Internet job sites,'' Hotjobs spokesman Robert
Liu said. ``For beer? For cola? Sure. We didn't want that to
happen. We tried to ask for exclusivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing doing. But the company expected to post $4 million in
sales this year is staking half that amount, including production
costs, on one 30-second blip in time. And the commercial to be
aired see Sunday wasn't even its first choice. An earlier version
was considered too risque by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Too risque by Fox? Funny, I don't think that phrase has ever
been used before in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Liu hopes the Hotjobs' spot kicks the snot out of Monster, but
it doesn't matter. Since the little New York-based company
announced late last year it was buying a Super spot, the number of
resumes added to its system doubled. ``We caught a lucky star
there,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what a lot of advertisers are hoping for on Super
Bowl Sunday, a little luck bought with a bucket of cash.

WHEN FRIENDS BECOME THE SOURCE OF E-MAIL CLUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you have e-mail overload? Is your mailbox overflowing with
joke files, chain letters, random musings, political treatises, or
knee-jerk petitions? Do you get lost in your in box, searching
desperately for that urgent memo from your boss and all you can
find is a Dr. Seuss-style poem about Zippergate or a recycled
rumor, long since proven false, about designer Tommy Hilfiger?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you're not
alone. You're receiving what what I call spam from friends, or
fram, for short. Technically, the notion of spam from friends is an
oxymoron: Spam is netspeak for odious, unsolicited mail hawking
get-rich-quick schemes or adult entertainment. Spam is a legal
issue; fram is not. But it can become cumbersome or downright
annoying when you're bombarded with too many promises of good humor
or good karma when you're busy researching a serious topic (like
Internet jokes). It's a problem, and it's getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   A study released last week revealed that 41 percent of Americans
use the Internet, up from 14 percent in 1995. Some 35 percent of
the population uses e-mail, up from 10 percent three years ago,
according to the survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press. Those numbers indicate that roughly a
quarter of the population began using e-mail in the past three
years, which means many of them are still in the early romance
stage when they create gigantic group lists to communicate with a
few hundred of their closest confidants.
</P>
<P>
   That means more jokes. More chain letters. More petitions.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? The on-line netiquette guides don't offer a
standard way to just say no. It's awkward; these are your friends,
after all. We turned to the experts for some practical advice. Mark
Leavitt, research director at International Data Corp. in
Framingham, Mass., says, ``Just can it, delete it'' without reading
it. But what about the one time a friend sends news of a death in
the family or a windfall in the lottery?
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt points out that one way to manage fram is to sign up for
one of the free e-mail services offered on Internet portals like
Hotbot and Yahoo and request that friends direct mail to that
address. And some e-mail packages, like Eudora, have built-in
filters, so you can automatically instruct the software to direct
mail from certain people to separate folders and look at it when
you have a free week or two. (I use Lotus Notes, and Leavitt
confirmed what I discovered while searching for a filter. ``Don't
even try it; it's not easy to use,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Fram, of course, is usually well intentioned, but some of it,
particularly the chain letters, can have serious repercussions.
Computer consultant Steve Baldwin remembers what he calls the Great
Chain Letter Incident of 1993 or '94. He was working at the
publishing firm Ziff-Davis, and one of those
reach-out-and-mail-someone letters circulated around the office. It
took up so much bandwidth that it threatened to paralyze the
system, and the company issued a stiff warning to stop the
insanity. ``Chain letters, however well intentioned, are a major
violation of netiquette,'' Baldwin wrote in a recent (solicited)
e-mail. (For a history of electronic chain letters, see
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Gallery/7333/. The site, run by a
University of Kentucky student named Jennette Fulda, documents 393
missives and asks, ``Want to lose friends fast?'')
</P>
<P>
   But there is an element of superstition to those letters; you
have to cross your fingers and knock wood while deleting them.
Sherry Turkle, the MIT professor and clinical psychologist who
specializes in the social impact of technology, admits that she,
too, is susceptible to their lure. ``When I received those things
as a kid, I remember being thrilled and excited,'' she says. ``You
had to retype it five times, put the stamp on, go to the post
office. Now as an adult, they push that vulnerable little button
from my childhood, that little superstitious twinge. But at a
certain point, you have to delete it and prepare for a little bad
karma.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks like Leavitt contend that chronic e-mailers are
addicts, a concept Turkle rejects outright. People go through
phases with e-mail, she says, and often, they use it as a coping
tool. ``It gives people a constant sense of social action,'' she
contends. ``They're stirring the pot. They're part of the party.''
Some of these folks send epistles to long group lists, confirming
that they are part of large social circle.
</P>
<P>
   But that can tap into the insecurities of the recipient. ``What
about me?'' you find yourself asking. ``Where are my 40 friends?
Where are my funny stories?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a vicious circle, this e-mail mania. Turkle predicts
there's going to be a shakedown in the urge for constant
communication. ``There is a sense that there is a new hot culture,
and there is a social anxiety about not being part of the scene,''
she says. ``But people are going to start being selective about
technology. When they experience a net decline in quality of life,
that's when they stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget: Some folks like receiving fram. It keeps them
connected, it's easy, it's intimate, it's free. But for those who
are bombarded, the simplest solution has nothing to do with
technology. It has to do with tact, with having the guts to tell
your friends you simply don't have the time to read salty jokes or
cultivate your karma at work. Let your friends know this, but by
all means, don't send the message via e-mail.

LOSING A FATHER TO THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THIRTY YEARS IN A RED HOUSE 
A Memoir of Childhood and Youth in Communist China 
By Zhu Xiao Di 
University of Massachusetts Press, 255 pp., illustrated, $34.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A host of Chinese have written memoirs of growing up absurd
during the Cultural Revolution, the decade-long crusade against all
things traditional and material that preoccupied China from 1966 to
1976, and many of those efforts are splendid both for their
humanity and for their factual content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Swans,'' ``Born Red,'' ``Son of the Revolution,'' and
other volumes chronicle the experiences of people caught up in a
closed society in which truth, reality, and individual fates
changed radically, whimsically, from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Given the magnitude of this disastrous crusade, and the
importance to the rest of the world of having some grasp of how
China works, additions to the genre are still in order. But enough
has been written so that new offerings now should do more than
retell a gripping, but oft-told, tale of personal suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Xiao Di rises admirably to this challenge in his ``Thirty
Years in a Red House.'' The book starts out as a personal memoir,
but swiftly shifts to an affectionate biography of Zhu's father,
spanning not just the three decades of the author's life but most
of China's revolutionary and Communist history.
</P>
<P>
   This serves two important purposes: It places the Cultural
Revolution in solid historical context without requiring the reader
to digest a huge volume, and it opens a window on the thinking of
an important, little-heard-from generation of Chinese _ people who
matured in the years between the Cultural Revolution and the
Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Qiluan, the author's father, was a deeply committed
communist from early on. He joined the Communist Youth League in
1932, recruited his brothers and sister, and helped organize the
historic December 9 Movement, the 1935 Beijing demonstration that
inspired generations of Chinese students. He worked underground
during the climactic years of the revolution, constantly putting
his life at risk, and when victory was won was rewarded with
responsible positions in the new order.
</P>
<P>
   Idealistic but also politically savvy and sure-footed, he
avoided the first waves of ideological excess. Then, in 1968, when
his son was 10 and the Cultural Revolution was two, he and his
wife, who was also committed and idealistic, were swept under.
Their mental and physical sufferings as suspected enemies of the
people were typical: They lost their jobs and their home, and were
confined in separate detention camps.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Zhus were cleared, and when Zhu Qiluan died, a
statue was erected in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ghastly, but not unusual, cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Similar woes, and much worse, befell uncounted people both below
the Zhus in rank and at the highest levels of Chinese Communist
society, before as well as during the Cultural Revolution. From the
courageous revolutionary General Peng Dehuai, who opposed Mao
Zedong's extremism early on, to the tenacious Deng Xiaoping, who
came back from all the purges to take supreme power and commit his
own awful excesses, almost everyone was eventually politically
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   It is extraordinary to follow Zhu Xiao Di through his teen years
and his 20s as he watches his father cope. Without ever seeming to
try, his book convinces you that tens of thousands of other bright,
ambitious young boys saw similar things, and now are thinking
similar thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the narrative reaches the crackdowns of 1986 and
1989, the unavoidable conclusion is that the Communist Party, at
least in its incarnation as the sole wielder of power in the
Chinese state, is finished. Its problems are too big, its members
too corrupt, its constituents too cynical. Zhu's generation places
neither hope nor faith in it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no explicit advice here for Americans who have worried,
for good reason, as US policy toward China has fluctuated wildly
between appeasement and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   But an implicit message seems clear when Zhu, as a newly minted
English professor at Nanjing Teachers' University, takes up
Hamlet's ``to be, or not to be'' soliloquy with his students. At
first, the students are tempted to say it is nobler ``to take arms
against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them.'' That is the
answer their indoctrination dictates. But they quickly become
confused, and fall silent, when he presses on.
</P>
<P>
   What is nobler, he asks his students and himself: Open public
dissent that is sure to draw the slings and arrows of the
threatened Party, or remaining painfully silent on forbidden
subjects while encouraging freer thinking wherever possible?
</P>
<P>
   The students, and Zhu himself, cannot readily answer, for some
of the people they most admire fall into one group, and some into
the other. No matter. The orthodoxy that once would have dictated a
single, firm answer and forbidden all others is dead.

FALLOWS TAKES ON THE POWERS THAT GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the ``hardening-of-the-arteries'' theory of journalistic
malfeasance. Writing in the upcoming issue of the American Prospect
magazine, noted press critic Jim Fallows finds a unique way to lash
out at the media oligarchy he disdains. He reveals their ages.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his article examining journalistic sins in
``Monicagate,'' Fallows _ a former U.S. News &AMP; World Report editor
now toiling for Microsoft _ hits upon his controversial ``Geriatric
Punditariat'' theory. Basically, he claims that the ``people who
have set the media tone during the Monica era'' are too old, a
``complacent establishment . . . less fascinated by testing,
improving and expanding the possibilities of its craft than in . .
. exercising the power it enjoys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a nasty little twist, he provides the ages _ as of the
end of 1999 _ of media stars ranging from Sam Donaldson (65) to
Cokie Roberts (56), from John McLaughlin (72) to Maureen Dowd (47).
(Under that formula, the average age of a Fallows bigfoot is a ripe
61.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are not particularly impressed by the geriatric
theory. When asked if Fallows's idea had merit, Washington Post
columnist David Broder (70) said simply: ``Not a lot.'' A spokesman
for Cokie Roberts declined comment, saying Fallows ``has a long
history of being overly, aggressively critical.'' Wall Street
Journal editor Robert Bartley (62) said, ``I guess Jim Fallows
still has his nose out of joint because we ridiculed his argument
that Japan was going to take over the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You desperately need someone who's a bomb thrower and who's
generally wrong to make things interesting,'' responded PBS talk
host Charlie Rose (57). Newsweek's Howard Fineman (51) was blunter.
``I don't need a Washington blowhard like Jim Fallows to lecture
me,'' he declared before tempering his language. ``He's like Cotton
Mather,'' he added. ``He provides a useful service.''
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy between Fallows and the press corps boiled over
with the 1996 publication of his assault on Washington journalism,
a book titled ``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American
Democracy.'' Thus, there was more than a little glee emanating from
some quarters when Fallows was fired as editor of U.S. News last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   And some sharp-eyed observers may detect a note of revenge in
the makeup of his list of aging pundits. Included are such Fallows
critics as Dowd, who has sarcastically called him ``the Rector of
American Journalism''; Times editorial page editor Howell Raines
(56), who called him a ``fount of dangerous nonsense''; and
Fineman, who attacked Fallows's book on CNN's ``The Capital Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not really my motive,'' insisted Fallows (50), when
asked if the ``Geriatric Punditariat'' was a way of getting even.
``The press establishment'' converging on this White House scandal,
he adds, consists ``largely of the same people in the big media
establishment'' who were around for Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Then an unrepentant Fallows twisted the knife a final time ``I'm
still younger than most members of the Punditariat,'' he says,
``but I'm older than everybody here at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the old TV commercial explaining how we would all take
more pride in our work if we signed our name to it? Well, Colorado
Springs Gazette editor Steven Smith is testing that theory. Since
November, the Gazette (circulation 99,500) has been running stories
featuring not just the reporter's byline, but the names of the
headline writer and story editor as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired and bored with things,'' says Smith, explaining
the impetus for the experiment. And the idea has already expanded
past its original parameters, with the Gazette now crediting some
page designers and considering giving a byline to photo
caption-writers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Smith admits there is no hard evidence that all this has
improved the quality of the paper. But ``what we've been able to do
is (create) more accountability internally. . . . Their sense of
ownership and pride in their work has been notably improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also reports that readers have begun calling story editors
to discuss published articles _ a development that could be
welcomed or dreaded, depending on your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Internet use dumbing down as a second wave of less affluent,
less educated citizens go on line? Yes, says a new Pew Research
Center poll indicating that as users grow more mainstream,
``Internet news interests are changing markedly.'' (Two years ago,
the most popular Internet news draw was technology stories. Now,
weather is the most popular category.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey of nearly 3,200 adults, veteran Internet
surfers are more likely to seek out news about technology,
business, international events, and politics than those who came on
line within the past year. The new users' favored categories are
entertainment (57 percent) and weather (56 percent). One reason
suggested by the Pew researchers is that the new cybersurfers are
decidedly less elite. Only 29 percent of those who started using
the Internet in the past year are college grads and a plurality has
household incomes of less than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Internet content providers is whether news
priorities will be permanently changed by the influx of
``ordinary'' citizens or whether their tastes will grow more
refined the longer they are on line. Pew Research director Kimberly
Parker opts for the latter, noting that new users ``from lower down
in the socioeconomic spectrum . . . don't bring the same news
interests as the sophisticated old users.''

LET THE DIPS WIN ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first commandment for hosting a Super Bowl party is one
worth memorizing: Keep it simple.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is not an occasion for spending hours in the kitchen
putting together tasty dishes that will wow your friends. Quite the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   An event dominated by a football game on television cries out
for snacks and only snacks. And what is more appropriate than dips,
an hor d'oeuvre staple, for this truly American celebration?
</P>
<P>
   Quick and easy to prepare, dips are some of the most versatile
foods. Endless flavor combinations are possible. Be creative. Let
your imagination inspire you.
</P>
<P>
   The most common bases for dips are sour cream, yogurt, soft
cheese, mayonnaise, cream cheese or creme fraiche (thickened,
slightly soured cream). High fat content is not required, though.
Use reduced-fat versions for any dairy base to lower the fat
content of your dip, or make vegetable or bean-based dips instead.
</P>
<P>
   With a minimal amount of planning, you can offer a variety of
zesty dips to accompany an assortment of cut-up raw vegetables,
crackers, assorted breads, chips or cubes of cheese or meat.
</P>
<P>
   While the normal rule of thumb is one cup of dip serves four
people, for a Super Bowl shindig it's a good idea to double up.
Plan on one cup for every two people. Remember, the game lasts at
least three hours and folks will turn to the snacks time and again.
</P>
<P>
   A good tip for keeping cold dips chilled is to set them in bowls
of ice. Hot dips will stay warm in a crock pot. If you don't have a
slow cooker, be sure to serve them in a container you pop into the
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   If dips aren't fancy enough for your guests, it's easy to
present them in ways that would impress even Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Try hollowing out large round loaves of bread and serving the
dip in them, with the cut-up bread as an accompaniment. Another
attractive way to serve dips is in vegetable ``containers'' such as
bell peppers, pineapples or cabbage leaves.

AFFECTION IS AT THE HEART OF `CRAZY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you first spot the members of the fictional British band
Strange Fruit in the film ``Still Crazy,'' you may be thinking this
is not a particularly likable group of fellows: too much ego, maybe
not that much talent, long in the tooth. The movie's director,
Brian Gibson, cuts to the chase: ``They were decadent, decayed,
self-indulgent, and a miserable lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Is another ``This Is Spinal Tap'' about to be sprung?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. ``Still Crazy,'' though a comedy and hardly
averse to pointing up the foibles and emotional fragility of its
``rock stars,'' isn't played at the satirical high pitch of
``Spinal Tap.'' The guys in the band _ singer Ray (Billy Nighy),
bassist Les (Jimmy Nail), keyboardist Tony (Stephen Rea), and
drummer Beano (Timothy Spall) _ turn out to be charming in spite of
their rough edges and ill-conceived notions. Hughie, their roadie,
played by Scottish comedian-actor Billy Connolly, is an even more
lovable rogue. The film opened to generally positive reviews last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rock 'n' roll archetypes,'' says Gibson, ``but have
enough individuality to exist as characters. There's the
narcissistic lead singer, the self-destructive muse type, the
raucous drummer. . . . Hopefully, they're well enough written and
well enough played that there's flesh on the bone.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot is uncomplicated. The long-defunct band, having moved
on to dodgy real-life pursuits, is urged to re-form by a young
promoter. They track down one another and attempt the rickety
business of reconstructing both the friendships and the passions of
their youth. They also try to locate their missing or dead band
leader, the mysterious guitarist Brian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock 'n' roll tales are usually limited,'' says Gibson. ``In
really crude terms, it's like a Mickey Rooney movie: `We're gonna
get together and make some noise and some music. Are we gonna
succeed? Are we gonna fail?' Those are the parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   The story _ penned by ``The Commitments'' writers Dick Clement
and Ian La Frenais _ may be basic, but the satisfaction comes in
the knowing details. Nighy, as the frontman Ray, is recovering from
substance abuse, broke and jittery but still living in his mansion.
He projects both the arrogance of fame and sheer terror of going
about daily life. In one scene at a recording studio, a delivery
boy brings pizza and asks Ray to sign for it. Ray asks whom he
wants the autograph made out to. Uh . . . Ray, hello?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky with the script,'' says Nighy, ``because the
writers not only write some of the best gags in town, but they
support you completely in the way they develop the characters. We
all kind of helped each other along naturally. But it was not
improvised at all, which is a compliment, really, to the writing.''
(The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best motion
picture comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``At my time of life,'' says Nighy, 49, ``it's an unlikely
prospect to be asked to do this,'' that is, sing. ``And for him,
for Ray, he had a period of intense celebrity a long time ago. To
persuade yourself that it still works, it was some jump for me.
With the help of his wife he's sustained the illusion that his
celebrity still continues. If he goes down to the shops, which I
don't suppose he does, he probably still wears shades for fear of
being mobbed. And the terrible truth is nobody remembers who he is,
which is obviously rich pickings for comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Role model as a singer: ex-Bad Company/Free singer Paul Rodgers.
Nighy says: ``I didn't believe I could sing like him. But I can
hold a mike stand like him.'' Nighy actually sings in the film _
the other actors had musicians play their parts _ though he says
his background is limited ``to singing around the house and I have
a daughter who has banned me from doing that because she finds it
so intensely embarrassing. Any more Van Morrison or Bob Dylan and
she'll leave home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' was made for $11 million _ ``by Hollywood
standards, a postage stamp,'' says Jimmy Nail. He adds that
everyone involved had ``a great awareness that we didn't want to go
near the `Spinal Tap' scenario, one of the reasons being that I
didn't think you could do that any better than what Rob Reiner did.
. . . What we all tried to do was create characters that an
audience could care about, their individual and collective journey.
I think you win a little battle. The hardest thing you can do is
introduce characters and get the audience to care for them in the
space of 90 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson knows his way around rock 'n' roll movies, having done
two of the better ones, the Tina Turner bio-pic ``What's Love Got
to Do With It,'' and the fictional ``Breaking Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of research,'' says Gibson. ``Either deliberately
or unconsciously in previous areas of our lives. The script is
beautifully written, but it does read like a comedy script and I
didn't want it to be `OK, here comes the gag.' I wanted it to have
an authentic edge, so the performance and the casting, the
lighting, the way the scenes are blocked are designed to make you
feel that you're watching reality first and a comedy second. The
camera will pan around, slightly out of focus, it does this and
that. But it is all contrived, very carefully cued and worded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' gets the music right too. It's semi-hooky hard
rock, but dated. Much of it is penned by Mick Jones (from
Foreigner) and Chris Difford (from Squeeze). ``The Flame Still
Burns,'' which earned a Golden Globe nomination for best sound,
does seem cut from Foreigner cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask people to buy into the fact that this was a
big song, and just the very fact that they don't know this song
(makes that) immensely difficult to do,'' says Nail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely cliches built into some of the lyrics,
combined with some good lines,'' says Gibson. ``So you do feel,
yeah, they probably were top of the '70s B-list. They're not a
transcendent rock band. To begin with, the mandate with the writers
we were working with was to make them deliberately not very good,
and I said, `No, what we should do is aim to make them as good as
we possibly can and then pull back if they're too good.' `All Over
the World' and `The Flame Still Burns' are pretty good songs, but
there are certain words that are very '70s words. We used
`tapestry' a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly serves as the sometime narrator, framing the picture.
The decision to do that came late in the process, says Gibson. ``I
realized that in my view the film was a little bit soft at the end,
and at the beginning a bit earnest, so I felt having Billy frame
the movie would help pull the audience in to the right attitude, to
make you feel right from the beginning this was an impertinent,
silly group of people and here is a cautionary tale if you like.
It's a bunch of clowns who never quite learn from their
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Having staged a comeback, will Strange Fruit continue via a
sequel? ``If it does as well as we hope, there's always a threat,''
says Gibson, with a laugh. ``I don't think I'd direct it, you know,
having done it, but I'd love to go and see it because I'd be
curious about what they'd do next.''

SUPER BOWL AD CAMPAIGN GOES DOWN TO THE WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With airtime costing about $3.2 million a minute, an ad on
Sunday's Super Bowl can be the product of months of planning.
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad is a mini movie, folks in the ad business say, and each
30-second ad on Sunday's big game can represent 2,500 hours of
creative thinking, scripting, casting, shooting, and editing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why advertisers such as Budweiser and Pepsi can start
thinking about the Super Bowl 10 months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to chief executive Jeff Taylor of
Monster.com, an on-line recruiting service in Maynard, Mass. that
looks to match job seekers with employers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move for a company that has never run an ad on
national TV before, Taylor bought a minute of Super Bowl airtime in
November. That was before he had hired an ad agency. It was before
he even had any idea what the ad might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the right way to do it?'' quips Taylor, whose
company will spend $4 million, or 18 percent of its 1999 marketing
budget, to air a single ad three times on Super Bowl Sunday, twice
during the game and once during a pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl ads are usually the province of such giants as
Frito-Lay, General Motors, and American Express. Monster.com and a
rival Internet firm are among a few smaller companies betting much
of their ad budgets on the impact of Super Bowl exposure.
</P>
<P>
   To get that exposure, Taylor needed an ad agency in a hurry, and
for that, he turned to Skip Pile, head of a Boston-based consulting
firm that manages ad agency reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a Pile and Co. review lasts eight to 10 weeks with a
company hearing pitches from several ad agencies before picking a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case with Monster.com. It condensed its review
into a mere five days before choosing Mullen, a Wenham, Mass. ad
agency, just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They moved with the speed of the Internet,'' says Pile of
Monster.com, adding: ``This is the fastest any client we ever
worked with has made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   From Taylor's perspective, advertising on the Super Bowl makes
perfect sense in the context of Monster.com's history.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, the company started as a Web site for local
high-tech workers looking for new jobs. Since being acquired a year
later by TMP Worldwide Inc. of New York, the company has tried to
broaden its reach, posting job listings for everyone from college
interns to high-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Internet shopping exploded over the holidays, so too has
interest surged in on-line Web sites where employers pay to post
job listings and to review job-seekers' resumes.
</P>
<P>
   As with other categories of electronic commerce, a frenzied
stampede is on, with the early birds in on-line job recruiting
likely to emerge as the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   On-line recruitment may be especially lucrative because Web
sites offer employers a cheap, easy way to find new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an impatient work force that values the challenge of a
new job every few years over the security of long-term employment,
and on-line recruitment seems poised to take off.
</P>
<P>
   That's the assessment of Forrester Research Inc., which projects
that spending on Web-site recruitment should grow from $105 million
in 1998 to $1.7 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With 1998 revenues of about $40 million, the Web-site jobs
empire Taylor leads is positioned to be one of the few mainstream
recruitment services likely to survive the Internet's frontier
days, suggests Forrester analyst Chris Charron.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure survival _ and dominance _ is one reason Taylor
decided to advertise Monster.com on the Super Bowl. A recent merger
between Monster and another Web-site recruiting service that TMP
acquired may be a second reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking advantage of the broad reach of the Super Bowl to
increase awareness and encourage viewers to visit our site,'' says
Taylor, who hopes the ad will triple the 5,000 monthly visitors to
the Monster.com's site.
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs.com Ltd., a Monster.com rival, has similar ideas.
Looking to exploit the dissatisfaction of workers with dead-end
jobs, the New York-based company hired Boston ad agency Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos to create its own Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs's experience shows some of the perils of attempting to
create a Super Bowl ad on the fly. A proposed ad showed a man
cleaning an elephant's cage. The elephant backs up, sits down, and
the man disappears. Despite its taste for risque sitcoms, the Fox
network claimed to be horrified and rejected the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think having a man inserted into an elephant's anus
is funny,'' a Fox executive huffed to Brill's Content.
</P>
<P>
   For HotJobs, the controversy was a public relations bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hill Holliday chief executive Jack Connors, the ad
could have been modified in a way to win censors' approval.
</P>
<P>
   But HotJobs ``decided they wanted the publicity instead,'' says
Connors, whose agency was dropped in favor of another that will
produce HotJobs's Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's Taylor says he's uninterested in such hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for big hype and a bunch of stories,'' he
says. ``Our goal is to stand out to the Super Bowl audience.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Mullen staffers have been working furiously.
Between the agency staffers and outside contractors such as
directors and editors, 2,500 hours of effort went into an ad that
took about five weeks to conceive and complete, says Edward Boches,
Mullen's executive creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Taped in black-and-white, the ad shows 13 children saying such
things as, ``When I grow up . . . I want to be a yes-man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to claw my way up to middle management,'' says another
kid. ``I want to have a brown nose,'' says a third.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the ad is: `` `Don't settle for less. Don't give
up your dreams. Find the job you want,' '' Boches says.
</P>
<P>
   Boches hopes the black-and-white ad full of ironic humor will
stand out amidst the often luridly overproduced Super Bowl spots
full of celebrities and cute animals. The ad concludes,
``Monster.com. There's a better job out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, viewers will judge how effective Mullen's whirlwind
efforts were. But today plans call for a champagne toast as Mullen
marks the first Super Bowl ad in its 29-year history, Boches says.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, champagne toasts were far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh, my God!,' I thought, `Are we going to be able to pull
this thing off?' ''

BOSTON BEER SEEKS BREW TO REVITALIZE COMPANY'S VALUE

 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Koch would throw a fit if his beer was as flat as his
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Beer Co., maker of the famous Sam Adams beers and
ales, is in a serious funk along with the rest of the upscale craft
brewing industry. Sales that boomed through most of the 1990s
suddenly hit a wall and haven't budged for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Beer shares, which went public at 20 in 1996, were worth
less than half that Wednesday, closing at 9 1/2. The only recent
excitement in the stock occurred two weeks ago when a rumor,
apparently started on an Internet site, speculated about a takeover
by beer giant Anheuser-Busch Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, Boston Beer's founder and chief executive, cringes if you
use the word flat to describe his business, but won't dispute the
need to rejuvenate the sagging public value of his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As by far the largest shareholder who has almost all his net
worth tied up in the company, I probably have the biggest stake in
increasing the value of the company,'' said Koch, whose 5.6 million
Boston Beer shares are worth about $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston Beer has taken no disasterous wrong turns or missed
any great opportunities on the way to this predicament. It is stuck
in a consumer category that lost some of its cache and may be
fighting an uphill demographic battle.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Beer went public with a wave of other craft brewers in
late 1995 and 1996, at the time Wall Street's most popular
speciality stock offerings. They started off hot and then turned
out to be investment disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Redhook Ale Brewery Inc. went public in August 1995 at 17 and
shot up to 34 3/4. It traded at 5 3/4 Wednesday. Pete's Brewing Co.
launched an IPO at 18, three months after Redhook, and quickly
traded to 25. It was acquired last summer by Gambrinus Co. for 6
3/8 a share, just better than a third of its IPO price. Pyramid
Breweries Inc. was known as Hart Brewing Inc. when it went public
at 19 the summer of 1996. It finished Wednesday at 1 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? On the shelves, success spawned many more craft
brewers. Some of them tasted terrible. Eventually people lost
interest in craft brew experimentation and went on to something
else, often high-end imports with familiar names like Heineken and
Corona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imports stole their thunder,'' said Benj Steinman, editor of
Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter. ``The core user
base was never that large. So once they weren't expanding the
experimental customer base it was tough to grow. A lot of their
growth had come from trial customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Beer owns a commanding 21 percent market share of the
craft beer business, far ahead of number two Pete's. But Koch's
strategy has tried to extract Boston Beer's products out of that
category in the minds of his distributors and customers.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about a ``better beer'' segment that includes the best
of the craft beers and the popular imports, creating distance
between Sam Adams and the more obscure craft names. This is how the
customer really thinks, Koch contends, and it would align Sam Adams
with a growing beer segement again.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: it may be easy for Boston Beer to outmuscle craft
companies like Sierra Nevada or Anchor Brewing Co., but imports
like Heineken have big money and huge global organizations behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston Beer is pushing hardest with its flagship Sam
Adams Boston Lager brands and not emphasizing its array of other
specialty beers that play into the no-win experimentation market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Beer's overall sales fell about 8 percent to 943,000
barrels through the first nine months of its fiscal 1998. But the
company's leading brands actually gained modest ground while its
group of ``nonfocused'' special brews suffered sales declines, some
as steep as 20 percent, according to analyst Skip Carpenter of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Koch insists Boston Beer's best long-term strategy is to protect
the quality image of its Sam Adams products. Customers, he said,
will come as long as the product stands for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``People constantly suggest to me to lighten the beer up and
make it more accessible,'' he said. ``I could probably get more
sales by dumbing down the beer. But in the long run, that would be
inconsistent with everything Sam Adams stands for. There is no way
I'm ever going to consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   No-growth sales and weak stocks are usually the prime
ingredients for corporate mergers that squeeze costs and
consolidate market share. But big brewing companies have shown
scant interest in buying their way into the craft segment, which no
longer offers one of the industry's few growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch has bought minority interests in Redhook and
Widmer Brewing Co. Others have created their own labels,
particularly easy because contract brewers around the country have
so much excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Koch once scoffed at the idea of a sale of Boston Beer. Ask if
he would sell today and the answer is a bit softer, but only a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is yes, if I had complete confidence the quality,
integrity, and passion wouldn't suffer and we'd get better in other
ways. Anything less would be an acquisition that would destroy the
value of what was being acquired,'' he said.

LUMINA BOWS OUT MODESTLY  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, JAN. 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Chevrolet Lumina is headed toward the end of its road,
destined to be replaced for 2000 as Chevy's bread-and-butter family
sedan by a more interesting craft bearing an old name, Impala.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Lumina, it never worked up to its potential, an automotive
underachiever that could only watch as Ford Taurus, Honda Accord
and Toyota Camry traded laurels year after year as bestselling
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The styling is attractive, though generic. Performance is
competent, though bland. The overall theme is mainstream to a
fault, offending no one but not enticing anyone, either.
</P>
<P>
   The big plus during its 10 years of existence has been its
affordability, providing a good-size interior and plenty of
creature comforts for a modest price.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem is that Lumina drives like a budgetary
compromise, getting you there in a reasonable manner but boring you
to tears along the way. Even the top-end LTZ tested recently failed
to excite, despite its strong engine response and generally solid
feel.
</P>
<P>
   Though a Ride and Handling package is standard on the LTZ, I
found the suspension to be mushy and poorly controlled. The car
swayed heavily in turns and, on any kind of rough surface, it
bounced and heaved unpleasantly.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a really good set of shock absorbers would
make on this car. Konis, all around?
</P>
<P>
   Again, here's another place where the Lumina fails to live up to
potential. The cornering is balanced and predictable, but because
of the vagaries of the suspension, it's really hard to get into it.
</P>
<P>
   The LTZ is advertised as a sports sedan, which it very well
could be with just a bit of extra effort. Jeez, I'm starting to
sound like my junior-high guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-horse engine has plenty of pull, growling appropriately
and zipping the Lumina quickly up to highway speed. The
transmission works nicely, allowing a sporty run to the upper revs
before upshifting.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment is a 160-horsepower V-6, which is quite
adequate but not nearly as enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the LTZ manages to turn some heads, checking out
the sharp aluminum wheels, unique front-end design and
monochromatic paint scheme. Jaded me, I was surprised by how many
people seemed to appreciate the LTZ styling.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the LTZ has comfortable bucket seats up front and enough
head and legroom front and rear. Three people will fit in the back
seat, as long as they're not too wide.
</P>
<P>
   Interior styling is, again, pleasant but generic, ergonomically
acceptable but completely unmemorable. Except for the leather power
seats, which were quite nice.
</P>
<P>
   And here are some examples of Lumina's big plus, affordability.
The leather seating surfaces and full console add just $645 to the
price. Six-way seat power for the driver is $305. And the preferred
equipment group of keyless remote, power trunk opening, dual
temperature control and steering-wheel radio controls is $591.
</P>
<P>
   Those are pretty reasonable prices for the kinds of options
desired on luxury cars, without the luxury price. But despite the
extras, including LTZ's engine upgrade and suspension refinements,
the bottom line is still solidly in midstream. That's good value.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's time for Lumina to ride into the sunset, having
enjoyed decent sales during its 10 years of existence but not
leaving much of an impression one way or the other. &QL;

NO REASON TO BE PARANOID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't watched a single episode of ``The X-Files'' this
season, and it's affecting me. I'm losing my paranoid edge. Things
just don't seem as bleak and menacing as they used to. I didn't
even freak out when I heard last week about Intel Corp.'s plan to
put an electronic ID number inside its Pentium computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've talked to Intel engineers, civil liberties
advocates, and security experts. And to my surprise, I'm still not
freaked out.
</P>
<P>
   I may be the only one who isn't. Intel's getting mail from
congressmen, an Arizona state legislator has announced a plan to
outlaw the production of the chips in his state, and privacy
advocates have called for a Pentium boycott. All in response to an
idea that strikes me as mostly harmless, and actually rather
clever.
</P>
<P>
   Intel plans to release a new line of chips this year called the
Pentium III. Each will include an electronic serial number, which
can be read with the help of a piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   Say you do your banking on line. When you open your account, the
bank sends a program that reads your chip's ID. This is filed away
with other personal information and your password. The next time
you sign on, the computer can check your chip ID as proof of your
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop says the system will provide an
extra layer of security against data thieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd not only have to steal your password'' to rip off your
bank account, Waldrop said. ``They'd also have to steal your
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip ID would also be a blessing for corporate users who
must manage hundreds or thousands of machines over a data network.
At a glance, the manager could identify every connected machine.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptography expert Bruce Schneier tells me it should be
possible to create a program to generate fake chip IDs, but the
Intel folks say this would be so difficult that few hackers would
waste time trying. Besides, you'd still need your victim's
password.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Intel ID system was to be switched on when the
computer starts up. But the fury of civil libertarians and
lawmakers has led Intel to a sensible change of heart. The Pentium
III chips will be sold with the ID switched off, unless the
customer chooses to switch it on. This can't be done remotely by
some evil hacker, either. It requires a complete shutdown and
restart of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the ID is switched on, it isn't broadcast
automatically to every Web site you visit, as some early press
reports implied. Only sites that request the information will get
it. And all they get is an ID number _ not your name, address, or
shoe size.
</P>
<P>
   For a site to get any personal information, you must give it to
them, or some other Web site must sell it to them. But that's your
problem, not Intel's. If you want to keep something private, don't
publish it on the Net, or give it only to Web sites that promise
not to share.
</P>
<P>
   A number of privacy advocates dropped their opposition to the
Intel system once the company agreed to let users decide whether to
activate it. Not the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which
wants Intel to remove the technology altogether. As long as it's in
the chip, says EPIC, Web sites could require their customers to use
it. And software makers could require the chip ID as a way of
preventing piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but why drive away so many customers? There are hundreds
of millions of computers that don't have chip IDs. Meanwhile,
chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor
Corp. say they won't put IDs on their Pentium-compatible chips.
What Internet merchant or software firm will refuse all this
business, just so he can read a chip code that provides far less
information than the customer's credit card number?
</P>
<P>
   The Intel plan offers a slight improvement in computer security,
and will cause hardly any loss in privacy. A little paranoia has
its uses, and there are genuine privacy threats for computer users
to worry about. This just isn't one of them.

 &HT;    A western simmering on the edge of wild
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone could breathe new life into the western, you'd figure
it would be Stephen Frears. The British director has invigorated so
many tread-worn genres: the costume drama (``Dangerous Liaisons''),
film noir (``The Grifters''), the biopic (``Prick Up Your Ears''),
social satire (``My Beautiful Laundrette'') and domestic comedy
(``The Snapper'').
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he couldn't reinvent the gothic romance with his muddy
``Mary Reilly,'' but he gave it a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' isn't a blunder like that flick. It's
handsome and absorbing in a low-key, big-sky way. But like its
narrator, Pete (Billy Crudup), the movie never seems to find focus.
It's a tale of passion, greed and gunfire that seems to be playing
out at a slight, discreet distance.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is in the casting. Patricia Arquette plays
Mona, a married woman who becomes the object of desire for both
Pete and his pal Big Boy (Woody Harrelson). Arquette can be fine,
but she's more of a presence than an actor. Here, she swims through
the role as if she's heavily sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the real love story has nothing to do with Mona. It's
the (nonsexual) crush Pete has on Big Boy, a powerhouse fellow who
represents the spirit of the Old West. He's out of step in
post-World War II New Mexico, where family farms are being
swallowed alive by ranchers like Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott).
</P>
<P>
   Mona happens to be married to Love's foreman. So when Big Boy
starts sleeping with her (and barely bothers to hide it), it's
considered as much an affront to him as to her husband. The women
in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are tools the men use to express their anger
and frustration. That includes Pete's old girlfriend Josepha
(delectable Spanish actress Penelope Cruz), who becomes an
unwitting stand-in for the passion Pete actually feels for Mona.
</P>
<P>
   Frears is an expert at slowly building tension. We know from the
start that somebody is about to die; Pete alludes to it in his
opening voice-over. That's what holds ``Hi-Lo'' together when its
romantic plot line isn't clicking. There's a terrific scene at a
dance, with Big Boy and Pete keeping an eye on the crowd, waiting
for an inevitable eruption from Love's men. It's a masterful
sequence, encapsulating the whole movie's mood of violence always
waiting to explode from the dusty, scenic landscape. But the film
is too uneven and too long to grip us the way it should.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson does his usual rollicking, loudmouth-rooster routine;
take that as an endorsement _ or a warning. Personally, I'm getting
tired of the actor's limited loudness. Like Robin Williams, he
seems to think acting is all about the mouth and jaws; he's
perpetually chewing on something or rolling a cigar between his
teeth. He's like a hyper kid who'll do anything to grab your
attention and steal focus from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup has the harder role. Pete is the quiet center of the
movie, an enigma. Though he's the narrator, we never get inside his
head. That's the fault of the script, not Crudup, who delivers a
performance much like the film: subdued, reactive, but with
something in his eye that warns you he could become dangerous when
you least expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson and Patricia Arquette.
Rated R for sexuality, violence and profanity. 2 hours, 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A tale of passion in the fading West that never
quite catches fire.

 &HT;    Beat goes on for '70s band in rock-solid `Still Crazy'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of Sunday's Golden Globe Awards madness, you might
have heard mention of a small British film called ``Still Crazy.''
A nominee for best comedy/musical, it lost, without anyone much
noticing, to ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Still Crazy'' is no loser. It's the richest, most
delightful surprise of a still-young year (it played Los Angeles
briefly in 1998 to qualify for award consideration).
</P>
<P>
   To say that it concerns the reunion of a fictional 1970s rock
band called Strange Fruit can't help but conjure up the hilarious
dino-rock classic ``This Is Spinal Tap.'' But while ``Spinal Tap''
is a dead-on, tongue-in-cheek, needle-sharp satire, ``Still Crazy''
strives for something more complex. That doesn't make it a better
movie, just a different one _ one with a special resonance for the
generation that traded the Yellow Brick Road for Abbey Road and
thought it could be young forever.
</P>
<P>
   Strange Fruit disbanded in 1977 after a disastrous gig at a
``legendary'' open-air festival named Wisbech (Isle of Wight,
anyone?). They were struck by lightning _ literally _ in midset,
prompting their dryly jovial roadie, Hughie (``Mrs. Brown's'' Billy
Connolly), to note that divine intervention was at work. ``I think
God got sick of all that '70s excess,'' he says. ``That's why he
invented the Sex Pistols.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's 20 years later and each Fruit has pursued his own
peculiar loop. Keyboardist Tony (Stephen Rea) stocks condom
dispensers. Bass guitarist Les (Jimmy Nail) is a roofer with a
family to support. Beano (Timothy Spall), the drummer, lives in a
trailer on his mum's farm. Lead singer Ray (Bill Nighy) has retired
to county squiredom, sharing a stately mansion with his domineering
Scandinavian wife (Helena Bergstrom).
</P>
<P>
   As for the band's star _ an impish lead guitarist named Brian
(Bruce Robinson) _ well, he's missing in action. When Tony and the
group's former manager/gofer decide to round up the lads for a
reunion tour, they line up a replacement named Luke (Hans
Matheson).
</P>
<P>
   Loaded up in a bus once used by the Psychedelic Furs, the Fruits
go back on the road, hitting the slummier clubs in Belgium and the
Netherlands. Lightning doesn't strike, but old tensions, feuds and
jealousies do. They are, indeed, still crazy after all these years.
Also still vain, needy, petty and all the other rock-life
afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   The film is both a celebration and an elegy, a sharp, knowing
tragicomedy for baby boomers. The music is a potpourri of
contributions from members of groups such as Spandau Ballet,
Foreigner and Squeeze. The script is full of shrewd jabs and
poignant touches. The director is Brian Gibson, who proved he knows
his way around movies and music with ``Breaking Glass'' and
``What's Love Got to Do With It.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire ensemble cast is terrific, from Spall's low-comedy
antics to Rea's low-key believer (he still wears Jimi Hendrix's
tooth on a chain around his neck). The standout, however, is Nighy.
As the tremulous has-been heartthrob, smearing on the makeup and
jacking himself up with ``You are the man!'' pep talks, he recalls
the tragic grandeur of Terence Stamp's diva-ish drag queen in ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the generation it both mocks and mourns, ``Still Crazy''
balances its smart-mouthed self-absorption with a sad-eyed
sweetness. And it honors the survivors of that long, strange trip
known as the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly and Bill Nighy. Directed by
Brian Gibson. Rated R for sexuality, language and drug references.
1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Brilliant, poignant and sharply observed, this
comedy about a reunited '70s rock band doesn't miss a beat.

   `The Thin Red Line'
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Malick's ``Days of Heaven,'' quite possibly the most
visually beautiful film ever made, came out 20 years ago. ``The
Thin Red Line'' makes it clear that we are in the hands of one of
the greatest visual poets ever. Malick's extraordinary vision does
not come along often. Think Welles, Kurosawa and Truffaut _ pieces
of each live inside Malick's films. Let's hope we don't have to
wait another 20 years to see a genius at work.

   `Meet Joe Black'

<P>
   I saw ``Meet Joe Black'' three times. It was one of those movies
that surprise you with every turn it took. I observed that the
other members of the audience were enjoying it as much as I was _
especially the ending. Great group of actors in that movie.

   `A Bug's Life'
</P>
<P>
   Pixar's second animated film is a darling flick. (It's) the
story of ants living under the thumb of grasshoppers. The jokes
come left and right. (The) voices are funny, and the music is very
fitting. An enjoyable movie for all ages.

   What would you do if your dreams were not your own, but those of

portraying such a woman, whose life is devastated by a psychopath,
well-played by Robert Downey Jr. An intriguing story and

 &HT;    Teen comedy ain't that much
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the problem with ``She's All That.'' She isn't. And
neither is he.
</P>
<P>
   In this teen rebake of ``Pygmalion,'' Rachael Leigh Cook plays
the Eliza Doolittle role _ only she's not a poor Cockney, but a
morose, arty student named Laney. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the
Higgins part, now called Zack and reconceived as the most popular
guy in his Los Angeles high school.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), Zack
accepts a bet from his cool-clique colleague Dean (Paul Walker) to
swan-ify the ugliest duckling on campus. Dean's choice: Laney.
(That seems odd, because even with long hair and nerd glasses, Cook
is already a stunner.) Zack has to transform Laney into a prom
queen in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think the chances are that he'll fall in love with
her in the process? Get real. You know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In our oversaturated world of movies and TV series built around
tart-tongued, hyper-articulate teens, ``She's All That'' has some
verbal zing that distinguishes it from the crowd. Wounded by his
breakup with Taylor, Zack describes her as ``a C-minus GPA with a
Wonderbra.'' And the movie has funny throwaway bits, like Laney's
dad (Kevin Pollak) watching ``Jeopardy!'' and getting every single
answer wrong. Or the sly cameo by TV's ``Buffy,'' Sarah Michelle
Gellar. And in its general sweetness, the movie is leagues beyond
the rude, crude (and hugely successful) ``Varsity Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The flick's liveliest moments deal with Taylor's new boyfriend,
Brock Hudson, the ``dyslexic volleyball guy'' from ``The Real
World.'' Played by Matthew Lillard (``Scream''), the Puck-like
slacker is one of the movie's best inventions, an epitome of a
brain-dead West Coast clown who's famous for being famous. And for
his habit of passing gas and calling people names.
</P>
<P>
   The lively supporting cast (including Anna Paquin, Kimberly
``Lil Kim'' Jones and Usher Raymond in a minuscule part) makes the
movie's real weakness all the more obvious: Prinze and Cook are
easy on the eye, but they're stiffs. He's noble and sensitive but
never seems three-dimensional. And though she looks like the
younger Winona Ryder, Leigh's performance lacks the warmth and
vulnerability Laney needs.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't helped by a script that's thick with laughs but thin
on character development. We never believe these two are made for
each other, that their preordained clinch is right and inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the two young stars fall in love because the script
says they do. That's what makes ``She's All That'' not all that
different from the dozens of other teen comedies around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook. Directed by
Robert Iscove. Rated PG-13. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This week's latest disposable teen comedy has some
laughs and charm, but it ain't all that.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the season to be miserable. Every other person seems to
be down with something. But what?
</P>
<P>
   Is it ``just a cold'' or are you suffering from something more
serious like the flu, bronchitis, sinusitis or perhaps pneumonia?
Or could it be an allergy? Knowing what you have can make a big
difference in how you feel, the treatment you require and your
chances for relapse and lingering fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   There is an understandable resistance about consulting a doctor
for what you think is a cold or other seemingly minor infection,
especially if you're still able to muddle through your day. And
there is even greater resistance about taking antibiotics, which
are widely abused and overused. But sometimes such treatment is
necessary, and the sooner it is started, the faster the recovery
and the fewer the complications.
</P>
<P>
   The wise reader will save this column, since the information is
bound to come in handy, if not for you then for a relative or
friend.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to distinguish between a cold and the flu
is by how the illness began. If it crept up on you, starting
perhaps with a scratchy throat, sniffles or sneezes, and gradually
progressed into a runny or stuffy nose, a sore throat and/or cough,
in all likelihood you have a cold _ an upper respiratory infection
with one of the 200 viral strains known to cause the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   You may feel a little chilled and achy and possibly run a
low-grade fever (no more than 100 degrees for adults and 102 for
infants and young children), but the aches will not be severe
enough to keep you from going about your business, though you might
prefer to go to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Most colds resolve without treatment within a week to 10 days.
Longer than that, and chances are you've developed a complication,
a bacterial infection like sinusitis or bronchitis that warrants
medical consultation and, usually, a prescription for antibiotics
to shake the symptoms and malaise.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the flu comes on suddenly and leaves you
feeling exhausted. Fevers tend to run high _ 102 to 104 _ and
you're likely to ache all over, in muscles you didn't even know you
had. Add in extreme fatigue and weakness and you may not be able to
do anything but lie in bed and sleep. Working or playing with the
flu is usually very difficult, even for those of strong will and
stamina.
</P>
<P>
   The upper respiratory symptoms that are the hallmark of colds _
runny or stuffy nose and sneezing _ only sometimes occur with
influenza. And while the sore throat of a cold usually disappears
in a day or two, the sore throat that accompanies the flu usually
worsens by the second or third day. Also, with the flu, the lower
respiratory tract is commonly attacked by the culprit virus,
leaving the bronchial tubes wracked with a hacking cough.
</P>
<P>
   The flu can also hit below the belt, causing vomiting and
diarrhea, especially in children and young adults. This never
happens with a cold. When flu attacks the digestive tract, it may
be impossible for days to keep down anything that is more
nourishing than water or tea. (This symptom is not to be confused
with what is loosely called ``intestinal flu,'' which is not a form
of influenza at all and has none of the achiness and respiratory
symptoms.)
</P>
<P>
   The flu is likely to disappear as abruptly as it started,
usually within three to seven days, though it often leaves a legacy
of fatigue and depression that can last for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague's problem started with a cold that just didn't quit,
leaving her very tired and understandably dispirited for weeks. Her
doctor thought she had chronic fatigue syndrome and suggested
Prozac to lift her spirits. Finding neither conclusion acceptable,
she consulted another doctor who properly diagnosed a sinus
infection and prescribed an antibiotic that restored her vitality
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   More often than most people realize, colds that linger are no
longer colds but have evolved into bacterial infections of the
ears, sinuses or bronchial tubes. These infections gain a foothold
when the cold symptoms weaken defenses and impair drainage in the
respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
   When a cold lasts for weeks, when the nasal discharge becomes
thick and yellow or greenish and a headache or painful pressure
develops in the face, cheeks, upper teeth or around the eyes,
chances are you've got a sinus infection. Though these infections
sometimes resolve with simple home remedies like hot compresses, an
antibiotic is often needed. When the infection hits the ear, the
intense pain and sense of fullness in the ear is unmistakable; here
again, an antibiotic is likely to be prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   A cold and, more commonly, the flu can also develop into
bronchitis or even pneumonia. When a deep, tight or productive
cough (i.e., one that brings up thick mucus) accompanies or follows
a viral infection, think bronchitis. You might try self-treatment
with an expectorant and gallons of fluids, but chances are you'll
need an antibiotic to wipe out the infection if bacteria are the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Strep throat can be another source of confusion. Like a cold, it
often begins with a sore throat and fever, but the throat quickly
becomes so sore and swollen that swallowing water can be a problem.
Fevers, too, tend to run high. If a throat culture confirms a
streptococcal infection, 10 days of antibiotics are needed to
eradicate the bacteria and prevent them from infecting the heart
valves (rheumatic fever) or kidneys (glomerulonephritis) and
causing permanent organ damage.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume that because it is winter and few pollen-producing
plants are in bloom you cannot be suffering from a nasal allergy.
Winter has its share of respiratory allergens _ dust mites galore
(especially when the heat is on), mold spores (do you burn wood in
a fireplace?) and pets (their saliva harbors the allergen) are the
leading candidates. Symptoms may be aggravated by scented candles,
smoke, even cooking fumes.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to recognize an allergy. Fever and that
overall sick feeling are rarely present, although fatigue is not
uncommon. With an allergy, your nose may run, your head feel stuffy
and your eyes and throat itchy. Sneezing and a tickly cough are
also common symptoms. Symptoms persist for as long as you're
exposed to the allergen, and return with each subsequent exposure.

PLAYING ARCHITECT ON YOUR PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started in December 1994, when my wife and I decided to
spend Christmas vacation at a quaint little inn on Martha's
Vineyard. We made the mistake of picking up one of those little
real estate guides. By the following May we'd bought a little house
in Vineyard Haven that was quite picturesque, but also in desperate
need of repair. Today, nearly four years later, the renovations
still aren't finished.
</P>
<P>
   Last month my attempts at finishing the ongoing work hit a snag.
I was thinking of turning a porch into a few extra bedrooms when
the housing inspector told me that he wanted to see some
architectural drawings before anything got serious. Meanwhile, my
electrician asked me for some plans for the older part of the
house, so that we could plan where to install a number of new
circuits, light switches, and outlets.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was shopping in Staples when I saw a whole
category of home software: three-dimensional architectural design
tools. I had never noticed these boxes before; suddenly they were
very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything needed to plan a new home, remolding project, deck,
and visualize new exterior landscaping,'' screamed the
advertisement on one box. ``Now anyone can easily visualize
remolding and decorating ideas in no time! said another.'' Here was
a way that I could recreate the missing plans to my 150-year-old
house, design the new addition, and do it all without hiring an
architect! And all for $59.95! What a deal!
</P>
<P>
   Now mind you, I never believed this hype for one moment. But I
did think that I might be able to use one of these programs to
create a rough set of plans and save me a few hundred dollars in
architectural fees. And indeed, after spending nearly 40 hours with
Broderbund 3D Home Deluxe, Sierra's Home Architect 2.0, and Planix
3D Home Designer, I'm still convinced that these programs are
useful to the layman. But don't think that they will make you an
architect.
</P>
<P>
   All of these programs let you create a rough set of plans, then
build a three-dimensional model of your home, view it from any
perspective, and furnish it with objects. And all of them have
special calculators and other kinds of gimmicks, like tools for
calculating the number of tiles you will need for a bathroom, or
the optimal location for a home satellite TV dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I found Broderbund's 3D Home Deluxe far easier to
use than its competitors. 3D Home Deluxe is like a paint program,
except that instead of painting with a brush, you paint with a tool
that puts down 2x4 stud walls. Draw four walls in a rectangle, and
you've made a room. Click on the icon of a door, then click a wall,
and you've just installed a door. Windows go up the same way. My
only complaint had to do with making changes: the program requires
that you select and change each wall one-at-a-time, rather than
allowing you to make multiple selections and change them all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The programs by Sierra and Planix take a different approach.
Instead of starting with walls, these programs start with rooms,
each represented by a rectangle or other suitable shape. By
dragging these rooms around your screen, you create the floor plan
of your fantasy house. When you are happy with the design, you draw
the exterior walls. Although you can create some pretty creative
plans this way, you're also likely to end up was some structures
that are fairly difficult, if not impossible, to build.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra and Planix are stronger in the interior decorating
department. They have many different wall textures, interior
fixtures, pieces of furniture, and so on. The Sierra program is
heavily oriented toward three-dimensional design, with
photo-realistic rendering of furniture and walls. You can then
create your own 3-D walk-through and mini-movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra does its three-D rendering in the background, a help on
even fast machines, since rendering takes a lot of time. The
program also has cute little instructional videos that play every
time you switch into a different module. Unfortunately Sierra keeps
all of these videos, plus the modules themselves, on the CD-ROM,
which must be inserted in the drive in order for the program to
run. This may be a clever form of copy protection; unfortunately,
it also makes the program run very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   My least favorite program was Planix. Created by Autodesk, the
program is similar to the company's high-end AutoCAD program for
the kind computer aided design done by the pros. This makes the
Planix pretty alien to the users of most desktop software. Planix
menus, icons, and toolbars don't work like other PC programs that
you might be familiar with. And unlike Broderbund's program, which
tries understands that connected walls should stay connected,
Planix is very manual: if you want to resize a room, you'll need to
move several walls, one after another.
</P>
<P>
   None of the programs that I tried had any sort of architectural
smarts _ not even simple concepts, like the fact that it's a good
idea to put your second floor bathrooms over your first floor
bathrooms, or the importance of building central walls that can
support the weight of the upper floors. Nor did the programs
understand plumbing or heating systems, although they do offer
limited electrical planning capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem that I found with these programs is that they
really don't understand the way we build houses in New England.
Many of the sample plans included on the CD-ROMs put the heater on
the first floor, rather than in a full basement, where it belongs.
I think that this is because these programs were all designed in
either Northern California or Seattle, and they show their regional
biases.
</P>
<P>
   But my biggest complaint about these programs isn't their lack
of architectural intelligence, but their limitations as Windows
applications. All the programs I reviewed were created for the
older Windows 3.1. None of the programs worked properly when I
installed them in the Program Files directory; the space in the
directory name caused them to malfunction. Planix doesn't even
support long file names.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, I was able to use the Broderbund's 3D
Home Deluxe to make a relatively complicated set of plans for my
house on the Vineyard. Now I finally understand why I don't have
any closet space.

NALEN OWNS UP TO UNSPEAKABLE OFFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ A week from today &UR;  &LR; (Thursday), Tom Nalen
will be on a beach in Hawaii, preparing the way NFL players do for
the annual league all-star game, the Pro Bowl. He's happier this
week in dark meeting rooms shielded from the Florida sun at the
Hyatt Pier 66, preparing the way NFL players do for the annual
league Big Game, the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't tan,'' the Wrentham, Mass., native said jokingly of
his preferences for Super Bowls over Pro Bowls. ``I get red. Then I
peel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Nalen will try mightily to peel away the layers of
the aggressive Atlanta Falcons' gap defenses to open holes for
running back Terrell Davis. It is something he has done well enough
the past two years to be elected to the Pro Bowl and it is
something he has done well enough this season for Davis to become
only the fourth player in NFL history to gain more than 2,000 yards
(2,008). Yet none of his success or Davis's has brought as much
notoriety to Nalen and his fellow offensive linemen as has the
simple act of not talking about either or much of anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the arrival of offensive line coach Alex Gibbs in
1995, the Broncos' offensive linemen have been mum by inclination
and enforcement. Each year, they have voted to accept Gibbs's
suggestion of a no-talk policy, a refusal to speak with the media
until the Super Bowl, the one week when the league fines the silent
rather than rewarding them.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was amended this year by fiat from head coach Mike
Shanahan, who agreed with a Pro Football Writers Association
protest that someone needed to speak for the linemen each week and
named a different one spokesman each week. Other than that, the
linemen remain silent or get fined by a kangaroo court that
collects the money and uses it for a year-end celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've been doing for a number of years,'' Nalen
said. ``We think it brings us closer as a group, and it's a way to
make fun of each other. Plus, the fines go to a good cause _
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has worked to our advantage. Now people
actually want to talk to us really bad. It's like we're geniuses _
which we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine system began simply as $50 charges for any quote
appearing in a newspaper or on radio or TV. But over time, Nalen
says, the system took on a life of its own, with penalties being
levied for an assortment of other transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a prima donna fine; that's about 50 bucks,'' Nalen
said. ``There's a whole list of them, but if I told them all to
you, I'd get fined. There's a $1,000 fine for being quoted on
`Monday Night Football,' though.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I was stuck in traffic on a Tuesday, which is our
day off. I had the radio on, and there's one of our guys as a
co-host on a show for two hours. He figured because it was our day
off, nobody would be listening and he could get away with it. I
charged him the next day and he had to confess.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even fines for not having enough fines, which seems to
fly in the face of the spirit of the no-talk policy but which Nalen
said has been enforced more than a few times against those trying
to limit their contributions to the year-end party pot.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nalen, he gets few fines for violating the no-talking
rule and none for being a prima donna despite his status as one of
the best centers in the NFL after just five seasons. But he has
been penalized more than once by the sensitivity police for another
violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cause a lot of my own fines,'' Nalen said, laughing as he
talked. ``I've had a couple of big ones for reacting to criticism
in the wrong way. Harry Swayne and Tony Jones are the sensitivity
judges. If both their hands go up, you're guilty. I don't know how
they got that job. They're more sensitive than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That last comment will probably cost Nalen another 50 bucks, but
these days he can afford it. Or he soon should be able to. After
coming to Denver as a seventh-round draft choice out of Boston
College in 1994 (the 218th player taken), he needed only two
seasons to become a full-time starter and four to become a Pro Bowl
regular.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained the former since breaking into the regular
lineup in 1995, and each year he played just a little bit better
than the year before until his breakout season last year, when he
made the AFC Pro Bowl team for the first time. Yet even with
success, Nalen has changed little from his days playing in a far
different Super Bowl, the one his Foxboro High team twice won
before he moved on to BC to earn a bachelor's degree in accounting
and a master's in football.
</P>
<P>
   He has used the latter so successfully that one day soon, he may
have to put the former to use either as a free agent or in
negotiations with a team for whom he has started 64 of the last 70
regular-season games. Until then, Tom Nalen will just try to keep
his account with the sensitivity police balanced, his accounting of
Terrell Davis's rushing yards on the profit side, and his comments
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not talking to the media didn't bring us a lot of attention
until we got close to the Super Bowl last year,'' Nalen said. ``I
voted for it because I don't really like talking and I don't want
to stick my foot in my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once we got to the Super Bowl last year, we decided to
talk because we didn't want to get fined. When that started, it
became pretty obvious the media didn't really want to talk to us,
anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the questions were about why we weren't talking. Once they
found out we were, that was the end of the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is nothing to get sensitive about.

A GEM FROM SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If soccer leagues are seeking diamonds in
the rough, they could do worse than to follow the trail of mineral
prospectors to the war-torn West African republic of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   That is the home of the latest Revolution recruit, Unisa Conteh,
a solidly built, 22-year-old, 6-foot striker with skills advanced
enough for the Major League Soccer team to have invited him to camp
after a one-hour workout last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution might not have room for Conteh, who would have
foreign status this season. But Conteh seems committed to staying
in the United States, or whichever country offers the best
opportunity, even to the point of adopting another nationality.
This is understandable, considering the ferocity and
unpredictability of Sierra Leone's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared to go back,'' Conteh said. ``When I left, I was 17
and the fighting was in the provinces. Now I am scared. Nobody in
my immediate family has been hurt, but friends and relatives have
been. I've got to try to get my family out, and that is on my mind
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting doesn't give you a chance to do anything. They
start the league each season, and then there is fighting and the
league stops playing. When I left, I was not a national team
player, and I want to be a recognized player, with a good club and
a good coach. If I get a chance in another country, I would take
it. I want a chance to play in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in form, I have speed and power. I am from the Timne
tribe, and we are strong from childhood. This is what I have going
for me, and I want to now adopt the white man's skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Conteh's agent, Steve Weymouth, has helped with visa issues and
is trying to arrange safe passage for Conteh's family. He also
provides Conteh's primary form of transportation, since Conteh does
not have a driver's license valid in the US.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh seems confident beyond his years and is worldly enough to
respect the uncertainties of life. West Africa has been exploited
for many decades, first for its so-called ``human resources'' and,
after slavery was abolished and Sierra Leone was created as a haven
for ex-slaves in the late 18th century, for its natural resources,
especially bauxite, diamonds, and rutile.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently have European clubs scouted Sierra Leone for
soccer players. Kewullay Conteh, a cousin of Unisa, and Mohammed
Kallon are playing in Italy, and Mohammed Conteh is in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the war, everyone is kind of scared to go to Sierra
Leone,'' Conteh said. ``They can't really go to countries with
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``With African players, it's luck. A lot depends on what you
want to do, what your goals are. And with God's grace, I am here to
learn something every day. I am not perfect and I still have a lot
to learn about this game. But I want to learn. I am confident, but
all I want to do is work hard and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Conteh was discovered as a teenager playing for Freetown United
in Sierra Leone's capital. He joined Al Ansar in Lebanon and
experienced his first taste of the exploitative policies of some
leagues. Former Revolution midfielder David Nakhid led Conteh and
others in an attempt to gain basic rights, such as preventing clubs
from releasing injured players without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh's next stop was Trinidad, where he joined a club called
Joe Public. The team played in the CONCACAF Champions Cup against
D.C. United at Washington's RFK Stadium, Conteh's first encounter
with cold weather. He had been slowed by an injury, then developed
cold and flu symptoms and left the game at halftime of an 8-0
defeat. Conteh decided to stay in Washington, then moved to Boston,
where his club's photographer resides.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Conteh will seek his fortune far from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the whole of Sierra Leone is made of diamonds,'' he
said. ``Sometimes people are planting and they will find diamonds
in their garden. You don't have to dig that deep. So I don't know
why they are fighting. As long as everyone has some money, that
should be enough.''

_DRUG COMBINATION SAID TO EASE ARTHRITIS  
 _YALE STUDY PRAISES TEACHING HOSPITALS  
 _MIT SCIENTISTS INVENT `PHARMACY ON A CHIP'

 Drug combination said to ease arthritis
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis researchers announced encouraging news for hundreds of
thousands of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers whose tender and
swollen joints are not relieved by current drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new ``designer'' drug to standard methotrexate therapy
improves symptoms for the many patients who have active arthritis
on methotrexate alone, according to a study in the current New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a 75 percent improvement in the number of
tender joints'' on the two-drug combination, vs. 39 percent
improvement on methotrexate alone, said Dr. Michael E. Weinblatt of
Brigham and Women's Hospital, who conducted the study with
researchers at six US medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced joint pain was not the only effect. Swelling was
similarly reduced in comparison to methotrexate alone, Weinblatt
said. ``That's pretty remarkable,'' he said. ``To make someone's
`joint count' almost 80 percent better is really pretty dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination, tested in 89 patients with severe, unresponsive
rheumatoid arthritis, contains a drug called etanercept, which has
won federal approval for use in arthritis by itself. The
genetically engineered drug sponges up a natural substance called
tumor necrosis factor that plays a pivotal role in the chronic
inflammation of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   However, the price of relief will be high. A year's worth of
etanercept, made by Immunex Corporation in Seattle, costs about
$12,000. Methotrexate adds another $1,000 for the drug alone.
</P>
<P>
   Etanercept isn't the only new item on the arthritis treatment
menu. Specialists expect federal approval too for infliximab, an
artificial antibody that disables tumor necrosis factor. Taken
together, the two drugs will usher in ``a new era in the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis,'' Dr. James R. O'Dell of the University of
Nebraska wrote in an editorial accompanying the current article.
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts about 2.1 million Americans,
usually beginning between the ages of 20 and 40. It strikes about
three times as many women as men.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Yale study praises teaching hospitals
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do teaching hospitals provide better care? For treatment of
heart attacks, yes, according to a Yale University study published
Thursday. But not because of their high-tech capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current New England Journal of
Medicine, found that heart attack patients were more likely to be
alive 30 days after admission if they went to the 60 US hospitals
that ranked highest on the well-known (but controversial) ``best
hospitals'' ranking published by US News and World Report. All but
one of the 60 were teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers ascribed the mortality advantage
largely to the fact that patients at the ``best'' hospitals were
more likely to receive aspirin and standard drugs called
beta-blockers _ simple, low-tech treatments known to cut the risk
of a subsequent fatal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   A second study in the same journal found that older patients
with hip fractures, stroke, heart disease, and congestive heart
failure had substantially lower mortality rates if they were
treated at major teaching hospitals compared to other types. The
survival edge was most pronounced for hip fracture patients.
</P>
<P>
   But mortality comparisons are not the only measure of a ``best''
hospital. Dr. Jerome Kassirer, the journal's editor, noted in an
editorial that major teaching hospitals scored lower on a 1998
Massachusetts hospital survey of patient satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals still have
much to learn about providing high-quality care,'' Kassirer
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIT scientists invent `pharmacy on a chip'
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists have invented
what they call a ``pharmacy on a chip'' _ a tiny drug-dispensing
device that could be implanted in the body and programmed to
release drugs successively from its reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the British journal Nature, Robert Langer and his
colleagues say the novel drug-delivery system could be made as
small as two millimeters square _ about eight hundredths of an
inch.

   WALTHAM, Mass. _ ``Do you want me to tell you all the things I
do?'' asks Ed Koch. And then the former mayor of New York leans
back in his chair and ticks them off on the fingers of his large
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Koch as television actor playing the judge in
``The People's Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Koch as political commentator, three times a week
on Bloomberg Television and once a week for the (N.Y.) Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Koch the movie critic, writing reviews every week
for a chain of 24 small papers around the Big Apple. And Koch the
advertising guy; he is currently doing commercials for Jammin'
105.1, an oldies radio station in New York, and last year he
shilled for Dunkin' Donuts, among other companies. Not to mention
Koch on the speaking circuit, Koch the author (now writing his 11th
book), and Koch the teacher at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. And now, the peripatetic 74-year-old lawyer has taken on
yet another ``challenge:'' teaching at Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not finished remaining relevant,'' he says, with a modest
grin, during an interview at Brandeis shortly before his first
class Monday. ``I will never retire.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Koch's obsession with remaining relevant after an
extraordinary three terms as mayor of the world's greatest city is
the operative principle of his life, and it is central to
everything he says and does, even now, after more than 40 years of
public service.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident, for instance, in the way he spins his current
Brandeis gig _ teaching a semester-long course in government to 150
undergrads. He is the second celebrity-politician (former Texas
governor Ann Richards was the first) to assume the university's
mantle of the ``Fred and Rita Richman Distinguished Visiting
Professor'' in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was presented to me as a course (to be taught) by people
who had been in government,'' he says, adding, ``and had left with
their reputations intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch's never-say-die relevance is also apparent in the way he
makes light of his unsuccessful attempt to win an unprecedented
fourth mayoral term: ``I'm probably the most successful political
reject in the history of New York City. The people threw me out in
1989, but they still feel warmly about me and I to them.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is there in the clever sound bites he delivers in a phone
call with a Washington Post reporter, who is writing on deadline
about the impeachment trial: ``It's not as exciting as a case I had
on the People's Court about the python who ate the Chihuahua.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is no more obvious than when he takes the bully pulpit in
front of a lecture hall filled with students, many of them from New
York City, and spins the story of his mayoral years, as only
Hizzoner can.
</P>
<P>
   When he became mayor in 1978, Koch tells the students, he had
two major objectives: balance the budget and make New Yorkers, who
had come within a hair's breath of bankruptcy, ``feel better about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am by personality and temperament a restrained, shy,
reticent human being,'' says Koch, whose shoot-from-the-hip style
in his third term earned him the epithet ``Mayatollah'' from the
local media. ``But I knew that if I didn't become bigger than life
. . . people wouldn't follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   So unlike his predecessor, Abraham Beame, he became a mayor who
was accessible to the press and above all, ``quotable,'' Koch says.
He also became a boss who didn't take no from his underlings.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to change New York's reputation as a city that
never paid its bills, Koch says, he threatened to tell the press
which of his commissioners weren't paying their departments' bills
on time. When he did just that, the parks commissioner, who had
placed last on the list, paid a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was so humiliated and he was never going to be 10th
on that list again,'' Koch recalls. ``He told me that he went back
to his comptroller and said, `If I'm in 10th place again, it's your
ass.' And guess what? He was never number 10 again.''
</P>
<P>
   The students laugh appreciatively. And later when Koch
criticizes Mayor Rudy Giuliani for his mean streak, his tendency to
``go for the jugular,'' the students nod their heads in agreement.
They don't seem to see, or perhaps have chosen to overlook, the
contradiction between how Koch sees himself _ a righteous leader
who was tough for the sake of the city _ and how he views the
mayors who came after him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani will never be a great mayor because he doesn't enjoy
and like people. Dinkins was a very nice guy and a terrible mayor.
Giuliani is a good mayor and a terrible person.''
</P>
<P>
   Class over, Koch, his trademark bald head leading the way,
strides purposively down the stairs of the Golding Judaica Center,
flanked by his handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Without pausing to speak to the students who cluster nearby,
Koch hops into a car parked on the sidewalk, waiting to take him to
the 6:30 p.m. shuttle back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it, Ed Koch is still a man on the move.

A SEPARATION BASED ON STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was developing a bad attitude about this winter. Could last
weekend have been any worse? Was last Sunday _ 50 degrees and
torrential rain in January _ just God's way of letting non-drinkers
see what a hangover is like?
</P>
<P>
   From New Year's Day to Martin Luther King weekend, a combination
of natural and manmade snow gave us quite good conditions,
especially considering how boney Christmas week was, not to mention
the weeks before it.
</P>
<P>
   Those stingy weeks before the holidays kept the ground bare and
brown, the trees and rocks dangerously close to the surface. Then,
the snow came, but now this spring stuff really has ski country
feeling a bit schizophrenic. If last Sunday was ugly, Saturday at
Sugarbush, where I happened to be skiing, the dawn broke a foggy
wet gray.
</P>
<P>
   It was not particularly inviting as we trudged toward the lift
after breakfast, feeling almost like we were going to work. Up, up
into the fog we rode, looking down for some sign of how conditions
were below. Then, sliding off, the first 6 feet down the ramp gave
an indication: fast and fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   We started on a familiar cruiser, Jester, so that we could sort
of remember where the turns were in the thickest pockets of fog,
and with about 15 yards visability, following the swichbacks became
fairly easy.
</P>
<P>
   The lower we descended, the thinner the fog, and we skied faster
on snow that was soft and fast, a nearly perfect ride with almost
no one else on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   This may not have been the day for back-country slashing through
the woods, and it was certainly not a day for the 75-m.p.h.
downhill racers I was there to cover. But cruising at half that
speed made this one terrific ski day, even with the light a bit,
uh, flat and a few raindrops falling here and there. It even gave
me a chance to deliver my lecture 27A to companions on the quad
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason the Swiss and Austrians become such great skiers,''
I pontificated, ``is their feel for the snow. When they're just
kids in camp, they do some training exercises where they ski with
tape over their goggles. No, really. A coach skis behind them
yelling out when to turn right and left. They have to learn to
react to feel instead of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I think I remember a European coach telling me this once,
but the point was valid. At least that was my story, and I was
sticking to it. Watching downhill racers free-ski _ part of my
life's work, you understand _ it becomes quickly obvious what the
difference is between a decent recreational skier and a great one.
For starters, that difference is never apparent until conditions
throw a curve.
</P>
<P>
   Two Austrian racers, Leonhard Stock and Peter Wirnsberger, went
down one run ahead of us as we worked our skis to adjust to unseen
variances of terrain and pillows of loose, soft snow on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   And as we tried to shift gears properly, reacting to change,
those great skiers (any racer who makes the Austrian National Team
is by definition a great skier) did not appear to make the least
movements at all, particularly in the upper body. Their skis were
smooth, thighs absorbing bumps like shock absorbers, their body
flow just seamless as they shot away from us down the trail.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that the vast majority of middle-ability
skiers are terminally intermediate and will not improve without
instruction, or without pushing themselves into uncomfortable
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   So who wants to be uncomfortable?
</P>
<P>
   Take Average Blue Cruiser. Ten years ago, ABC might have gone
down the Starr trail or headed for Castle Rock or the Snowfields
just for the satisfaction of making it to the bottom in one piece _
not a particularly lofty goal.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a decade ago, and now maybe he doesn't have a
yapping adolsecent around to goad him into risks. Or maybe he just
likes to relax a bit more now, and hasn't really wanted a tough
challenge for years.
</P>
<P>
   Skiing 10 or 12 times a year (the US average) ABC isn't
progressing, and he's probably going backwards, like a guy who
doesn't get to the putting green enough. These days, when ABC hits
an icy day or bumped up terrain, or tough weather conditions, he
bails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life's too short,'' he says. ``I'm here to relax, not to prove
anything to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   So here is a definite crossroad, and ABC has a point. There will
be enough good days on the slopes for him to enjoy corduroy
cruising to the end of his days.
</P>
<P>
   The other route is to push off the plateau, to take a bump class
or some ice training. Practice skiing through trees, in and out of
crud, over the fearsome death cookies of a frozen granular track.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is not to survive varied terrain and conditions (an
intermediate skier can survive anything). The goal is to learn to
shift gears so imperceptibly as conditions underfoot change, that
you can ski anything as smoothly and confidently as ABC skis those
groomed white boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   It can even begin by trying to follow a couple of Austrian
downhillers through the fog.
</P>

A TRIP TO MOE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON HOLE, WYO. _ As can happen occasionally on chairlifts,
conversation hit a lull. So the guy seated to the far right
recalled his thoughts the moment before he launched from the
starting gate to win downhill gold in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands forward, outside ski,'' Tommy Moe recalled the other
day, reflecting on what went through his mind during the countdown
at the Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games. Then he added one of those
nuggets that buffs to a shine when it comes unsolicited from a
superstar just passing the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing here, same thing in any terrain. Keep the hands
forward and over the (downhill) ski,'' said Moe.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the inaugural Tommy Moe All-Mountain Ski Camp,
conducted where, when the skiing gets tough, the not-yet-tough get
scared and squirrely _ and ultimately better.
</P>
<P>
   Moe, 28, has just joined the elder Pepi Stiegler of 1964 Winter
Olympic fame to become the newest ``skiing ambassador'' to Jackson
Hole. Moe's four-day camp is one of five specialty ski and
snowboard workshops geared predominantly to improving the skills of
intermediate and advanced snow riders.
</P>
<P>
   The camps range in cost from $400 to $600, and include lift
tickets and other incidentals. For example, an ``incidental'' at
the Moe camp (the next one is slated for March 11-14) includes an
evening lesson at a nearby swimming pool learning how to snap roll
a kayak. The relevance of kayak proficiency on a 10,450-foot
mountain remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's fun!'' proclaimed Moe.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting epitaph for a man destined to play fast for a living.
In addition to winning gold in the downhill, Moe won silver in the
super-G, retiring from the US Ski Team last year to ski for Jackson
Hole and join the professional circuit. He currently leads the pack
in the Ford Downhill Series, placing last weekend at Sugarbush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that difficult to have fun and ski for a
living,'' said a lad who thinks nothing of dropping 20 vertical
feet into Corbett's Couloir, which would be the graduation exercise
(not compulsory) for his January camp.
</P>
<P>
   A scheduling windfall two weeks ago allowed me to join Moe for
the first day, our ranks including two mothers, a teen-ager, and a
73-year-old retired electical engineer from the flats of Michigan
who had been skiing for only six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've got to factor in that they have been full years,''
said John Davies, who lives in Teton Village at the base of the ski
area's tramway.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 began in steep bumps in Cheyanne Bowl where, one by one,
campers were asked to strut their stuff in front of coaches who
then divided us by skill level. John Grant, a local landscaper,
became my partner. When Grant is not skiing narrow chutes or
tickling the levers of earth-moving machines, he competes in
national swing dance competitions. The point is, one part of his
body tends to know precisely what the other part is doing. I tend
to leave body parts behind.
</P>
<P>
   So I followed him. He followed Moe, and when Moe was instructing
other groups, he followed Bruce Keller, a member of the Jackson
Hole Ski School who, despite his Kansas roots, has a specialty in
skiing extreme terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is confidence building. Confidence is transferable,
from one environment to another,'' Keller explained as our trio set
off to explore such double-black diamond delights as Toilet Bowl,
Alta 1, Dick's Ditch, and Tower. The names say it all. No cruisers
here. And now a note about the local jargon.
</P>
<P>
   If the start of a run requires ``hopping in,'' don't think Hokey
Pokey, think free fall. ``Chocolate chips'' are not nibbles; they
are scatter shot of limestone shards in the snow that stop skis
like the barbed ends of fish hooks. You do not want to ``biff'' on
a chocolate chip. To ``point it'' means to take a deep breath and
plummet in the company of your angel. With skill, you'll ``huck''
it, which means your angel persevered. If you hucked it with
``aggro'' (aggression), your angel's taking Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a summary of some of the lessons learned from a
day of hucking the steeps with Tommy Moe and friends:
</P>
<P>
   --About half the ski boots worn by recreational skiiers are too
big, leading the wearer to over tighten the buckles and warp the
shell to the point it creates sores. Big boots are quick sales in
some equipment shops. Test: Remove an inner boot, place your foot
in the shell with toes snug to the front. You should have enough
room behind your heel to insert a little more than one finger.
</P>
<P>
   --When the going gets steep, the body should lead the skis
downhill. To the inexperienced, the alternative is preferable _
skis first, then the torso safely snuggling the hill above. This
puts the weight back and will end in a biff (see above).
</P>
<P>
   --The steeper the terrain and/or the faster the speed, the less
input is needed to accomplish a turn. And of course, hands forward
and over the outside (downhill) ski to maximize edging on the
downhill ski and stabilize the platform _ your stance.
</P>
<P>
   How does Tommy Moe feel about seeing a lifetime of ski training
condensed into three bulleted paragraphs gleaned from one day in
his ski camp?
</P>
<P>
   This is not known. He wasn't asked. But a safe bet might be
following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrific! Have fun!''

FACING HIS 23RD OPERATION, SCHLERETH GOING STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A strong case can be made that they're all crazy, every
single one of them. Professional football is, after all, a barbaric
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But among these gladiators, there are degrees of madness. There
are tough guys and there are really tough guys. There are stories
and there are epics. There are medical risks and there is Mark
Schlereth.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doctor in his right mind would ever pass me for a physical
if his job were on the line,'' Schlereth reports. ``But this is the
NFL. If they want you to pass the physical, you will pass the
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to Denver this season, he went wading into the
free agent waters. He flunked physicals in Chicago, Indianapolis,
and _ you'll love this _ Atlanta. Back in Denver, however, no
problem. The Broncos quite obviously wanted this 33-year-old,
287-pound guard to pass his latest physical. He has started every
game this season. On Sunday, he will start at left guard in Super
Bowl XXXIII _ against the Falcons. A week later, he will undergo
his 23d career surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things floating around inside my left elbow,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   He has had his knees invaded 17 times. The upcoming procedure
will be the fourth on his elbows. He has had back surgery. And he
has had kidney stones removed. They came out at 9 on a Sunday
morning. The next evening, he played a half in a Monday night game
before feeling too ill to continue. ``We were up, 21-0, at the
half, so I didn't feel too badly about missing the second half,''
he explains.
</P>
<P>
   If playing can be painful, not playing can be even worse. When
surgery for two herniated disks forced him to watch another Monday
night game on television, Schlereth couldn't handle it. ``I was
physically ill watching the game and knowing that I should be out
there with my teammates,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Matter-of-fact doesn't quite describe this fourth-generation
Alaskan's attitude toward his medical situation. Fatalistic doesn't
quite do it, either. Is it possible for a man to accept one's
physical fate with serene defiance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your pens ready,'' he commands. ``I'll explain myself to
you. I am nine parts stupidity and one part complete lunacy. If
something is important to you, then do it. Football is important to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that if someone had told this guy on the occasion of
his first operation 16 years ago that it would be the first of 23,
it would not have remotely fazed him. He might even have thought it
would be pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   When you've battled through dyslexia, you feel confident you can
overcome life's obstacles. You go through the dyslexia, the 22
surgeries, and a bout with a debilitating disease known as
Guillain-Barre syndrome _ which rendered him pathetically weak and
took away the feeling in his hands and feet for three months back
in '92 _ and it makes you amazingly resilient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you learn from adversity,'' Schlereth maintains. ``I
am stubborn and rockheaded. I have never learned anything about
myself in good times. Adversity is good for me. Because of it, I
know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He is surely a Bill Parcells kind of guy. ``During football
season,'' The Tuna loves to say, ``football players play
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schlereth corollary: ``When I've been a free agent, I've
told people, `Don't even fly me in if you want me to pass the
physical. But if you want someone who is going to line up and play,
I can do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He is a legend in the Denver locker room. ``Mark Schlereth is a
guy who has had 22 surgeries,'' says coach Mike Shanahan. ``When we
signed him, a lot of people thought his career was through.
Football is very important to him. When guys come into the locker
room and they're a little hurt, they look at him and say, `I'm not
hurt.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He's not just tough; he's good. He's been to Pro Bowls and he
has won championship rings with both Washington ('92) and last
year's Broncos. But he has become so identified with the surgeries
and what they represent in the larger picture that there is a
danger he will eventually pass through the game without being
properly appreciated for his skill.
</P>
<P>
   As if he cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I walk off the playing field,'' he roars, ``none of
you will remember me. Ten years down the road, I will be forgotten.
I'm not playing to establish any legacy. But I will know that no
one ever got more out of his body in the history of the game than I
have. I'm saying that in all humility. I can't say I'm proud of
that. But that's the way it is. I just want to be remembered by my
teammates as someone who put out the effort in every practice and
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a stupid man. He has made a rational choice to play
football as hard, and as long, as he can. As a current consequence,
he reports, he cannot bend over to putt a golf ball or crawl on the
floor to play with his kids. He will almost undoubtedly require as
many artificial body parts as they manufacture, but that is of no
concern to him right now. ``I don't spend a minute of wasted time
worrying about what the future holds,'' he says. ``I have no idea
what's going to happen. The damage to my body has been done. I'll
just press on and cross that road when it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   His daily motivations? ``Fear and paranoia,'' he says. ``There
is the fear of failure and the fear of getting beaten up and the
fear of being embarrassed. It's all part of being an offensive
lineman. A defensive lineman can play a poor game and then make one
sack late and get in the highlights. An offensive lineman can play
57 or 58 great minutes with no one paying attention and then give
up one sack late, and what will be in the highlights?''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, therefore, that offensive linemen are so
notoriously clannish? ``I am a Christian, and I truly believe I am
here to serve others,'' says Schlereth. ``Offensive linemen must
always be ready to help each other on the field, and if I needed
help at 3 in the morning, I would feel comfortable calling any one
of those guys, and they all know they could call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are the bad knees, the bad elbows, and the bad
back, and it goes without saying there are the hopelessly mangled
fingers and the toes that have been stepped on countless times and
probably a half-dozen other things Mark Schlereth thinks are too
irrelevant to talk about. In his own strange way, they are his
comfort, his reminder of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are so much a part of my life,'' he says, ``that
I wouldn't know what to do if I felt good. I've just adjusted to it
all and gotten used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   You tell him he's crazy. I'll pass.

ANDERSEN HAS MADE THE RIGHT EXCHANGE

<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida's Turnpike can bring you to Sunday's Super Bowl.
Interstate 95 also can deliver you close to the big game. Many
other lesser-known routes lead to Pro Player Stadium as well.
</P>
<P>
   Morten Andersen's path to Super Bowl XXXIII, though, is one of
the most intriguing, even if it cannot be found on any map.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen arrived in the United States as an exchange student on
his 17th birthday. He had arrived from the little town of Struer,
Denmark, where his mother was a librarian, his father a
psychologist and supervisor of educational programs for handicapped
children. Andersen truly was bound for the heart of America on his
birthday, to the home of the Baker family in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following day after I arrived with the Bakers, they told
me there was something called a `jamboree,' '' recalled Andersen,
whose English is perfect now but who could not understand back then
what this ``jamboree'' word meant. ``The Bakers asked me if I
wanted to go to the jamboree.''
</P>
<P>
   All lives, in retrospect, have such moments at which they turn.
Andersen was an athlete in his little town of 9,000, and when he
came to America, he wanted to play soccer. But the high school he
would be attending had no soccer team. Yet there was this
``football,'' this ``jamboree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bakers told me this was sort of a preseason game, and Dale
Baker asked me if I wanted to go and watch this jamboree,''
Andersen said of his conversation with the head of the Baker
family. ``I said . . . what could I say? . . . I didn't know what
he was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   So Andersen went to the game, watched all these boys in strange
helmets and padded shoulders, ``and I had no clue what was going on
out there.'' But word had passed through the local grapevine that
this boy had arrived from Denmark, and of course, all Europeans
play soccer, and perhaps Andersen could kick the football. ``They
told me the high school team had no kicker and they asked me if I
wanted to try out,'' he recalled. ``I told them I'd give it a
try.''
</P>
<P>
   The school ``threw together some equipment for me, and I put it
on and I think my number was 42 _ a pretty high number for a
kicker, huh? _ and the team and the coaches lined up on the side
and watched me kick,'' Andersen said. ``We started on extra points,
and I hit the extra points, and then we moved back 30 yards and the
ball was still going through. I could could tell the other guys
were pretty excited and the coach was, too. So that was my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is a bit more to the story.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for his first actual game of the season, a
season that would wind up an 11-1 success, Andersen was given some
unusual instructions for his kickoffs by his coach, Bob Wilbur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that when I kicked the ball, I should just run for
the sidelines the moment I kicked it,'' said Andersen. ``So I would
kick the ball and I would just haul for the sidelines. So
basically, we had just 10 guys covering the kick all year long.
Every time, I'd kick and then I would just run for the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   A vivid image of an interesting starting point on that Andersen
road to the Super Bowl. Kick the ball and run like mad to the
sideline. The first step of this kicker can be copied by little
boys and girls, but not the first step of this journey. Never.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until much later in the season that Andersen had a
clue about what was going on between the teams on the field. ``I
was not close-minded when I came to America,'' he said. ``The
reason I came here was because I wanted to expose myself to a
different culture, the language and the people. But I really had to
open my mind up to football.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andersen could kick, and soon recruiters noticed him and he
went to Michigan State, where he was very good, and then to the
NFL, where he has been very, very good for 17 years. In fact, it
was his overtime field goal at Minnesota in the NFC Championship
Game that enabled the Atlanta Falcons to complete their improbable
trip to the Super Bowl, where they'll meet the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Andersen would return to Denmark to visit
family and friends. And from time to time on those trips, he would
go to a nearby soccer field and practice his kicking. Little Danish
boys and girls and older Danes would gather to see this famous son
of Streur who had made so much money kicking. ``I'd be kicking at a
soccer net, and of course, I'd be trying to kick it over the net
and not into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, the Danes surmised, money must be easy to come by in
America, since this Andersen can't even kick the ball into the net,
even without a goalie there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd happen all the time,'' he recalled, laughing at the
memory. ``They'd be watching me kick and they're saying, `This
guy's really, really bad,' and `He's terrible; he kicks them all
over the crossbar.' Several times, boys would come up to me and
say, `No, hit it into the net. Don't keep hitting it over the net.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark may still be confused about why America considers Morten
Andersen so good when he can't even do what any Danish boy or girl
does so easily _ kick a ball into a net. But Danish television has
a videocam and a reporter with ``Sporten2'' on his microphone
recording Andersen's every move and word this week, and three
sportswriters from Danish newspapers are scribbling down every
vignette.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has a custom-made kicking shoe, and every detail of
that $5,000 shoe is public fodder. Andersen has been to Nepal to
find harmony and peace up in the Himalayas, and it slipped out that
``I've seen Tibetan monks levitating,'' and media skeptics have
grilled him about that.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Andersen reviews his list of Super Bowl ticket
requests, the names of people for whom he absolutely has to find
tickets. His parents, of course, Hanne and Erik; brother Jakob;
Janice Appelgreen of Big Rapids, Mich., who was his surrogate mom
when he was at Michigan State; wife Jennifer and her family from
Maine; his old neighbors from New Orleans; and yes, Lois and Dale
Baker of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to take care of the people,'' he said, ``all of
them who took care of me.'' Or even, like the Bakers, who asked the
question which changed Andersen's life: ``Do you want to go and
watch the jamboree?''

THEQUE-MOVIE (Los Angeles) After nearly two decades, the American

Hollywood Blvd. It begins continuous programming there next week
with a spectacular James Cameron retrospective, and over the next
few months will present an eclectic range of series. 
. 
STREEP-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ With her uncanny ability to disappear
into a character, Meryl Streep established herself in the '70s as a

rich and poor, mother and daughter, jilted wife and cheating
spouse, lover and friend, criminal and whistle-blower. By Bob
McCarthy. 
. 
TINSEL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Tinseltown'' is a misfired comedy
about talentless show-biz wanna-bes trying to hustle their way into
the Hollywood movie game. Some jokes about the people responsible
for making the film could be made here, but it would not be fair to
do so. Not too far off the mark in some of their cases, but still
unfair. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
SHES-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``She's All That'' isn't much. One of
the approximately 150 high school comedies coming out this year,
it's as bland and generic as ``Varsity Blues'' was calculated and
pandering. Frightening as the prospect may be, at least we might
remember ``Varsity Blues'' by the time the millennium gets here. No
chance of that happening with this one. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
TITANIC-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The Switchblade Kittens' punky
girl-centric version of ``My Heart Will Go On'' is the the funniest
song parody you may never hear. ``I heard Celine Dion's version on
the radio so many times it was driving me nuts, so I decided we had
to make a joke out of it,'' says Switchblade Kittens' leader,
bassist and singer Drama Mahaffey-Arthur. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
SHARPS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ I'm not one of those who believes
there's little interesting or challenging pop music being produced
anymore. I just don't think the labels are bound by law to sign 35
versions of the same hit sound. What's needed is more creativity in
the executive suite. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
TRIO-VIDEO (LoS Angeles) _ Three films that feature
independent-minded women hit video stores Tuesday: the outrageously
funny ``There's Something About Mary'' and Disney's animated
``Mulan.'' But you may have missed the third one _ an enjoyable bit
of comic fluff called ``Shooting Fish.'' By Rob Lowman.

`HOMICIDE' COPS GET HANDS-ON LESSON IN INTERNET CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A serial killer is mutilating young girls,
posting grisly video clips of his handiwork on the World Wide Web.
To catch the video producer, the police give chase on the Net,
diving into the arcane culture of the on-line world with its
confusion of addresses, chat rooms and fake e-mail drops.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens on the Feb. 5 episode of NBC's ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' the critically acclaimed police program that
airs 10 p.m. EST (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   To help the show's old-school detectives navigate through the
intricacies of an on-line crime investigation, ``Homicide'' writers
turned to Alex Wellen and Luke Reiter, two young lawyers who host
the ``CyberCrime TV'' broadcast on a computer-based television
channel in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to us with the concept of a murder that would be
broadcast live on the Internet,'' said Reiter, 28, a former
district attorney in Queens, New York. ``They wanted to know
whether or not it was technologically feasible for somebody to do
what their made-up killer could do on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair's answer was enough to create a multimedia extravaganza
that should satiate even the most die-hard ``Homicide'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the ``Homicide.Com'' episode airs on NBC, the Web
site for the program _ called ``Second Shift'' (www.homicide.com) _
will begin showing a pre-TV show episode. Using New York-based
actors, ``Second Shift'' will feature the preliminary investigation
of a mysterious, shocking on-line film of a murder. The Web site
detectives investigate the authenticity of the video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Then the TV show takes over, where Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet
Kotto), Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer) and the other
fictional gumshoes from the Baltimore homicide bureau track down
the killer. ``Second Shift'' takes over after the TV episode for
some post-investigation work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show will flow back and forth between the Web and TV,''
said Ayelet Sela, a writer/producer of the Web site. ``We're going
to be laying some new ground here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were looking to us for was to try figure out how
detectives would go about investigating this kind of a high-tech
murder,'' said Reiter, who spent his DA days chasing New York
homicide officers. ``They wanted to show how old-school detectives
would investigate a murder on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an easy gig for Reiter and Wellen, who have been
reporting on on-line crime and other stories since the ZDTV
computer channel was launched last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we helped show them how to sustain a story that had a
lot of high-tech angles,'' said Wellen, a civil lawyer from
Manhattan. ``That's because we've been into all aspects of this
stuff for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiter said he and Wellen, who attended Temple Law School in
Philadelphia together, were invited to Baltimore in December to
observe the ``Homicide.Com'' episode being filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that was interesting,'' said Wellen, who used the chance
to create his own segment on the experience for ZDTV. The project
was mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really helped make the show work,'' said Sara Charno, a
``Homicide'' writer and co-producer. ``For example, in a regular
mundane murder, you look for fingerprints, hair and witnesses,''
Charno said. ``In a cybercrime, we had to show what steps you take
to trace information. ... We had to show how a criminal could erase
his on-line traces.''
</P>
<P>
   Charno also used tips from Wellen and Reiter to avoid what the
television and movie industry calls ``Internet syndrome'' _ endless
scenes of a character parked in front of a computer screen, typing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charno, ``Homicide'' producer Jay Tobias boosted
the episode's number of scenes to 80 from the usual 40 to 60. ``We
wanted the pace to be fast and furious,'' Charno said.
</P>
<P>
   The network experience has Wellen and Reiter thinking of further
moves into new venues, including a novel and a pilot for a
fictional crime TV series. ``It'll be the next wave in law
enforcement drama on TV,'' Reiter said. ``Its about time for a new
kind of crime show.''

ACTRESS JODI O'KEEFE, CLOSET KLUTZ, IS ON A ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Good news for teen-age girls throughout the
land! Actress Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, she of the perfect hair, teeth and
bod _ not to mention a face like Venus _ is a klutz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every sense of the word, completely and totally,'' she says
solemnly, sitting in a hotel conference room in San Francisco as
she promotes her new film, ``She's All That.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't care who knows it!''
</P>
<P>
   While filming a recent episode of ``Nash Bridges'' here (she
plays Don Johnson's daughter), the 20-year-old was wearing only a
moleskin in the shower, when she slipped and hit her head _ hard.
``Everyone came running over to me _ `Are you OK?' _ and I was
screaming at them, `I'm fine, I'm fine, and I'm NAKED!' It was bad,
though. I had this big old bruise on my forehead that made me look
like something out of `Star Trek.'''
</P>
<P>
   And while filming ``She's All That'' _ in which she plays an
evil high school senior named Taylor _ O'Keefe had a few other
mishaps. Like during a love scene with Matthew Lillard
(``Scream''), when he flipped her over and she cracked her head on
the headboard; another scene called for her to leap into Lillard's
arms, and every time she did, her tube top fell down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I can blame that one on my lack of ... you know...''
and she bursts out laughing. Say what? Taylor is presented as one
buxom babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about Wonderbras every day!'' says O'Keefe, who
talks 90 miles an hour, while poking at a chocolate on her plate.
``For this movie we're talking pushed-up, padded, silicone. You
know, the kind that comes out of a box. I would take them out and
throw them at people like bean bags!''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe is such a seasoned professional, having started acting
at 8, that there are only occasional glimpses _ like this one _
into her youthfulness. She grows serious again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm trying to not be insecure about it. I'm planning to
have a career based on my acting skills rather than the size of my
chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another reason for looks-obsessed girls to hope: O'Keefe
was once a geek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, fully!'' she laughs. ``When I was a freshman, I was 5 feet
9 and totally skinny as a pole. Knock-knees and bad hair. Then over
that summer I grew up a little bit. Not that I was some super
beauty, but at least I didn't look like I was 10 anymore and had a
little self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Having ``been there'' herself, O'Keefe has complete sympathy for
the shy, geeky young woman character in the movie that she, as the
reigning high school diva, is supposed to torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this scene where I was supposed to pour wine down Rachel
Cook's dress was really hard,'' she admits. ``I felt like this
horrible monster. I apologized to her 100 times until she had to
tell me it's OK, just pour the damn wine.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe joined the cast of ``Nash Bridges'' at age 16, when she
moved to California from New Jersey to take the job. Her mother
moved with her and stayed until she turned 18. Now in its fourth
season, O'Keefe's character has supposedly enrolled at the
University of California at Berkeley, although she's still seen
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   What about published rumors that she and Johnson were an item at
one time? O'Keefe politely declares that Johnson is a rumor magnet
because ``women love him. And I do, too _ but not that way. I mean,
I love his whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe says she has minded rumor items about her only ``because
of how they impact my family back home. But I always tell them, if
you want to know the truth, call me. I'm getting sort of used to it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe has an apartment in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where
she goes in her spare time.
</P>
<P>
   As for her college plans, O'Keefe says she plans to attend at
some point, ``but not for a while. I figure I should strike while
the iron is hot. While the opportunity is there, and the work.
School will always be there. I was thinking Mills College, because
I really love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   She is waiting for the ink to dry on a couple of new movie deals
before she can talk about them. But she has high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really admire actresses like Meryl Streep; I would love to
have a career like hers. And Natalie Wood _ I thought she was so
beautiful. And I want to make a movie with Al Pacino someday. Maybe
that sounds ridiculous now, but if I keep saying it, maybe it will
come true!''

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ Senators are struggling to reach a bipartisan
timetable for the remainder of President Clinton's impeachment
trial as the White House signals it may forgo defense witnesses if
there's no new damaging testimony. Senate Republican leader Trent
Lott and Democratic leader Tom Daschle expressed hope they could
present a proposal today to conclude the trial by Feb. 12 or
sooner. Any agreement approved in party meetings would be presented
for approval in today's impeachment trial session.

   BARR _ ATLANTA _ House impeachment prosecutor Bob Barr was back
in Atlanta Thursday, a day after the potentially forshadowing
Senate votes of Wednesday. Hanging with Barr to get his take on
where the process goes from here and what constituents think.
(Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15-18.

<P>
   PETS-LEPTO _ WASHINGTON - Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease
that infects humans and numerous animals, apparently is becoming
increasingly common in dogs, according to some veterinary schools.
At times the shock to a canine's kidneys is so severe the animal
must have hemodialysis to survive. Only four veterinary hospitals
in the country are equipped to administer the treatment. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service).

   JACKSON _ DAYTON _ Rev. Jesse Jackson comes to Dayton this
afternoon to announce his latest initiative, calling for 1,000
churches to begin investment clubs and mentoring programs for
troubled youths in their churches. This is, in part, a continuation
of his effort to encourage investment in Appalachia. (Franklin,

$35 million Miracles of Mentoring campaign with a goal of building
a national youth leadership institute in

<P>
   metro Atlanta. (PScott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   TEENDRIVE-GRADES _ ASHEVILLE, N.C._Wanda Coates, the registrar
at the 1,225-student high school in this western N.C. mountain
community, has one tough duty ahead of her next week. She must sort
through the grades of all ninth and tenth graders, siphoning off
those who failed two or more courses, to send letters telling them
they've lost their driver's license. Last year, the N.C.
Legislature tied driving privileges to school performance. The
first grading period since then has just ended, with some 30,000
students expected to lose their license this month, according to
Artie Kamiya, who is overseeing the project for the N.C. Department
of Instruction. In all, 17 states tie school attendance to driving
privileges, but only a few add the extra provision of maintaining
good grades. In Georgia, the state can yank a license if students
are suspended from school for violence, drug or alcohol use on
school grounds or for having a weapon at school. It does not punish
dropouts or those with poor grades. (Riddle, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   TRACK COUGH _ More on the strange `kennel cough' afflicting
greyhound tracks around Florida. Need to talk to experts to find
out: is it a bacteria or virus, what is it exactly, symptoms, how
you treat it, are track owners reluctant to treat dogs because they
can't raise while being medicated, how often do you get this kind
of outbreak, what are the rules about shifting dog from track to
track, where are the Palm Beach kennel dogs bred, do they have an
outbreak, etc? (Donald, Palm Beach Post)..
</P>
<P>
   UNITED-WAY _ AUSTIN _ Austin set a national record for
increasing its contributions to the United Way in 1998, the second
year in a row that Austin has seen among the highest increases in
the nation. The big increase in contributions from Dell and the
other high-tech companies, and the increase in people giving over
$1,000, fueled the growth. (Thatcher, Austin American-Statesman).

   STATE LEGISLATIVE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   TEX-LEGIS-BUDGET _ AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush unveils his
budget plan on Thursday. We are looking for details on his proposed
$2 billion school property tax cut and how he plans to make sure
local school districts don't simply raise local taxes (like they
did in 1997) to fill the gap. How much money will Bush put into his
plan for remedial programs to stop kids from being socially
promoted? (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman).

   SC-LEGIS-LOTTERY _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ South Carolina legislature
takes the first step toward approving a lottery. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GA-LEGIS-LOBBY _ ATLANTA _ Doors to the House and Senate were
flung open for them but now a badge bars them from the chambers
where they once helped write laws. Once legislators they are now
lobbyists _ among the more than 1,000 who work the Capitol halls;
among the ones targeted by Gov. Roy Barnes in his ``eel-skinned
briefcases and aligator shoes'' comments. (Cook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15-18.

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein appears closer to
death now than at any time. In recent days, he has thrown the royal
palace -- and an adoring public -- into a frenzy with a 14-page
letter written to his brother, Prince Hassan, essentially naming
his son, Abdullah, as his successor to the thrown, then suddenly
jetting back to the United States in an apparent relapse of his
cancer. What's really going on here? Who are the key players? Why
are all eyes in Israel and the Arab world focused on this tiny
country of nomads? Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

TERRORISM AT ABORTION CLINICS ISN'T FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For years now, pro-choice advocates have tried
to drive home a truth about the violence that is inflicted on
abortion providers and their medical facilities. Last week, Hillary
Rodham Clinton became perhaps the most prominent mainstream figure
to join this effort. She identified clinic violence for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not free expression,'' she said. ``This is domestic
terrorism and it must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the National Abortion Rights Action League on
the 26th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision
that affirmed a woman's right to an abortion, the first lady cited
some familiar statistics:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years there have been seven murders (of clinic
doctors or staff), 38 bombings, 146 cases of arson and 733 cases of
vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, as did Nation magazine writer Katha Pollitt, such a
siege against any other business or organization. In a column last
autumn, Pollitt wondered what the national response would be ``if
zealots like the ones who burn down abortion clinics and kill
doctors and stalk their children were committing the same crime
against, say, dermatology clinics or convents or the Marines.''
</P>
<P>
   How many folks would term these overt criminal acts ``free
expression'' or defend them as a natural result of deep-seated
religious convictions? How many would ignore the fact that the
activities of the dermatologists, nuns or Marines are _ like those
of abortion providers _ still legal?
</P>
<P>
   The day before Hillary Clinton's speech, the Feminist Majority
Foundation reported findings from its most recent survey of the
nation's abortion providers. From January through July 1998, more
than 20 percent of clinics experienced at least one incident of
violence. The incidents included blockades and death threats,
invasions, stalking, bombings, fires and chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a noted abortion provider _ the obstetrician and
gynecologist Dr. Barnett Slepian _ was shot to death through a
window of his home outside Buffalo, N.Y. The prime suspect, a
longtime anti-abortion zealot named James C. Kopp, has eluded the
police and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the shooting of Slepian, Attorney General Janet
Reno finally delivered an appropriate federal response. She created
a task force to prosecute and prevent violence against abortion
providers. Besides establishing a national database on clinic
violence, the task force will train the police and clinic staffs in
response and prevention tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In her abortion rights address, Hillary Clinton told her
audience that the president's forthcoming budget will ask Congress
for $4.5 million for an array of protective devices for abortion
providers. They would include closed-circuit cameras, motion
detectors and bulletproof windows.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the president would not be handicapped by the residue
from his impeachment (and he will), the likelihood of this Congress
allocating such a sum to protect abortion providers is probably
small. Most of the women who use highly visible family planning
clinics are among one of the least powerful influence groups _ the
young and the financially strapped. Middle-class and wealthy women
receive birth control or abortions in their doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, too many members of the male-dominated Senate and
House fear the voting and funding clout of the anti-abortion
movement. They may not be willing to target legal abortion for
extinction, but they don't like to appear to support the procedure
in any active way.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that could include not allocating the funds to protect
providers from being murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke the obvious truth when she said, ``Violence,
harassment and intimidation have no place in our health care system
or in this debate.'' But until our nation's lawmakers admit that
such tactics are indeed domestic terrorism, their place in the
debate and the health care system will be guaranteed.

STREEP WRAPS HERSELF IN MYSTIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With her uncanny ability to disappear into a
character, Meryl Streep established herself in the '70s as a
leading dramatic lady with a chameleonlike quality.
</P>
<P>
   She's played rich and poor, mother and daughter, jilted wife and
cheating spouse, lover and friend, criminal and whistle-blower.
With so many outstanding performances to her credit, it's sometimes
hard to remember Streep as much as the characters she has embodied.
</P>
<P>
   Bing Theater at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is hosting
a retrospective of her work starting Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979, for which she won her first Oscar,
co-starring Dustin Hoffman) and ``A Cry in the Dark'' (1988,
co-starring Sam Neill) will screen Feb. 5, ``Out of Africa'' (1985,
co-starring Robert Redford) on Feb. 6. Streep, a graduate of Yale
Drama School, has compiled a string of memorable performances since
first gaining notice in ``The Deer Hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Other films to be shown in the February series are ``Silkwood,''
``The River Wild,'' ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``Postcards From the
Edge,'' ``Death Becomes Her,'' ``The French Lieutenant's Woman,''
``The Bridges of Madison County'' and two current films, ``One True
Thing'' and ``Dancing at Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   This series is made possible with the support of Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   LACMA's Bing Theater is at 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.
Tickets cost $7 general admission, $5 for museum and AFI members
and students with ID. Purchase of a ticket includes admission to
the museum. Call (323) 857-6010 or Ticketmaster for ticket
information.
</P>
<P>
   PRIDE AND JOY: With the theme of ``Infinite Imagination, the
sixth Pan African Film &AMP; Art Festival opens Thursday at the Magic
Johnson Theatres and the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. The festival
runs through Feb. 15 with actor Malcolm Jamal Warner acting as
celebrity host.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director Ayuko Babu explains that the theme
encompasses the sheer number of exhibitions planned _ 70 features,
shorts and documentaries along with works from prominent and
emerging artists and craftsmen. ``The entire scope of our event
mandates one's infinite imagination,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan African Film Festival is the largest festival of black
films in the United States, according to organizers. Along with
cinema, it offers poetry, fashion and music. Last year's event drew
100,000 spectators and celebrities Sidney Poitier, Tim Reid and
Blair Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Awards for best narrative feature, best documentary, best short
and best student film will be handed out.
</P>
<P>
   Screenings are $7.50 for adults ($4.75 after 6 p.m.) and $4.75
for seniors and children. The opening-night gala is $45. Forums,
children's events, art and photographic exhibits are free. Call
(213) 896-8221 or (323) 295-1706 for information.
</P>
<P>
   `DETROIT 9000' BACK: Director Quentin Tarantino apparently liked
``Detroit 9000'' enough to re-release this 1973 action-packed
standout from the blaxploitation era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit 9000'' is playing today through Sunday only at the
Nuart Theatre, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. Call (310)
478-6379 for show times.
</P>
<P>
   Two cops _ one black, the other white _ set out to discover the
truth about the robbery of a politician in a racially charged
atmosphere. Arthur Marks (``Friday Foster'' and ``Bucktown'')
directed this tame and humor-laced production that features a soul
soundtrack and ultra-hip characters. &QL;

THIS ECLECTIC TRIO WORTH CLOSE LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are three films hitting the video stores
next Tuesday that feature independent-minded women. Two of them are
box-office hits _ the outrageously funny ``There's Something About
Mary'' and Disney's animated ``Mulan'' _ but you may have missed
the third one _ an enjoyable bit of comic fluff called ``Shooting
Fish.'' With ``Mary,'' the Farrelly brothers, who were behind the
summer blockbuster, have managed to mix the gross-out, even
tasteless, humor they are known for into a romantic comedy and make
it work.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the credit goes to the performance of Cameron Diaz
(Mary), as well it should. But the writing-directing brothers
(``Dumb and Dumber,'' ``Kingpin'') have gone beyond their usual
cardboard cutouts and given us characters we can care about in Mary
and Ted (Ben Stiller).
</P>
<P>
   The running joke in ``Mary'' is that this wholesome, intelligent
woman attracts nothing but a collection of losers. But because of
her good heart and determination and the fact that she takes care
of her mentally retarded brother, Mary takes the bizarreness of her
life in stride. The closest thing to a normal guy in her life was
Ted, who disappeared after a humiliating accident (which we are
sure already has been described to you) the night of their prom.
After 13 years of dreaming about her, Ted hires a private
investigator (Matt Dillon) to find her.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to recount the whole plot. ``Mary'' isn't a
perfect mesh. The Farrellys at times still seem caught between the
worlds of gags and storytelling. But it works most of the time, and
most of the time it's hilarious. The cast deserves credit for
throwing themselves into this lunacy. One delightful touch is the
use of singer-songwriter Jonathan Richman as drummer Tommylark in a
twisted Greek chorus.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem much point in hoping that a Disney animation
feature will do well. Like a well-oiled machine, it spits out one
hit after another. But with ``Mulan'' there is a reason. Disney
often has feisty females at the heart of its stories _ ``The Little
Mermaid,'' ``Pocahontas,'' Belle in ``Beauty and the Beast.'' In
``Mulan,'' it has been taken one step farther. The title character
is a young girl on the brink of womanhood. Her family wants her to
marry. But when her infirm father is called back into the army to
fight against invading Huns, she cuts her hair and dons her
father's suit of armor and takes his place in the ranks, calling
herself Ping.
</P>
<P>
   In the army, her former concerns of womanhood are transformed
into concerns with being a man among the other recruits. She must
show her strength and be one of the boys while still being a woman
inside. For most women trying to make it in the business world, it
must seem like a familiar story.
</P>
<P>
   There is love, of course, but for Mulan it is honor, not
romance, that drives her. By the end, she has learned about her
masculine side and become a self-assured woman.
</P>
<P>
   The music is witty, if not memorable. And, as is expected, the
animation is quite wonderful. Smartly, Mulan hasn't been drawn as a
Barbie doll.
</P>
<P>
   `Shooting Fish'' is a light confection that reminds you of those
swinging '60s British comedies, such as ``The Knack, and How to get
It.'' ``Fish'' even has a couple of Burt Bacharach songs in it just
to remind you. It stars Kate Beckinsale as Georgie, a med student
who moonlights as a stenographer. She is hired by a couple of con
men, Jez (Stuart Townsend) and Dylan (Dan Futterman), for one of
their schemes. After she figures out the con, she turns the tables
on the pair, who both grew up as orphans and were raising the money
to fulfill their dreams to have some kind of a family. Georgie
enlists them to raise money to save a medical facility. Love, high
jinks and laughs ensue. ``Shooting Fish'' is one of those little
gems that shouldn't be overlooked. &QL;

   The AC plans to present all the eclectic celluloid the city can
handle, starting with an appropriately big bang: ``Cosmic Fury: The
Spectacular Cinema of James Cameron,'' which features a live
discussion with the uber-director following Wednesday's screening
of his special-edition cut of ``The Abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   And the shows will keep on going, five nights a week. From here
to eternity, the movie gods willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just so glad that we've finally got our own venue, that
we're able to have a theater that says `The American Cinematheque'
on it, that we're able to expand our audience,'' says AC director
of programming Dennis Bartok. ``I think we've always been lucky in
that we've been able to show great films, bring in great filmmakers
and get really appreciative audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I think we have the last piece of the equation, which
is a theater that's equal to the films, the directors and the
audience members who have supported us over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, the AC organized monthly, then weekly,
weekend mini-festivals at the Directors Guild of America building
and Raleigh Studios in Hollywood. With a wide-ranging screening
agenda that emphasized the kind of popular genres (American B
movies, Italian westerns and horror films, Japanese samurai and
yakuza actioners) often overlooked by classics-oriented college and
museum film programs, the AC built up a loyal following of hip,
younger film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the AC managed to serve more traditional
cineastes' needs with surveys of current European cinemas and the
Alternative Screen, a regular showcase for the kinds of independent
filmmakers who were more interested in creating personal visions
than making product reels for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Programming at the 1922 movie palace _ which has been brought
back from earthquake dereliction to its former deco-pharaoh glory,
with state-of-the-art projection and sound systems added to the mix
_ will include more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Make that much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   The initial schedule at the Egyptian sets the tone for the AC's
eclectic agenda. The Cameron retrospective, which concludes Feb. 6
with a 70mm print screening of ``Titanic,'' will be followed Feb.
10 and 11 by two evenings of winners from the currently running
Slamdance Film Festival in Utah. A showcase for low-budget indies
that didn't make it into the concurrent, snootier Sundance
festival, Slamdance's guerrilla best represents the polar opposite
of Cameron's big-budget blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   A two-week survey of films featuring 19 of France's younger
generation of actresses (Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, Nathalie
Richard ...) begins Feb. 12. It's followed by two weeks of recent
Spanish cinema.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a Spike Lee retrospective from March 15-20. You're
no doubt familiar with him, but have you heard of Mike Hodges
(March 26-31), whose masterful British crime films (``Get Carter,''
``Pulp'') were major influences on the Tarantino generation? Get to
know both filmmakers, who will make personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Starting April 2, ``Buried Secrets: The Lost World of Film
Noir'' will offer up rare examples of the influential, midcentury
American thriller cycle. Who even knew there were still good prints
of such dark, '40s and '50s jewels as ``Hell's Half Acre,'' ``The
Killer Is Loose'' and ``The Devil Thumbs a Ride'' _ or that the
films existed in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Finding these and the hundreds of other films required to fill
out the AC's year-round slate is not exactly easy. Bartok, his
small staff and a dedicated group of volunteer consultants depend
on the kindness of studios and the great film archives, such as
those at UCLA and the George Eastman House, to get their prints.
But the job hardly stops there. Individual film collectors and
rights holders have to be located, cultivated and cajoled as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you set your mind that a program is going to happen and
you really start tracking down film prints and the filmmakers, I
would say it takes a good four to five months of hard work,''
Bartok explains.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the average. A planned retrospective of the
virtually forgotten, Russian fantasist Alexander Ptushko, for
example, has taken five years to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the multifilm series, the Egyptian will hold regular
screenings of short films programmed by Andrew Crane and twice
monthly presentations of new, American independent features.
</P>
<P>
   Margot Gerber has been programming the Alternative Screen series
for more than three years. She feels that the theater offers
independent filmmakers and distributors as attractive an L.A.
showcase as they could possibly wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will be interested in getting their film
exhibited at the Egyptian because it's such an amazing venue,''
Gerber notes. ``Alternative Screen will be in the big house (the
600-plus seat Lloyd E. Rigler auditorium), with all the
state-of-the-art projection and on a really big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because we have a smaller theater too (the 83-seat Steven
Spielberg auditorium), we can also become another cinema where
small distributors or self-distribution entities can talk to us
about actually booking their film for five or 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   AC director Barbara Zicka Smith expects that to be just one of
many changes the organization _ and its programming strategy _ will
now undergo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick will be going from this very kind of renegade,
underground organization to being an organization with this big
theater on Hollywood Boulevard,'' says Smith. ``We sit here and we
think that it's not going to change, but it is going to change and
there's nothing we can do about it. We've worked really hard to
affect a change that we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Long and hard. The Cinematheque was the brainchild of Gary
Essert and Gary Abrahams, the founders of Filmex, L.A.'s always
overstuffed, perpetually undercapitalized and fondly remembered
international film festival of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As Filmex fizzled in the early '80s, the Garys refocused their
energy on forming a kind of permanent festival along the lines of
cinematheques in Paris, Rome, Moscow, Jerusalem and other major
world cities.
</P>
<P>
   For over a decade, though, plans for a permanent AC home were
tied to failed Hollywood real-estate development schemes. Smith,
who had worked at Filmex, gradually assumed more responsibility for
the homeless organization as the Garys' health deteriorated (they
died of AIDS complications within weeks of each other in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the Northridge Earthquake severely damaged the
Egyptian property, the city of Los Angeles agreed to turn it and a
$3 million repair grant over to the AC. Donations and loans paid
for the rest of the $14 million repair cost.
</P>
<P>
   Money is still being raised to pay off about $4 million owed on
the refurbishment loans. Part of that will come from a restaurant
scheduled to open on the site by midyear. Other income streams will
come from concessions sales, renting the theater for premieres and
private screenings on Sunday and Monday nights, and daytime
showings of a specially commissioned film about the history of
Hollywood, designed to attract the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, there will also be big-ticket sales for AC programs.
Perhaps that explains why the Egyptian's first series is dedicated
to the reigning king of the box-office world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were other good reasons for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we would have done a series of Jim Cameron's
movies in a small theater with a really little screen,'' Smith
notes. ``He's certainly deserving of a tribute and, I think, the
concept of seeing all of his movies together is really going to be
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were also thinking that we have this great facility and we
want to show it off. I guess that is, sort of, the new facility
influencing us. But it's not influencing us to do something that we
wouldn't have done, if we could have, before.''
</P>
<P>
   The viability of some programs, Bartok admits, remains in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next six months to a year are going to be the test case,''
he says. ``We'll see what the public responds to. There are things
that we've never really done before. We may get great crowds
whenever we do 70mm shows. We'll be testing the waters by showing
silent movies every Tuesday night, once our 1922 Wurlitzer pipe
organ is installed. We'll see how the audience responds to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever uncertainties remain, though, one thing is for sure:
The American Cinematheque will never run out of movies to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, no matter how much we screen, we realize
how much more there is to show,'' Bartok says. ``For all the films
that we've shown over the past 10 years, there are thousands being
made every year, all around the world. We'll discover whole bodies
of films that we didn't know anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they do, though, you can now safely bet that the American
Cinematheque will bring them to L.A.

HER HEART WILL GO ON
</HEADLINE>

By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the funniest song parody you may never hear.
</P>
<P>
   Switchblade Kittens' punky girl-centric version of ``My Heart
Will Go On'' _ Celine Dion's multimillion-selling love theme from
``Titanic'' _ currently is in the hands of lawyers who must work
out fair use rights before the inspired high-concept cover version
can be issued to commercial radio.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the parody came to Switchblade Kittens' leader,
bassist and singer Drama Mahaffey-Arthur, 22, who started the
quartet about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Celine Dion's version on the radio so many times it
was driving me nuts, so I decided we had to make a joke out of
it,'' Mahaffey-Arthur said. ``We did it for a laugh, to crack
ourselves up. It needed to be done because Celine was driving
everybody crazy. People kept saying, `I just can't take that song
one more time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Switchblade Kittens' fast and furious version includes a short
spoken segment featuring members of the band playing the parts of
Jack and Rose while the sound of rising water burbles in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Jack: ``Hi. I'm a jobless card-playing drifter who likes to draw
naked girls. Do you want to sleep with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Rose: ``Are you kidding? I'm a rich socialite virgin who's
engaged to be married. Of course I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey-Arthur said the spoken segment reflects the ``Titanic''
plot point that bothered her the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what the movie is saying to girls,'' she said.
``I have friends who are single mothers and they ended up getting
(pregnant) by some arty no-account guy like Jack who just didn't
care. `Titanic' says if you have a life with money and privilege,
go ahead and ruin it all by sleeping with this guy who plays cards,
who has this seedy life. This is what they're saying to the girls
who come to our shows _ `Sure, jump into bed and don't think about
the consequences.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Kittens' parody of ``My Heart Will Go On'' is available on
the Internet 
(http://members.aol.com/greatbands/switchbladekittens/titanic/titani
c.html).
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey-Arthur said the tune has sparked major label interest
in the band and the fair-use problem may just be dropped into the
lap of whatever record company signs the quartet or agrees to
release the song nationally. ``My Heart Will Go On'' was written by
James Horner and Will Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues that must be decided is whether the Kittens'
``Titanic'' parody would diminish the commercial value of Dion's
original version. The first question, though, is whether the band
recorded a parody at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure whether it's a parody or a cover version, and
that has to be established before we can proceed,'' Mahaffey-Arthur
said. ``That's the issue. But I can tell you it was originally a
joke. It was for us and our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The snafu hasn't stopped college stations in Louisiana, Florida,
Texas and Alabama from downloading the tune and airing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana State University has gone completely insane,'' the
singer said. ``Students are e-mailing us all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Linus Lee, music director at Louisiana State's KLSU-FM in Baton
Rouge, said listeners are going ``ballistic'' over the song.
</P>
<P>
   Switchblade Kittens is a high-concept guitarless group that
features three bassists and a teen-age drummer _ ``the weird name
club,'' Mahaffey-Arthur says.
</P>
<P>
   The band's ``token male'' is known as Pep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really one of those sensitive ponytail guys,'' she
explained. ``He probably would've had a horrible time in a guy
band. He sat in his room his whole life and played bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bassist is Ariel Penn ``and she actually looks like the
Little Mermaid,'' according to Mahaffey-Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Switchblade Kitten is 17-year-old drummer X Vilar _
``because she's from Argentina and her first name is hard to
pronounce,'' the band leader said, adding that Vilar's dad is the
janitor at Glendale High School, from which the drummer recently
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Kittens' songs is titled ``My Dad's a Janitor,''
written by Mahaffey-Arthur from Vilar's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Another original tune is ``Emily,'' a tribute to poet Emily
Dickenson.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of guitars is intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of problems at the beginning because of the
lead-guitarist mentality,'' said Mahaffey-Arthur, who until
recently worked at a local music store. ``The guitarist dominates
everything, writes everything, has three-minute solos in the middle
of every song. I had to figure out a way where I didn't have to
deal with these guitar personalities. I thought it would be so
great if I could turn the bass players into guitarists because
bassists have such mellow personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mahaffey-Arthur says, the Kittens don't smoke, drink or
fool around with illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to start a punk band where no member takes drugs and
nobody drinks _ and I got it,'' she explained. ``And I wanted it to
be mostly women and really nice people as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey-Arthur was raised in Coral Gables, Fla., and attended
film school at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in bands my whole life,'' the Los Angeles resident
said. ``As a kid, I acted in a regional production of `Annie' and I
eventually decided I wanted to be a director.''
</P>
<P>
   Switchblade Kittens was in the midst of recording a six-song EP
at Sound Asylum in Woodland Hills recently when ``Titanic''-fueled
interest in the band skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the one law student I knew in college, and he
referred me to one of his friends, who's handling the case,''
Mahaffey-Arthur said. &QL;

FEW LABELS, FEWER RISKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's been a lot of hand-wringing lately about
the loss of record label identity since the Polygram-Universal
merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the days when you could depend on a label imprint as a mark
of quality have been over for decades.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time long before the music industry was reduced to
five global conglomerates _ Universal, Sony, Warner, EMI and
Bertelsmann _ when you could buy almost any album on Island or
Warner Bros., for example, and know it would be interesting and
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, music fans would purchase Warners albums by
Little Feat, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, the Meters, Allen
Toussaint, Capt. Beefheart and Ry Cooder or Island releases from
the Wailers, Free and Nick Drake without thinking twice, without
having heard the music first.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you took a chance on a $14 compact disc?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one of those who believes there's little interesting or
challenging pop music being produced anymore. I just don't think
the labels are bound by law to sign 35 versions of the same hit
sound in the hopes that one of these copyists will stick to the
wall like the proverbial strand of spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is more creativity in the executive suite.
</P>
<P>
   The problem seems to be the people in talent acquisition.
According to the endless stream of throwaway music the labels spew
out over the course of a year, these decision-makers have little
imagination, no sense of the world and no broad musical interests
or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Labels in the '90s take far too few risks. I mean, what sort of
guts does it take to issue 120 variations on Dr. Dre's ``The
Chronic'' or Nirvana's ``Nevermind''? All of which stiff at the
cash register.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's a $38 billion global music market; the United
States accounts for almost $13 billion of the pie. That means
there's a lot of music selling regionally throughout the world _
and it's not all Mariah Carey and the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't U.S. music fans been given the chance to hear the
latest superstar acts from Africa or Jamaica? Why is so much
cutting-edge dance music unreleased in North America?
</P>
<P>
   Why are some of the best New Orleans acts pressing their own CDs
and selling them at small club dates?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the higher-ups in Universal's brave new world have
the ears to match their deep pockets. &QL;

   MILLER-SALESMAN (New York) _ Willy Loman started small. ``That
was the idea I started with, that Willy should be small and his
wife should be very big,'' said Arthur Miller, thinking back on the
first staging of ``Death of a Salesman,'' 50 years ago. Willy is
back in the hulking form of Brian Dennehy, whose sagging bulk seems
to fill up the entire doorway of his house, when he is first
glimpsed, sample bags in hand, in the new staging of the play. It
began previews on Broadway last week and opens Feb. 10, 50 years to
the day after it was first staged with Elia Kazan directing and Lee
J. Cobb starring. By Peter Applebome.

   APPLES-BOSTON (Boston) _ Boston is the most historic city in
America, a repository of our national past, yet it has an
extraordinary capacity to reinvent itself. The Pilgrims landed
nearby. Boston became the cradle of liberty, but later it became a
byword for bluenosed narrow-mindedness. It has traded and
manufactured. Nowadays it manages money, and capitalizes on the
science and technology developed in its laboratories. It has boomed
and busted and now it is a boom town again, uncouth as that sounds.
The one constant has been ideas: Boston ideas have washed across
the nation and the world for two centuries. There can be very few
cities in the country with as much to offer the visitor. Historical
sites abound, of course, enough to exhaust the most avid dwellers
in the past. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-MUSIC (Undated) _ World music thrives on
misunderstandings. As a marketing category, it's a grand
hodge-podge. The world-music bins of any well-stocked store are
likely to hold field recordings from remote villages as well as pop
songs concocted in 64-track digital studios, and practitioners of
traditional styles end up next to hybrids of, say, didgeridoo and
Brazilian percussion and synthesizer. American popular music is
downright provincial in its mass media, rejecting nearly everything
with lyrics that aren't in English. But while world music is
ignored by commercial radio and television, many listeners who
discover it get hooked. Importers and licensers and packagers of
world music have created a small world with a huge number of
possibilities. By Jon Pareles.

   MORGAN-MANUSCRIPTS (New York) _ When is a book more than a book?
Anytime it does its job, you might well answer. That is, when its
contents awaken the mind with some combination of guidance,
distraction, insight, knowledge and pleasure. But there are
concrete ways that books can be more than books: when they combine
aspects of painting, sculpture and architecture to become works of
visual art. Books of this sort are the subject of a sumptuous
exhibition at the Morgan Library that ranges through nine
centuries, from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and early
printed books; through an extraordinary array of fine bindings from
different countries, periods and styles, to modern, mostly English
private-press books and livres d'artistes. They all come from the
collection of Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a lifelong
bibliophile. By Roberta Smith.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Vatican issued a new handbook for exorcism,
and the rites haven't changed much since 1614. The Vatican still
believes in the devil and possession. What's new is that the
Vatican now believes in psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Next we'll find out they believe in Woody Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook warns that exorcists must ``not think possessed by
a demon someone who is suffering from some illness, above all
psychic'' or ``the victim of one's own imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good that the Vatican has recognized the importance of
treatment for mental illness. After all, our HMOs are trying very
hard to dodge the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It's also good that the Church still recognizes that the devil
is among us, or in us. Psychiatry has explored the vastness of the
Id and the depths of depression, but it's never been very good at
explaining evil.
</P>
<P>
   Every psychoanalytic study of Hitler or Manson falls into
cliches about anger at parents or feelings of sexual inadequacy.
The shrinks can't even explain the little evils of life, like what
possesses people to use sports utility vehicles as 3,000-pound
phone booths moving at 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known
as ``the bible'' of the American Psychiatric Association, contains
descriptions of disorders from schizophrenia all the way down to
compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no listing for Possession by the Devil Syndrome, or
PDS, as it would be known in syndrome-happy America.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists have debated whether to include caffeine
withdrawal in their manual, but they've left evil, the toughest
problem of all, to religion.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I know. If he doesn't literally exist, he's made in
our image, as a Dostoyevsky character once put it. And the devil is
in the details, as a character named Ross Perot put it.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, does the devil like details.
</P>
<P>
   You want to exorcise someone? Try Kenneth Starr. The man is
obsessed with details only the devil and Paula Jones could love. To
prove the president had a few pathetic sexual encounters, he
produced a 445-page X-rated report with 2,600 pages of
detail-filled appendices.
</P>
<P>
   Starr isn't crazy. Something has gotten into that boy. Could it
be Satan? No, Starr isn't evil on a grand scale, unless you're
looking at him from the president's perspective. But he's foremost
among those I'd try to exorcise, just to see what fly-sized angels
of darkness flutter out.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for his benighted army of the night, Reps. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., Bob Barr, R-Ga., and the rest of the gang of 13. They may
not be tools of the devil, but if they are, they're very small
tools, like the little thingamabobs on a Swiss Army knife you have
no use for.
</P>
<P>
   If I were chief exorcist, high on my list would be the creative
geniuses at MSNBC who aired split screens of the pope arriving in
St. Louis with President Clinton's lawyers talking about Monica and
the fact that it's all about sex. At least it wasn't about
contraception, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, he's been possessed quite often in his life. The
exorcism of his recurring serpent spirits, however, has been
performed by thousands of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   What comes out if you exorcise David Hasselhof, Rupert Murdoch,
Jerry Springer, Linda Tripp, Courtney Love, Calista Flockhart,
Geraldo Rivera, any supermodel or all of those young people on
``Party of Five''? If it's Satan, at least we know they weren't
entirely empty.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Rolling Stones is they just can't convince
anyone they're possessed by the devil anymore. Now they're simply
the Grateful Dead Brits.
</P>
<P>
   You can't tell me the devil wasn't at work down at Intel when
they invented a chip that automatically identifies individual
computers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet itself is possessed by evil spirits. Intel was
about to give the flamers and hackers a powerful technology to
sneak into our private lives.
</P>
<P>
   The devil wouldn't have to waste a lot of time taking human form
and walking the Earth. He could virtually possess people.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the puniest of evils. What's got into Dan Quayle and
conservative activist Gary Bauer that makes them think they can be
president? Could it be Satan?
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's power lies in Mammon and his rich Family Research
Council. He even offered to pay the $90 registration fee of anyone
who would attend a conservative conference last week and vote for
him in a straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is running on name recognition, and yes, his name does
have an E on the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at my exorcism manual, I believe those guys aren't
possessed by even tiny devils perching on their shoulders. I think
each qualifies as a ``victim of one's own imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Call in the shrinks, and look up ``delusions of being somebody''
in the psychiatric manual.

   SCI-NEW-ELEMENT (Undated) _ In a brief news story, the journal
Science reports a claim by Russia's main nuclear physics lab at
Dubna to have created Element 114 _ a long-sought target of
scientists hoping to reach the ``island of stability.'' Beyond the
element plutonium, the dozen or so additional elements created in
laboratories are all so unstable they survive for only tiny
fractions of a second. But theorists have predicted that if someone
could make Element 114 and higher numbers, the mix of protons and
neutrons in their nuclei might be stable enough for these elements
to survive for a while. The Russians claim to have reached this
goal, and that Element 114 seems to survive for about 30 seconds.
``Superheavy'' elements as stable as 114 may have very interesting
properties, and in any case, if the Russian claim holds up, a Nobel
Prize could be in the offing. By Malcolm Browne.

   GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ The American Geophysical Union, the
nation's foremost organization of earth scientists, issues its
first-ever statement on climate change. It says there is a
``compelling basis for legitimate public concern'' about climate
change resulting from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere. The present level of scientific uncertainty, the
paper says, does not justify inaction in the mitigation of
human-induced climate change and/or the adaptation to it. By

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ When the Gaia Bookstore hit hard times, the
spiritually oriented, independent Berkeley shop turned to an
unlikely source of inspiration: the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, the only nonprofit, publicly held professional
sports team in the nation, turned to its fans when it needed cash
to finance stadium improvements in 1997, selling so-called shares
at $200 apiece and making the Wisconsin town its owners.
</P>
<P>
   With its business suffering under pressure from corporate-owned
and on-line booksellers, Gaia's owners have asked its employees and
customers to do the same: rescue the store from imminent closure by
investing $25 to $250, essentially becoming part owners of the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Gaia wants to use the cash to bridge its transformation from a
for-profit bookstore to a nonprofit cultural institution, a move
the founder said would keep the store alive.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstore may be the first in the country to try this
financial model. Gaia's co-owner and founder, Patrice Wynne, calls
it ``shared capitalism'' or ``venture capital of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole other investment model _ it's a community line
of credit,'' Wynne explained. ``If we want enterprises that are
quirky, original, entrepreneurial and reflective of the values of
the community, we have to make choices to give them economic
viability.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaia's story resembles the plot of the movie ``You've Got
Mail,'' which highlights the plight of the independent bookseller.
In the film, the opening of a book superstore forces actress Meg
Ryan's character to close her children's bookshop.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Gaia, named after the Greek goddess of Earth,
was a thriving bookstore whose owners never dreamed of turning to
readers with their hand out.
</P>
<P>
   Annual sales grew steadily until 1997, when they hit a peak of
$1.4 million. Then, in 1998, sales began dropping 10 percent to 20
percent per month. In November, they plunged 39 percent from the
year-earlier period. Overall holiday sales dropped 25 percent at
the 12-year-old store.
</P>
<P>
   Wynne said the decrease is the result of increasing pressure
from on-line and chain booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Gaia is not alone in hurting. In the past five or six years,
independent booksellers have gone from selling a third of all books
in the country to about 18 percent, according to the Northern
California Independent Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   During that same time, more than 25 million square feet of
retail space dedicated to selling books was added nationwide, the
association said. And that space excludes on-line sellers and
general merchandise stores like Target and Safeway, which are
devoting an increasing amount of space to books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have economic conditions in this country where we have an
explosion of retail book space without the indicators that we're
cultivating new readers and that millions more books are selling in
this country,'' Wynne said.
</P>
<P>
   She surveyed her customers when sales began to drop, and they
told her they have less time than ever to read.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the handwriting on the wall, Wynne and her co-owner hit
on another novel idea: transform the bookstore, which holds about
250 readings a year, into a nonprofit cultural institution. The
store already had plans to move in the summer of 2000 into a larger
location in downtown Berkeley. But last month Wynne determined it
would be impossible to stay open for the next year and a half. She
told her customers Gaia would close in February.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a longtime customer offered to donate $200,000 on
the condition that Gaia employees, customers and other supporters
match that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Wynne said that would be enough to cover $300,000 in debt to
publishers, distributors and banks as well as operating expenses
until the move. The nonprofit status offers tax reductions as well
as increased fund-raising opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Green Bay Packers model, investors get a certificate and
voting rights at the annual meeting. Wynne said Gaia's
``shareholders'' would have the satisfaction of supporting a
neighborhood institution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amy Thomas, president of the Northern California Independent
Booksellers Association, said other independents would be closely
watching Wynne's efforts. While Gaia has a devoted following,
Thomas said, Wynne's plan is still risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of running a retail operation under nonprofit
guidelines is tricky,'' she said, explaining that the nonprofit
structure of making decisions by committee tended to go against the
entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas said Wynne's focus on creating a cultural center
around a bookstore was different. ``She's very interested in ways
of making Gaia more than just a bookstore,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thomas could not predict whether Wynne would be
successful. Thomas, owner of bookstores in Berkeley and Oakland,
said customers had admitted buying books she had suggested on-line,
and seemingly loyal customers are still lured by the volume and
discounts at the mega-chains.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley author Melody Ermachild Chavis has been both a customer
of Gaia and an author at Gaia readings. Chavis said her first book,
``Altars in the Streets,'' published in 1997, would not have
survived without the promotion and support it had received from
Gaia and other independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berkeley should be able to save its bookstores the way other
towns save lighthouses and train stations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynne said she had been encouraged by the initial response. One
author wrote a check for $1,000. Smaller donations have been
trickling in for a total of about $3,000. If the store fails to
raise $200,000 by March, Gaia will be closed, with plans to reopen
as a community center.

 &HT;    Live witnesses `unlikely,' top Republicans say
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First the House prosecutors were told to limit the
number of witnesses to three. Now they face the prospect that they
will not be allowed to call witnesses at all in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Much to their dismay, Republican prosecutors say they have been
told by top Republican senators that it is ``unlikely'' that they
will be allowed to call live witnesses at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have been told that videotaped depositions from
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal will do just
fine. Senators seem more interested in pursuing a quick exit
strategy from the trial than pursuing the truth, several
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they were not at the Alamo or Valley Forge,'' said
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
and lead prosecutor of the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's frustrating is all these steps constantly intended to
limit us,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the prosecution
team. For example, Barr said, the prosecution was not allowed to
rebut the arguments made by the White House legal counsel in
defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   And it does not help that the road blocks to calling witnesses
are controlled by the Republican-dominated Senate, Barr said.
``This whole thing is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that the witnesses won't be allowed to
testify in person,'' said Barr, who added that he is so frustrated
by the Senate that he has decided to fly home to Georgia for a
slice of the ``real world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether live witnesses will be called,
said John Czwartacki, press spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott. He said he knew of no conversations where members of
the Republican Senate leadership spoke with House proseuctors or
investigators about the prospects of calling live witnesses. ``You
cannot make a prediction until those depositions are taken,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Another House prosecutor stopped short of saying that the trial
is all but over, suggesting that the focus should now turn to to
the question of how to improve the impeachment process for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like a man on the verge of retiring than
prosecuting, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he wants to fix the
law allowing independent counsels to conduct the impeachment
investigation as well as the rules governing the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he would like to see a bipartisan task force tackle
the process so that ``the law will be left better than the way we
received it.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said that he wanted to make sure that future
impeachment prosecutors are given the authority to do much of what
independent counsel Kenneth Starr did in his investigation, such as
the right to interview and obtain testimony from witnesses under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to change the law,'' Graham said. ``The
House impeachment process should not be limited, nor should it
hamstring the prosecutors' team to make its case.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he is ``frustrated'' by the push in the Senate to
end the trial. He said the House prosecutors have not been given
the chance to put on their entire case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a big record here and a political mood here for
closure,'' said Graham, about the chances of calling witnesses. ``I
don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to know you have to
cross great hurdles to have live witnesses,'' Graham said. But as
Rep. Christopher Cannon (R-Utah) put it, ``it does not take a genie
with a crystal ball to see the votes aren't there (to convict
Clinton).''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Cannon said, the public would judge the Senate's
decision on whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will be unsatisfied,'' Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the Democratic senators, save one, and some
Republican senators say they do not think witnesses are needed. The
record is extensive and the Republican prosecutors are unlikely to
garner the 67 votes they need to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case has not been made for witnesses,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.), who is upset that the Republican prosecutors
were even given permission to depose witnesses. ``The House
managers are calling the shots for the Senate Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his private ``hideaway'' office overlooking the
Lincoln Monument, Kennedy said the House prosecutors had disrupted
government long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House managers are in danger of demeaning the Senate,''
Kennendy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's staunchest foes say they do not
think live witnesses will be presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a betting man, I say it tilts against live witnesses,''
said Sen. Robert Bennett (R-Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), one of the
prosecutors responsible for deposing the witnesses. Hutchinson said
that it was important to remember that just last week, it appeared
doubtful that the House prosecution would be allowed to depose
witnesses at all. Now they have that permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an openness for our case to call witnesses,''
Hutchinson said. ``I can see the hurdles, but I'm hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchinson is one of the few that has such hopes on the
prosecution team. With others abandoning hope of live witnesses,
the question is prompted: Is this over?
</P>
<P>
   ``As Yogi Berra said: it's not over until it's over,'' Barr
said.

   MILLER-SALESMAN (New York) _ Willy Loman started small. ``That
was the idea I started with, that Willy should be small and his
wife should be very big,'' said Arthur Miller, thinking back on the
first staging of ``Death of a Salesman,'' 50 years ago. Willy is
back in the hulking form of Brian Dennehy, whose sagging bulk seems
to fill up the entire doorway of his house, when he is first
glimpsed, sample bags in hand, in the new staging of the play. It
began previews on Broadway last week and opens Feb. 10, 50 years to
the day after it was first staged with Elia Kazan directing and Lee
J. Cobb starring. By Peter Applebome.

   APPLES-BOSTON (Boston) _ Boston is the most historic city in
America, a repository of our national past, yet it has an
extraordinary capacity to reinvent itself. The Pilgrims landed
nearby. Boston became the cradle of liberty, but later it became a
byword for bluenosed narrow-mindedness. It has traded and
manufactured. Nowadays it manages money, and capitalizes on the
science and technology developed in its laboratories. It has boomed
and busted and now it is a boom town again, uncouth as that sounds.
The one constant has been ideas: Boston ideas have washed across
the nation and the world for two centuries. There can be very few
cities in the country with as much to offer the visitor. Historical
sites abound, of course, enough to exhaust the most avid dwellers
in the past. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-MUSIC (Undated) _ World music thrives on
misunderstandings. As a marketing category, it's a grand
hodge-podge. The world-music bins of any well-stocked store are
likely to hold field recordings from remote villages as well as pop
songs concocted in 64-track digital studios, and practitioners of
traditional styles end up next to hybrids of, say, didgeridoo and
Brazilian percussion and synthesizer. American popular music is
downright provincial in its mass media, rejecting nearly everything
with lyrics that aren't in English. But while world music is
ignored by commercial radio and television, many listeners who
discover it get hooked. Importers and licensers and packagers of
world music have created a small world with a huge number of
possibilities. By Jon Pareles.

   MORGAN-MANUSCRIPTS (New York) _ When is a book more than a book?
Anytime it does its job, you might well answer. That is, when its
contents awaken the mind with some combination of guidance,
distraction, insight, knowledge and pleasure. But there are
concrete ways that books can be more than books: when they combine
aspects of painting, sculpture and architecture to become works of
visual art. Books of this sort are the subject of a sumptuous
exhibition at the Morgan Library that ranges through nine
centuries, from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and early
printed books; through an extraordinary array of fine bindings from
different countries, periods and styles, to modern, mostly English
private-press books and livres d'artistes. They all come from the
collection of Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a lifelong
bibliophile. By Roberta Smith.

   SCI-NEW-ELEMENT (Undated) _ In a brief news story, the journal
Science reports a claim by Russia's main nuclear physics lab at
Dubna to have created Element 114 _ a long-sought target of
scientists hoping to reach the ``island of stability.'' Beyond the
element plutonium, the dozen or so additional elements created in
laboratories are all so unstable they survive for only tiny
fractions of a second. But theorists have predicted that if someone
could make Element 114 and higher numbers, the mix of protons and
neutrons in their nuclei might be stable enough for these elements
to survive for a while. The Russians claim to have reached this
goal, and that Element 114 seems to survive for about 30 seconds.
``Superheavy'' elements as stable as 114 may have very interesting
properties, and in any case, if the Russian claim holds up, a Nobel
Prize could be in the offing. By Malcolm Browne.

   GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) _ The American Geophysical Union, the

in the atmosphere. The present level of scientific uncertainty, the
paper says, does not justify inaction in the mitigation of
human-induced climate change and/or the adaptation to it. By

 &HT;    NEW HOUSE ETHICS CHAIRMAN ALREADY HAS FULL AGENDA
 &HT;    900&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the new chairman of the House ethics committee,
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, will barely have time to say howdy to
his posse before saddling up for two tough cases involving powerful
members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   The committee must complete an ongoing investigation of Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., the chairman of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, who is accused of improper dealings with
a developer in his district. And it will have to decide whether to
investigate accusations in the online magazine Salon that Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, misused his office payroll and campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Smith said House rules prohibit him
from discussing any case being considered by the ethics panel,
officially titled the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
However, he expressed the hope he would be able to stress the
``advice and education'' aspect of committee responsibility rather
its investigatory duties.
</P>
<P>
   Providing more guidance on ethics ``could result in fewer
investigations,'' he said. ``An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of anxiety and bad publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-generation Texas rancher from near San Antonio, Smith is
replacing Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, in what is perhaps the most
thankless job in Congress. ``It's an honor and a privilege to be
asked to serve'' as chairman, Smith said. ``But it is not always a
pleasure'' to carry out the tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, demands for House ethics investigations have
sometimes been seen as tactics in partisan struggles. Some Capitol
Hill observers viewed the 1997 ethics case against then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., as retaliation for the ethics case
that Gingrich led a decade earlier against then-House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after joining the committee as a member, Smith cast the
only vote against the reprimand and $300,000 fine that were levied
against Gingrich. At the time, Smith said the penalty was excessive
in relation to the violations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, Smith said, the ethics committee
has avoided the partisan rancor that has divided the House on
issues such as the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the ethics committee not to be bipartisan, but to
be nonpartisan. We have checked party labels at the door,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some continuity,'' with eight of the 10 members having
served for a number of years, he said. The new members are
Republicans Rob Portman of Ohio and Dave Camp of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Few members lobby for this committee assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job that you can't brag about, but it is necessary,''
Smith said. ``We take our responsibility seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Those responsibilities will require quick consideration of
several complaints filed by the Congressional Accountability
Project, a private, non-partisan watchdog organization affiliated
with Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer activist.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, the Congressional Accountability Project
called for an investigation into the relationship between Shuster,
who has considerable influence over spending billions of federal
dollars on transportation projects such as highways and airports,
and Maurice Lawruk, a Shuster friend and a real estate developer in
Altoona, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, who was unopposed in winning his 14th term in November,
has denied any wrongdoing. ``I look forward to being fully
exonerated, as I have complied with all House and Federal Election
Commission rules,'' he told Congressional Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Accountability Project questioned Shuster's
links to Lawruk, who has financially supported the congressman's
grown sons in business ventures and whose own businesses have
profited from federal contracts. The group has also questioned
Shuster's ties to Ann Eppard, a transportation lobbyist who was
formerly Shuster's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability
Project, charged that the long delay in finishing the Shuster
investigation shows that ``the ethics committee is well designed as
a shield to protect members from investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Smith as chairman, Ruskin said that the Texan's
record on ethics is so limited that it is premature to predict how
he will do on the job. As a subcommittee chairman, Smith led a
``very thorough'' ethics investigation of former Rep. Jay Kim,
R-Calif., he said, but then the full committee ``didn't recommend
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin said he didn't know how much Smith was involved in that
final decision. However, in addition to the Shuster probe, he said
his group has several requests for investigations pending before
the ethics committee:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Burton kept ``ghost employees'' _ two women who who
did little or no work on the payroll of his congressional office
and campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., received illegal
gratuities, bribes or gifts _ including a $50,000 Lexus car _ from
a West African millionaire and a $10,000 payment from Rev. Henry
Lyons, a Florida minister.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Rep. Jerry Costello, D-Ill., accepted an illegal
gratuity and tried to obstruct a federal gambling investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
violated the House gift rule by accepting the personal services of
a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   First elected to Congress in 1986, the 51-year-old Smith is a
graduate of Yale and the Southern Methodist University law school.
With the turmoil in the House leadership since Gingrich stepped
down following the November elections, Smith jokingly said he
thought he might get a ``reprieve'' in serving as ethics committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was called about the job around Thanksgiving by
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., then the speaker-designate. But
Livingston abruptly resigned after revelations that he had had
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what was going to happen then,'' said Smith. But
then the new speaker-designate, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called
Smith in Texas over the Christmas recess and asked him to serve.
</P>
<P>
   He again said yes.

 &HT;    DREAMSVILLE: History kept under concrete
 &HT;    (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    By Willard N. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was born in the farm community of Dunwoody, Ga., in the year
1928.
</P>
<P>
   My dad was a poor, hard-working farm laborer whose pay was not
more than $1 a day.
</P>
<P>
   We moved from one shabby shack to another during all my growing
years, and each time we had to battle a hungry horde of bedbugs
left by the former residents.
</P>
<P>
   We never knew the luxury of electricity, running water or any of
the comforts folks now take for granted. (Of course, the outhouses
were fully ``air-conditioned.'')
</P>
<P>
   We had meat almost every Sunday, and only on Sunday. We kids
always thought that eating end-cut ham was really living high on
the hog.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 6 years old we moved to nearby Sandy Springs, which
was big enough to have two grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The town center included nine or 10 stores and service shops on
three corners of the road crossing, and a baseball field on the
other corner. This was one of my favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Our town had some mighty good players. We also had a huge umpire
with a booming voice that could be heard for a mile when he called
a third strike.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite memories is fishing in the Chattahoochee
River, either by myself or with my dad.
</P>
<P>
   A Prince Albert tobacco can of worms, a few rolled fishing lines
and a walk of several miles always made for the start of a perfect
day.
</P>
<P>
   Usually we could fish for a whole day and never see another
person. Nowadays the river is used by thousands.
</P>
<P>
   During my teen years, my best friend lived a couple miles away.
His family owned a radio, and we spent many happy hours listening
to ``The Lone Ranger'' and the other great radio shows of that day,
especially the mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that long, scary walk home late at night. I
always had a fear of rabid dogs, of which we had a good supply, but
those lonely walks are among my favorite memories.
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memories are of the many small farms planted
mostly with cotton. In between grew miles and miles of woods,
mostly pine forests.
</P>
<P>
   It was this land that I loved and thought would last forever,
and I never dreamed of any other life.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1949 I joined the Air Force, and my little world was no
longer to be.
</P>
<P>
   It was my fortune to be transferred quite often, and my world
soon extended to half of the American continent and to the lands of
Japan, Okinawa and a war in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my little town began to grow, and today it is a city
surrounded by cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 we arranged a reunion of our 1941 graduating class of

   IVANGOROD, Russia _ The grass wasn't always greener on the other
side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is, and with Russia's economy in peril many residents
of this depressed border town dream of seceding to become part of
the neighboring Baltic republic of Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Ivangorod look across the border -- the Narva
River -- with envy at Narva in Estonia, a sister city that was an
equal when the Soviet empire encompassed them both.
</P>
<P>
   Under communism, they shared water, sewer and public transit
systems. Moreover, they endured the common monotony and meagerness
of life under the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   Now eight years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the
economy of independent Estonia is blossoming and Narva with it,
while Russia and Ivangorod are in the throes of yet another
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Those fortunate enough to reside in Narva in 1991 received
Estonian passports and over the years became the haves. The
residents of Ivangorod on the Russian side are the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an instant I'd give up my Russian citizenship with
pleasure,'' said Valery Fyodorov, 48, who earns 950 rubles a month
as a construction worker -- the equivalent of about US$42 since the
ruble collapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister lives in Narva and I know life is better there. The
city is more prosperous. It is cleaner. There are jobs. It is
apparent that the people live like Westerners,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivangorod last year, local activist Yuri Gordeyev circulated
a petition calling on the town and its 12,000 inhabitants to secede
from Russia and join tiny but successful Estonia. Russian officials
ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   It was, he concedes, a futile effort pursued more as a moral
protest than a realistic mission. He gathered 502 signatures and
suspects more would join him now since Ivangorod is suffering
winter's sub-zero temperatures with no hot water and periodically
no cold water either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the mayor that if conditions here don't improve 99
percent of the population of Ivangorod would be willing to give up
citizenship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Ivangorod is 35 percent, and those who do work
seldom are paid on time. Nearly half the town's population are
pensioners, each of whom collect the equivalent of only about US$20
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river in Narva (population 74,000), the unemployment
rate is 7 percent, salaries are rising and pensions are 10 times
higher than in Russia. Refurbished office buildings, cafes, shops
-- even a recently opened McDonald's -- attest to the relative
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Ivangorod's story is not unusual as Russia has struggled
to convert to a market economy. The collapse of the Soviet system
and the end of state subsidies hit thousands of small towns and
villages particularly hard. Factories folded, eliminating jobs.
Aging water and heating systems faltered, leaving residents to cope
with insufficient help from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-Estonian border was drawn in 1991 based on the lines
on the map of the Soviet administrative districts. Ivangorod was
part of a district ruled from Leningrad, renamed St. Petersburg.
Narva was part of the Estonian district, ruled from the capital of
Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet era, the water and sewer works for the two towns
were built in Narva. After the Soviet Union dissolved, an
arrangement was made for the Estonian town to sell the services to
Ivangorod.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was supposed to be temporary. But after eight
years, the Russians showed no signs of constructing their own
utilities and Ivangorod racked up a $1.5 million debt to Narva in
unpaid water bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Estonians late last year issued an ultimatum and on Jan. 2
turned off the pipes, leaving Ivangorod without drinking water and
flushing its raw sewage directly into the icy Narva River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a market economy. No store will give you things
unless you pay for them,'' said the acting mayor of Narva, Ants
Liimets(CQ). ``We're ready to give them water. We're ready to clean
their sewage. But they must pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Russian officials are rushing to build a water plant. They
have some pumps running, though water service stops at night and is
intermittent during the day. There is no hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Ivangorod's humiliation is the constant reminder that
their economy is second class.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic meltdown last August, when the ruble
began a slide that reduced it in value by two-thirds, more
residents of Narva do their shopping in Ivangorod. They take
advantage of the power of their national currency, the Estonian
kroon, and buy Russian produce and goods.
</P>
<P>
   About 96 percent of Narva's residents are ethnic Russians and
many families have branches that stretch across both towns. A
Russian-Estonian agreement allows residents of Ivangorod and Narva
to pass with ease through border checkpoints and over the bridge
that crosses the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices are so much cheaper here. So we come over to
'steal' from our neighbors in Russia,'' said Claudia Skorikova, a
pensioner from Narva, who trekked across the river to do her
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a whole series of problems -- the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the collapse of the economy, the lack of public
services. The pressure has been great,'' says Antonina Kostitsina,
Ivangorod's deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Kostitsina dismisses any talk of secession as the aim of a
disgruntled few, however.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes that Russia and Estonia will enter into a border pact
that would allow Ivangorod and Narva to cooperate in areas of
social services, public transit and education. The towns have
matching, centuries-old Teutonic forts that could draw mutually
beneficial tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the Russian government nor Estonia's is eager to
consider the border question. For Russia, it is a matter of pride
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   For Estonia, which has an arguable claim to Ivangorod based on
the border between the two countries drawn at the end of World War
I, it is a matter of pragmatic diplomacy. Estonia is seeking
membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization; adding a border dispute would only complicate
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ivangorod looks with envy at its neighbors across the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy mayor, Kostitsina, laments: ``We're a small city held
hostage by political events.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PING YU, China _ Life looks simple and tradition-bound in this
misty mountain hamlet, but even here couples have access to a piece
of modern technology that is mutating the face of China.
</P>
<P>
   The ultrasound scanner that reveals the sex of a fetus has led
to the purging from China's population of between 500,000 and
750,000 unborn girls every year, recent statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery that identifies birth defects also allows
sex-selective abortions, which have become commonplace in the
countryside where sons are in highest demand.
</P>
<P>
   China has outlawed sex screening for a decade, yet it remains as
accepted here as the rickety mini-truck delivering big green
cabbages, as unremarkable as the older women who monopolize the
central village yard every Sunday with folk dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a girl is the first baby, they won't have an abortion. If
it's the second, they will,'' explained Jin Heyin, 49, one of the
women waiting on a recent Sunday for the drum and cymbal players to
begin rolling out the rhythm for their weekly dance routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many people who do this,'' she said. ``Medically, it's
very safe now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ping Yu, as in most of rural China, birth control regulators
have tried to assuage the peasants' ire over the 1979 ``one child''
regulations by adopting an unstated ``one son'' policy instead.
</P>
<P>
   A couple giving birth to a son is allowed one child. But a rural
family that has a girl first is permitted a second baby.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often will keep the first girl, then repeatedly abort
subsequent pregnancies until an ultrasound shows the requisite male
heir.
</P>
<P>
   Other Ping Yu dancers, dressed in pink satin trousers and tunics
tied with a green sash, agreed with Jin that the process is simple.
They don't even need to travel the 100 miles northeast to Beijing,
but can simply go down the winding road to the town of Shi Du, less
than a half hour bus ride away.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there are reputed to be willing and able to scan a
woman's stomach and tell her what is in her womb. Similar
ultrasound machines are used in more than 200,000 local clinics and
private doctors' offices across China.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage of science and tradition -- the Chinese
traditional hunger for sons -- has bloated to 1.04 million a year
the estimated number of ``missing girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Selective abortion isn't the only explanation, though it is the
biggest factor. For centuries unwanted girls have fallen victim to
infanticide, abandonment and neglect. Others are ``missing''
because their parents never reported their births.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mortality rates show girls aged 0-4 dying at the high
rate of 37 per 1,000, compared to 28 per 1,000 for boys. In few
other countries do young girls die at a greater rate than boys.
</P>
<P>
   One Chinese investigation into irregular girl mortality rates
found rural boys getting more milk, better food, better and faster
medical care, according to last summer's report in the Chinese
academic journal ``Population and Economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-boy tradition at least has been a boon to foreign
couples seeking to adopt babies. Chinese orphanages are filled with
abandoned, healthy little girls, and Americans took home nearly
4,000 of them in the year ending last September.
</P>
<P>
   But now modern medicine has made it vastly easier to dispense
with girls in advance. China's 20-year experiment in social
engineering, rigidly limiting families to one or sometimes two
children, has made it compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of boy versus girl babies nationwide has steadily
risen since the ``one child, one family'' policy took effect in
1979. The natural ratio of 106:100 climbed to 108:100 by the 1982
census. Once ultra-sound machines were introduced in the mid-1980s,
the pace quickened. Surveys in 1992 and 1995 found that the sex
ratio had reached 118:100.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the newspaper Shanghai Express said a recent
government survey put the ratio at 120:100, but there has been no
official confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from population sampling and sex ratios in the
mid-1990s, for every 1,000 babies that were born in China, another
51 female babies should have been born but are not accounted for.
These comprise the ``missing'' girls -- more than one million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have contended that parents do not register all
daughters' births, keeping them hidden in order to dodge the
restrictive reproduction policy and have another child.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 study by the State Statistical Bureau concluded that
underreporting was only a lesser cause of the skewed sex ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic reason is the selective abortion before birth,'' the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   China -- with nearly five times America's population -- has
about the same per capita abortion rate. In 1992, China reported
5,564,000 abortions for ``birth control purposes,'' compared to
America's 1.3 million abortions in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   How many sex-selection abortions were there in China? Using a
methodology developed in the U.S. Census Bureau, it appears from
Chinese birth data that there were at least 500,000 and possibly as
many as 750,000 sex-selective abortions last year.
</P>
<P>
   Consequences of sex-selective abortions include health
complications women may suffer from late-term and repeated
abortions. The low-tech, two-dimensional ultrasound machines
typically available to private physicians or grassroots clinics
cannot determine the sex of a fetus until the fourth or fifth month
of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead lies the problem of matrimony. Who will these excess boys
marry when they come of age? Already cases of kidnapping and
selling women for brides have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decade of regulations against use of the ultrasound
for sex screening, doctors and women alike keep taking what
apparently is a minimal legal risk to produce Chinese sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious problem,'' acknowledged Chen Shengli,
chief spokesman for the State Family Planning Commission. ``A
majority of the people still think a boy child is superior to a
girl child.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen believes other provincial governments soon will follow the
lead of Shandong Province, which in January began enforcing a
strict new law that prohibits private doctors from even possessing
ultrasound scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow them to have ultrasound machines, and also they
cannot do operations to stop pregnancy,'' said Sun Ailing, deputy
director of the family planning commission in coastal Shandong
Province, where the sex ratio in some places stands at 125:100.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the province's public medical clinics, ultrasound must
be administered by two doctors, both of whom must swear in writing
that the test was given for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way we can protect women's health,'' said Sun, citing
cases of women forced into abortion by a husband or in-laws until
they produce a son. ``Some abortions are very painful and cause
permanent sterility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun expressed concern over women who act without medical advice
by walking into a pharmacy and buying the Chinese equivalent of
RU-486, known as the ``morning after'' pill. In larger doses it
will cause a miscarriage even if a woman is well into pregnancy.
Danger exists if some fetal material is not expelled and flares
into a uterine infection.
</P>
<P>
   Why do women take these risks?
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, where the ``one child'' policy is more strictly
enforced, many fewer do. Among more educated Chinese, daughters
have gained almost equal status with sons and the urban sex ratio
is about normal.
</P>
<P>
   It is still the countryside, where more than two-thirds of
China's 1.2 billion people live, that boys are so prized.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Heyin, the folk dancer in Ping Yu, had the luck to birth a
son in the days before ultrasound scanning was available. She
understands the anguish of those who ``want very badly to have a
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of feudal traditional thoughts, they think if they
have a boy he can keep the family line going,'' she said. A son
also is a guarantee of care in old age, especially important in a
country lacking solid pensions or reliable social services for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The other operative aspect of Chinese tradition means that care
or money spent rearing a girl, at least in the countryside, is
virtually wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After she is married,'' Jin said, ``a girl will leave the
family.''

   MILESTONES OF POPULATION CONTROL IN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   Early 1950s - Chairman Mao Tse-tung, fearing nuclear war,
encourages rapid population growth. China's population explodes
from 540 million in 1950 to 850 million in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   1958-1960 - Famine kills millions, shocking the ruling
communists to worry whether their crowded land could feed an
ever-expanding population.
</P>
<P>
   1973 - China adopts limited population control, calling on
citizens to have ``late-spaced-few'' children.
</P>
<P>
   1970 - China's fertility rate drops rapidly. Chinese women bore
an average of 5.8 children each in 1970, but by the end of the
decade this was down to 2.2 children each.
</P>
<P>
   1979 - China intensifies population policy, introducing
mandatory ``One Child, One Family'' policy that led in the early
1980s to compulsory sterilizations and abortions after unplanned
second pregnancies. The fertility rate drops further.
</P>
<P>
   1984 - China loosens ``One Child'' policy, allowing some rural
families to have a second child, especially if the first was a
daughter. Forced abortions and sterilizations are officially
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   1989 - Realizing that ultrasound machines are being used for
sex-selection abortions, the Chinese Health Ministry issues an
urgent notice ``strictly forbidding'' use of medical technology to
determine sex of fetuses. However, this and follow-up rules
throughout the 1990s are evaded or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   1990 - China exceeds 1.1 billion population.
</P>
<P>
   1995 - Fertility rate continues dropping. Now, Chinese women
have only 1.8 children each -- comparable to the rate in Western
Europe, and lower than the rate in the United States. ``One Child''
policy is still in effect in the cities, two-child families in farm
areas is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   2000 - China's population is expected to reach 1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: These bits of history could be super-imposed on Chart 2.

BUSH, QUAYLE AND THE QUESTION OF COMPASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give that man from Indiana credit. He knows political balderdash
when he hears it, although he might not be able to spell it.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle's denunciation of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' theme as a ``silly
and insulting term'' fused together by ``liberal Republicans''
suggests that his bovine-excrement detector is in pretty good
working order.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's easy to understand why Quayle would be offended by
this term. In using the adjective ``compassionate'' to modify
``conservatism,'' Bush appears to be suggesting that conservatives
have been hard-hearted and that some of them still are.
</P>
<P>
   True conservatism, a Dan Quayle might argue, is compassionate by
its very nature. It is a philosophy that stresses individual
opportunity, responsibility and accountability. And there is true
compassion in removing the fetters of excessive governmental
control and reducing taxes to allow individuals to make the best
use of their own resources.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, a real Quayleyan conservative is
committed to certain core moral and religious values that they
perceive to be the bedrock on which society rests. Those values
cannot be compromised just for political expediency, in Quayle's
view.
</P>
<P>
   So it is reasonable, from the Quayleyan perspective, to assume
that either Bush is not a true conservative or that he is flying
false colors with his accentuation of the compassionate in a effort
to win over independents, liberals and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle chooses not to dissemble, but rather to be what he is and
not to describe himself in a way that suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not alone in that. It is noteworthy that some of
Bush's other rivals for the 2000 Republican nomination view Bush's
characterization of his new political philosophy with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who served as former
President George Bush's education secretary, has taken pointed
exception to the compassion thing, accusing Bush the younger of
using ``weasel words'' that in his view are ``cleverly and
deliberately put together to confuse people by meaning ...
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander hearkened back to the days when Bush the elder
admonished his fellow party members to be ``kinder'' and
``gentler,'' and he raised the poignant question: ``Is Mr. Bush
(the younger) trying to tell us that he's not like the rest of us
conservatives?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there came magazine publisher Steve Forbes, whose eyes are
again on the prize of the White House, also castigating Bush's
catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and poll-tested cliches are no
substitute for a muscular, substantive agenda,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-tax advocate asserted that conservatives were
``betrayed'' after Ronald Reagan's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan's brand of pro-growth, pro-freedom conservatism wasn't
enough, we were told. What was needed was a `kinder and gentler'
approach. Promises were made, but had to be broken, we were told,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Bush the elder's having reneged on his
``read-my-lips'' pledge to allow no new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the 2000 campaign is nearing, and we're hearing the
familiar chorus. Even a few of the names sound familiar,'' Forbes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm. Does anyone hear the opening chords of a cacophonous
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bush says he has not made up his mind yet about
running. And you have to take him at his word on that, even if,
like Quayle, one perceives a tad of duplicity in his compassionate
conservatism advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 2000 election is likely to be the Texas
governor's only shot at the White House. He must either do it now
or limit himself to heading only a compassionately conservative
state government, which he appears to be trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy, for example, that Bush is calling for an end
to social promotion in the public schools of Texas. Retaining
students who do not master basics or who fail the TAAS exams at
prescribed grade levels is a solidly conservative idea.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush would give them three chances to pass the test and
provide millions in state funds for summer school, tutorials and
extended day programs to help them pass, so that very few would
have to repeat a grade.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds ... well ... pretty compassionate. But Quayle would
probably spell it l-i-b-r-e-l-l.
</P>

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Why would hundreds of thousands of Mexicans camp out overnight
at a chilly racetrack to gain a glimpse of Pope John Paul II? Why
would 20,000 St. Louis teen-agers chant ''We love you'' at a youth
rally, or 100,000 people attend a Mass at the city's Trans World
Dome?
 &HT;    As the head of a church with a billion members, any man would
attract crowds. But not with the fervency and love that this man
sparks. Though he is now very frail, with a visibly trembling hand,
when he speaks he moves crowds deeply. Why?
 &HT;    First, all know this may be his last visit. Second, he speaks in
the language of whatever people he has visited in his 85 trips
abroad. We admire a man whose native tongue is Polish, who took the
time to learn our language whether English, Spanish, French,
Italian, etc.
 &HT;    Third, he has keen insight on each culture and senses the
deepest feelings of those he is visiting. In his fourth visit to
Mexico, he mentioned the Virgin of Guadalupe six times in his brief
arrival statement. She appeared to an Indian peasant named Juan
Diego in 1531, a decade after the brutal Spanish conquest of the
Aztec empire. She asked him to tell the bishop to build a church on
the hill where she appeared.
 &HT;    But the bishop did not believe Juan Diego. On Dec. 12, 1531, she
appeared again and told him to pick flowers from the hillside,
gather them in his cloak and take them to the bishop. When Juan
Diego later opened his cloak, it bore her image, that of a
dark-faced woman.
 &HT;    The garment has hung ever since in a series of churches built on
the site. The newest basilica, a cylindrical building built in
1976, is the most visited shrine in the world, after St. Peter's in
Rome. ''For us, she is the mother of Mexico, and she is my mother.
She is dark like us. We adore her every day,'' Clara Frias Tapia,
55, told a reporter.
 &HT;    In St. Louis, the pope insightfully recalled the 1857 Dred Scott
decision, a Missouri case in which the Supreme Court declared ''an
entire class of human beings, people of African descent, outside
... the Constitution's protection. America faces a similar time of
trial today.'' He added, ''Today the conflict is between a culture
that affirms, cherishes and celebrates life and a culture that
seeks to declare entire groups of human beings -- the unborn, the
terminally ill, the handicapped and others considered `unuseful,'
-- to be outside the boundaries of legal protection.''
 &HT;    John Paul is also inspirational in what he says. He challenged
Catholics to ''stir up a new springtime of holiness'' across the
Americas, linking North and South America against the ''social
sins'' of violence and injustice. In the Basilica of Our Lady of
Guadalupe, he called for ''No more violence, terrorism and drug
trafficking. No more torture or other forms of abuse.'' Applause
erupted after each sentence.
 &HT;    In St. Louis he thanked ''the American people for the countless
works of human goodness'' which ''have been such a part of the
history of your country. I know that you will hear my plea to open
wide your hearts to the ever-increasing plight and urgent needs of
our less fortunate brothers and sisters throughout the world.''
 &HT;    In his first major message to the Americas as a whole, a
135-page exhortation, ''Ecclesia in America,'' he acknowledges that
many of the hemisphere's 500 million Catholics are only nominally
Catholic, but called on them to engage in intense prayer and to
seek ''a personal encounter with Christ.'' He said the church needs
''new order, methods and expression'' for a ''new evangelization of
America.''
 &HT;    He noted the Americas are tied together by immigration and Latin
America's $697 billion debt. ''The decision to speak of `America'
in the singular,'' John Paul explains in the document, ''was an
attempt to express not only the unity which in some way already
exists, but also to point to that closer bond which the peoples of
the continent seek and which the church wishes to foster.
 &HT;    ''In America as elsewhere in the world, a model of society
appears to be emerging in which the powerful predominate, setting
aside and even eliminating the powerless.'' While he called for a
''preferential love for the poor,'' he added, ''If evangelization
of the leadership sector is neglected, it should not come as a
surprise that many who are a part of it will be guided by criteria
alien to the Gospel and at times openly contrary to it.''
 &HT;    This pope speaks to all of us, inspiring any who listen. That is
his appeal.

HEARST AND WOMEN.COM ANNOUNCE NEW ONLINE VENTURE FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates with fresh quotes)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Women.com Networks and Hearst New Media &AMP; Technology,
a wholly owned unit of The Hearst Corporation, announced Thursday
that they are forming a joint venture that will own and operate the
largest online network for women.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Women.com Networks will each own approximately 50
percent of the new enterprise, which will include the Women.com
network and the HomeArts.com network.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture will be called Women.com Networks and will
enjoy the highest reach among women's sites, with 6 percent of the
Internet audience as measured by Media Metrix, and well over 4
million women each month.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies said the joint venture will focus
on increasing market share rather making money. Women.com has yet
to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we started, growth has been more important than profits
and that will continue,'' said Maureen McDaniel, president and
chief executive officer of Women.com Networks. McDaniel will be
chief executive, president and chair of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief executive officer of
The Hearst Corporation, added that Hearst's Lifetime cable
television network operated in the red for years before becoming
television's largest network for women. ``I've been hearing this
same question for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel said that while the majority of the company's revenue
comes from advertising, she expects the firm's online shopping
service to eventually be its main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said Hearst wanted the merger with Women.com because the
two companies' audiences were ``perfect complements.'' Most of
Hearst's women's magazines and its online company HomeArts.com
focus on home and family issues, while Women.com specializes in
women and careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, we give women the whole range of information on work
and home,'' Bennack said.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of taking the company public, McDaniel and Bennack
did not rule out the possibility but declined to say if and when
the decision would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Women.com) was an attractive company before and that has only
increased with the merger,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture will have distribution rights for the Hearst
women's magazine sites; promotion in Hearst's leading women's
magazines; on-air promotion from Hearst's television properties and
interests (which include Lifetime, A&AMP;E, The History Channel, and
the Hearst-Argyle group of network-affiliated television stations);
capital; and Astronet, the world's leading online astrology site
which was recently acquired by Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Hearst magazine sites to be distributed by Women.com
Networks are Cosmopolitan, Country Living, Country Living Gardener,
Country Living's Healthy Living, Good Housekeeping, Harper's
BAZAAR, House Beautiful, Redbook, Town &AMP; Country and Victoria.
Hearst magazines reach 48 million women each month.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Creech, general manager of HomeArts, will assume the
role of senior vice president and general manager of the HomeArts
division in Women.com Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Women.com will each have four members on the
Women.com board of directors. The company's headquarters will
remain in San Mateo, Calif., the home base for Women.Com, with
significant operations in New York City, the headquarters for
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Women.com and HomeArts ``will deliver
increased value to our audience, as well as to the advertisers who
want to reach women _ the most important market on the Web,''
McDaniel said. ``The cross media synergies that Hearst brings to
the venture add an exciting new dimension to the new Women.com
Networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Sikes, president of Hearst New Media &AMP; Technology, predicted
that the joint venture ``will create a new standard for destination
sites on the Internet, securing leadership in serving both
consumers and advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1995 launch of flagship site Women's Wire, Women.Com
Networks has grown into a network of women's oriented communities,
now featuring Women.com, HomeArts.com and Astronet. To the over 4
million women visiting each month, the Women.com Networks delivers
interactive content and services, supportive communities and online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Women.com Networks can be found at www.women.com,
www.homearts.com and www.astronet.com and through AOL Keywords
``Women.com,'' ``HomeArts'' and ``Astronet.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Founding Fathers probably would never have
imagined the Constitution being mentioned in the same breath as the
Kinsey Institute sex survey _ even if it had been published 200
years ahead of schedule. But such is the strange world of
impeachment, '90s style.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Edelman, a professor of political science at the State
University of New York at Albany, welcomed more than 100 students
to ``Sex, Lies and Impeachment,'' a course where the hallowed
edicts of the Constitution mingle freely with the murky realities
of politics and sex.

   Setting the tone for the first day of class on Wednesday,
Edelman informed his students that a recently published Kinsey
survey showed that 60 percent of students at a midwestern
university would not consider oral sex as sex _ apparently
supporting the view President Clinton asserted in grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Then Edelman went ahead and quoted from the Constitution, which
says that a president may be removed for conviction of ``treason,
bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not gods and they're not infallible,'' he said of the
framers of the Constitution. ``But they're pretty damn smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The course, which examines current events in federal politics
even as they're unfolding, meets three times a week and includes
readings in four required texts. ``Wag the Dog'' and ``Primary
Colors'' _ both films that critics say parallel the Clinton
presidency _ are part of the syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman said he wants to look at the issue through the prism of
a ``culture war'' that has divided the nation on issues like
homosexuality and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   If student reaction on the first day of class was any
indication, some of that war may be fought in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very devoted Democrat,'' said freshman Allison Biller, a
political science major from Long Island. Biller, who served as a
page for House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt last summer,
believes that Clinton did what most Americans _ and most members of
Congress _ would have done under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's right,'' she said. ``He did commit
perjury. But if you asked the whole Congress, many of them have had
affairs. I think the majority of Americans would lie about that
sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a view is abhorrent to junior Gil Woodard, a history major
from North Creek and a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the sex, it's using the resources of the White House
to cover it up,'' he said. ``The man who's in charge of the highest
office of the land should have more responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman said he planned to look at the history of the special
prosecutor law as well as precedents for Clinton's debacle, from
the Senate trial of Andrew Johnson to efforts to impeach Richard
Nixon during Watergate.

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to the
following religion features moved during the last week.
</P>
<P>
   For retransmission of these stories, call 888-346-9867.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-TCU-TEX (Fort Worth) _ Southern Baptist conservative
leaders in recent years have enforced a strict conservatism on
professors in the six Southern Baptist-supported seminaries. The
Baptist Studies Program at Texas Christian University, established
in 1995, is a moderate alternative. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ Another high-profile
evangelical, this time the Rev. Jerry Falwell, has stuck his foot
in his mouth. Falwell would like to take back his remarks made
recently stating that the evil Antichrist probably is alive today
and, of course, will be a Jewish man. By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-Y2K-COX (Undated) _ Shaunti Christine Feldhahn, a
former federal reserve financial analyst who lives in Atlanta, has
started a project and written a book to help churches get ready for
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SACRED HARP-TEX (Undated) _ Sacred Harp, or shape-note
singing, is one of America's oldest musical heritages and survives
to this day little changed from the 1800s, when it flourished in
rural communities in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and
Alabama. Next Saturday, the Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth will have its 15th annual ``singing,'' a
free event designed more for participation than listening. By Dave
Ferman.
</P>
<P>
   SWAGGART-ENDURES-HNS (Baton Rouge, La.) _ The sign with
directions to Jimmy Swaggart's Bible College is gone as are the
throngs at his Family Worship Center, but the voice endures on the
radio, pleading, as ever, for money. By Curtis Wilkie.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ The nation's seminaries and
theology schools need to start preparing a new breed of preachers.
By Diego Ribadeneira.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-J-NYT (Undated) _ In the traditional interpretation of the
Bible, the Five Books of Moses are exactly that: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, written by Moses at God's
command. What may not be as well known is that during the last two
centuries, many biblical scholars have offered a different type of
analysis, concluding that those biblical books, also known as the
Pentateuch, are a compilation of four separate narratives, woven
together by ancient editors, or redactors, to create a single text.
By Gustav Niebuhr.

READERS SOUND OFF ON TV CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Creider doesn't just dislike arts critics. He despises
them. Won't read them. Won't talk to anyone who reads them. Won't
read anyone who's writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the new NBC drama ``Providence,'' airing its fourth
episode at 7 p.m. CST Friday. He considers it a laid-back,
entertaining series about real people and not contrived characters
living ``where no one would want to anyway.'' (''NYPD Blue'' is
mentioned specifically, so I suppose he dislikes New York and New
Yorkers, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Critics hammered ``Providence'' mercilessly. Mike's relationship
with critics didn't crumble there, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I didn't read a word of what the critics had to say
about `Providence,''' Mike says in a tersely worded e-mail, a
response to a story he did read, about the wide gap between
critics' and viewers' tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he put any stock in what any critic has to say about
anything: TV shows, movies, music, ``or the price of tea in
Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I view most critics, if not all, as frustrated people who are
not talented enough to produce a film, TV show, or record,'' he
continues. ``So to keep their noses in the business, they get a job
as a critic.''
</P>
<P>
   For credibility, Mike mentions a journalism degree ``from a
reputable college,'' one that doesn't give him license to be a
critic about anything having to do with the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you guys wonder why people like me don't pay attention to
the critics,'' he says near the end of his e-mail. ``Who needs
to?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, those who don't want to be led by the publicity machine of
the networks, for one. Taking critics out of the equation means
networks are your only source of information. True, far too many
critics write for themselves and other critics. Even more think
that bulldog writing tactics entertain readers. But a critic's job
is to give programming a social and historical context, and to
produce some sort of judgment, one that should be used as a
guidepost rather than as the final word.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Providence,'' many readers wrote about their love for
the series, but others actually agreed with critics. One was Liz
Valente, who finds the show ``sappy.''
</P>
<P>
   She also felt that the episode about the autistic child insulted
her intelligence. Her theory of its success? ``There's nothing
decent on in that time slot other than `Legacy,' which I thoroughly
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz thinks the networks ``should realize that for years they
have ignored Friday nights for good programming. I hate to tell
them, but not everyone goes out on Friday nights, and many people
who are out there working hard look forward to a quiet evening at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks also finally seem to be realizing, after years of
success from series like ``The Simpsons,'' that animation works.
It's a genre in which writers can get away with more than they can
in live-action series. But the creators of ``The PJs,'' airing
Tuesdays on Fox, found out quickly enough that race is still a
sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to an essay about the Fox series and the protests it
created, Curvie Hawkins, who grew up in an urban, inner-city
setting, writes that seeing characters tossing down 40-ounce malt
liquors was ``an objectionable moment.'' But overall, he saw
nothing that he hadn't witnessed on comedies like ``Married ...
With Children,'' ``Roseanne,'' ``South Park'' and ``Martin.'' ``No
more,'' he writes, ``no less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the current protesting group will find a more
salient purpose for displaying their anger, hopefully toward a
cause that will have a positive effect on conditions of people who
live in the projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin, who lists his age as 37 and his TV entertainment
during the '70s as ``Good Times'' and ``Sanford and Son,'' offers a
different take. ``The main problem with `The PJs,' at least in the
episode that I've seen so far, is that it isn't funny,'' he writes.
``The only interesting thing about it is the animation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Curvie sees a red flag in a series that is threatened by
protests. ``I recall that protesters created the cancellation of
one of my favorite shows in the '90s, which was `South Central.' I
still have a few episodes that ran on videotape. I hope that
doesn't happen with `The PJs.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. ``The PJs,'' despite the protests (and lukewarm
response from critics, Mike) is doing quite well in the ratings.

WHERE TIME STANDS STILL, NOT PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palm Beach, Fla., is beloved for its Spanish-style shopping
arcades and 1930s Mediterranean Revival mansions designed by
society architects like Addison Mizner and Maurice Fatio. The
Historic Preservation Society of Palm Beach has strict guidelines
to protect these old buildings as well as the town's charming
wooden bungalows. Very few houses are modern or contemporary. It's
not Miami Beach, you know.
</P>
<P>
   So it's striking that at least eight of the 84 dealers
participating in the Palm Beach International Art and Antique Fair,
which opens Friday in West Palm Beach and runs through Feb. 7, are
showing Art Deco and 20th-century furniture and objets d'art.
</P>
<P>
   They are not well known to the public in the United States, but
are favorites among European collectors and New York interior
designers. Jean-Claude Ciancimino, who specializes in Art Deco
furniture, is from London. Jacques De Vos and Robert Vallois are
from Paris, Philippe Denys from Brussels, and Galerie Beyrie from
New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Even French companies that concentrate on antiques of other
periods, like the wallpaper dealer Carolle Thibaut-Pomerantz and
the 18th-century furniture dealer Ariane Dandois, have some
20th-century works.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of 18th-century French and English furniture
and shabby chic,'' said Ciancimino, a dealer for 40 years who once
concentrated on English Regency and Neoclassical antiques. ``They
want to live in cleaner surroundings. The public is now realizing
how important this period is.'' He has focused for 10 years on Art
Deco, the fashionable style from between the wars.
</P>
<P>
   He is selling a pair of ebony-veneered screens designed about
1930 by Jean-Michel Frank, the French decorator and furniture
designer. Each screen has six handsome, unadorned panels that are
eight feet tall; they are simple and architectural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank stripped the rigid late-18th-century forms of their
ormolu and applied sumptuous veneers,'' Ciancimino said. ``He
reduced furniture to its simplest expression, limiting its
decoration to flat surface areas.''
</P>
<P>
   John Saladino, the New York interior designer, called Frank ``a
follower of simple geometric forms,'' adding: ``That's why his work
is so timeless. Frank let the wood or shagreen or cracked eggshell
be the decoration. He held back on ornament.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, the great-uncle of Anne Frank, was born in Paris in 1895.
His two brothers were killed in World War I, his father committed
suicide and his mother was placed in a mental institution.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris Frank studied law. Then in 1927, he commissioned a new
decor for his apartment from Adolphe Chanaux, a Paris designer who
had worked with Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, the 1920s designer who was
part of the 1925 Paris exposition that gave Art Deco its name.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Frank and Chanaux went into business together, catering to
clients like the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli in Paris, Count Cecil
Pecci-Blunt in Rome and Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York. Frank
also worked on the Riviera villa and Paris apartment of the
Viscount and Viscountesse Charles de Noailles, a society couple
known for their daring taste.
</P>
<P>
   Their Paris residence on the Place des Etats-Unis is still
considered one of the most important modern interiors of the
century. When Jean Cocteau saw the sparseness of Frank's decoration
there, he is said to have quipped, ``Pity the burglars got
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank did projects with other artists and designers, including
Emilio Terry, Christian Berard, Diego and Alberto Giacometti and
Dali. ``You have to remember these people were all working
together,'' Ciancimino said. ``They all copied each other. Unless a
piece is signed, it's hard to tell who did what.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallois Gallery is showing a glamorous sofa in Macassar ebony
designed by Ruhlmann, who was known for his sumptuous wood veneers.
The sofa, with slim, rectangular silvered bronze feet, is in the
form of a sleigh bed, with a silver mattresslike seat cushion and
round silver bolsters. The dark ebony is inlaid with fillets of
ivory. It costs $340,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vallois is also selling a dressing table fit for a movie star.
It has an oval mirror flanked on both sides with black lacquered
wooden drawers. The top is covered in shagreen. It was designed
about 1925 by Pierre Legrain, a modernist who revolutionized the
art of bookbinding.
</P>
<P>
   Vallois has an exceptional black lacquer and gold leaf screen
created in 1931 by a Japanese lacquerist named Hamanaka, who worked
in Paris. He is not well known, but Barbara Deisroth, Sotheby's Art
Deco specialist, said it was Hamanaka who taught lacquering
technique to Eileen Gray and Jean Dunand. The dramatic screen, with
a Zorro-like zigzag in black, is $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Denys, the Brussels dealer, is showing a Dunand collector's
cabinet in blond tortoise-shell lacquer from about 1935. Dunand,
who was Swiss, moved to Paris and, beginning in 1919, began
producing lacquered panels and tables for Pierre Legrain, Eugene
Printz and Ruhlmann to incorporate into their works.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thibaut-Pomerantz, a private dealer who divides her time
between Paris and New York, is selling a pair of Art Deco wallpaper
panels manufactured in 1928 by Stephanie of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   She said she will display them with a group of period crystal
lamps, a lemonwood console by the Parisian decorator Jean-Charles
Moreux ($20,000) and an Austrian chest in pearwood and mahogany
attributed to Dagobert Peche, the Austrian architect who served as
co-director of the Weiner Werkstatte in Vienna from 1917 to 1923.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Deco furniture is strong. ``There has been a big
change in demand in the last two years,'' said Peter Loughrey, an
owner of L.A. Modern Auctions. ``Things that weren't moving at all
are now selling for double the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rogin, a dealer in 20th-century design at 21 Mercer
Street, in Manhattan, who is not at the fair, said: ``The auction
houses are getting unbelievable prices for the big names, like
Rateau, Frank, Gray and Chareau. Prices for signature pieces are
going up 20 to 40 percent per year.'' Rogin sells cheaper examples,
like a Jacques Adnet club chair from 1928 ($6,000) and a pair of
1925 mahogany and seagrass chairs by Francis Jourdain ($12,000 for
the pair).
</P>
<P>
   The prices don't surprise Ms. Deisroth of Sotheby's. ``Deco
furniture always does well; it's the most popular furniture of this
century,'' she said. ``The quality is unchanged from the 18th
century and it easily fits in with any kind of furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McClelland of Christie's tried to explain why a cast
bronze armchair by Armand Albert Rateau sold at auction on Dec. 10
for $640,500, a world auction record for any 20th-century chair.
``The chair is quintessential in form and very rare,'' she said.
``But then, we've gotten record prices in every 20th-century
decorative arts sale this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did the dealers clamor to go to Palm Beach? David Lester,
the organizer of the fair, said, ``They regard this as a second New
York market. Their best customers are American, and they know their
clients are in Palm Beach.''

IT'S NOT QUITE ALL THAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, the Baltimore Sun ran a story about millennials,
today's Internet-savvy, parent-friendly generation of teens and
young adults. We probably shouldn't begrudge filmmakers who want to
give millennials movies like ``She's All That,'' even though it
isn't very well-executed.
</P>
<P>
   This high-school ``Pygmalion'' tries hard but misfires
frustratingly on many levels. It's sensitive to its teen
characters' emotional confusion and respects their intelligence,
but it struggles _ and usually fails _ to represent those
qualities. Ultimately, though, its near-miss failure falls squarely
on the shoulders of its leads, whose performances don't do justice
to their appealing characters; and its director, Robert Iscove, who
can't bring his actors to the levels needed for the film to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Prinze Jr., cursed with that Judd Nelson/Patrick Swayze
look _ you know the one, in which the actor registers pain, anger
and confusion by knotting his brow as if trying to decipher a
complicated physics text _ plays Zack, a big man on campus who has
just been dumped by his narcissistic girlfriend. Belatedly noticing
his ex's superficiality, he bets a friendly rival ``(Varsity
Blues''' Paul Taylor) that he can turn any girl at the school into
a prom queen by giving her the right look _ and putting the right
guy on her arm. Their test case is Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook), a
noncomformist art student who's a reverse snob: She thinks she's
better than everyone else because she doesn't think she's better
than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   How can this scenario go wrong? Let us count the ways: 1) Laney
is already by far the most interesting person at the school,
despite her geeky klutziness; 2) With her glasses and free-flowing
long hair, she's prettier before her ``makeover,'' which turns her
into a babe but conventionalizes her; 3) She hardly seems the type
to get caught in the prom-queen thing, even reluctantly; 4) Zack is
revealed from the outset as such a decent guy, it's hard to believe
that he'd make such a sexist bet.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a peripheral plot line in which Zack's ex (Jodi Lyn
O'Keefe) takes up with a guy from MTV's ``The Real World''
``(Scream's'' Matthew Lillard, in an incredibly irritating
performance), who's so self-absorbed that he'd rather watch himself
on TV than have his hottie girlfriend kiss his bare chest (maybe
``self-absorbed'' isn't the word; ``nuts'' is probably better). The
movie somehow fails in its attempts to lampoon ``The Real World'' _
the pop-culture equivalent of missing the broad side of a barn with
a rolling tank.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all its deep flaws, the movie is hard to dislike,
especially after you get past the indifferently written,
haphazardly directed opening scenes. The turning point comes during
a face-off between Laney and Zack's ex, as the movie finally
decides that it's going to find a tone and take itself a bit more
seriously. Still, Cook's performance is flatter than her character
deserves; she suffers seemingly eternal agonies by looking like
she's suffering indigestion _ heartburn instead of heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the movie's best scene _ which has nothing to do with
the rest of the story and looks as if it was filmed by a guest
director _ illustrates what's wrong with it. During the prom, a
bunch of teens kick it in a production number set to Fatboy Slim's
irresistible techno-funk anthem ``The Rockafeller Skank.'' It's
completely unbelievable, yet it's great fun to watch, because it
teems with life and youthful vigor. If the rest of the movie had
this much energy, we might have had something.
</P>
<P>
   After the screening, local Miramax representatives were
collecting audience surveys, with most 18- to 24-year-olds rating
the movie good to excellent. So it's succeeding at reaching its
target audience, but there's a laziness in that, as if it were
trying just hard enough and not going the extra mile. Teen-oriented
movies don't have to be the province of teens; the best of them,
from ``Saturday Night Fever'' to ``The Breakfast Club'' to ``Say
Anything,'' cross generational lines because they find depths that
``She's All That'' doesn't try to reach.
</P>
<P>
   That Baltimore Sun story about millennials also stated that they
hate being lumped into groups. So here's a movie that, despite
apparently good intentions, argues that it's OK to be
individualistic, as long as you have contact lenses, the right hair
and the right clothes. Perhaps the filmmakers don't even see the
hypocrisy in that. Perhaps we can begrudge them films like this,
after all.

CRAZED AND CONFUSED: AGING ROCK BAND STRANGE FRUIT IS RIPE FOR THE
PLUCKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new comedy ``Still Crazy,'' the broken-up and reunited
(though broken down) '70s rock band Strange Fruit are more like
middle-aged crazy than ``still crazy.'' These 50-ish has-beens,
having disbanded 20 years ago, decide to get together for a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1978, they were probably already on their way to
becoming the Jurassic Park Orchestra _ punk was raising its spiky
head for the first time, putting an end to the whiny bloat of a
band like the Fruit. Anyone who's read a favorable review of Mick
Jagger's alleged dancing will start to tear up with laughter when
the lead singer of the Fruit, Bill Nighy, hauls his ravaged
scarecrow frame onstage and contorts what's left of him into
rock-star poses. He's like Gumby without elasticity.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rea is the band's keyboardist, who manages a musty
dignity, even though he's been reduced to restocking condom
machines for a living. He wants to bring his mates back together,
even if it means losing the collectible that he's been saving for
an emergency: one of Jimi Hendrix's teeth, salvaged from a barroom
floor.

   The Fruit are a salvage job themselves. The band's painful,
caterwauling brand of excess hasn't aged well. (They're the last
ignored artifact of the '70s for a reason.) The majestically
indifferent trophy wife of the Fruit's lead singer (Helena
Bergstrom) wants nothing to do with them. She's too busy tromping
around in their arena-sized castle, trying to lure buyers with
enticements like, ``The Queen slept here. So did Steve Winwood.''
But soon enough _ probably too soon, given what they sound like _
the Fruit are rotting and rolling again, thanks to their ace road
manager (the irrepressible Billy Connolly) who knows where every
body is buried ... even that of their leader, whose disappearance
finished off the band.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Still Crazy'' writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais
(contributors to Tracey Ullman's HBO series) also wrote ``The
Commitments,'' there they had a great novel as source material, and
a director (Alan Parker) who knew how to lovingly serve the script.
Still Crazy director Brian Gibson stumbles like an aged pop figure
who hasn't quite figured out less is more; you can almost hear his
arches fall as he trolls the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Clement and La Frenais, ``Still Crazy'' slams its
jokes home into the broad side of a barn. It may not be adroit, but
a lot of it is very funny. It helps too that the Fruit's song
catalog _ anthemic roof-raisers _ were written by Squeeze's Chris
Difford (with production by Jeff Lynne and Foreigner's Mick Jones).
These lovingly re-created plow horses have a wheezing authenticity
_ it's as if Difford and company listened to the worst of Yes and
T. Rex, completely absorbed it and toiled until they crafted
hilarious sound-alike gems. Maybe ``Crazy'' doesn't have the
vicious vigor of ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' but unlike ``Tap'' it
carries affection for its protagonists and their game idiocy. If
you still chuckle when you hear the first crunching chords of
``Smoke on the Water,'' then bogard your way into ``Still Crazy,''
my friend.

NINE EASY PIECES: A WRITER'S EXERCISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his last two major novels, ``The Information'' (1995) and
``London Fields'' (1990), Martin Amis persuasively established
himself as one of his generation's most ambitious and technically
daring writers: a writer who has articulated his distinctively
dark, dyspeptic view of the modern world with a Nabokovian love of
language and a post-modernist's fondness for narrative play.
</P>
<P>
   Although his latest book, ``Heavy Water and Other Stories,'' a
collection of nine stories written over the last two decades,
intermittently displays those gifts, the volume is basically a case
of a skilled writer lazily using his sleight of hand to toss off
what (with two or three exceptions) are pure exercises in craft.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more annoying stories in this volume are nothing but
extended jokes, predicated upon a not so clever reversal of roles.
``Career Move'' depicts a world in which poets are highly paid
Hollywood hacks and screenwriters are impoverished artists who
publish their obscure work in little magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight Fiction'' similarly posits a world in which gay and
straight people have switched roles: the heterosexual minority
finds its ranks being decimated by a mysterious illness known as
``the straight plague,'' while the homosexual right mocks
heterosexuals as ``reproducers,'' ``bearers,'' ``spawners'' and
``fertilizers.''
</P>
<P>
   This story not only feels incongruously comic, given the
seriousness of the AIDS crisis, but also forced, as though Amis
were straining to expand a slight and silly premise into a
magazine-length story.
</P>
<P>
   The same might well be said of ``Career Move,'' which, despite a
couple of laughs, quickly devolves into a series of tiresome jokes
about poets wanting to direct and screenwriters giving readings
that attract ``tousled girls who wore thick overcoats and no makeup
and blinked incessantly or not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both tales bring to mind Amis' unfortunate 1991 novella,
``Time's Arrow,'' which recounted the story of a former Nazi doctor
turned American suburbanite in reverse chronological sequence: all
three fictions devote pages and pages of expendable sophomoric
humor to the cause of making one obvious philosophical point.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories in this volume are equally forgettable. ``Denton's
Death,'' a grisly little tale about a man awaiting his execution _
meant, no doubt, as a kind of sendup of ``Danton's Death'' _ feels
like a perfunctory creative writing class assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The title story, ``Heavy Water,'' which chronicles a sea cruise
undertaken by an aging woman and her middle-aged, mentally
challenged son, is little but an assemblage of descriptive effects
meant to showcase the body language Amis can put on words.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Let Me Count the Times,'' an utterly predictable account
of a bean-counting businessman's penchant for tabulating his sexual
encounters, reads like a sorry excuse concocted by the author to
indulge his taste for unwholesome descriptions of bodily functions,
the sort of thing he did so famously in his earliest fiction some
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``The Janitor on Mars,'' a lengthy story about a Martian
robot dispensing his milleniums-old wisdom about the cosmos to
backward earthlings, it's a heavy-handed parable about human
stupidity _ reminiscent of the tales in ``Einstein's Monsters,''
Amis' 1987 collection of anti-nuclear fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Amis' Janitor on Mars, whose tale is clumsily juxtaposed with
that of a pedophiliac janitor who works on Earth at an orphanage
for boys, is a long-winded, casually profane fellow given to
discursive diatribes. ``I think you'll be awed by some of the
things I'm going to tell you,'' he declares, as he begins to
expatiate upon the dangers of hubris and war. ``Other emotions,
however, will predominate. Emotions like fear and contempt. Or
better say terror and disgust. Terror and disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coincidence of the Arts,'' an O'Henryesque tale about the
relationships an English painter develops with a hostile would-be
novelist and his seductive wife in Manhattan, is equally contrived,
but it is enlivened by Amis' unforgiving eye for detail and his
ferocious gift for dialogue. The reader can see the story's ironic
ending coming a mile off, but doesn't really mind, so engagingly
does Amis put its raucous elements into play.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two stories in this volume, ``State of England''
and ``What Happened to Me on My Holiday,'' both of which originally
appeared in the New Yorker, are even better. In these tales, Amis
not only dazzles the reader with his verbal pyrotechnics but
actually uses them to say something, dropping his wise-guy
authorial stance to create people with genuine conflicts and
dilemmas, characters who vividly reveal themselves to be more than
collections of satiric traits.
</P>
<P>
   In ``State of England,'' Amis chronicles the efforts of a former
bouncer named Big Mal to come to terms with his estranged wife,
their son and his old partner, and in doing so gives us a sad-funny
portrait of a man caught between two worlds, a man trying to
reconcile his rough-neck past with the changing England he sees
around him, an England of upwardly mobile immigrants and spoiled
yuppies, an England where new rules of etiquette and gender obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Told phonetically in nasal, childish tones, ``What Happened to
Me on My Holiday'' may initially strike the reader as a mannered
experiment in style, but it subtly evolves into something wiser and
deeper: a child's stumbling, stammering efforts to tell the story
of a young friend's death, and his own apprehension, that summer of
his 11th year, of the meaning of mortality and loss.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that points up the flimsiness of so many of the
other tales in this volume, even as it underscores the feats of
which the copiously talented Amis is capable.

LEARNING LIFE'S LESSONS ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARSITY BLUES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight, Amy Smart, Paul Walker, Ron
Lester, Scott Caan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brian Robbins &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 106 minutes
</P>
<P>
   At a beery party, a deputy sheriff tells a high school boy
called Tweeter (Caan) that it's time to go home. Tweeter agrees and
takes off in the deputy's squad car, siren screaming, which he
later loads up with friends, all of them stark naked.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily that would get a guy in Dutch, but this is Texas
football country and Tweeter is the West Canaan Coyote's ace wide
receiver. With the team's 23rd district championship there for the
clinching, nobody wants to rile Coach Bud Kilmer (Voight), a nasty
piece of work even in the off-season, by disciplining his players
(especially those at the skill positions).
</P>
<P>
   Every West Canaan male Kilmer ever coached for the last 30 years
is not only still stuck in town, but slavishly worships him and the
great god football. A racist tyrant, the coach is the kind of man
who reacts to substandard performance by promising to ruin his
players' lives.
</P>
<P>
   He also isn't above locking the trainer's door and injecting
enough pain killer into a badly blown knee to get a star back in
the game regardless of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of drugs or intimidation can revive the injured
quarterback Lance Harbor (Walker), so Kilmer inserts his backup,
Jon Moxon (Van Der Beek, the ``Dawson's Creek'' star).
</P>
<P>
   Mox is a West Canaan original: a sensitive, intelligent
teen-ager who doesn't regard football, or Kilmer, as the fount of
existence. He's also a pretty fair quarterback, which keeps the
West Canaan juggernaut on track. Even so, a revolt against Kilmer
is building, and with the inevitable big game inevitably in the
balance Mox mounts the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE They can dish it out on a west Texas football field,
and an aura of physical combat hangs over West Canaan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Plenty. Decked out in a whipped-cream bikini, a cheerleader
lures quarterbacks, having sex with one on top of a washing
machine. Later, the high school's sex education teacher gives a
torrid demonstration as a topless dancer at a local strip joint.
And don't forget Tweeter in the buff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Thoroughly laced throughout.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 Parents should be aware of the sex, but on an
entirely different plane the film has an estimable character in
Mox. Having applied to Brown, he has a lot to lose by defying
Kilmer, who threatens to taint his transcript, but he sticks to his
values and acts on his convictions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP The sex may still raise objections, but on
balance there shouldn't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC GLORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A two-dimensional Imax film (no headsets required) at the Sony
Theaters Lincoln Square &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kieth Merrill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No rating 42 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With elaborate corporate sponsorship and the official imprimatur
of the International Olympic Committee, Merrill's documentary about
the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, makes a grand if antiseptic
splash across the gigantic Imax screen.
</P>
<P>
   Events from Alpine and Nordic skiing to figure and speed skating
are presented one by one, exalted by high-blown and sometimes
ponderous narration that could never be accused of not taking
itself seriously. At one point, for instance, we are told
dramatically that ice hockey, a sport most people have at least a
passing familiarity with, is played with a rubber object called a
puck.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many engaging scenes. The film is at its best with
big vistas in events like the downhill, which gives a good feeling
of the immensity of the course and what it's like to be on skis at
80 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For the roller-coaster effect, which is de rigueur in all Imax
films, there are rocket rides down the bobsled and luge runs. And
there may never be a better secondhand look at ski jumpers soaring
almost forever down a 90-meter hill.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that considers only victory and lofty ideals, losing
hockey players don't trash hotel rooms as they really did in Nagano
nor do figure skaters go sprawling. Nor, of course, is there any
hint of the current allegations of corruption over the selection of
Salt Lake City as the site of the 2002 games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more genuine moments is the last-place finish in
cross-country skiing by a competitor from Kenya, a land with no
snow. An accomplished marathoner, he had trained for skiing in
Finland. ``It was great,'' his Finnish instructor says. The Kenyan
smiles broadly. ``It was terrible,'' he says. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY In the heat of competition, some may be mouthed, but
none is audible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-11 The littlest ones may not fathom every detail, but the
film is a wonderful spectacle for young children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP By this age, more sophisticated viewers may roll
their eyes ceilingward at some of the more flowery narration.
Still, they'll be enthralled at the sights on screen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   PG 110 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Ephron's film, based on Ernst Lubitsch's ``Shop Around
the Corner'' (1940), Kathleen Kelly (Ms. Ryan) runs a sweet little
children's bookstore, a fixture on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, and exchanges wistful e-mail messages about bagels and
life with Joe Fox (Hanks), scion of the Fox superstore book chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the over-30 room and there he was,'' Kathleen
tells a friend. She means chat room. Maintaining strict Internet
anonymity, she and Joe don't know each other's identity but
gradually come to acknowledge a strong attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, their flesh-and-blood selves live in the same
neighborhood and regularly and unwittingly cross paths. Eventually
they meet, never realizing that they're e-mail correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   His new superstore is about to put her shop out of business. He
doesn't seem too sorry, but he has a golden retriever and is not
that bad a fellow. She is determined to be civil and carry on.
</P>
<P>
   She loses her shop. Now they run into each other everywhere,
still unaware of the Internet connection. They both get rid of
inappropriate live-in partners (Ms. Posey and Kinnear). The stage
is set for the big revelation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-11 The film is harmless, but it is too slow-moving and
ruminative to hold the attention of younger children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP More romantically inclined viewers will enjoy
themselves.

POPULAR MOTLEY FOOL'S INVESTMENT GUIDE HAS YET ANOTHER SEQUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fools are back, but the Ladies are conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about some distorted board game, but rather of
popular investment books and their continual sequels.
</P>
<P>
   The Motley Fools, aka Tom and David Gardner, are among the
leaders of the pack in investment book sales. They have produced a
book e year for three years running, with a workbook published in
that time frame, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners say their latest book ``closes out a trilogy of
investment works.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait for 2000, to see if a fourth book emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Beardstown Ladies, that affable group of senior
citizens from Beardstown, Ill., who rose to talk show fame after
their investment books came out, are MIAs in the annual surge of
investment books for January.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the Ladies have taken to hiding after a
journalist ran their numbers last year and found that they
significantly inflated their portfolio's percentage of total gains.
The ladies said it was an error on their part. If so, it's one that
their publisher should have found long before their first book hit
print. It's little wonder that they are still under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   That said, let's see what the Fools have to say this year.
</P>
<P>
   Their book is ``The Motley Fool's Rule Breakers, Rule Makers:
The Foolish Guide to Picking Stocks'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 340 pages,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners have used their feature on America Online and their
Web site to propel themselves into investment guru status in the
past few years. By showing investors how to act Foolishly, meaning
to do their own investing rather than relying on brokers or mutual
funds, the Gardners have created quite a following. Their
interactive investment advice, as well as the posting of their
portfolio's performance with daily updates, attracted millions to
their Internet sites. Their previous books, outlining their basic
investment strategy, have all been bestsellers.
</P>
<P>
   This book discusses exceptions to their typical strategy that
have shown up in their portfolio. Or, as they write, ``an attempt
to answer one of the more frequently asked questions on
www.fool.com: `Why did you guys buy America Online and Amazon.com?
They don't seem to fit any of your parameters!'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, those stocks and others the Gardners list, including
Starbucks, Microsoft, Whole Foods Market and Wal-Mart, are examples
of another genre of investments that the brothers call ``Rule
Breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The business world is full of rules made by industry leaders,
they say. ``In order for a new business to come into existence and
gain significance, it must consciously break those rules. ...
Entrepreneurs therefore invent new rules or change the game
altogether.... All great businesses begin by being Rule Breakers,''
they write.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners identify six traits investors can look for to find
rule-breaking companies. For example, the companies must be the
market leader and first mover in an important, emerging industry,
the Gardners write. They go on to detail those traits and provide
numerous examples of companies that do and do not fit those
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule Makers,'' the other investment strategy found in their
book, deals with less volatile and less risky companies for
investment. The rule makers are actually the rule breakers that
have grown up and become stable, rock-solid industry leaders. They
are the kings, or legalized monopolies of the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They maintain high valuations, wield outlandish power in their
industries, and exert great influence over the business world at
large,'' the Gardners write.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies make great long-term investments and are of
tremendous benefit to society in that they provides good and
services at unparalleled combinations of high quality and low
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Among that group are Dell Computers, the Gap, Cisco Systems,
Intel and Microsoft (again).
</P>
<P>
   The latest Fools book is as well-written as the others and
certainly offers more food for thought. It will be interesting to
see what variation on the variation they come up with, however, to
continue the flow of book sales.

   ``Angels in the Workplace: Stories and Inspirations for Creating
a New World of Work''
</P>
<P>
   By Melissa Giovagnoli
</P>
<P>
   Jossey-Bass, $22
</P>
<P>
   Whether starting a program to teach underprivileged teen-agers
how to run their own businesses, or running a work program for
homeless men or fighting against a major polluter, some people in
the workplace inspire like angels, Melissa Giovagnoli says. She
discusses the traits the ``angels'' have in common and provides
hundreds of anecdotes about what they are doing. Her book is

<P>
   From advertising rental property to evicting unruly tenants,

<P>
   legal issues for landlords. Now in its third edition, it has
been hailed as a bible by real estate trade publications. All three
authors are with Nolo Press, a major publisher of self-help legal
guides. The guide includes a computer disk with 25 legal forms
pertaining to rental property.

</P>
<P>
   By Graham Bannock, R.E. Baxter and Evan Davis
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   From accelerator coefficient to zero-sum game, this book
provides clear, quick definitions of the easiest and most
complicated economic terms. It took the authors 439 pages to
complete the task, in quite small print. But this fourth edition
should define any business term you need.

TEACHERS SAY CLINTON PLAN DOESN'T PASS MUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Illinois, New York.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It sounds simple enough: If you fail in school,
you don't graduate to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Clinton raised the idea in his State of the
Union address of a national policy to end so-called social
promotion, educators say he oversimplified an issue far more
complex than the either-or proposition of promoting or holding back
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good that sounds to people ... it's not a sound
educational practice,'' said Warren Gemmill, assistant
superintendent of the Saratoga Springs City School District, which
he said holds back few students.
</P>
<P>
   Social promotion is the practice of promoting students
performing below grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Schenectady school district in upstate New
York ended the practice of social promotion _ a move, said
Superintendent Raymond Colucciello, based on the idea that ``if we
socially promote, we're doing an injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The district increased support along with the policy, he noted,
instituting summer school and tutorial programs and alerting
parents early on to problems. The district did not immediately
provide statistics on how many children have since been held back.
</P>
<P>
   But some educators are skeptical of plans to eliminate social
promotion. The president failed to acknowledge research suggesting
that holding students back can increase the likelihood of them
dropping out of school altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education said that Clinton was not
advocating holding children back, but wants to encourage schools to
pay closer attention to struggling students. Schools that fail to
end social promotion practices would risk their federal aid, which
accounts for about 7 percent of school funding nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we mean and what the president means is putting in place
programs that help all children succeed,'' said Department of
Education spokeswoman Julie Green. ``This is really an effort to
get standards into the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address on Jan. 19, Clinton said he would send Congress a
five-point Education Accountability Act that would require every
district receiving federal aid to take certain steps, including
ending social promotion.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal was hailed by the New York State United Teachers
union, which in a 1996 survey of 1,000 members found that 61
percent felt pressured to promote students regardless of their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This union has always believed that social promotion is really
a harmful practice, that it's really the Achilles' heel,'' said
union spokeswoman Linda Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting an unready student and forcing them to struggle with
new material when they haven't mastered the old is ``far more
damaging to self-esteem,'' Rosenblatt said. And, she said, ``It
makes a high school diploma meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   But educators, including the New York State United Teachers, say
such a change must be backed up with special programs to give
at-risk students the best possible chance of success. That means
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just as easy as saying, `OK, we're not going to
just promote children,''' Rosenblatt said. ``That's were the rub
is. Some people say, we don't have the money to do that. Our
position is, we can't afford not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to the complexity of the issue, saying, ``We
can't just hold students back when the system fails them.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed tripling the $200 million the government now
provides for summer and after school programs, to help districts
prepare students to advance a grade.
</P>
<P>
   That grant program, however, already is fiercely competitive;
out of 2,000 applications last year, only about one-third were
funded. ``Obviously, that still is only a drop in the bucket,''
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the Chicago school district as an example of how
eliminating social promotion can work. Under Chicago's 3-year-old
program, children in grades three, six, eight and nine must pass
their classes, score well on standardized tests or successfully
complete a summer school program.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago last summer graduated the most eighth graders to high
school ever _ 28,160 _ including more than 4,700 who underwent the
summer program. About 3,000 children were either held back or moved
into a special transition program.
</P>
<P>
   But one educator said the short-term results Clinton praised in
Chicago ignore 70 years of studies that for the most part show a
long-term downside to retention.
</P>
<P>
   Gemmill said one study showed that students who were held back
were three times more likely to drop out of school as children of
even lesser achievement who were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it sounds great to get tougher, it's not borne out by
hundreds and hundreds of studies,'' he said, adding that holding a
student back leaves the child, along with classmates, siblings and
even parents, with a perception of failure. ``It follows them.''

A TRIO OF GIANTS REOPEN THE YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ After closing for a year to spruce up its
Louis Kahn-designed home, the Yale Center for British Art has
reopened with a trio of exhibitions devoted to three giants of
modern British art: Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Henry Moore.
The last two are minor sideshows: one dedicated to Freud's
etchings, the other a survey of small bronze studies for monuments
produced by Moore from the 1930s to the 1970s. But the Bacon show,
an imperfect but ultimately dazzling 60-painting retrospective,
makes a trip to Yale well worth it. All three shows run through
March 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Bacon exhibition, whose curator is Dennis Farr, the director
emeritus of the Courtauld Institute of Art's galleries in London,
starts with a rare piece from the 1930s, a small, ghostly,
abstracted Crucifixion, and a couple of full-size studies for
Bacon's 1944 triptych ``Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a
Crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the work that horrified and disconcerted viewers when
it was exhibited in London in 1945 and put Bacon, then in his
mid-30's, a self-taught painter with little formal education, on
the map of the British art world.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the panels, a fleshy, dinosaurlike creature with a
long serpentine neck and a gaping, toothy maw snaps at a bouquet of
roses thrust in its face by an unseen hand. With its intense orange
background and richly sensuous paint, this work introduces the
primary poles of Bacon's art: the comically melodramatic horror and
the seductive surface.
</P>
<P>
   If you identify Bacon mainly with his ``Screaming Pope'' of the
1950s, several versions of which are included here, you may be
surprised that the most compelling part of the exhibition is
devoted to the last two decades of Bacon's life, when he produced a
series of big, vibrant, wonderfully animated triptychs. (He died in
1992 at 82.) Compared with his late output, the works from Bacon's
early years seem dour and constricted.
</P>
<P>
   A better selection might have changed that impression, but in
any event, the ``Screaming Pope'' is still his most memorable
creation from the early period. Attaching a face, taken from the
image of a wailing, bloodied woman with broken spectacles in Sergei
Eisenstein's ``Battleship Potemkin,'' to a three-quarter-length
sitting portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velazquez, Bacon created a
great 20th-century icon, a crazy, evil father figure for a mad
world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the screaming pope image is like an editorial cartoon.
Bacon is famous for abhorring illustration, but that is what most
of his work from the 1950s resembles. Tormented men isolated in
dark spaces, lone dogs or spectral sphinxes dressed up with
artfully blurry brushwork serve all too obviously as symbols of
existential dread.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1950s there was a shift. In a catalog essay,
Sally Yard suggests that this may have been partly inspired by
Bacon's exposure to new American painting, Barnett Newman's in
particular. Bacon disapproved of pure abstraction, but increasingly
at this point, his expanding canvases give themselves over to
fields of unmodulated color.
</P>
<P>
   From here on, it is hard to see Bacon as the artist of
``isolation, despair and horror,'' as he is characterized in an
exhibition brochure. He seems more a joyfully, wickedly perverse
hedonist, which is what he was in real life, too.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Portrait of George Dyer Talking'' (1966), Bacon poses his
subject, who was his lover at the time, naked on a stool at the
center of an empty room under a bare, dangling light bulb. Oddly, a
sheaf of papers splays out at his feet. The man is a melting, lumpy
mass of flesh made of sinuous brush strokes and his eyes bug out,
as though he felt trapped within his own body.
</P>
<P>
   But if this is horrible, it is not reflected in the environment:
a rosy, pink-hatched rug; a curving violet rear wall and a
moss-green ceiling. Take away the figure and the light bulb and
you'd have a wholly pleasurable 60s-style Color Field painting.
With the figure, you have a voluptuous, hallucinatory cartoon of
desire on the brink of gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest of the triptychs, a triple portrait of Freud, was
made in 1969; the last, executed in 1988, is a version of the 1944
Crucifixion triptych in which the harsh orange of the earlier piece
has become a deep velvety red and the bestial figures have been
softened to diaphanous chimeras.
</P>
<P>
   The triptychs all measure 6{ by 15 feet and occupy most of one
floor of the exhibition, to glowing and almost disorientingly
enveloping effect. They are deceptively clear yet oddly confounding
amalgams of color fields, erotically distorted or fragmented bodies
and sharp, linear articulations of space, with, here and there,
pieces of furniture or still-life objects.
</P>
<P>
   In the portraits, the repetition of the picture of a man on a
stool in an empty room three times, with only slight variations,
creates a powerful formal amplitude and a clinical gaze that
recalls the sequential photographs of Eadweard Muybridge, an
important influence on Bacon's visual imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But the most engaging of the triptychs offer enigmatic
narratives, sequences of disquieting glimpses like lurid images
from barely remembered dreams or nightmares. In one from 1970, two
naked Muybridge-inspired men grapple on a round green bed; in
flanking panels, shadowy figures look in from open doors and
bizarre, misshapen homunculi, barely evolved from puddles of dark
paint, seem to writhe on the floor. It's all embedded in a great
field of intense reddish-orange and, contrary to the sense of
Dionysian urgency, the overall composition is one of symmetrical
elegance, almost Asian in its exactingly balanced delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   That each panel of the triptychs is contained by a shiny gold
frame and isolated behind a great sheet of glass may bother viewers
who want to get closer to Bacon's dry and thin yet sumptuous
surfaces. But the grandiose Old Masterish framing is in keeping
with the Bacon vision, which always embraced extremes of high
estheticism and low carnality.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfair that Freud's etchings should be viewed alongside
the Bacon show. As a painter, Freud shares with Bacon, his old
friend, a fascination with the body and a huge ambition for the
medium. It would be interesting to compare directly his
aggressively painterly, warts-and-all realism with Bacon's deftly
edited surrealistic expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   But this presentation of the Paine Webber collection of all the
42 prints Freud has made since taking up etching in 1982 does not
show him to best advantage. With the exception of a formally and
psychologically impressive head of ``Lord Goodman in His Pajamas,''
the works are wooden, doggedly laborious and colorless exercises in
the drawing of inert models.
</P>
<P>
   As for Henry Moore, it's a relief to turn away from the vacuous,
overly familiar biomorphic Cubism of his reclining nudes, fallen
warriors and mothers and children to Bacon's nasty, delirious
beauty. &QL;

 &HT;    A YEAR LATER, FBI STILL BELIEVES RUDOLPH IN N.C. MOUNTAINS
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 31
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ This seems such an unlikely place to find a
domestic terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime is rare and people in this town of 2,600 don't
hestiate to speak to strangers. The streets are adorned with
rambling old Victorian homes and stately churches. A few families
still keep chickens in backyard pens. From anywhere in town is a
breathtaking view of 5,000-foot high peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet federal authorities remain convinced that accused bomber
Eric Robert Rudolph still is somewhere in these mountains into
which he disappeared a year ago. Led by the FBI and the U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, about 200 federal and state
agents continue the 12-month search on foot and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   They remain convinced that Rudolph is here because they have no
proof he is anywhere else. He knows the mountains, they point out,
and the dense forests where he learned survival skills as a
teenager near his remote home in the Nantahala community. The
country is so rough that it can conceal an airplane crash with no
trace to be found.
</P>
<P>
   And some residents think he still is here because he is getting
support from local sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   An old sewing machine factory along the railroad tracks is now a
heavily guarded command center for the Southeast Bomb Task Force.
Helicopters rumble over the town day and night. Each morning,
squads of law officers, often with tracking dogs, fan out over the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, a carpenter and former soldier, is charged with a
series of bomb attacks that began at Centennial Olympic Park, where
one person was killed and 111 others injured, during the 1996
Summer Games and ended with the Jan. 29, 1998, explosion at a
Birmingham abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer
working as a security guard and seriously injured a nurse. He also
is accused of setting bombs in 1997 at a Sandy Springs abortion
clinic and at an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say he was motivated by extreme anti-government and
anti-abortion views. He is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list and
carries a $1 million reward on his head.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become one of the most intense manhunts in American
history, the pursuit of Rudolph also has resulted in painful media
scrutiny of this town and surrounding villages. Community leaders
contend the area has been linked unfairly to anti-government
extremists who have settled in the mountains the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people here support what (the agents) are
doing,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said. ``We may have some militants around
here, but no more than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to find Rudolph sympathizers in Andrews,
it is not so difficult in the rural community of Nantahala north of
here. In a high and remote mountain valley, Nantahala is where the
Rudolph family moved from Florida when Eric Rudolph was 14 in 1981
and where he lived off and on until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here I'd say it's 50-50 as far as the people who would
turn him in and those who wouldn't,'' said John Wagner, as he
sipped coffee in Nantahala's only restaurant, The Lake's End Grill.
``A lot of people say he killed people who were killing babies.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Wagner's wife, Joy, who writes a regular column for the
weekly Andrews Journal, disagrees. ``I think those who support him
are just a few.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the town of Andrews has tried to make the outside
law enforcement agents feel welcome. Over the Christmas holidays, a
number of agents were invited into local homes for dinner, while
residents delivered food to the command center.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have presented programs to Scout groups and attended
local churches. FBI and ATF officials have maintained for months
that most citizens have cooperated fully, offering information
about Rudolph's background and tips about his possible whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mayor and others are at a loss to explain why on a
chilly night in November several rifle rounds were fired at the
federal compound. One bullet grazed an agent inside the building
and narrowly missed another.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in the shooting and federal agents
declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack. A few days
after the shooting, leaflets were distributed in town calling the
investigators ``jack-booted thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the community, theories about who fired the shots range from
Rudolph sympathizers to drunken teens or maybe a jealous husband.
Some residents say they feel agents overreacted by continuing to
press misdemeanor charges of impeding the investigation against a
local mechanic arrested the night of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Rogers, 45, admits to shining his son's toy laser on a
surveillance helicopter as it flew over his house. Agents said they
thought it was a laser-targeting device used on sharpshooting
rifles. Rogers was quickly swarmed by at least 10 agents who threw
him to the ground and handcuffed him, recalls Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it was a dumb thing to do,'' says Rogers, a life-long
resident of Andrews, who says he was not aware of the shooting at
the time. ``But I was just playing with my little boy's toy laser
he got for his birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were led the day after the Birmingham blast to
this rugged area where Cherokee and Macon counties. The
registration for a gray Nissan pickup truck seen near the clinic
was traced to Rudolph, who rented a mobile home in neighboring
Murphy. He was charged Feb. 14 in the Birmingham attack. In
October, federal agents declared they had enough evidence to also
charge Rudolph in the three metro Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The last verified sighting of Rudolph immediately after the
Birmingham explosion was Jan. 30, 1998, when he rented a video,
Kull the Conqueror, in Murphy. He resurfaced briefly in July and
obtained food from a friend living in the Nantahala community.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, George Nordmann, a noted local herbalist who owns a
health food store in Andrews, waited four days before alerting
authorities. By then, Rudolph again had slipped into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, authorities said Rudolph had obtained six months'
worth of food. They think he now may be hiding in a bunker, cave or
old mine and may be running short of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he is still here,'' Woody Enderson, the FBI agent in
charge of the task force, said at a recent media briefing. ``There
is no evidence that he has left, and, as we told you before, he has
to have food, and may make a significant move to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   That move may come soon, Enderson added.
</P>
<P>
   It would be virtually impossible for the fugitive to live off
the land, especially in winter, and not be conspicuous about it,
says Burt Kornegay, a guide who has led numerous hiking and camping
trips into the mountains where Rudolph is thought to be hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's either dead and been eaten by a bear or someone is
helping him.''says Kornegay, owner of Slickrock Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   With food, the hiding places are nearly unlimited. The 30-mile
prime search area is mostly within the Nantahala National Forest.
The remote peaks are thick with stands of hardwoods, which shade
jungle-like tangles of laurel and rhododendron. Water is readily
available from a myriad of springs and creeks.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, a private plane piloted by the father of an
agent flying to visit his son crashed into the remote ridges. The
plane has yet to be found, despite an intense air search.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't find something as big as an airplane that is
fixed in one place, what makes people think it would be so easy to
find a person who can move around?'' asks former Cherokee County
Sheriff Jack Thompson. Part of the search has concentrated on
trying to locate abandoned mines and caves in the area. Darren
Free, a Hendersonville, N.C., spelunker is assisting agents in
their search for old mines.
</P>
<P>
   Free says there are about 300 mines in the area, most of them
abandoned pits for digging mica, gold, corundum and other minerals.
Some are narrow tunnels dug back into the mountain, he adds, and
would provide excellent hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be very stressful on the agents,'' says Lee
Colwell, former associate director of the FBI and now director of
the University of Arkansas Criminal Justice Institute. ``They know
they are very vulnerable to him. In many ways he has the upper
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rudolph is receiving aid from an area resident, it does not
surprise Mark Potok, who helps track hate groups for the Southern
Poverty Law Center. Intelligence gathered by the Montgomery civil
rights organization indicates that western North Carolina is a
``center of anti-government activity,'' along with the Ozark
Mountains in Arkansas and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Potok contends that most of these people moved into the area
because ``there are few minorities there, it's very white. It's
rural. There's a lot of privacy. And it's the Bible belt and they
feel comfortable there.'' But Andrews Police Chief Clay Hardin, who
is also a minister for Mountain View Baptist Church, says just
because many residents are traditional Christian conservatives does
not mean they support the tactics of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that most people in this area are conservative and
are against abortion,'' he says. ``I don't think they would cover
up for him, though. In fact, many people have been helpful (to
investigators).''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rudolph may have escaped long ago from this area.
That is the opinion of Gary Perlstein of Portland State University,
a criminologist who has studied the militant anti-abortion
movement. He thinks Rudolph may have tapped into a sort of
``underground railroad'' for militants fighting abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who may not murder a doctor, who may not blow
up a clinic, but they understand why the person did it and deep
down have some empathy with them,'' Perlstein said. ``They are the
kind of people who would help move him across the country.

 &HT;    CONGO'S GANGA VOWS TO FIGHT EXPULSION FROM IOC
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Signaling a bitter fight ahead, Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo on Thursday said he intends to oppose the
move to expel him from the International Olympic Committee over
allegations that he accepted improper payments from the Salt Lake
City bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life will I resign,'' Ganga said in an interview
published in a French newspaper. ``I will fight tooth and nail
before my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, the powerful president of the Association of National
Olympic Committees of Africa, also struck out at IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom Ganga accused of sacrificing his friends to
save himself. Ganga has been an IOC member since 1964, two years
longer than Samaranch, who has been president since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   One of six IOC members targeted for expulsion last Sunday by the
IOC executive board, Ganga, who lives in Paris, made the statements
in the Thursday edition of the French daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Samaranch) defends his skin by throwing opprobrium on the
others,'' Ganga told the newspaper. ``We had friendly relations but
if he's trying to get rid of his friends it will be dangerous for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said 40 IOC members would oppose his expulsion when a
special IOC session assembles in mid-March to consider the fate of
the accused members. A two-thirds majority -- or 75 members -- must
approve the motion to expel. If Ganga survives the March vote, it
would be a stinging defeat for Samaranch who has vowed to rid the
IOC of members accused of unethical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The members are accused of accepting nearly $800,000 worth of
goods and services from Salt Lake before the city won a vote in
1995. Under IOC rules members are not allowed to receive gifts
worth more than $150.
</P>
<P>
   One of the accused IOC members, Kenya's Charles Mukora, resigned
Wednesday, bringing the total members to leave the organization
over the scandal to four. Accusations against three other members
are still being investigated by a special IOC commission formed to
look into allegations of vote buying related to Salt Lake's
successful campaign for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said none of the benefits he derived from his visits to
Salt Lake City during the bidding process, including large medical
bills, travel assistance and help in a huge real estate investment,
were bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee records show that Ganga, 64,
received more than $200,000 from the bid committee, including
direct payments of $70,010, more than $17,000 for medical expenses
for his family, $115,000 in travel expenses and gifts and
entertainment expenses totaling more than $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that Ganga asked
for a financial favor from then-Ontario premier David Peterson
during bidding for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Norm Seagram, a
spokesman for Toronto's bid committee, said while visiting the city
in the late 1980s, Ganga asked Peterson that his son pay cheaper
tuition at York University as a Canadian resident rather than the
international student fee,, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The request was turned down, Seagram and Paul Henderson, head of
the bid committee, said. ``The premier said no,'' Seagram said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga's son, Guy, graduated from York's Glendon College in 1989.

 &HT;    CONGO'S GANGA VOWS TO FIGHT EXPULSION FROM IOC
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.

   LONDON _ Signaling a bitter fight ahead, Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo on Thursday said he intends to oppose the
move to expel him from the International Olympic Committee over
allegations that he accepted improper payments from the Salt Lake
City bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life will I resign,'' Ganga said in an interview
published in a French newspaper. ``I will fight tooth and nail
before my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, the powerful president of the Association of National
Olympic Committees of Africa, also struck out at IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom Ganga accused of sacrificing his friends to
save himself. Ganga has been an IOC member since 1964, two years
longer than Samaranch, who has been president since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   One of six IOC members targeted for expulsion last Sunday by the
IOC executive board, Ganga, who lives in Paris, made the statements
in the Thursday edition of the French daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Samaranch) defends his skin by throwing opprobrium on the
others,'' Ganga told the newspaper. ``We had friendly relations but
if he's trying to get rid of his friends it will be dangerous for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said 40 IOC members would oppose his expulsion when a
special IOC session assembles in mid-March to consider the fate of
the accused members. A two-thirds majority -- or 75 members -- must
approve the motion to expel. If Ganga survives the March vote, it
would be a stinging defeat for Samaranch who has vowed to rid the
IOC of members accused of unethical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The members are accused of accepting nearly $800,000 worth of
goods and services from Salt Lake before the city won a vote in
1995. Under IOC rules members are not allowed to receive gifts
worth more than $150.
</P>
<P>
   One of the accused IOC members, Kenya's Charles Mukora, resigned
Wednesday, bringing the total members to leave the organization
over the scandal to four. Accusations against three other members
are still being investigated by a special IOC commission formed to
look into allegations of vote buying related to Salt Lake's
successful campaign for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said none of the benefits he derived from his visits to
Salt Lake City during the bidding process, including large medical
bills, travel assistance and help in a huge real estate investment,
were bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee records show that Ganga, 64,
received more than $200,000 from the bid committee, including
direct payments of $70,010, more than $17,000 for medical expenses
for his family, $115,000 in travel expenses and gifts and
entertainment expenses totaling more than $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that Ganga asked
for a financial favor from then-Ontario premier David Peterson
during bidding for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Norm Seagram, a
spokesman for Toronto's bid committee, said while visiting the city
in the late 1980s, Ganga asked Peterson that his son pay cheaper
tuition at York University as a Canadian resident rather than the
international student fee,, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The request was turned down, Seagram and Paul Henderson, head of
the bid committee, said. ``The premier said no,'' Seagram said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga's son, Guy, graduated from York's Glendon College in 1989.

TRIUMPHAL HOMECOMING  
 BACK FROM THE BRINK

 (ATTN: Utah)  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Tony Bui was only 2 when his family fled
Vietnam in 1975 shortly before the fall of Saigon. He grew up in
Sunnyvale, Calif., and studied film at Loyola Marymount University
in Los Angeles. When he was 19, he returned to Vietnam for two
weeks to visit ailing relatives. ``I hated it,'' he recalled. ``I
hated the dust, the heat, the humidity. I hated the fact that my
grandfather didn't have a real toilet. I was very ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to California, driving from San Francisco to
Sunnyvale in Silicon Valley, Bui found he couldn't get Vietnam out
of his head. ``I kept smelling Vietnam; I could hear the traffic,''
he said. ``It sounds strange, I know, but something happened. I
knew I had to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui returned to Vietnam several times, staying with his
relatives, learning Vietnamese and eventually making a 30-minute
film, ``Yellow Lotus,'' based on a journal he kept. The movie,
about a poor fisherman who comes to Ho Chi Minh City, won awards at
several film festivals. That success led Bui, 26, to create a a
more ambitious drama, ``Three Seasons,'' the first full-length
American film shot in Vietnam since the war there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Seasons,'' which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival
here, is to be released by October Films in April. Costing less
than $2 million, the English-language movie includes a mostly
Vietnamese cast but also features Harvey Keitel, whose involvement
was vital in getting it made. Keitel plays a returning Vietnam
veteran searching for a daughter he has never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The film, loosely based on characters Bui had seen or met, is
essentially about today's Vietnam in the midst of transition and
focuses on several disparate people. These include a cyclo driver
obsessed with a prostitute, a boy hustling watches and cheap
lighters, a girl hired to assist a reclusive spiritual master, and
Keitel's character.
</P>
<P>
   Bui, whose father was an officer in the Vietnamese air force
during the war, said filming was arduous. The 60 crew members _
half Vietnamese, half American _ were distrustful and hostile to
one another at first but eventually became friends. More
problematic, he said, was the Vietnamese government, which 4ept an
official, who often clashed with the director, on the film set at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many arguments and many threats of being shut
down,'' Bui said. ``You can't shoot a single frame of film without
a censor being with you.'' The government objected, of course, to
some material depicting poverty and prostitution, but some of the
concerns seemed odd.
</P>
<P>
   When the color red appeared in a scene, officials often
objected, saying it was a negative comment on communism. When a
character with a deformed face talked of being a poet at 21, the
officials strenuously objected because they felt it was a negative
comment on Ho Chi Minh, who took up his life's work at 21. Bui
changed the reference to 23.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally showed the full film as a courtesy to the
Vietnamese authorities several months ago, he was nervous. ``I was
freaked out,'' he said. ``If they didn't like it, they could ban me
from coming back. But they were so moved. They stood up and
congratulated me. They said it rang true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui said he would keep returning to Vietnam. ``My sensibilities
are American, but what I am is Vietnamese,'' he said. ``I think a
lot of my life will be trying to determine what I am.''
</P>

   Back From the Brink
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days before flying to Salt Lake City to drive to the
Sundance Film Festival, where she is appearing in two films, Ally
Sheedy was honored by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for
her performance last year in Lisa Cholodenko's drama ``High Art.''
Ms. Sheedy shared the top women's acting prize with Fernanda
Montenegro of ``Central Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy, a one-time member of the Brat Pack of the 1980s and
a star of movies like ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's
Fire,'' was stunned at the award. Before ``High Art,'' the career
of the 36-year-old actress had gone into such a downward spiral
that she thought of giving up acting, because she was barely
earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blindsided by the award; there were people in the
audience like Joan Allen and Bill Murray and Steven Spielberg,''
said Ms. Sheedy, seated in a Park City hotel room. ``To have come
from this place where I couldn't even get on a bad television
sitcom two years ago, where my agents at William Morris fired me
because I wasn't earning enough, where I felt just two years ago
like a washed-up, down-and-out, can't-get-arrested, teeny-bopper
actress _ it was mind-boggling for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy's intense performance in ``High Art'' as a
middle-aged, drug-addicted lesbian photographer has advanced her
career and certainly buoyed her confidence. But the scripts are
still not rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know; I think parts will come from strange places,''
said Ms. Sheedy, a likable and friendly woman who lives in New
York. She said the one positive turn in her personal life in recent
years was meeting David Lansbury, an actor whom she married, and
having a daughter, Rebecca, who is 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy plays disparate roles in her two films at Sundance.
In Allison Anders' ``Sugar City,'' a comedy-drama about the music
business, she portrays, as she put it, ``a very neurotic, very
successful production designer who can't find a good man in
Hollywood.'' In Steven Maler's ``Autumn Heart,'' she plays a
daughter of Tyne Daly in a family drama set across the class divide
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy is also set to start production next month for an NBC
drama, ``Our Guys,'' based on the true story of the sexual assault
of a retarded girl by members of a high school football team in
Glen Ridge, N.J. Ms. Sheedy plays a police detective. She said the
role, a good one, was probably the direct result of ``High Art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know why they offered this part to me,'' she
said. ``They usually give these parts to television stars, and I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy spoke candidly about the near-collapse of her career.
``I was no longer commercially viable,'' she said. ``The movies I
was making weren't making money. And there's a certain point in the
road if you're an actress in Hollywood who becomes well known in
your early 20s that you have to really sell yourself. You should
become very glamorous and sell the sex appeal thing and start doing
fashion spreads in magazines and wearing certain clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was advised to do it,'' she said. ``It seems so trivial
talking about it now, but it was a huge obstacle for me. I really
felt there was nothing about me that could carry all that off. And
I was told I was either too fat or too thin and not beautiful
enough. I felt there was something really wrong with me. It was so
hard to keep some perspective. And from the way I was raised as a
kid _ my mother is a militant feminist _ there was no way I could
do any of this.'' (Ms. Sheedy's mother, Charlotte Sheedy, is a
literary agent in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy worked in theater for a while and earned a living
working on television shows that were mostly forgettable. The fact
that she had played in all those adolescent films dogged her. ``I
was typecast in a dismissive way,'' she said. ``Who knew if I had
any talent?''
</P>
<P>
   Her banishment by the William Morris Agency after she failed to
get a job in a television pilot left Ms. Sheedy devastated. ``I
can't tell you how horrific it was,'' she said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, she heard about the part in ``High Art'' from
Rachel Wein, her sister-in-law, who had just been promoted as an
agent at the Don Buchwald agency, which now represents Ms. Sheedy.
She phoned Ms. Cholodenko at her New York apartment and left a
message pleading for an audition. Ms. Cholodenko, a film editor of
art movies turned director, had never heard of Ms. Sheedy, who was
given the part after an audition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Sheedy's performance was acclaimed by critics,
``High Art'' has been seen by a relatively small audience. This
makes it uncertain whether Ms. Sheedy will be nominated next month
for an Academy Award, although she said with a laugh that her
neighbors in New York insisted she would be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy said she still thought with fear of how her
professional life would have evolved had she not been cast in
``High Art.'' She said slowly: ``I don't know what else I could do
but act. I was in my 30s. I was untrained to do anything else. It
was the part of a lifetime for me. I owe so much to it.''

 &HT;    The marquee at Las Vegas' hot new gambling palace Bellagio
flashes: ``Vincent Van Gogh! Henri Matisse!'' Whatever happened to
Wayne Newton?
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Colleen Newblom admitted that she had drunk too many
Lemon Drops. But that didn't stop the Reno, Nev., native and her
husband, Norman, from ordering another round of the sticky-sweet
libations as soon as they sat down for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in sequined black velvet, Mrs. Newblom, 69, sank into a
glove-soft ivory leather banquette, cracked open a supersized menu
and gave it a perplexed once-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a French restaurant?'' she asked her husband, who
shrugged. She turned to a neighboring diner, her blue eyes
twinkling brightly if not exactly focused. ``This is supposed to be
a French restaurant, isn't it? Better be at these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was one of the world's most celebrated French
restaurants: Le Cirque. Or, more precisely, a near-replica that's
even swankier and more intimate than the New York original.
Fashioned from the richest mahogany and the plushest fabrics,
containing a mere 80 seats, Le Cirque is a fantasy of fine dining.
</P>
<P>
   Little would you expect that just past the intricately etched
glass and mahogany front door lie row after row of nickel slot
machines, clang-clanging in a bright, smoky and vast casino.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds collide at Bellagio, the grandest and most ambitious
resort that Las Vegas has witnessed. Developer Steve Wynn, whose
Mirage and Treasure Island casinos are nearby on the Strip, has
loaded Bellagio with so many options for fine dining, entertainment
and cultural enrichment that he has effectively upped the ante on
what this tackier-than-thou gambling kingdom expects from its
glittery citadels.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn famously shifts the focus of his casino resorts away from
nuts-and-bolts gambling to sybaritic delights of luxury travel.
(His latest pleasure palace, Beau Rivage, is slated to open in
March in Biloxi, Miss.) At Bellagio, he has gone all out.
</P>
<P>
   Named for an Italian vacation town on Lake Como, this 3,005-room
hotel conjures European glamour with mosaic-tiled floors, expanses
of rosy marble and a palatial conservatory filled with exotic
plants. In the lobby, a 2,000-square-foot canopy of free-form blown
glass by Dale Chihuly bathes new arrivals in the serene light of
expensive taste.
</P>
<P>
   Everything here boasts highbrow marque value. Along the vaulted
marble Via Bellagio are boutiques for Chanel, Prada, Giorgio
Armani, Tiffany &AMP; Co. and Gucci. Cirque du Soleil's underwater
spectacle, ``O,'' has a permanent stage here through 2010. In front
of the building, arching fountains erupt every hour, timing their
jets to a Luciano Pavarotti performance of ``Rondine al Nido.''
</P>
<P>
   The top names in American dining have set up shop as well,
effectively doubling the number of fine-dining rooms in the city.
Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque also brought a branch of his Italian
concept, Osteria del Circo. There are clones of Boston's favorite
Mediterranean restaurant, Olives, and San Francisco's stunning
new-age seafood place, Aqua. Superchef Jean-Georges Vongerichten
contributes a cutting-edge steakhouse, Prime, to the mix. Bellagio
even lured one of the country's top chefs, Julian Serrano of Masa's
in San Francisco, to run the show at Picasso, a restaurant where
seven of the Spanish master's canvases hang on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   How does Serrano feel about leaving Babylon by the Bay for
Gomorrah in the Desert? ``I miss San Francisco, but I like it
here,'' he says, pointing firmly at the funky geometric carpet
designed by Claude Picasso, the painter's son. ``The Bellagio. It's
a safe house.'' And the city? No comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio's restaurant program is only matched in audacity by its
fine art museum, a feature that Wynn financed when his investors
balked. Throughout the day, visitors queue up for an hour or more
to take the $14 tour of the approximately two dozen prominent
artworks by European masters, among them Cezanne, Modigliani, Miro,
Degas and Renoir. If you're lucky at the tables _ really, really
lucky _ most of the paintings are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In Wynn's world, these artists are the real headliners. Their
names even flash on Bellagio's marquee: ``Vincent van Gogh! Henri
Matisse!'' Whatever happened to Wayne Newton?
</P>
<P>
   With such touches, you'll never mistake Bellagio for a Venetian
palazzo. Despite the $1.8 billion spent on the property, there
remains a degree of Vegas cheesiness. Marble walls are topped with
fake wallpaper cornices; plastic bathroom tissue boxes are gilded
with gold spray paint. And you can never get to your room without
trudging through the maw of the casino, because at heart that's
Bellagio's raison d'etre: the double down.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn understands that Bellagio's appeal has to cut across income
levels for this new-style resort to thrive. Yes, there are villas
with private lap pools and personal butlers as well as magnificent
suites with soaring ceilings. There are also perfectly nice rooms
that go for as low as $99 during the winter holidays. And though
Bellagio courts high-stakes gamblers, there are just as many nickel
slots here as anywhere in Vegas, and just as many little old ladies
parked in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn also knows that any Las Vegas resort has to have a theme.
If New York, New York has a faux Coney Island and the Luxor a
sphinx, Bellagio offers a vision of Euroclass. Some high spenders
come to indulge and some penny-ante folk to gawk. Both are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are these two sides of the experience more apparent than
at Le Cirque. Inside, a trio of well-heeled young men wash down 6
ounces of Russian caviar with a 1970 Chateau Lafite Rothschild.
While out front, Colleen Deralto, a schoolteacher from Mesa, Ariz.,
pumps a lucky nickel into a slot machine lit up with the name
Filthy Rich.
</P>
<P>
   Deralto hits the jackpot. Bells clang, the cherry-top light
flashes, and an attendant arrives with a master key to lock the
machine and cash out the winnings: $63.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Colleen and husband Andrew will spend their jackpot at
Le Cirque?
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' she laughs, ``We couldn't afford that.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. An ounce of caviar at Le Cirque, a mere nibble,
costs $65.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Delta's lowest fare for nonstop flights to Las
Vegas is $295 round trip (off-peak hours only), with a seven-day
advance purchase and a minimum two-night stay. Seven other airlines
match that fare but include connecting flights.

 &HT;    Fine dining finds place at Las Vegas tables
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Talk about arid, colorless and void. For years the
Las Vegas dining scene was a bad joke of all-you-can-eat buffets,
cheap steaks and rubber-chicken banquets.
</P>
<P>
   But now that this once-and-future gambling mecca is also the
fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country (with a population
exceeding 1 million) and a major convention destination, true fine
dining has finally emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Puck led the pack when he opened a satellite of Spago,
his benchmark L.A. restaurant, in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.
Jean-Louis Palladin (formerly at the Watergate Hotel in Washington)
opened Napa, a cutting-edge eatery in the Rio, and proved Vegas was
ready for world-class restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the town awaits the imminent arrival of Charles
Palmer (the chef from Aureole in New York) at Mandalay Bay and
Joachim Splichal (Patina in L.A.) at the Venetian.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, everyone's talking about Bellagio and its boggling
lineup of restaurants. I managed to hit most of them during a
recent visit and, with a couple of exceptions, found them worthy of
their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of time constraints, I was unable to experience Shintaro
or Jasmine, the sophisticated Japanese and Chinese spots.
</P>
<P>
   PICASSO
</P>
<P>
   With so many superstar restaurants from which to choose at
Bellagio, the showcase eatery better have something remarkable to
offer. Picasso, in fact, has two: an astonishing collection of
original Picassos on the walls (valued at $37 million) and the
talents of resident chef Julian Serrano, lured from Masa's, San
Francisco's top-rated venue for fine dining.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano is Spanish, but his style of cooking is haute French
with a California palate. Time and again, he takes a classical dish
and gives it a subtle New World tweak.
</P>
<P>
   The brief menu offers a choice of a four-course prix fixe menu
with choices ($65) or a set six-course degustation menu ($87.50)
with wine pairings offered for a $57.50 surcharge. Try the
degustation if only to splurge on the fascinating wines,
precision-matched to Serrano's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   A super-crisp Prager riesling from the Wachau region in Austria
makes an ideal foil for the subtly dynamic but rich flavors of the
first course, a warm lobster salad with saffron-poached potatoes in
truffle vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes one perfect scallop _ jiggly and sweet on a cushion
of potato mousseline and a pool of satiny veal jus. A glass of
Domaine Schlumberger Pinot Gris provides another spot-on match,
fuller-bodied and with a rounder flavor as lingering and gentle as
the food.
</P>
<P>
   A crisp-edged slab of seared foie gras with lavishly truffled
madeira sauce is high-test luxury on the plate, with an elegant
botrytised late-harvest Chappelet Chenin Blanc served alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Truffles reappear in the sauce for an exceptionally tender loin
of lamb, crusted with tiny bits of cumin and caraway seed and
served with a Bruno Clair Marsannay _ a medium-bodied burgundy with
all sorts of spicy nuances integrated into the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning trio of molded apple, quince and pear sorbets takes
these flavors to the nth degree and identifies each by a sheer
crisp made from the dried fruit. Is there better sorbet on the
planet?
</P>
<P>
   All around me, guests are moaning in delight. Gloria and Jack
Sisk of Beverly Hills, Calif., claim Picasso served the best meal
they've ever eaten in Las Vegas. And they've been coming here five
or six times a year since they first saw Danny Thomas at the
Flamingo in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   LE CIRQUE
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a seat,'' says the hostess coolly, motioning to a lounge
where clearly no seat is available. Expensively turned-out people
are crowding the tiny bar three deep, as they wait for a table in
the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While Picasso, with its airy spaciousness and natural wood,
evinces a decidedly California sensibility, Le Cirque is New York
all the way. A jewel box of rich mahogany and flouncy fabric that
playfully evokes a circus big top, this satellite of the Maccioni
family's classic restaurant is where Vegas bigshots go to be
noticed. They wear fine clothes, bring beautiful dates and order
more caviar and truffles than they can finish.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is past 10:30 by the time I'm seated for my 9:45
reservation, I decide on a relatively simple meal. White asparagus
spears, glazed with cream and ringed with wild mushrooms, are so
fibrous I can't even gnaw through one, much less cut it. And I have
no opportunity to return this poor dish, since the waiter never
checks on my progress and simply whisks away the full plate without
question.
</P>
<P>
   But a cut-up roast chicken ``fermiere'' with nickel-thick slices
of black truffle under the skin is a beautiful bird _ hearty,
refined and unbelievably flavorful. Dessert is a pulpy passion
fruit soup with sorbets served in a stunning goblet that rises
higher than the crown of my head. It has remarkable purity of
flavor but is so piercingly tart I can only manage a few bites.
</P>
<P>
   While I can't fairly judge a restaurant after one meal, I'd be
disinclined to spend hard-earned cash at Le Cirque next time. But
maybe if I was lucky at the tables. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (Entrees: $28-$80; expect to spend about $100 per person before
tip.)
</P>
<P>
   OSTERIA DEL CIRCO
</P>
<P>
   This second ring of the Maccioni family circus features
homey-to-trendy Tuscan food, lower prices and an even more festive
decor than Le Cirque. Startling primary colors tent the ceiling and
outfit the waiters. Weird orbs embedded in the mahogany walls
rotate. And kinetic metal sculptures, such as a creepy monkey
riding a unicycle on a high wire, constantly demand your attention.
You feel like you've been set in a playpen under a mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The food seems to be as uneven as that at Le Cirque, though my
sense is that the homey recipes inspired by nonna Egidiana Maccioni
beat the trendy stuff by a Florentine mile. Zuppa alla frantoiana,
a 30-vegetable soup, looks like leftovers of leftovers reduced to a
sludge. But this cannily reproduced peasant fare has a flavor so
exquisite I was sad to see my mopped-clean bowl disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Circo prepares one of the least credible versions of gnocchi
I've tried. Making these potato dumplings requires a touch that the
cooks clearly don't have. Theirs are dense, gummy and arrive coated
with rawish minced thyme.
</P>
<P>
   This uneven meal ends with terrible coffee and a plate of pretty
friandises _ chocolate truffles, fruit tartelettes and thin
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Servers here keep their left hands behind their backs and
generally put on tony airs. But I didn't find them particularly
swift. Not only did my waitress neglect to tell me that one dish
had radically changed from the menu description, she didn't check
on my meal until I had given up any hope of exchanging it. And when
I asked a waiter for a glass of iced tea with my lunch, he
responded, ``How about a bottle of wine?''
</P>

   LAS VEGAS: bottle of wine?''
</P>
<P>
   PRIME
</P>
<P>
   If you find Siamese cats the most beautiful creatures in the
world, you'll love Prime _ a luxurious steakhouse decorated in pale
blue, chocolate brown and creamy beige. Bunched velvet curtains
with embroidered valances separate the tables and lend this room a
well-earned grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Though I can't fit Prime into my dining schedule, I can swing by
during dinner one evening. And the food looks stunning. Wandering
around the dining room, I espy an iced shellfish platter the size
of a manhole cover loaded with cracked lobster, shrimp, clams and
oysters. Elsewhere, there's a fat porterhouse steak and a gorgeous
salad of tomato slices stacked with basil.
</P>
<P>
   New York superchef Jean-Georges Vongerichten spices a standard
steakhouse menu with his trademark invention. If you don't want
everyday bearnaise sauce with your entree, you can get chicory,
tamarind or _ excuse me? _ caper-raisin sauces.
</P>
<P>
   (Entrees: $18-$54.)
</P>
<P>
   AQUA
</P>
<P>
   As playful as it is sophisticated, the menu at Aqua will leave
you in a fit of indecision. Should you start with the black mussel
souffle or the oyster and salsify stew? Then should you move on to
the lobster pot pie or splurge on the roasted whole foie gras with
caramelized Granny Smith apples? Maybe the best bet is to decide
after they wheel over the caviar cart.
</P>
<P>
   This contemporary seafood restaurant, a branch of Michael Mina's
San Francisco smash hit, is serious foodie fun. At its best, the
cooking stops just short of going over the top. Porcini-crusted
wild turbot with truffle mashed potatoes in mushroom-red wine sauce
sounds like a lot of mess for a piece of fish. It isn't. The
flavors don't merely combine in your mouth, they take off in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes rocket right over the top. Gorgeous spot prawns are
split and stuffed with crab meat, then sadly slathered in orange
mousseline and cloying sweet-and-sour vinaigrette. Salmon is
sweety-sweet, as well, in a mishmash of raisins, berry sauce, curry
sauce and pearl couscous.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, Aqua makes a big deal of its ``a la minute'' ice
cream service. Freshly churned ice creams are wheeled to the table
and scooped onto the plate. I found them goopy and pedestrian. Much
better is the updated root beer float with warm chocolate chip
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   (Entrees: $28-$34.)
</P>
<P>
   SAM'S AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
   With its free-form animated design and cavernous columns
suggestive of a trippy grotto, Sam's American feels like ``Blue
Velvet'' set in the Flintstones' Bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   The food follows suit: It's fun, clunky and wildly eclectic _
the kind of chow that goes down easily when you've had a few too
many.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't care for a deadly thick carrot soup with a pumpkin
custard mired in it. But I enjoyed picking at a monstrous BLT ($12)
with arugula, avocado and chipotle mayo piled sky-high on country
bread. A competent beef brisket sandwich ($11) heaped on challah is
a like a Jewish brontosaurus burger. Other items on the wild menu
include Indian-style crab cakes in carrot broth and grilled guinea
hen paillard on melted foie gras mousse with watercress salad and
plum-wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   OLIVES
</P>
<P>
   This franchise of Todd and Olivia English's Boston favorite
looks nothing like the original. Whereas the Boston restaurant is
tucked snugly into a converted townhouse, this spot opens wide onto
the Via Bellagio shopping arcade and has a shiny mosaic floor that
glints like a million diamonds in the sunlight pouring through the
windows. Just as glittery is the food, which to my taste gives the
most gustatory bang for your buck of all the Bellagio restaurants.
I'm in love with the flatbreads, which are big, misshapen ovals of
crackery-chewy pizza dough baked with inspired toppings, such as
balsamic-fig jam, prosciutto and Gorgonzola on a rosemary crust.
</P>
<P>
   At Olives, you want to splurge on the oddities because you sense
they'll work. And then you're rewarded with perfectly tender
chargrilled squid and octopus, outfitted with chickpeas and tomato
bits in a garlic-parsley vinaigrette. Or you may luck into a pearl
couscous carbonara tossed with creamed spinach, bacon and the
barest whiff of white truffle oil.
</P>
<P>
   I'm less impressed with the signature cod cakes with lobster
remoulade and Boston baked beans _ a heavy plateful that might
stick to your ribs in snowy Beantown, but here just sticks to your
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   (Entrees: $19-$27.)
</P>
<P>
   BUFFET
</P>
<P>
   No Las Vegas hotel would be complete without a buffet, and
Bellagio has one of the grandest, serving lunch, dinner and weekend
brunch. At brunch ($18.50) you can count on everything from freshly
tossed salads to customized omelettes, peel-and-eat shrimp and
smoked fish. There are also some trendier dishes (grapefruit
macerated with kaffir lime leaf) and unusual offerings for
international customers (a rice gruel bar). The amazing La Brea
bakery breads are in abundance, and the restaurants donate to the
gourmet dessert bar. Just don't expect Southern comforts: Soupy
grits and shotput biscuits disappoint.

 &HT;    For neophyte, a windfall leads to monkey business
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 31
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ During my first hour in Sin City, I was eating
Chinese noodles at a casino restaurant when I glanced down at the
floor and saw a fat, green wad.
</P>
<P>
   Omigod. One, two, three, four, five, six! $20 bills. Some old,
some new. All legal tender.
</P>
<P>
   A woman at the next table took an immediate interest in this Las
Vegas moment. After trying to bargain for a cut, she dissuaded me
from handing it over to the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kid, you're in Vegas,'' she chuckled. ``You give that to the
waiter, it's a tip. And if there's someone who can lose that kind
of money, they won't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching my ill-gotten wad, I realized what it was: gambling
cash. Free gambling cash.
</P>
<P>
   I slurped down lunch and wandered into the casino. What, where
and how would I wager this windfall? Craps? Blackjack? Poker? I
hadn't considered any of these games since my last ninth-grade
sleepover.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw Banana-Rama.
</P>
<P>
   A slot machine disguised as a video game, Banana-Rama features a
little cartoon monkey and an orangutan staring imploringly from
under a coconut tree. I touched the orangutan; it giggled. I
touched the little monkey and a coconut fell on its head. I was
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   The machine accepts ones, fives, tens, twenties and hundreds for
$1 wagers. I slipped a twenty into the slot and pressed the
touch-screen button. Bananas spun across the screen. I kept
pressing, and the fruit kept spinning until something remarkable
happened: triple bananas landed on the pay line. A bongo fanfare
erupted, and the monkeys went berserk _ screeching, flipping over,
climbing the tree and leaping down. They were in banana heaven, and
I had won $100. I cashed out and traded my heavy cup of tokens for
one crisp Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The first moral of this story (there are two) is that today's
Las Vegas has more temptation than ever for the gaming neophyte.
</P>
<P>
   Modern slot machines are, in essence, high-tech video games
powered by microprocessors. If you get bored with the monkeys, you
access a menu and switch to an Arabian Nights motif, or let a pair
of eerie, detached hands deal blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   If one game of video poker bores you, you can draw five hands at
once. And nearly all the games have surprise bonus rounds that
unleash a new video landscape. If you play Fort Knox long enough,
you will eventually get the combination to the safe and be led into
the inner recesses of the compound to choose a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   Even the traditional one-armed bandits are now driven by
computer chips rather than spring-coiled reels. All feed
information into central mainframe computers, some into citywide
networked jackpots. One such network of slots, called Megabucks, is
the talk of the town since a local woman won $27 million and change
with a lucky pull.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to move past slots into the hard stuff, casinos are
all too happy to oblige; they place gaming instruction booklets in
the hotel rooms. During my four days in Las Vegas, I never did try
one of the card tables or the roulette wheel, figuring that was a
place I didn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I was spending too much time getting to know the slots.
One evening at the MGM Grand, I pumped quarters for nearly two
hours into Fort Knox waiting to unlock the safe. My big payoff was
a measly $6.25.
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is the second moral of this story: Win
early, and you're hooked. I forced myself to quit after squandering
$70 on Arabian Nights, Double Diamond, Monopoly, Wheel of Fortune
and every game in between.
</P>
<P>
   I left Vegas with about $150 of combined findings and winnings.
But I still think I should've given that money to the waiter in the
first place.

LIBRARY TREASURES, BOUND FOR ETERNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When is a book more than a book? Anytime it does its
job, you might well answer. That is, when its contents awaken the
mind with some combination of guidance, insight, knowledge and
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But there are concrete ways that books can be more than books:
when they combine aspects of painting, sculpture and architecture
to become works of visual art.
</P>
<P>
   Books of this sort are the subject of a sumptuous exhibition at
the Morgan Library that ranges through more than nine centuries,
from medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and early printed books,
through an extraordinary array of fine bindings from different
countries, periods and styles, to modern, mostly English
private-press books and livres d'artistes. They all come from the
collection of Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a lifelong
bibliophile.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 30 years Sir Paul has built a collection that is
considered one of the world's best, especially for being top-heavy
with important volumes in unusually fine condition. It reflects
what can happen when money is no object, and taste, expertise and
focus are similarly abundant.
</P>
<P>
   His collection is housed at Wormsley, Sir Paul's estate in
Chiltern, outside London, in a mongrel structure that seems the
outcome of several centuries of expansion and remodeling: Doric
columns here, crennelation there, a round tower elsewhere. The new
building (the show includes an architect's model) and the
collection it holds are known as the Wormsley Library.
</P>
<P>
   The 110 or so books at the Morgan are a small percentage of the
collection, but they include many of its high points; they form by
far the largest group of books to leave Wormsley at one time since
Sir Paul began assembling his treasures.
</P>
<P>
   He selected this sampler, working with the library's curators,
Bryan Maggs and Robert J.D. Harding, and with L. George Fletcher,
who until September was the curator of printed books and bindings
at the Morgan and is now director for special collections at the
New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all these items are sure to delight or enlighten, and
quite a few may inspire speechless awe. Here, for example, is a
fragment of what is considered the oldest manuscript in England, a
30-line page from a history of the Christian church written in the
middle of the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a pristine copy of the 1462 Mainz Latin Bible,
published seven years after Gutenberg's, with an improved version
of Gothica Textura (or Black Letter) type that remains crisply
legible today. And there is a copy of the first printed edition of
Chaucer, compiled and published by William Caxton in 1476; Sir Paul
acquired it in July.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes arcane material is made more accessible by
informative labels whose headings can have an emphatic,
journalistic sound. ``The Only Bookbinding Designed by Robert
Adam'' reads one. ``A Binding by Jean Grolier's Last Binder'' says
another, referring to the 16th-century bibliophile.
</P>
<P>
   A third identifies a five-volume Bible bound in 1906 for the
Doves Press by Katharine Adams as ``One of the Very Best Specimens
of Tooled Binding.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time this display is reached, attentive viewers will have
seen enough in the way of leather bindings _ tooled, gilded and
stamped; inlaid, onlaid or painted; overdone, clumsy or refined _
to understand that Adams' elegant arrangement of dotted and solid
interlocking circles and arcs is indeed sublime.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning the word was God's, and all books were rare.
Before Gutenberg, and even after, books were painstakingly made by
hand, usually in a king's or abbot's scriptorium, and most of them
pertained to religion, whether they were works of philosophy or the
Bibles, psalters, graduals and books of hours for daily worship.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition beautifully captures the various minglings of
printed texts and images, with hand coloring, illumination and even
calligraphy that persisted in the two centuries after Gutenberg. In
addition to its crisp new type, for example, the 1462 Mainz Bible
includes exquisite illuminated initials whose long tendrils trail
gently down the page.
</P>
<P>
   The show is laid out in roughly chronological order. In the
first several vitrines, images predominate: books are shown
primarily as repositories for mostly religious images. They glow
with gold, color and devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Seven rare leaves from a lost manuscript known as the
Burckhardt-Wildt Apocalypse (circa 1290) show a soul being saved: a
woman first seen as beset by demons and snakes and covered by sores
(as well as a brilliant orange blanket) becomes a bride of Christ,
dressed in white, and is then depicted with her arms raised in
ecstatic devotion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the collection's high points, the Ottobeuren Gradual
(circa 1164), is open to an image of Jesus on an aqua cross flanked
by Mary and St. Paul, shown on a perfect plane of shining gold. On
the opposite page is an illuminated initial T (of ``Te igitur,'' or
``Thou therefore'') festooned with decorative vines, the cruciform
of the alphabet as stylized tree.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of the revival of antiquity that would
eventually lead to the Renaissance. One of the largest, most
gorgeous books here is the Ulm Pytolemy of 1482, the third European
edition of the Egyptian astronomer's atlas ``Cosmographia.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the first edition of this work published north of the
Alps, as well as the first to use woodblock printing instead of
engraving. Printed on vellum and hand colored, it is confident and
tentative in equal portions. Its oceans are lapis, its rivers gold
leaf, but the Indian Ocean is shown with a southern shore labeled
``terra incognita.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of the bookbinders' art are touched on here in
12th- and 13th-century books that have bindings of crudely cut
leather or tawed deerskin or sheepskin that is still on the fuzzy
side. These set the stage for the show's center section, dominated
by the book as object, a six-surface opportunity for decoration. It
is here that the lay person's knowledge of bookbinding and its
development in terms of craft and style can expand exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   One gains a working knowledge of the variety of gilding tools by
studying the repeating patterns and details of these surfaces: the
undergrowth of stylized plant life, the gently molecular fields of
stipling and the penchant for architectural motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Some covers look like elaborate ceiling designs, others like
whole rooms, among them, the grand scheme of John Whittaker's 1816
binding for the Magna Carta, presented to the Prince Regent on the
600th anniversary of its signing. The deep borders surrounding the
royal coat of arms run from rococo scrolls to Gothic arches, the
latter looking like nothing less than walls full of windows.
</P>
<P>
   Common words take on new meanings. ``Cottage roof'' refers to
the gablelike diagonals that cap some binding designs, and ``drawer
pull'' to the ubiquitous eyebrow or downturned-mouth motif. (It is
deployed most effectively on a Bible bound in the English
Restoration style, ``picked out'' in black stain on red goatskin
gilt and with silver paint.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Strapwork'' denotes the designs of interlocking, usually black
bands that wind through many binding designs; ``gauffering,'' the
patterns and images sometimes found on the edges of a book's closed
pages (including the Restoration Bible).
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, where the 19th and 20th centuries dominate, the
books' interiors and exteriors are equally prominent. And the show
in some ways comes full circle, as the intricate illuminations and
beautiful calligraphy of the Middle Ages are restored to some of
their former glory during the English Gothic Revival and the Arts
and Crafts movement, continuing into Art Nouveau, Art Deco and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent works is Paul Bonet's 1957 design for
Alphonse Daudet's 1937 ``Aventures Prodigieuses de Tartarin de
Tarascon,'' with 34 decorated initials by Raoul Dufy. It features a
flamelike lion's head depicted in fiery leathers, not unlike the
``Lion King'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   This section is full of show stoppers. Francis Bedford's binding
for Henry Shaw's 1860 ``Dresses and Decorations of the Middle
Ages'' is appropriately medieval, replete with clasps, gauffering
and imitation jewels in ormolu mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it fades in comparison with Sangorski and Sutcliffe's
extravagant 1913 binding for a volume of Keats, a carefully
orchestrated riot of gems, pearls, contrasting leathers and gilt.
</P>
<P>
   For chasteness there's the green goatskin gilt binding that
Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson, founder of the Doves Press, designed
for William Morris' copy of the first French translation of Marx's
``Capital.'' A pattern of stylized leaves and clouds of stipling
form a cover that is consistent with its author's critique of
industrialization, at least in principle.
</P>
<P>
   Even more restrained is the gilded white pigskin binding that
Cobden-Sanderson designed for the great Chaucer edition brought out
by Morris' Kelmscott Press in 1896. It is paired with a second
Kelmscott Chaucer in the Getty collection whose open title page
shows Morris' roiling foliate patterns at their most dense.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no going back. The books at the beginning of this
exhibition represented the prevailing states of knowledge, book
technology and religious faith of their time. They pushed history
before them, and they have its urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The books at the end are expressions of increasingly marginal
passions and obsessions. Reviving once-essential crafts, they are
undeniably beautiful but also anachronistic, drifting at the edges
of the great stream of books that Gutenberg unleashed.

 &HT;    Bit by bit, Lamott has forged a vision of humane spirituality
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Lamott, author of the quirky new ``Traveling Mercies: Some
Thoughts on Faith,'' is reverent in a free-spirit, leftist-liberal,
recovering-addict, single-mom kind of way. She doesn't walk gently
toward a state of grace; she ``staggers.'' She doesn't have a leap
of faith; she has a ``lurch.'' And if religion and humor are not
traditionally interwoven, well, they should be, says the
44-year-old California author and online essayist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think being religious means that you can't also be
funny,'' Lamott says. ``And if God's not funny, then I'm not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamott wrote four novels before her first book of nonfiction _
``Operating Instructions,'' a journal of her son's first year _
sold 100,000 copies in 1993. A year later, her second book of
nonfiction, ``Bird by Bird,'' sold 200,000 copies. Subtitled ``Some
Instructions on Writing and Life,'' that book made her something of
a cult figure among writers and readers _ ``a rock idol of the
literary world,'' one bookseller put it _ and made it possible for
her to quit teaching weekly writing classes, cleaning houses,
teaching tennis, waitressing and writing restaurant reviews. In
1997, she began writing biweekly essays for the hip online magazine
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Through those essays and her nonfiction books, readers have
followed Lamott through the death of her father, the birth of her
son, Sam (now 9 1/2), the death of her best friend, her eating
disorder, drug and alcohol addictions, loves lost quickly or en-
</P>
<P>
   dured too long, rampant neuroses, bad thigh days and religious
epiphanies. Clean and sober since 1986, the writer has learned to
bow her dreadlocked head and prey on the insecurities that once
threatened to destroy her. From her home near San Francisco _ which
she shares with her son, a dog, a cat, an iguana and a goldfish _
she took a few minutes to talk about her ``very ordinary'' life,
her inspiration and her ``Traveling Mercies,'' a uniquely Lamottian
mix of painful insight and laugh-out-loud confessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a single interesting theological thought in my
head,'' Lamott says. ``I don't understand very much, and I don't
have a position I want to get people to. All I can do is tell
people my own truth and my own version of things, and that tends to
come out kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does it help or hurt a writer to actually have some financial
success?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it makes life a lot easier. It's a relief not to always
be sweating where the rent's coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your daily writing routine?
</P>
<P>
   A: I try to sit down at the same time every morning _ 9 o'clock
_ and work until about 11:30. Then I stop and take a break until
about 1. I'll walk my dog, eat, catch up and hang out, check in on
the impeachment proceedings. . . . Then I work until a quarter to
3, when I leave to pick up my son from school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has motherhood changed your writing?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's certainly a lot more efficient before you have children,
when you're only responsible for yourself. But it so profoundly
changed me as a person, in terms of changing the whole geography of
my heart and my spirituality . . . it gave me a depth that I was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the idea for ``Traveling Mercies'' come about?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been on a book tour every year since 1993, and
everywhere I went people were really glad to talk about writing,
but I noticed that they also really wanted to ask me about faith,
to tell me about their own faith or to express appreciation that
somebody on the left was a person of faith, that somebody who was
not conservative or Moral Majority was talking out loud about God
and faith and religion. I just started to feel there was a real
hunger in the world _ even in the reading world _ for somebody like
me to talk about these things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of things do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A: I used to read really wonderful, esoteric, fresh new voices .
. . and then I had a kid. . . . I'm secretly looking forward to the
new John Grisham _ none of my friends would ever cop to reading
John Grisham. I just finished reading ``King of the Gypsies,'' a
25-year-old book by Peter Maas, and I'm reading ``The Orchid
Thief'' by Susan Orlean. . . . And I read The New Yorker and the
New York Observer religiously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concept of family _ in the broadest possible sense _ has
always seemed important to you. Have there always been people
around you to serve that function?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always understood that the secret of life is friendship.
Everything else can come and go, but if you have a strong community
of support around you, your fortunes can change and you'll still be
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The chapter on your aging mother in ``Traveling Mercies''
surely will touch a chord with a lot of readers. That had to be
difficult to write.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was difficult to write, and it was difficult for her to
read. Our relationship is imperfect and it always was. . . . I'm
not like my mother much at all, but I'm very devoted to her and
have put a lot of time into this relationship. It's just what it
is. . . . I think she was really grateful for a daughter who could
tell the truth and love her and be loved by her for what is rather
than for the great fantasies we had all those years _ what it
should be like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're obviously very close to your son, whom you write so
much about. Does he have any problem with people knowing so many
details of his life?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always check with him before I write something. I make sure
he doesn't mind, to cover myself in any future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, what inspires you as a writer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's wonderful when writers tell the truth and help
me understand life a little more. I try to do that myself. . . .
When a writer makes me laugh or catches me by surprise, that always
inspires me to do it myself.

 &HT;    Crittenden's credo: Only unhappy victors in battle of the sexes
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday Jan. 31.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   &QR;  What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us. By Danielle Crittenden. Simon
&AMP; Schuster. $23. 224 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls are taken every day, and not infrequently the
findings of yesterday's poll contradict the findings of today's.
People are fickle. And sometimes they just change their minds. But
for some odd reason a poll from the '70s sticks in my mind. It set
out to determine who was happiest: married men, married women,
unmarried men or unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
   This one, I thought, was loaded: sex and marital status lined up
like coordinates on a graph, with happiness the elusive variable.
You knew, whether by intuition or from experience, how it was going
to come out. Happiest were the single women. Next happiest were
married men. Then came married women, and the burden of the
findings _ their details now forgotten _ was that they were not all
that happy. Finally, a sad group of puppies if ever there was one,
the single men.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway knew that men without women reverted to animal
instincts. So did James Dickey and James Jones.
</P>
<P>
   You don't read much about women without men. Maybe there's a
reason. On both sides of the equation, the notion of need is
implicit: A man is lost on his own; a woman on her own gets along
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Generalizations go only so far, and there are many exceptions to
this one. But most people would recognize in it a certain truth.
Some might even recognize themselves, past or present.
</P>
<P>
   How is it, then, that so much is written about women's
happiness, so little about men's?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, progress
</P>
<P>
   The subtitle of Danielle Crittenden's book ``What Our Mothers
Didn't Tell Us'' is ``Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman.''
Well, why does it? They marry and have children at a later age than
their mothers and grandmothers did. They're studying subjects other
than education and nursing (almost half the students in medical
school are women). At the office, they're managers and get to go to
the meetings just like men. What's not to be happy about?
</P>
<P>
   They're not happy, Crittenden says, because they got sold a bill
of goods. All you have to lose is your chains, feminists told them,
but they instead lost their moorings:
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the ripping down of barriers that has taken place over
a generation, we may have inadvertently also smashed the
foundations necessary for our happiness. Pretending that we are the
same as men _ with similar needs and desires _ has only led many of
us to find out, brutally, how different we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is neither a revelation nor, in its essentials, a new
argument. ``The truth,'' Sally Quinn wrote more than 10 years ago,
``is that many women have come to see the feminist movement as
anti-male, anti-child, anti-family, anti-feminine. And therefore it
has nothing to do with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A man is wise to leave this issue alone, but opinion surveys
have documented that most women do not identify themselves as
feminists (in 1980, more women voted for Ronald Reagan than for
Jimmy Carter). The label is self-limiting and they don't like it.
They like professional feminists even less. But if radical feminism
is passe, it's because all of us _ or nearly all of us _ are
members of the faith. We believe in equal pay for equal work, in
equal opportunity under the law, in marriage as partnership and not
property management. The war's over, and the right side won.
</P>
<P>
   Yet poll after poll also confirms the feeling among women that
they are the junior partners in the marriage, and that they
submerge a part of themselves in their husband's life and career.
Pulled one way by work, pulled the other by family, they cannot
give themselves fully to either.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Men don't either. Hence the conundrum of happiness.
Why is it that women's happiness should matter more than men's?
</P>
<P>
   Happiness as privilege
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden _ a journalist and founder of The Women's Quarterly,
a wife and mother _ has no answer. She is a shrewd, often witty
analyst of our contemporary social arrangements and a lucid writer
in a field populated by preachers and charlatans. If she is a
kinder, gentler Dr. Laura, she's also a more intellectually
grounded one. Women would be happier if they had their children
earlier, she tells us, and began a career outside the home in
midlife.
</P>
<P>
   What is of greater interest is the assumption that happiness is
the right of one sex and the privilege of the other, the fulcrum on
which the two find their balance. Only Americans could think this
way. The pursuit of happiness is not only written into their
national charter but encoded in their psyche.
</P>
<P>
   And yet happiness _ however we construe it _ or marital status
might have nothing to do with any of this. Relations between the
sexes have changed drastically in the 35 years since Crittenden was
born, mostly for the better. Human nature changes more slowly. If
the fruits of feminism have not been as sweet as advertised, it is
not only women who had expected something more.

`SHE'S ALL RIHT': WHEN `PYGMALION' METS MTV, THE BOOKWORM TURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how much the world changes, the caste system of a
typical American high school seems inviolable. The jocks,
cheerleaders and pretty people rule, while the nerds, bookworms and
arty types remain the untouchables.
</P>
<P>
   But in Hollywood, at least, there's always the outside chance
that an outcast Cinderella will remove her glasses, put on a chic
party dress and be discovered by Prince Charming. That's sort of
what happens to Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook), a bespectacled,
extremely earnest art student at an upscale Los Angeles high
school, in Robert Iscove's wispy romantic comedy ``She's All
That.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly out of the blue one day, Laney finds herself avidly
pursued by Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the school's handsome senior
class president and star soccer player. Because she's smart, she
senses something fishy.
</P>
<P>
   Zack's sudden interest in Laney isn't exactly altruistic. Having
been unceremoniously dumped by his snooty girlfriend Taylor (Jodi
Lyn O'Keefe) for a self-centered clown named Brock (Matthew
Lillard), who is featured on the MTV series ``The Real World,''
Zack finds himself dateless for the senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   When Zack's pal Dean (Paul Walker) bets him he can't turn the
gawkiest, geekiest girl in his class into a prom queen in just two
weeks, Zack takes up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' is essentially a formulaic comedy, but it has
enough glimmerings of originality and wit to make you wish it were
much bolder and funnier than it turns out to be. Among other
targets, the movie takes pointed aim at the MTV mystique as it is
embodied by the evil Taylor, who flounces about spitting outrageous
venom, and the goofily narcissistic Brock, who would rather watch
himself on a movie-size television screen than succumb to Taylor's
slavering advances.
</P>
<P>
   The film has short fantasy sequences that parody MTV's ``Real
World'' and ``Spring Break.'' And come the prom, this movie, which
has never really had its feet on the ground, takes leave of reality
altogether and lets its senior class members break into an
elaborate choreographed line dance enhanced by a psychedelic light
show. It also employs a student disk jockey (Usher Raymond) as a
part-time commentator who disseminates gossip on the school's
public-address system in a modified rap style.
</P>
<P>
   If ``She's All That'' has the trappings of a Cinderella story
(Laney undergoes a spectacular makeover supervised by Zack's
sister), its heroine is no abject ugly duckling transformed into a
radiantly passive swan.
</P>
<P>
   Very early in their courtship, Laney puts Prince Charming
through his paces at a performance art event in which she is
participating. Coaxed into doing an impromptu solo, in which he
tosses around a beanbag and improvises a soliloquy, Zack joyfully
discovers his inner nerd. It is all thanks to Laney.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the charm of ``She's All That'' emanates from Ms. Cook,
a star of ``Dawson's Creek'' who looks and sounds like a baby
Winona Ryder. Unlike so many actors playing smart young people, she
actually projects some intelligence along with a sly sense of
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It has some strong language.

ATLANTA'S ANDERSON DISCOVERS HIS OWN FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Friend-of-the-family Muhammad Ali was in the hospital
waiting room when Jamal Anderson arrived in the world. So of
course, Anderson grew to understand the importance of outer beauty.
Anderson works hard at it. A man can count on natural good looks to
go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Europeans have shown us the way,'' Anderson said, a
running back who carried the Atlanta Falcons to their first Super
Bowl since, well, the beginning of time. ``You get facials. You
wash your face nightly.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Anderson is basking in the warmth and shine of joining
the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. Two seasons ago, his first
as a starter in the National Football League, the Falcons went
3-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the situation we're in right now,'' Anderson said.
``There are no bad days for Jamal Anderson. We're here, and we're
the only two teams playing for the world championship. It's the
greatest athletic stage there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes arrive on center stage better prepared than
Anderson. His father, James, is a former New Jersey policeman who
has handled security for the likes of Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike
Tyson and assorted entertainers. ``Uncle'' Muhammad, the prettiest
boxer the world ever laid eyes on, used to perform magic tricks for
Jamal and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Summer has read Anderson bedtime stories. Anderson has
skated at Richard Pryor's place. Leonard sang once at the birthday
party of Anderson's father. Under the circumstances, the Super Bowl
_ with its worldwide audience of 800 million _ seems like a natural
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous in this setting,'' Anderson said. ``Everything
is (treated) like a chore. Why not have fun doing our jobs? People
say, `He's a ham.' It's not being a ham. It's just being relaxed
and natural. Doing my thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has always pointed out that the people who changed
always had a sudden and hard fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Hang around the stars enough, and it's only natural to want to
reach for them. ``You say, `I'm going to be like Muhammad,'''
Anderson said. ``Right. Every time I thought about boxing, one of
those guys either lost or got beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   One episode with Tyson reinforced Anderson's suspicion that he
wasn't cut out to be a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of mock slap-boxing,'' Anderson said. ``You know
how you get with your buddies? You duck, thinking you're a boxer.
Mike swung _ I kind of think he had a flashback. The wind took me
back. I was like, `Twenty-second timeout. This game is over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Football seemed safer. Saner. As a boy, Anderson was an NFL
Films junkie. The trademark stiff-arm that helped Anderson to the
ninth-highest season rushing total (1,846 yards) in NFL history? He
unveiled it at age 9, inspired by old clips of Jim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stiff-arm wasn't enough of a weapon to attract more
than passing interest from the NFL. Anderson lasted until the 201st
pick of the 1994 draft. Twenty-three running backs went before
Anderson, who rushed for 1,275 yards at Utah. In his career. A year
later, Terrell Davis went to the Broncos on the 196th pick. Davis
has made an illogical progression from 1,117 yards to 1,538 to
1,750 to 2,008.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of carries the flag for the unwanted,'' Anderson said.
``I'm part of Terrell's Army.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Anderson wasn't even a foot soldier with the Falcons.
Anderson carried the ball 41 times his first two seasons. He has
rushed for 3,903 yards and 26 touchdowns in the three seasons
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no way you can prepare for him,'' Broncos
safety Steve Atwater said. ``He's a unique athlete. Come Sunday,
we're going to have to go after him like a pack of wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-feet-11-inches and 234 pounds, Anderson is a tailback in a
fullback's body. He squats 670 pounds. He bench presses 465. When
necessary, he handles like a Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up watching Earl Campbell ... that's who he reminds me
of most,'' Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton said. ``He's strong, he's
short, he's thick, he's quick and he's fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL-record 410 carries this season only hint at how much
Anderson softens up a defense. Anderson produced 1,133 of his
rushing yards and nine of his 14 touchdowns in the second half of
games. He'll have plenty of time later to get tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about the residual effect, the wear and
tear on your body,'' Anderson said. ``But that's over 10 or 20
years. I'm only in my fifth year, and realistically, I didn't even
play my first two years, so this is really my third year. So I've
got seven or eight more years of ... dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson laughed. Everything is beautiful. He's in the Super
Bowl. Besides, Anderson figures he has something else in his favor,
something that allows him to be a beast of burden without being any
worse for the wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetics,'' Anderson said. ``Genetics. But you also have to
take good care of yourself. This is really the first season that I
started getting massages and getting in the cold tub and
incorporating a lot of the things that my trainers were telling me
I should do. And it kind of all fell into place.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston is the most historical city in America, a
repository of the national past, yet it has an extraordinary
capacity to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims landed nearby. Boston became the cradle of liberty,
but later it became a byword for bluenosed narrow-mindedness.
(``Banned in Boston!'' they used to say when they wanted to tout a
naughty book or a risque play.)
</P>
<P>
   It has traded and manufactured. Nowadays it manages money, and
capitalizes on the science and technology developed in its
laboratories. It has boomed and busted and it is a boom town again,
uncouth as that sounds. The one constant has been ideas: Boston
ideas have washed across the nation and the world for two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a second constant: the accent, as distinctive
as those of Brooklyn and Tidewater, Va. Hear a man say ``farm'' _
``fahm'' _ in that distinctive nasal way, and you know just where
he came from. It is the sound of ``a brick-throated bullfrog,''
Ford Madox Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   There can be very few cities in the country with as much to
offer the visitor. Historical sites abound, of course, enough to
exhaust the most avid dwellers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Dockside at the Charlestown Navy Yard, you can visit ``Old
Ironsides,'' the Constitution, commissioned in 1797 and never
decommissioned. You can visit the Old South Meeting House, a
Colonial gem with a sounding board hung above the pulpit, where
Samuel Adams roused the rabble against the tyrant in London, and
see Faneuil Hall, with its grasshopper weather vane, still used
occasionally for political meetings, and stand beside the Old State
House, where five protesters, including a black man, Crispus
Attucks, were killed by the redcoats in the Boston Massacre of
1770.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, Boston ranks among the nation's leaders. The Museum
of Fine Arts has no peer in the Western Hemisphere for its
collection of Asian art. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, under the
baton of Seiji Ozawa, born in China to Japanese parents, is one of
the top five in the United States, and the inimitable Boston Pops
flourishes as it did in the days of Arthur Fiedler and John
Williams. The whole panoply of American architecture, from Bulfinch
to I.M. Pei, is on show here.
</P>
<P>
   Boston loves sports; in fact, it has often been said that only
three things count here: sports, politics and revenge. The
basketball Celtics, who have never recovered from the loss of the
formidable Larry Bird, and the baseball Red Sox, jinxed since they
traded Babe Ruth to the Yankees 79 years ago, are nevertheless
beloved. The Sox play in Fenway Park, a wonderful old band box, as
idiosyncratically shaped as the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Beantown
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Boston is a superb walking town. Compact and
convenient, a mosaic of distinctive neighborhoods, it is a baby
London.
</P>
<P>
   Right at its heart lie the Boston Common and the Public Garden,
twin parks that are perfect for strolling. Swan boats, propelled by
boatmen whose pedaling turns paddles, cruise the garden's pond,
familiar to all as the setting for the children's classic ``Make
Way for Ducklings.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Boston's aristocrats, the fearsome Brahmins, ran
everything. The Cabots spoke only to Lowells, as the doggerel had
it, and the Lowells spoke only to God. Then the Irish fought their
way to power.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the two worlds _ the world of John P. Marquand's
``Late George Apley'' and the world of Boss Martin Lomasney,
celebrated in Edwin O'Connor's ``Last Hurrah'' _ came to terms with
each other. They learned to co-exist. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
carries the flag of his brothers and Tip O'Neill and James Michael
Curley. William Weld, recently the governor of Massachusetts, walks
in the footsteps of two presidential Adamses from nearby Quincy and
two senatorial Henry Cabot Lodges. And now, mirabile dictu, the
mayor and the governor are both Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   William Lloyd Garrison, foremost of the abolitionists, made his
first anti-slavery speech in Park Street Church in 1829, and Robert
Gould Shaw raised a black regiment here to fight in the Civil War.
But tolerance is a latecomer to 20th-century Boston. The
controversy over court-ordered busing of students in the interest
of racial balance left deep scars, with the city's intellectuals,
many of whose children attended private schools, pitted against the
clannish, less affluent Irish-Americans of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, though no longer, Brahmin hostility to other tribes
was obvious, with the haughty Somerset Club a pre-eminent symbol of
that. During the Civil War, it had been a stronghold of the
Southern sympathizers known as Copperheads, and it is enshrined in
Boston lore that they closed the club's windows when Robert Gould
Shaw walked past. Benjamin C. Bradlee, the scion of an old Boston
family, once tried to take Sen. John F. Kennedy to lunch there but
was turned away. He may as well have arrived in blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bostonians developed a reputation for
self-satisfaction. Once, a guest at a White House reception told
Franklin D. Roosevelt, ``I'm from Boston.'' He replied, ``You'll
never get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1857, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that Boston, or more
precisely the State House atop Beacon Hill, was ``the hub of the
solar system.'' People still call it the Hub today, but they use
the term self-mockingly. They also call their city Beantown, after
their beloved Boston baked beans, which gives them something in
common with the proud inhabitants of Florence, another historic
city, who call themselves bean eaters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tea and Insurrection
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries ago Boston bred insurrection. Its patriots led the
way to independence, dumping chests of English tea into the waters
of the colonies' most important harbor to protest royal taxes. Paul
Revere, silversmith and midnight rider, and John Hancock, president
of the Continental Congress, were Bostonians. Lexington and Concord
lie just over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   American legal tradition owes much to Boston. The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts predates the U.S. Supreme Court. It
has sat without interruption longer than any other court in the
Western world.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the city lived by the sea. Its trade was
built upon cod. That humble fish, now often called scrod
hereabouts, is still a favorite on local dinner tables, and a
wooden replica, the Sacred Cod, hangs in the State House in the
chamber where the House of Representatives meets. (Just as the lord
chancellor in Britain sits on the wool sack as a reminder of the
source of England's early wealth.)
</P>
<P>
   When the British market dried up, Boston opened trade routes to
the East, bringing porcelain, spices and silks to the young United
States in its snazzy clipper ships. And when steel-hulled ships
made the clippers obsolete, it turned to manufacturing; Boston
money and management built the mills in the smaller cities around
it, from Salem to Lawrence to Brockton.
</P>
<P>
   The profits built Boston's great educational and cultural
institutions. Henry Lee Higginson came home from the Civil War and
helped establish both the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which still
accords the van der Weyden he gave it a place of honor, and the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. Harvard University, across the Charles
River in Cambridge, flourished anew. Boston became the nation's
intellectual locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century Boston and its suburbs were filled with
writers whose names resound today: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David
Thoreau, Margaret Fuller and the other Transcendentalists, the poet
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the historian Francis Parkman, the
psychologist William James, the educational reformer Horace Mann,
the philosopher George Santayana, and the novelist William Dean
Howells, editor of The Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   They have their successors in this century in scholars and
writers like David Reisman, John K. Galbraith and Henry Louis Gates
Jr. Houghton Mifflin and Little, Brown &AMP; Co. carry on the city's
publishing tradition, and WGBH, Boston's public television station,
produces much of the best fare on PBS, including the Julia Child
programs and ``The American Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston and its suburbs are home to countless colleges and
universities: peerless Harvard, the oldest institution of higher
education in the country, whose business, law and medical schools
educate the nation's leaders-to-be; the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, one of the world's great science and engineering
schools; Wellesley, Hillary Rodham Clinton's alma mater; Tufts and
Brandeis, Boston College and Boston University and Northeastern.
Its eminent hospitals, like Massachusetts General and Brigham and
Women's, draw patients from everywhere, and high-technology
businesses cluster around the exits on Route 128, the semicircular
highway skirting the city.
</P>
<P>
   A Renaissance
</P>
<P>
   For almost half a century, from the 1920s to the 1960s, Boston
was a backwater of sorts, subsisting largely, it seemed, on
memories. But the Kennedy presidency brought new attention to the
city. (Kennedy's presidential library is housed in a Pei building
in Dorchester, south of the center.)
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, a mayor named John Collins and a
redevelopment genius named Edward Logue began reshaping the place.
They cleared out the malodorous neighborhood known as Scollay
Square, installing a new government center there. In two decades,
the nearby Quincy Market was turned into a chic shopping precinct
by the architect Benjamin Thompson, incorporating the raucous old
eating house called Durgin-Park. In and near Copley Square, new
towers were built for the Prudential and John Hancock insurance
companies, reviving that neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After a nasty slump in the 1980s, yet another renaissance is
under way. Average rents exceed those in Manhattan and San
Francisco, and hotel rooms are as scarce as downtown parking
meters. An $11 billion project is at last burying the city's
unsightly main north-south highway deep beneath the ground, and a
new 1,000-acre seaport district is abuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Boston is a money town along with everything else. The
Fidelity group, the country's biggest mutual fund enterprise, is
headquartered here, along with several competitors. Peter Lynch,
its smooth-talking stock picker, shows up on commercials
nationwide. Fleet Financial, headed by Terrence Murray, is a
banking powerhouse in and beyond New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Arts
</P>
<P>
   Boston has a downtown commercial theater district, where many an
aspiring Broadway show has had its kinks ironed out (or not). The
city's theatrical life is centered, however, across the river, in
Cambridge, where the gifted, turbulent Robert Brustein directs the
American Repertory Theater, an unfailing source of new dramatic
ideas. Cherry Jones, a joy of the New York Theater, developed her
craft in a decade of classic roles under Brustein's aegis.
</P>
<P>
   Opera is a less happy story. For decades Sarah Caldwell kept the
Boston Opera going, innovative if unstable, with bailing wire and
duct tape. She also championed the music of Russian modernists like
Rodion Shchedrin and Alfred Schnittke. But the Caldwell era
collapsed in a heap of recriminations over questionable financial
practices in 1990, and the Boston Lyric Opera, now headed by Leon
Major, a Canadian, is a more modest proposition, with only three
productions a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony Orchestra has always been Boston's
performing arts favorite. In winter it plays in Symphony Hall,
which need not take a back seat, esthetically or acoustically, even
to the Musikverein in Vienna, and in summer it plays in the Music
Shed at Tanglewood, in the Berkshire Hills of western
Massachusetts. Maestro Ozawa, lithe and balletic, a charismatic,
controversial conductor whose musicianship is praised by many and
doubted by a few, has led it for 25 years, matching the tenure of
the Russian Serge Koussevitzky and exceeding that of the Frenchman
Charles Munch.

   Here is information about visiting the Boston area:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON HARBOR HOTEL, 70 Rowes Wharf, (617) 439-7000. On the
waterfront, a few steps from the city's financial district, this
place offers arresting harbor views, especially wonderful from your
(very comfortable) room at sunrise. It has a water taxi to Logan
Airport, which lets you bypass snarls in the tunnels. Rowes Wharf,
its restaurant, specializes in modern New England cooking, with the
best brunch in town on Sundays. Double room: $305 to $450 on
weekends; $365 to $550 on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES HOTEL IN HARVARD SQUARE, 1 Bennett St., Cambridge, (617)
864-1200. Great for old grads, visiting lecturers and proud
parents. (Is there any other kind, when the young-un's get into
Harvard or MIT?) The 296 bedrooms, mostly on the snug side, have a
lean, Quakery feel, with quilts and Colonial-style furniture.
Chilly reception. Jody Adams' Rialto restaurant can disappoint, but
on most nights the Mediterranean fare scores. Double room: $239 to
$389.
</P>
<P>
   THE ELIOT, 370 Commonwealth Ave., (617) 267-1607. This is a
find, a neo-Georgian hotel built in 1925 and discerningly renovated
a few years ago. Tucked into patrician Back Bay, convenient for
shopping along nearby Newbury Street. The 92 suites all have
kitchens; if cooking palls, Clio awaits downstairs, a supper club
with a leopard skin rug and the gutsy French cuisine of Ken
Oringer, who used to cook at Silks in San Francisco. Winter rate:
$195 a suite.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 200 Boylston St., (617) 338-4400. Overlooking the
Common and the Public Garden, with the golden State House dome just
beyond, this one gets an A for location and for everything else:
attentive service, with jolly, efficient doormen; large, handsome
bedrooms (including one, to which I was once upgraded, with a grand
piano); one of Boston's very best restaurants (see below), lush
lobby flowers and a 50-foot indoor pool. Double room: $475 to $665.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON, 15 Arlington St., (617) 536-5700. Kansas City and
even Naples, Fla., have their Ritzes now, but this is THE Ritz, a
link to Boston's days of glory, a hallowed institution where the
elevator operators still wear white gloves. I can remember when
they did your bill in pen and ink and made you wear a tie to
breakfast (the blueberry muffins are famous). It's formal, even a
bit stuffy, but it lives and breathes Old World elegance. Double
room: $245 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   AUJOURD'HUI, Four Seasons (see above). The first time I took
Julia Child out to eat, I asked her where she wanted to go; this is
her town. She chose Aujourd'hui. Like her, it lives and breathes
style. The kitchen produces Americanized haute cuisine that lets
the quality of the ingredients shine through, and many think it the
city's premier restaurant. ``Tres chic, tres cher,'' says Boston
Magazine, which pretty well sums it up.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE GINGER, 583 Washington St., Wellesley, (781) 283-5790. So
much fusion cooking is so bad that it's a joy to taste that of Ming
Tsai, 34, who grew up in his family's Chinese restaurant, then went
to Yale. Try his crab cake with kafir lime, and you'll think
Baltimore and Bangkok at the same time, or shu mai dumplings
stuffed with foie gras and shiitakes in caramelized onion broth, or
miso-marinated sea bass, with a slug of wasabi oil. No one in the
country can match Tsai's virtuosity in this idiom.
</P>
<P>
   EAST COAST GRILL, 1271 Cambridge St., Cambridge, (617) 491-6568.
Author, grillmeister and hot-sauce maven, Chris Schlesinger serves
barbecue in several regional styles, plus other lively specialties.
Good raw bar, terrific drinks, reasonable prices, good sides but no
side.
</P>
<P>
   HAMERSLEY'S, 553 Tremont St., (617) 423-2700. That's Gordon
Hamersley in the Red Sox cap at the range, and his winter menu
delivers genuine cold-weather cheer. Things like seared foie gras
with prunes and armagnac, choucroute with smoked bacon, sausage and
quail, and slow-cooked Vermont pig with endives, along with Mrs.
Hamersley's sagely chosen wines.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL SEAFOODS, 35 Columbus Ave., (617) 426-4444; and other
locations. Don't go to Legal's for fancy cooking; go because Roger
Berkowitz, the owner, buys the best fish and shellfish and tests it
for freshness and purity. The oysters and clams on the half shell
are nonpareil; the clam chowder is the city's best, rich but not
thick, and oh, the fried clams . . .
</P>
<P>
   OLIVES, 10 City Square, Charlestown, (617) 242-1999. Todd
English carries the flag nationally for Boston cooking, and no
wonder. He has turned a storefront in the middle of nowhere into
the city's top address with his lustily flavored, eclectically
inspired food. A typical uptown, downtown example: brisket with
parmesan risotto. No reservations for parties under six.
</P>
<P>
   LES ZYGOMATES, 129 South St., (617) 542-5108. The kind of wine
bar every town needs, a meeting place for young and old, rich and
just getting by. Ian Just, the chef, learned his craft at the Paris
mother house of Les Zyg, and his plats du jour warm the heart (and
other parts). The name, fittingly, refers to the muscles that make
your face and mine smile.

 &HT;    ECHOES OF VIETNAM RESONATE IN RUDOLPH SEARCH
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 31
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It has been a year since Atlanta and Birmingham bombing suspect
Eric Robert Rudolph slipped into the heavily wooded mountains
around Andrews, N.C., with federal law enforcement agents only a
few hours behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Heat-detecting infrared sensors have failed to spot the
anti-government recluse and former airborne soldier in the thick
woods and mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Listening devices planted in the woods have failed to pick up
any sound of him.
</P>
<P>
   Specially trained hunting dogs have failed to sniff him out.
</P>
<P>
   And heavily armed searchers, at times as many as 200, have
failed to run him to ground or dig him out of a cave despite
focusing their search on a 30-square-mile area in the Nantahala
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph's hunters appear no closer now to their quarry than they
were when they first showed up in Andrews in the wake of the
bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham on Jan. 29, 1998. If
anything, the feds have gotten bogged down in a mission that has
developed eerie similarities to the U.S. military involvement in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Like the U.S. military in Vietnam, the feds in North Carolina
are facing something of a no-win situation. If they catch Rudolph,
they look foolish for taking so long. If they don't, they look even
more foolish for being outwitted by one rugged individualist.
Either way, they risk losing the confidence and respect of the
American people, just as the U.S. military did after the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   When the first wave of regular combat troops was sent to Vietnam
in early 1965, it was with high expectations that the widely
disparaged Viet Cong insurgency would be quickly taken care of. The
Viet Cong were considered little more than illiterate peasants who
were poorly armed, had virtually no military training and could be
quickly overwhelmed by America's superior firepower and manpower.
Overlooked and ignored were their commitment to the cause and the
backing they received from North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The feds have not underestimated Rudolph's commitment to his
cause, whatever that might be, but they too were overconfident
about how they would be able to hunt down one man with their
superior technology and firepower. Just as the resourcefulness of
the Viet Cong initially befuddled America's military, which until
then had been training to fight a set-piece battle with the Soviets
in Central Europe, so too has Rudolph's elusiveness baffled those
searching for him in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam the U.S. military found a population that often only
grudgingly accepted its presence. The people there feared the
Americans almost as much as they feared the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese. In Andrews and the surrounding areas, the feds have met
with the same sort of grudging acceptance from many residents who
are independent and who harbor strong anti-government feelings.
Federal officials are close-mouthed about how much, if any, outside
help Rudolph might be getting, but it seems highly unlikely that he
would be able to survive this long without assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The feds have developed something of a bunker mentality in
Andrews, hunkering down in a old sewing-machine factory that is
enclosed by a fence, its access road closed to public traffic. It
is somewhat reminiscent of Vietnam-era base camps and fire support
bases. But that did not keep someone from firing off eight shots at
the building in November, one of the rounds grazing the head of an
agent and another round narrowly missing a second agent.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent search for the gunman did nothing to endear the
feds to the local populace. Phillip Rogers, a local mechanic
unaware of the shooting at the task-force headquarters, was
arrested by federal agents after he tracked a search helicopter
with a laser pointer. According to Andrews attorney Tim Rasmussen,
Rogers was charged with ``forcibly assaulting, resisting, opposing,
impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen says the whole thing is overkill and symptomatic of
the growing friction between the feds and the locals. ``It's like
too many people in an elevator for too long. After a while you get
uncomfortable with the people around you,'' Rasmussen said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the troops fighting in Vietnam grew more discouraged the
longer America's involvement went on, so too do some of the troops
hunting for Rudolph. Living conditions for federal agents are less
than ideal: They're sleeping in motels far from friends and
families and eating restaurant food for weeks at a time. Progress,
if any, is difficult to measure. And Rudolph's emergence in some
quarters as a mythic hero for his ability to outwit the feds has
added to the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Vietnam, leaders from Washington occasionally drop in
to visit the troops in the field to tell them what a great job they
are doing. FBI Director Louis Freeh made two morale-boosting trips
to Andrews over the past year, telling agents, ``We will maintain
the investigation and search for as long as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasional briefings for the news media in Andrews have
taken on aspects of the media briefings in Vietnam, once derisively
referred to as the ``Five O'Clock Follies.'' Those Vietnam
briefings were long on statistics, body counts and rosy outlooks
and extremely short on realistic assessments. In Andrews the
briefings seldom offer anything of substance and agents rarely
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The feds searching for Rudolph are not likely to declare victory
and go home. That would entail telling the public they believe he
is dead, either through natural causes in a cave somewhere or by
his own hand. But doing that could be extremely dangerous because
it leads to the possibility of Rudolph passing into legend in the
style of D.B. Cooper, who disappeared into the Pacific Northwest
before Thanksgiving in 1971, with $200,000 in Northwest Airlines'
money, after parachuting from one of its Mexico-bound jets.
</P>
<P>
   If Rudolph is not caught or his body is not found, the same
could be in store for him. Sightings of Rudolph, some real but most
imagined, would probably go on for decades in the Nantahala
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Without the capture of Rudolph and a trial, or without his body,
there will be no satisfactory end to this mission, just as in
Vietnam.

INSIDE ART: MADAME DE POMPADOUR PORTRAIT; SOTHEBY'S IN FRANCE;
MUSEUM GETS A COPLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regular visitors to the Frick Collection will notice
some changes to the grand interiors of the limestone mansion at 1
East 70th St. Several paintings in its collection that had been out
of sight for years were rehung this week in prominent places. Some
of the Frick's fine porcelains, too, have found temporary new
niches.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the reinstallation is to create a mini-exhibition
that revolves around a single loan: Drouais' full-length portrait
of Madame de Pompadour from the National Gallery in London. It is
the first time the Drouais has been seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait, painted in 1764, one month before Madame de
Pompadour's death, depicts her in a voluminous gown of painted
Chinese silk edged with yards of fine lace. The work hangs in the
Frick's East Gallery, where it will remain through April 25.
</P>
<P>
   It is flanked by two works by Chardin from the Frick's
collection: ``Still Life With Plums'' (circa 1730) and ``Lady With
a Bird-Organ'' (1751). ``Elizabeth, Countess of Warwick,'' a
portrait by Jean-Marc Nattier that had been in the director's
dining room on the second floor and had not been exhibited since
1980, is on the same wall.
</P>
<P>
   Madame de Pompadour loved Sevres porcelain, so three vases
dating from around 1762 from the royal factory at Sevres can now be
seen at close range on a commode placed in front of the portrait.
They are usually displayed in the museum's Boucher Room on a mantel
out of the public's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``These paintings and objects all relate to Madame de
Pompadour,'' said Samuel Sachs II, the Frick's director. ``It's a
revisitation to the 18th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's own Drouais, ``The Compte and Chevalier de Choiseul
as Savoyards'' (1758), which usually hangs behind stanchions to the
left of the grand staircase leading to the Frick's private
quarters, has been rehung, too. It is now on the north wall of the
East Gallery, directly across from Madame de Pompadour's portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The Frick curators have hung a Van Dyck in the Drouais'
customary place: ``Ottaviano Canevari'' (circa 1627), which had
been at the top stair landing and had not been publicly displayed
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The loan of the Drouais portrait from the National Gallery was a
result of discussions in which the Frick agreed to lend the London
museum its Ingres portrait of the Vicomtesse d'Haussonville (1845).
An exhibition of Ingres portraits opened on Wednesday at the
National Gallery and will travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Henry Clay Frick's will, the Frick is not
allowed to lend works acquired by its founder, which make up
two-thirds of its collection. But it can lend art that has been
bought since Frick's death in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot where the Ingres had hung, a long, narrow room
called the North Hall, there is now a painting by the only female
artist in the collection, Cesarine-Henriette-Flore Davin-Mirvault.
It is a portrait of Antonio Bartolomeo Bruni that had been hanging
in a curator's office and has not been on public view since the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's in France
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated delays in opening the French auction system to
non-French auctioners, Sotheby's has figured out a way to hold one
of the most eagerly anticipated house sales of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This week it announced that it would join with two French
auctioners _ Remi Le Fur and Herve Poulain, vice president of
Drouot _ to sell the contents of the Chateau de Groussay, the home
of Charles de Beistegui, an interior designer who died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, a series of sales from June 2 to 6, will take place
at the chateau in Montfort l'Amaury, an hour southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great step forward for making the French auction
system more international,'' said Laure de Beauvau Craon, deputy
chairman of Sotheby's in Europe and president of Sotheby's France.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the French Senate would debate the issue of
opening the system to companies like Sotheby's and Christie's in
April and that the National Assembly would do so in June.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Sotheby's first involvement in an auction in France
since it opened its grand quarters in the Galerie Charpentier on
Rue du Faubourg-St. Honore early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Beauvau Craon said that Poulain and Le Fur, not
Sotheby's, signed the contract to conduct the sale with Juan de
Beistegui, Charles de Beistegui's nephew, who inherited the 21-room
chateau. Sotheby's will be paid only for its services, which
include organizing the event. That approach meets the French
requirement that French auctioners conduct sales in France.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which is estimated to bring $20 million, includes an
array of furniture, art and objects: magnificent Russian and French
furniture, porcelains, clocks, marble busts and 18th- and
19th-century paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Gets a Copley
</P>
<P>
   A double portrait of Pennsylvania's first governor, Thomas
Mifflin, and his wife, Sarah Morris Mifflin, by John Singleton
Copley is being sold by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania to
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it has been on loan since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 1773 portrait, which was bequeathed to the Historical
Society in 1900, has been the jewel in its collection of more than
10,000 paintings and objects. But the Historical Society decided to
become a research library two years ago and to dispose of much of
its art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to stay in Philadelphia,'' said Anne d'Harnoncourt,
director of the Philadelphia Museum. ``This is where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., longtime trustees of the
museum, have given the lead gift toward buying the Copley. The $4
million price will be met with additional money from the museum's
endowment.

A JOURNEY BACK TO JUDAISM, THANKS TO THE DALAI LAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Jew in the Lotus'' is a documentary that suggests that
film may be far from the ideal medium for portraying a spiritual
journey that takes a man back to his religion.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Laurel Chiten, whose previous work includes ``Twitch and
Shout,'' about Tourette's syndrome, ``The Jew in the Lotus'' is
introduced as a work about a group of rabbis who traveled in 1990
to Dharamsala, in northern India, to meet with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Driven from Tibet by invading Chinese bent on obliterating
Buddhism, the Dalai Lama sought to know the secret of the spiritual
survival of Jews in the millennia of the Diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating question, but it is rapidly subsumed and abandoned
without meaningful answer beneath the story of Rodger Kamenetz, a
writer asked by a friend to accompany the rabbis to India and
chronicle their encounter with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens Friday and is part of the New York Jewish Film
Festival at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   For Kamenetz, agonizing over the death of an infant child and
the blunt rejection of a book into which he had poured himself, the
journey to Tibet proved an experience that reawakened and deepened
his Judaism. The experience also led him to relate his story in
``The Jew in the Lotus,'' a best-selling book that not only
restored his faith in himself as a writer but also made him a
popular figure on the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his gifts as a writer and public speaker may be,
Kamenetz generates little interest and radiates no charisma in this
documentary. One can sympathize with his torment over the death of
a child, but for the most part the film makes him appear to be a
self-absorbed neurotic surrounded by mostly unidentified talking
heads striving hard to imbue him with a significance that his words
and acts on film fail to justify.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the meetings of the rabbis and the Dalai Lama
seem slighted, and the travelogue elements of ``The Jew in the
Lotus'' appear unexceptional.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, when Kamenetz returns to Dharamsala and presents the
Dalai Lama with a copy of his book, Ms. Chiten's documentary bears
an unfortunate resemblance to a 60-minute infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   THE JEW IN THE LOTUS
</P>
<P>
   Produced and directed by Laurel Chiten; based on the book ``The
Jew in the Lotus: A Poet's Rediscovery of Jewish Identity in
Buddhist India'' by Rodger Kamenetz; director of photography, Peter
Wiehl; edited by William Anderson; released by Blind Dog Films. At
the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running
time: 60 minutes. This film is not rated.

SAVEUR COOKS: BOOK REFLECTS AMERICAN HERITAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See SAVEUR-COOKS-RECIPES) 
 
By DAI HUYNH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven on a bun is a bacon cheeseburger.
</P>
<P>
   At least Colman Andrews thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   The way the editor of Saveur magazine sees it, the bacon
cheeseburger is among the highest culinary achievements of modern
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good food is good food,'' he said. ``The fact that it's called
foie gras or lobster doesn't mean that it's better than something
that is called hamburger or green beans. If it's honest, fresh and
well-made, it's good food.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles native's philosophy on food goes even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food connects with virtually every area of life. Food is a way
of anchoring ourselves, reconnecting with our roots and also with
the world,'' said Andrews, who lives with his wife and two
daughters in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate how food permeates people's lives, Andrews and his
Saveur colleagues have crafted ``Saveur Cooks Authentic American''
(Chronicle Books, $40).
</P>
<P>
   The 320-page volume offers a glossy, lush look at the foods and
traditions of Americans through 175 recipes from all corners of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   From out west, Rose Pistola shares her recipe for calamari
cakes. Back east, Susan Blew talks about Swedish coffee bread. Up
north, there's food writer R.W. Apple Jr.'s family recipe for
Pennsylvania Dutch creamed corn. And in Texas, Houstonian Carter
Rochelle's Real Texas Chili consists of plenty of meat but no
beans, podnuh.
</P>
<P>
   The accessible text is supplemented with compelling photographs.
It's hard not to feel some kind of connection with the land when
viewing photographs of swollen vine-ripened tomatoes being peeled
or the sweeping wild-rice paddies of Minnesota being harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Providing even more texture and soul to the culinary
anthropology are the essays on the people, places, ingredients,
rituals and dishes that define authentic American cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors to the book tell readers how they got their hands
on a ``dead man's recipe'' for fried chicken from Gus Vanderbilt or
the secret to perfectly cooked glazed ham from Monte Mathews. Many
recipes include stories that describe their origins, such as
Tutu-Man's chicken with teriyaki sauce, Mrs. Garrett's chicken
pies, Georgene's fluffy rolls, Sam's apple pie and Francis Vitale's
lamb's-neck stew with polenta.
</P>
<P>
   The book is peppered with uniquely American fare, such as
iceberg lettuce with blue cheese and barbecued ribs. Many, however,
are transplants, reinvented or adapted from other parts of the
world. This has prompted many to question whether foods such
asgnocchi and pesto, flour tortillas and chow mein can be labeled
as authentic American food.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the foods we eat,'' replied Andrews. ``We're all
immigrants. Our ancestors brought over these recipes and adapted
them to the ingredients we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking more like a football coach than a gastronomical guru,
Andrews didn't start his career as a food authority. Critiquing the
music scene was his meal ticket until the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music world was getting less hospitable, more bottom-line
oriented,'' he recalled. ``Food, at about the same time, was
becoming, for the first time, a major preoccupation in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch from music critic to restaurant critic wasn't too
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of my parents came out of a food tradition, and a lot
of what we ate at home came from a can,'' he said. ``But my parents
took me out to restaurants from the time I was a little babe in
arms. I became very comfortable in their surroundings, learning
everything I could about food by observing what was on other
people's plates.''
</P>
<P>
   After establishing a name in food journalism, Andrews got
together with Dorothy Kalins, editor in chief, and Christopher
Hirsheimer, executive editor, to launch Saveur (pronounced sa-VER).
</P>
<P>
   The threesome, however, wanted to go beyond publishing just
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to share and discover with our readers where food
comes from, why it was made a certain way and who made it,''
Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept clicked with readers and catapulted the magazine
into the culinary limelight in the summer of 1994. Today,
circulation has swelled to more than 375,000.
</P>
<P>
   In less than five years, Saveur has garnered many notable
awards, including six James Beard Awards (the Oscars of the
culinary world) and two National Magazine Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most about it is the nice marrying of the
geography with the cuisine of the region,'' said Len Pickell, an
avid reader and president of the James Beard Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only get the recipes but you get the source.''
</P>
<P>
   For Andrews, the source is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is one of the most direct links we have with the earth _
stuff that comes out of the earth and comes into us and literally
makes us what we are. How people don't find that fascinating I
don't understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although a connoisseur of food, he rejects the distinction
between haute cuisine and simple cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good food is good food,'' he repeated. ``It's not a serious,
pretentious kind of thing.''

SAM'S APPLE PIE &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pastry &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
2/3 cup solid all-vegetable shortening, chilled &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sift flour and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in shortening
with a pastry cutter or 2 knives, until mixture resembles coarse
meal. Make small depressions in the mixture with your finger and
drizzle in up to 5 tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time,
mixing until dough holds together. Form into a ball, wrap in
plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Filling &QL; 
 &QL; 
3 pounds baking apples, peeled and cored &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
Pinch of nutmeg &QL; 
2/3 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
Salt &QL; 
4 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces &QL; 
1 egg, lightly beaten &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut apples into wedges, 1/2 inch thick at the widest point. Mix
sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl. Add apples and
mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Divide dough into 2 balls. Roll out
1 dough ball into a 12-inch round on a floured surface, then ease
into a 9-inch pie pan. Fill the pastry with apples and all their
juices, and dot with butter. Roll out remaining dough into a
12-inch round, place on top of apples, then fold edge under and
crimp or flute. Poke 4 or 5 holes in top crust with your finger to
allow steam to escape during baking. Beat 1 tablespoon water into
egg, then brush top of pie with egg wash. Bake until crust is
golden brown, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before
serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PANFRIED FLANK STEAK WITH GARLIC BUTTER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (1 1/2-pound) piece flank steak, about 3/4 inch thick &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil &QL; 
2 tablespoons Garlic Butter (recipe follows) &QL; 
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat steak dry with paper towels; season liberally on both sides
with salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high
heat. When pan begins to smoke, coat with oil, then add steak (be
careful; oil will spatter) and sear until almost black, about 4
minutes on each side (for rare). Don't move meat until ready to
turn, or crust will break.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer steak to a platter and top with Garlic Butter. Cover
loosely with foil to keep warm. Allow steak to rest 10 minutes,
then cut across the grain into 1/4-inch slices. Spoon juices over
steak and top with parsley. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Garlic butter &QL; 
 &QL; 
4 tablespoons butter &QL; 
3 garlic cloves, crushed &QL; 
 &QL; 
Heat butter and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.
Cook until garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard
garlic. Keep butter warm. Makes enough to top 4 servings of steak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herb Butter: Beat 4 tablespoons softened butter with a fork in a
medium bowl until creamy. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh
tarragon, 1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh chives, and 3/4 teaspoon
each, minced, fresh: chervil and parsley. Mix thoroughly; season to
taste with salt and pepper. Mound butter on a piece of plastic
wrap, roll to form a cylinder, twist ends of wrap, and refrigerate
until firm, at least 1 hour. Slice into rounds to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Roquefort Butter: Substitute 1 tablespoon crumbled Roquefort,
1/2 teaspoon cognac and 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard for the herbs,
then proceed as in Herb Butter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STUFFED PEPPERS &QL; 
 &QL; 
8 fresh poblano peppers or 4 green bell peppers &QL; 
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided &QL; 
1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced &QL; 
1 garlic clove, peeled and minced &QL; 
1/4 pound each, ground: beef and pork &QL; 
Salt and freshly ground black pepper &QL; 
1 large tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped &QL; 
Pinch of ground nutmeg &QL; 
1 1/4 cups cooked long-grain white rice &QL; 
1 tablespoon each, chopped, fresh: marjoram leaves, thyme and
parsley &QL; 
1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Char peppers over a gas flame or under a hot broiler, turning to
blacken all over. Place in a paper bag, close tightly, and steam 15
minutes. When cool enough to handle, rub off and remove blackened
skin, taking care not to tear flesh. Cut a slit down the length of
each, stopping about 1/2 inch from the tip. (If using bell peppers,
simply cut off the top.) Scrape out ribs and seeds. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion
and garlic and cook until soft and golden, about 20 minutes.
Increase heat to medium-high, add beef and pork, breaking meat up
with the back of a spoon, and brown 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
medium, season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in tomato
and nutmeg. Cook 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in rice,
marjoram, thyme, parsley and 1 tablespoon oil. Adjust seasonings.
Preheat broiler. Spoon about 1/4 cup filling into each pepper and
place on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle with bread crumbs, drizzle with
remaining oil and broil until golden. Serve hot or at room
temperature. Makes 4 servings.

`SHE'S ALL THAT' RECYCLES TIRED TEEN THEMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' may seem to borrow from the latest in
cinematic high-school social studies, but it outright steals from
the genre's master, John Hughes, especially his ``Some Kind of
Wonderful'' and ``16 Candles.''
</P>
<P>
   The character equation is shuffled a bit but it's essentially
the old familiar story: wealthy, handsome and smart Zack Siler
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) has just been dumped by his longtime
girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). She's the icon
``every girl wants to be, and every guy wants to nail.'' Zack
learns Taylor met a new guy over spring break and now it's only
eight weeks till the prom, and Zack needs a date.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a dare from his competitive, not-so-best friend, Dean
(Paul Walker), and agrees to transform the nerdiest, most
politically-conscious girl in the class into queen of the prom.
Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) lives on the wrong side of the
tracks, is working hard for an art scholarship, wears glasses and
is more concerned about what the king of Zimbabwe is doing to the
mountain gorillas than who will be crowned king of the senior
class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Zack comes to his senses because after a little
makeover by his savvy little sister, Mack (Anna Paquin), Laney
transforms from an ugly duckling into the swan. Too, he finds he
likes performance art better than being class president. But when
Taylor's new guy, Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), an egomaniacal
actor from the TV show, ``The Real World,'' dumps her, she has to
win Zack back and grab the regal title from new threat Laney.
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Iscove, whose credits include TV fare such as
``Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella,'' makes his feature film
debut. He has a strong choreographic eye and his work in musicals
lends a ``Rocky Horror Picture Show'' meets ``West Side Story''
pulse to the dance sequences at the prom. And in that, ``She's All
That'' is kind of fun.
</P>
<P>
   But the high school milieu is limited as far as new ideas. Every
teen movie that comes along recycles the same themes.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is very little that's fresh in ``She's All That,''
at least the presentation keeps the ho-hum material from feeling
stale. Still, it's hard to feel sorry for a guy who drives a Range
Rover to high school and who has been accepted at every prestigious
college from Dartmouth to Harvard and still feels like he's a
victim.
</P>
<P>
   She's All That. Directed by Robert Iscove. Written by R. Lee
Fleming Jr. Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew
Lillard, Paul Walker. Miramax Films. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

HOCKEY BOOSTERS HOPE TO BOOST AMERICANS' APPETITE FOR THE SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETE DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ All-star festivities bring out the best a league
has to offer. Certainly the National Hockey League put on its best
face last weekend for its midseason extravaganza in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hockey League is trying to do the same here for its
All-Star Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of cocktail parties, autograph sessions and
virtual-reality exhibits get those around hockey feeling good about
the sport. But is it a false sense of security?
</P>
<P>
   About the time Fox network returned the NHL to national
television four years ago, hockey was labeled the sport of the '90s
and beyond. Michael Jordan was playing baseball, putting the NBA in
a slump. Baseball canceled its World Series because of labor
problems. Even the NFL was fretting over its lack of compelling
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   So where is hockey's imprint? Fox's television ratings last
season fell 42 percent. ESPN's cable number dropped 13 percent. A
recent Sports Illustrated essay determined that golf is poised to
overtake hockey as America's fourth major sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad year last year,'' said John Davidson, a Fox
analyst and former New York Rangers goaltender. ``Let's face facts.
We had a real short Stanley Cup final. We had a mess at the
Olympics. There's a lot of different people who bear responsibility
for this. Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong last
year regarding the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight year, the best-of-7 Stanley Cup final
ended with the losing team failing to win even one game. A U.S.
Olympic team went to Japan in February as a co-favorite but
finished 1-3, after which several players trashed their rooms in
the athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic incident notwithstanding, hockey players are among
the most media- and fan-friendly professional athletes anywhere,
but America's public perception that they compete in an obscure
sport is hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madison Avenue has put some hockey players in commercials, but
those commercials only run during hockey broadcasts, where you're
preaching to the choir,'' said Ed Goren, executive producer of Fox
Sports. ``You'll know that there's some success and they've
developed personalities when you see an NHL player in a commercial
that runs during a football game, a basketball game, a baseball
game. You see it with other sports crossing over.''
</P>
<P>
   Until hockey is accepted into the mainstream of American sports,
it will be a hard climb.
</P>
<P>
   Most hockey players say they are avid fans of all sports. Yet
take a collection of people who claim to be serious sports fans,
and only a limited percentage follow hockey closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch ESPN `SportsCenter,''' said Robert Esche, a
goaltender for the AHL's Springfield Falcons. ``The thing that
ticks us off all the time is that there's so many football and
college basketball and baseball highlights, and they'll show like
two or three frigging hockey highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has a lot more people participating because you can play
no matter what your skill level,'' said Ken Gernander, a Minnesota
native who has played nearly 500 AHL games. ``In a lot of areas of
the country, playing hockey isn't even an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a northern pocket extending from Maine and ending in
Minnesota, there are few hockey hotbeds in this country. Supporters
of the sport say the NHL's expansion into new territories such as
Nashville, Atlanta and Florida will increase the interest base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing process,'' said Steve Guolla, a Canadian now
doing his AHL playing in the basketball hotbed of Lexington, Ky.
``They've never seen hockey before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't happen overnight,'' said Jon Coleman, a
Boston-born member of the Adirondack Red Wings. ``Kids have to get
interested and youth hockey programs have to be built up. It's
going to take a little more time to become a national sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen new arenas in a lot of cities around the country,''
Davidson said. ``The next generation of kids is starting to learn
the game at a young age and they have an understanding of it.
There's going to be a void between the time those kids grow up and
the kids who are adults now who watch. Through time, the next few
years we're going to have more people involved at all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the top level, hockey has more concerns than just
indoctrinating an American audience.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the perception that it is not a made-for-TV
sport. Fox, although it will relinquish network rights to ABC after
this season, invested millions to develop a glowing puck that's
easier to see on television screens. The network also was
progressive trying to find camera angles that show the game's
speed, which only on-site fans can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what Park Avenue may feel, there are people who
are involved with these teams whose only concern is their in-house,
live, ticket-paying audience,'' Fox's Goren said. ``In today's
world, you're maxed out on attendance. The only way to pay for the
escalating player salaries is to make it a better television
product, which translates into bigger rights fees and maybe greater
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is the development of stars. The NHL has had
several, headed by Wayne Gretzky, who may be in his final season,
and Mario Lemieux, who already retired.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has players with Hall of Fame talent but not necessarily
Gretzky-like personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next couple of years we are going to lose Wayne
Gretzky, Ray Bourque, Mark Messier,'' Davidson said. ``I hope the
young players coming up who are going to be the future stars, like
Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros, that they know and understand what
Messier, Gretzky and Bourque meant to the game. They're going to
have to share the responsibility of being there for the media, for
the public, to be part of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the players in this league are still from
Canada,'' Coleman said. ``It's just going to take a little bit of
time for hockey to keep growing. It grew a lot after the '80
Olympic Games. You see all these new college programs, the
different junior teams cropping up. With the East Coast league
getting bigger and bigger, kids are getting into hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey right now is on a great path,'' Esche contended. ``I
could be wrong, but to me it keeps getting bigger. Now that there
are teams all over, you're going to find songs written about
hockey. Hank Williams always sings about football, someday he's
going to be singing about hockey. It's something that's starting to
come out of the closet.''

 &HT;    SOME OF FBI'S MOST FAMOUS SEARCHES HAVE TAKEN YEARS
 &HT;    WITH RUDOLPH AND RUDOLPH-VIET
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, JAN. 31
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the recent annals of fugitives on the lam from the law, the
year-long manhunt for Eric Robert Rudolph is considered still in
its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   What sets the search for accused Atlanta and Birmingham bomber
Rudolph apart from most other manhunts is its focus. Federal posses
often cover the entire country, and sometimes the world, in their
pursuit of bad guys. The hunt for Rudolph is concentrated in about
30 square miles of rugged Nantahala Forest wilderness in western
North Carolina. But the difficulty of the terrain, and possibly
because Rudolph is receiving help from some local citizens, has
frustrated efforts of law enforcement to run him to ground.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the FBI or the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms or the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are
likely to give up any time soon. In fact, FBI Director Louis Freeh
has stated repeatedly that the task force hunting for Rudolph will
stay in the mountains as long as it takes to find him. If nothing
else, federal agents can be incredibly persistent. Among their most
noteable searches, many of which dwarf the longevity of the hunt
for Rudolph:
</P>
<P>
   -- It took a 40-agent task force18 years to track down and
arrest the ``Unabomber,'' who turned out to be an eccentric Harvard
graduate and former University of California mathematics professor
named Theodore ``Ted'' Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
   -- This Thanksgiving eve, it will be 28 years since fabled
hijacker D.B. Cooper plummeted into the night sky over the Pacific
Northwest with $200,000 in cash. He was never seen again, and may
be dead, but the file on him is still open.
</P>
<P>
   -- Leo Fredrick Burt also is approaching his 28th year on the
run. Burt is wanted in connection with the May 1971 bombing of a
building at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   -- Donald Eugene Webb, like Rudolph, is one of the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted. He has been on the run since December 1980, when he
allegedly shot and murdered a small-town police chief in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another long-time runner and FBI Most Wanted is Victor
Manueal Gerena. He is approaching 16 years on the loose after he
allegedly participated in a $7 million robbery in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the FBI's more notorious manhunts in the more distant
past were of relatively short duration.
</P>
<P>
   It took the feds little more than 18 months to track down and
kill Bonnie and Clyde and ``Pretty Boy'' Floyd in separate
incidents. And John Dillinger's crime spree lasted a mere nine
months.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Willy Loman started small.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the idea I started with, that Willy should be small
and his wife should be very big,'' said Arthur Miller, thinking
back on the first staging of ``Death of a Salesman,'' 50 years ago.
``So we tried to cast all the available little actors, but it soon
became apparent that the part was big; it required someone with
weight and size and heft. It's like our idea of him grew as soon as
we put him on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy is back in the hulking form of Brian Dennehy, whose
sagging bulk seems to fill up the entire doorway of his house, when
he is first glimpsed, sample bags in hand, in the new staging of
the play. It began previews on Broadway last week and opens Feb.
10, 50 years to the day after it was first staged at the Morosco
Theater with Elia Kazan directing and Lee J. Cobb starring.
</P>
<P>
   But when Arthur Miller, who was a young man of 33 when the play
opened in 1949, looks back on his most famous creation, it is with
a distinctly bittersweet tinge. Even more than the actors who
portray him, Willy Loman has grown over the years, metamorphosing
into one of the most familiar creations of the American
imagination: a figure as much a distinct sliver of the American
myth as Huck Finn, Stanley Kowalski or Jay Gatsby.
</P>
<P>
   What worries Miller, after a life dedicated to the intimate
revelations of the theater, is whether any playwright, no matter
how talented, will ever be able to take a character from the stage
to the heart of the culture in the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, so you would be foolish to write off the
possibility,'' said Miller, who at 83 still has the lanky frame,
craggy features and Brooklyn inflections of his youth. ``But a play
does not exist apart from its audience, and there's no longer a
mass audience for theater in this country. Plays now, in general,
are written for a very constricted audience, generally better
educated, more sophisticated. But the theater has been most vital,
most successful, when it's been aimed at a very demotic audience,
and it's hard to see that audience being re-created again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50th anniversary of ``Death of a Salesman'' provides an
opportunity for Miller to celebrate and reflect, to kvetch and wax
nostalgic, all of which he does with remarkable lack of pretension
for a man whose capsule biography usually has a phrase like
``greatest living American playwright'' thrown in somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was born in Harlem in 1915 and then moved with his family
to the Midwood section of Brooklyn. His father was a well-to-do
clothing manufacturer. His mother was the one in the family with
artistic instincts, and Miller grew up an indifferent student whose
passions leaned more toward baseball than literature. But in his
autobiography, ``Timebends,'' Miller talks of his first experience
of the stage at the Shubert Theater on Lenox Avenue, where he
learned almost unconsciously ``that there were two kinds of
reality, but that of the stage was far more real.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to the University of Michigan, and came back to New York
to become a playwright, fusing his instincts about the theater with
a vivid and innovative approach to narrative richly informed by his
own life story. That personal history included the sometimes harsh
give and take of his family, the ravages of the marketplace he saw
in his father's business and in his uncle Manny Newman's career as
a salesman, a career that ended in suicide, and the social and
spiritual dislocations left by the Depression. ``I've seen the
great ship go under, and once you've survived that you don't ever
forget it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His first Broadway play, ``The Man Who Had All the Luck,''
lasted all of four performances. His second, ``All My Sons,'' ran
for 300 performances. The drama, about a wartime industrialist who
must accept responsibility for manufacturing defective airplane
parts that ultimately led to the death of his airman son, won a New
York Drama Critics Circle Award in 1947. It took him six weeks to
write his third, which had been germinating for years. ``Death of a
Salesman'' ran for 742 performances on Broadway, won a Pulitzer
Prize and created a character so memorable that to Miller the
various incarnations of Willy Loman are like old friends: long gone
but so vividly remembered they seem alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Cobb had one thing; he was born sad,'' said Miller,
wearing black jeans and a striped shirt and lounging on a couch
beneath a Spanish religious figurine in the apartment he keeps on
the Upper East Side. ``He must have been a sad baby. He could laugh
and make you feel terrible. There was some majestic pathos in him
that fit this role very well. George Scott had great power and
enormous authority. So what you saw going down was a man who was
losing his authority, which was very effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dustin Hoffman was a little different peek at it. I think his
Willy started out looking more ordinary, but he grew as the part
went on, and all the emotions were tucked into that little body
he's got. He was a slightly dictatorial Willy, always ordering
people around. And Dennehy is a good combination of several
necessary elements. He's a wonderful actor, and he's got that
feeling of something of size, like something big being destroyed,
which is terribly important. And at the same time, he's got this
naivete, like when his smile breaks out and he seems to be enjoying
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, many others: the Swedish Willy, played by
Jarl Kulle; the Japanese Willy, who did it for 30 years, quit at 90
and recently passed the role on to another 60-year-old, who
presumably has 30 years ahead of him; the Italian Willy in a
sepia-toned poster photograph, looking like a striving, put-upon
middle-class paisan hunting for a parking space in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also has warm words for Elizabeth Franz's performance in
the new production as Linda, Willy's long-suffering wife. ``She's
mounted a kind of wonderful outrage I've never quite seen before,''
he said.

NEW YORK: before,'' he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willy's universality has been cited as part of the play's
appeal. It is not just beleaguered American strivers who try to get
by on a smile and a shoeshine, and even in the great boom of the
90s, the reality of castoff workers is every bit as relevant as it
was to the children of the Depression. But one of Miller's
strengths over the years has been to write plays able to find root
in various kinds of soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crucible,'' for example, used the Salem witchcraft trials
as a metaphor for the McCarthy era, but Miller recently wrote an
Op-Ed article for The New York Times extending the metaphor to the
political melodrama in Washington. He listens to radio broadcasts
with a measure of wonder and professional envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't dare put this together in a show; no one would
believe it,'' he said. ``If I'm going to believe what's going on in
the chamber, serious men debating where he touched her, it's like
something out of Kaufman and Hart. We are really below sea level on
this one, aren't we? But it invigorates the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing with absurd reality is the least of the challenges he
sees for the theater today. For all the acclaim won by his
best-known and most frequently staged plays, ``Death of a
Salesman,'' ``All My Sons,'' ``The Crucible'' and ``A View From the
Bridge,'' none of his recent plays _ like ``The Last Yankee,''
``Broken Glass,'' ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' ``The American
Clock,'' ``The Archbishop's Ceiling'' _ have been major successes
in the United States. The current 50th anniversary aside, Miller
remains far more an object of veneration in England, where his work
remains wildly popular, than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not alone in lamenting the plight of serious drama on
Broadway, particularly drama that originates there. But he comes to
the issue with an authority few others could muster. Asked if a
young Arthur Miller today could make a living as a playwright and
penetrate the broader culture to the same degree he could 50 years
ago, he gives an almost imperceptible shake of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for a serious play, unless it's got
some very large star, to come out of Broadway, the main stem of it
all,'' he said. ``You would never get the financing. We get our
plays from London, and we get them from theaters across the
country. I used to defend Broadway as the only place that
originated anything. Theaters in other places were only redoing
Broadway hits. It's the opposite now. Nothing starts on Broadway.
It doesn't have the vigor to initiate anything. So it's really in a
decayed position at the moment, and I don't see how it's ever going
to improve in our time. What we still do well is musicals, but
that's not theater. That's pure show business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question emerges how much this matters beyond the
provincial needs of the New York theater. If, for example, the
culture now gets its memorable, shared, metaphoric characters,
whether Michael Corleone or Forrest Gump or Rocky Balboa, from the
movies rather than the stage, is there a loss?
</P>
<P>
   T Miller, for all the grappling with big themes in his plays,
seems to have maintained a wry, forgiving eye for much of what he
sees. It's not necessarily true in the arts, where he looks at
television, for example, and grouses, ``I don't think a gorilla
could remain interested very long.'' But it seems to be true in the
world outside his window, whether at his home in Connecticut or his
apartment in New York, which is cluttered with books, random awards
and posters of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the theater is that anything can
happen,'' he said. ``Since it doesn't need the mechanization of
other performing arts, it changes overnight, for good or ill. So I
could imagine, suddenly, three terrific playwrights emerge, more or
less at the same time, and we're off to the races. I don't expect
to see it, but it could happen, against all odds. You couldn't
predict the collapse of Russia or that Clinton would be so popular
after all this. But it happened. This could happen too.''

<HEADLINE>
SON OF SLAVE OWNERS LOOKS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BERNADETTE FAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Promoting the paperback edition of his book
``Slaves in the Family,'' a chronicle of his family's legacy of
slave ownership, Edward Ball says it's easier this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds are bigger,'' he says, ``and the emotions are more
developed, not as raw.''
</P>
<P>
   Part archival research, part oral history, ``Slaves in the
Family'' is an examination of the Ball clan's past as a prominent
plantation family in Charleston, S.C. The book peels back the
family lore of benevolent masters to reveal the brutality of forced
labor that became the family business when the first Ball _ young
Elias ``Red Cap'' Ball _ arrived in Charleston from England in 1698
to inherit half a farm.
</P>
<P>
   During nearly 170 years, Edward Ball estimates, his family owned
about 4,000 slaves on 25 rice plantations, and their descendants in
America numbered 75,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of this chronicle belongs to those black people bought
and sold by the Ball family, or, in some cases, spun into the
lineage through sex. Again, patriarch Elias Ball seems to have led
the family by fathering five white children, and, apparently, two
children by his housekeeper, a slave named Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most often, by today's measurement, we would have to describe
it as rape,'' says Ball, 40, in a telephone interview from San
Diego. ``And yet there were relationships between black women and
white men that survived over time and produced a number of
children, and it would be disrespectful, to the women especially,
to describe those relationships exclusively as relationships of
exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball chooses his words carefully, treading cautiously in a
geography of race, sex, power and privilege. He has been criticized
for being too easy on slave owners; he has been criticized for
being too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book has stung some members of my family in a way that
cannot be healed,'' he says, ``and I regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every door that has closed, another has opened. For the
magic of ``Slaves in the Family'' is that it tells the stories long
missing from most African-American families. It allows these
descendants of diaspora the rare chance to look at their family
tree and put a name to each branch _ in one case all the way back
to 1756 and a girl herded off a slave galleon onto the docks of
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Her Ball owners named her Priscilla. She would be one of five
children bought by the Balls that day. More than 200 years later,
Edward Ball would track down and meet her descendants.
</P>
<P>
   What was it like, meeting these strangers with a common past, if
slave owner and slave can be said to have anything in common?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared when I started contacting people, and I continued
to be scared for a long time,'' Ball says. ``It still does make me
nervous to think about it. It seemed like a connection that had to
be made. It seemed it was worth the risk of being rejected, being
denounced, being accused of exploitation and all other kinds of
social risk. But the rewards of actually contacting people could be
important enough to make everything else moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the power of the encounters that I had with the African
Americans,'' Ball says. ``It felt like something larger than we
were. It felt like we were two electrical poles, pulsing, creating
a current or a charge of some kind. It was a jolt every time I had
another encounter with a family, an enormous cathartic jolt.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball was invariably met with suspicion by these families, some
still living hard by the plantations where their ancestors worked
and died, some as far away as Los Angeles and Philadelphia. But
after the suspicion, says Ball, was relief. Indeed, Ball's next
project is a collaboration with his Harleston cousins, prosperous
blacks who can trace their Ball kinship to the union of an
unmarried white rice planter and his black slave that produced
eight children. The Harlestons are an artistic bunch, something the
Balls decidedly are not. That appealed to Edward Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are artists and musicians who had a direct influence on
American popular culture,'' he says. ``It's not a continuation of
the book I just finished. It's the story of a prosperous Southern
black family over a period of five generations.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Ball comes back to the words ``story'' and
``storytelling'' to describe the three-year research project that
took him from his columnist's job at the Village Voice back to his
childhood haunts in South Carolina and then to Sierra Leone to try
and make sense of the inhuman flesh trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusually rich and long story,'' Ball says of his
genealogy, and he hoped he wouldn't ``botch'' the telling of it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. The book won a string of awards, including the
National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's one more look back, along with recent movies ``Amistad''
and ``Beloved'' and the buzz over Thomas Jefferson's relationship
with his slave Sally Hemmings, at the long and winding path through
the thicket of American slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Ball calls this surge of interest part of the vast ``unfinished
business'' of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, he says, are ``very happy to tell the Germans how to
make sense of their Nazi past ... and we're very happy to lecture
the South Africans about their history of exclusion and
disenfranchisement of African people, and yet we're not able to
incorporate the memory of slavery into our sense of who we are. It
deeply marks who we are as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, we have never had an honest reckoning
with the legacy of the plantations.''
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of the earnings from sales of the book go to
restitution projects Ball and family members are designing with
descendants of Ball slaves.

`FAMILY GUY': WHERE MATRICIDE IS A FAMILY VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little Stewie sits in his highchair playing with something that
looks like a toy ray gun. It is, in fact, the mind-control device
he is inventing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stewie, I said no toys at the table,'' his mother says as she
takes it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn you, vile woman!'' Stewie answers in his plummy British
accent, his eyes narrowing with his sinister thoughts. ``You've
impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.
When you least expect it your uppance will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The misfit child in a typical New England family, Stewie the
Killer Baby may be the most intelligent and wry television
character since Frasier Crane. They even have the same hairline,
not to mention common-sensical fathers who will never fathom their
urbane sons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Frasier, though, Stewie shoots at his mother from a
high-tech weapon hidden in his tuna sandwich, all part of his
dastardly plot to take over the world. A baby can dream, can't he?
</P>
<P>
   Stewie is the funniest character in the risky, rude, hilarious
new animated series ``Family Guy.'' And with the once-sterling
``Frasier'' in a slump this season, ``Family Guy'' stands to become
the best satire of all-American dysfunction next to ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   (``Family Guy'' will have a special preview on Fox after the
Super Bowl on Sunday night and begin its run in March.)
</P>
<P>
   If comparisons to ``Frasier'' and ``The Simpsons'' seem equally
comfortable, that suggests how well-written ``Family Guy'' is, and
how limiting it would be to see the series merely as part of the
copycat glut of prime-time animation (at least seven shows and
counting).
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Frasier,'' the series is a satire of class and culture in
America. And like ``The Simpsons,'' it takes full advantage of the
freedom animation offers: humans act on their ids and worst
impulses yet remain likable. A bumptious, irresponsible Dad like
Homer Simpson is lovable only because he is a cartoon, kept at a
nonthreatening distance from reality (or so we tell ourselves).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its similarities to other shows, ``Family Guy'' feels
wholly original. Stretching humanity to the breaking point, the
series reflects and at the same time explodes the image of the
American family.
</P>
<P>
   Today that image is more likely to be dysfunctional than
idealized, and to be shaped by movies and television as much as by
real-life neighbors. So the series' opening song echoes the off-key
Archie-Edith duet that began ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting around the piano are Peter Griffin, the portly, bumbling
guy of the title, and Lois, his kind but nasal-voiced wife,
singing, ``Where are those good old-fashioned values?''
</P>
<P>
   Laden with such swift jabs at pop culture, the first episode
begins with the Griffins watching ``The Brady Bunch,'' perfectly
drawn right down to Brady's ludicrous 1970s permed hair. In this
version, when Greg Brady tells a lie his father says, ``I'm afraid
your punishment will be four hours in the snake pit,'' and Greg
disappears through a trapdoor in the kitchen floor. His sister Jan
is locked in ``the chamber of fire,'' a blazing closet.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Bunch from hell is a pretty good setup for ``Family
Guy.'' Peter is underemployed and basically underqualified for
life. His 13-year-old son, Chris, shows every sign of becoming a
beer-swilling oaf to make his father proud.
</P>
<P>
   Meg, the frumpy teen-age daughter, dreams of collagen injections
for her lips. Brian is the family's talking dog, who raps Peter on
the nose with a newspaper to knock some sense into him. (Along with
Dogbert on the new series ``Dilbert,'' that makes too many smart
talking dogs on television.)
</P>
<P>
   Visually, everyone is drawn in broad strokes except Stewie,
whose head is shaped like a football. And since the other Griffins
have flat American voices, there's no explanation for Stewie's
accent except an overdose of old British movies.
</P>
<P>
   (Seth MacFarlane, 25, who created ``Family Guy'' and does
Stewie's voice, has declared his affection for Rex Harrison. But
Stewie's sense of melodrama, as well as his name, brings him closer
to the B-movie actor Stewart Granger.)
</P>
<P>
   If attempted matricide isn't rough enough, ``Family Guy'' takes
a politically incorrect approach to ethnic jokes. Some work: when a
black woman wearing a kerchief appears outside the window offering
pancakes, Peter points her out as one of those ``Jemima's
witnesses'' who are always showing up. Less inventive is the ``G.I.
Jew'' doll who complains about bagels.
</P>
<P>
   But a few misfired jokes are worth it; most of the risks in
``Family Guy'' pay off. In the first episode, Peter loses his job
and soon gets an erroneous welfare check worth $150,000. For a time
he lives luxuriously in the land of welfare fraud. Nothing is out
of bounds as this series gleefully undermines family sitcom
values. &QL;

A GLOBAL HEARTBEAT ON CDs 
(bl) 
By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   World music thrives on misunderstandings. As a marketing
category, it's a grand hodgepodge. The world-music bins of any
well-stocked store are likely to hold field recordings from remote
villages as well as pop songs concocted in 64-track digital
studios, and practitioners of traditional styles end up next to
hybrids of, say, didgeridoo and Brazilian percussion and
synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion may baffle new fans, but it's true to the history
of music, where no category stays intact very long.
</P>
<P>
   Music carries the traces of cultures as they meet, dance
together, struggle for pre-eminence or get together on the sly;
musicians steal each other's licks only to recast them in the mold
of their own traditions. The ever-evolving material might be a
deity's rhythm that travels back and forth across the Atlantic,
changing with each journey; it might be the way an electric guitar
is made to sound like a zither in one place, a thumb piano in
another, or bagpipes somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   World music can make a listener appreciate (and worry about the
survival of) isolated cultures. Yet it can also make listeners
marvel at the surprising things that happen when isolation ends and
musicians start to pick up foreign accents, bending what they
borrow into something new. American popular music is downright
provincial in its mass media, rejecting nearly everything with
lyrics that aren't in English.
</P>
<P>
   But while world music is ignored by commercial radio and
television, many listeners who discover it get hooked. Importers
and licensers and packagers of world music have created a small
world with a huge number of possibilities: sonic excursions as
close as a CD player. There's music for purists and
assimilationists, traditionalists and rock fans, and every few
years, another bit of the globe claims some shelf space: Pakistan,
Cape Verde, Ireland, Cuba and the musical cornucopia of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   One central source for international music is the World Music
Institute's new catalog of albums and videos, with thousands of
releases documenting mostly traditional music from Albania to
Zimbabwe; the institute's Web site is www.heartheworld.org.
</P>
<P>
   Major record-store chains, like Virgin, Tower and HMV, also
offer plenty of world music. Stern's (71 Warren St. in Manhattan's
Tribeca) is a reliable source of African music; Bate Records (140
Delancey St. on Manhattan's Lower East Side) and the mail order
house Descarga (718-693-2966, 800-377-2647 or www.descarga.com)
have a broad selection of Caribbean music, particularly from the
Spanish-speaking Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a selection of some of the best world-music releases of
the past year (and one from 1997): just a handful of destinations
for the ears. (CDs range in price from $15 to $19 for a single
domestic disk to $20 to $25 for an imported CD.)
</P>
<P>
   Algeria
</P>
<P>
   RACHID TAHA: ``Diwan'' (Island). Rachid Taha is one of the most
important voices of rai, Algerian rock with a confrontational
streak. He has lived in France for 30 years, beyond reach of
Algerian censors, and he has sung about the intolerance facing his
fellow immigrants and the loneliness of exiles. ``Diwan'' asserts
his cultural pride, reviving older songs from Algeria, Egypt and
Morocco and celebrating the history of rai. Meanwhile, the music
considers tradition with 1990's ears. Most of the time, hand drums
drive the music's terse but unfolding melodies, and Taha's rough,
ardent voice is answered by oud, flute or Arabic-style strings. And
every so often, a programmed drumbeat or a wah-wah guitar slips
into the mix, only making the songs sound more biting and fervent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas
</P>
<P>
   ``THE REAL BAHAMAS, VOLS. 1 AND 2'' (Nonesuch). Musicians were
immediately smitten with these recordings when Volume I appeared in
1966. It was a collection of gospel songs and hymns, radically
adapted to Afro-Caribbean timing and delivery, with raw, ebullient
voices building call-and-response harmonies full of rhythmic moxie.
Guitarists like Ry Cooder and Taj Mahal studied the hide-and-seek
syncopations of Joseph Spence, who always placed a chord where it
was least expected; the Grateful Dead and the Incredible String
Band both learned the Pinder Family's version of ``I Bid You Good
Night.'' But none of the imitators could match the verve of the
original recordings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil
</P>
<P>
   CAETANO VELOSO: ``Livro'' (Polygram, Brazilian import). Caetano
Veloso is one of the greatest songwriters of the century: a master
melodist, a lyricist who merges surreal imagery with a sense of
history and a sense of humor, a singer whose voice radiates
tenderness and supple swing and a musician who connects to
traditional music, pop and jazz from all over. ``Livro''
(``Book''), which was released in 1998 along with Veloso's
autobiography, floats endearing melodies over a subtly remarkable
array of backups: sambas and 12-tone lines, Bahian drum choirs and
electric-guitar funk. Looking inward, Veloso contemplates a world
of musical ideas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BELO VELLOSO: ``Um Segundo'' (Velas, Brazilian import). This
young Brazilian singer brings a warm, guileless voice to
immaculately graceful pop. The album's dozen pop songs touch on
Brazilian styles like bossa nova, forro and pagode samba, and bring
a Brazilian subtlety to borrowings from reggae, salsa, funk and
nuevo flamenco. The arrangements maintain a light touch while Ms.
Velloso caresses the melodies, making the songs seem to come
straight from the heart.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOM ZE: ``Fabrication Defect'' (Luaka Bop). Tom Ze may be
Brazil's most impish songwriter. Like his fellow members of
Brazil's tropicalia movement, he thinks about semiotics and
multinational capitalism as well as the imperatives of romance and
carnival. He puts together ingenious vamps and engaging tunes, then
knocks them off-center with a shifty beat or an unexpected noise,
finding beauty in the disruption. He has often been compared to
Frank Zappa, but he's more melodic and far more concise, coming up
with sweet-and-sour songs that tease before they spring their
surprises. An album of remixes of his songs by fans including John
McEntire of Tortoise, Sean Lennon, the High Llamas and Amon Tobin
is due this spring.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon
</P>
<P>
   ANTHOLOGY OF WORLD MUSIC: ``Africa: The Ba-Benzele Pygmies''
(Rounder). Rounder Records has been reissuing CD versions of albums
from the remarkable series of ethnomusicological recordings that
were released by Unesco from 1968 to 1987, and academics aren't the
only ones who should hear them. The Ba-Benzele Pygmies, nomadic
hunters who live in the rain forest where the Central African
Republic meets Cameroon, are rhythm wizards whose hunting songs,
stories and even lullabies sound like a perpetual party. They
create astonishing lattices of rhythm: vocal parts that yodel and
leap, quick call-and-response choral singing, layer upon layer of
polyrhythm, all using nothing more high-tech than voices,
percussion and whistles. It's beautifully cooperative music, with
soloists and choruses and percussionists interlocking in grand
designs. The individual voices are strong and vivid, the ensemble
singing would challenge even a gospel choir, and the drumming
builds unstoppable grooves. The only shortcoming of this recording
is that it's monophonic; stereo would have made heads spin. &QL;

   Congo
</P>
<P>
   SAMBA NGO: ``Metamorphosis'' (Compass). Congo gave the world
some of the most exuberant guitar music anywhere: soukous, built on
reclaimed rumba rhythms and twinkling intertwined guitar lines.
Samba Ngo, a Congolese guitarist and singer who now lives in the
San Francisco Bay Area, has been pushing soukous in pan-African
directions, incorporating Nigerian Afro-Beat, reggae, Zimbabwean
thumb-piano music, and some dance-music electronics. In his genial
voice, he sings serious lyrics about the strife in his homeland,
but the music stays buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba
</P>
<P>
   ``PINARENO: FROM THE TOBACCO ROAD OF CUBA'' (Alula). Cuba fields
some of the world's slickest and most startling dance bands, among
them the highly recommended Los Van Van, David Calzado and Charanga
Habanera, Manolito y Su Trabuco, NG La Banda and Paulito y Su
Elite. But far outside Havana, near the plantations where tobacco
is grown for cigars, bands also stay in practice playing for the
farm workers. This collection, recorded in the tobacco country of
Pinar del Rio, features local bands who make up in exuberance what
they lack in polish; they conserve slightly older styles than urban
bands do, and their voices sound approachable rather than
superhuman, though the rhythms still jump. Don't miss Grupo el
Organo Pinareno, whose wooden-piped organ sounds like a salsa
calliope.
</P>
<P>
   Finland
</P>
<P>
   LOITUMA: ``Things of Beauty'' (Northside). These
conservatory-trained Finnish musicians probably sound more polished
than the original performers of their folk songs; in exchange, they
bring the music an angelic purity. Four women harmonize in ethereal
voices, accompanied by the chiming tones of a five-string harp and
an occasional fiddle. The melodies are kin to Celtic and medieval
music, ranging from jaunty waltzes to sustained, otherworldly
chorales that seem to float between centuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greece
</P>
<P>
   ``MOURMOURIKA: SONGS OF THE GREEK UNDERWORLD 1930-1955''
(Rounder). Criminal types have patronized musical innovations from
tango to jazz to reggae. In Greece, too, outlaws had music they
could call their own: the rembetika, a story-song accompanied by
string instruments like bouzouki, guitar or the smaller lute called
the baglamas. The songs on this collection have a hard-bitten,
clandestine tone, sung in voices that have seen their share of
trouble. And the translations of the lyrics spin scenarios that
gangsta rappers would recognize: gambling, smoking dope, shootouts
with cops, woman trouble. The recording quality varies, from a few
worn 78-RPM. disks to fairly high fidelity, and despite the
bare-bones arrangements, the music suggests that Norman Mailer was
wrong: tough guys do dance.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti
</P>
<P>
   BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS: ``Revolution'' (Tuff Gong International).
Boukman Eksperyans builds its songs on traditional Haitian and
African drumbeats, many of them from rural styles of voodoo. Above
that foundation, anything can show up: guitar power chords, reggae
backbeats or age-old call-and-response vocals. The songs' lyrics,
sung in Haitian Creole (or Kreyol) with occasional bits of English,
insist war must end, urge Haitians to resist ``industrialism,
imperialism and monopolism'' and, in a song that dominated Haiti's
last carnival, mock corrupt politicians. There are a few too many
pompous synthesizers, but the ancient rhythms and the singers' raw,
troubled voices make the songs ring with passionate commitment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia
</P>
<P>
   ``KALIMANTAN: DAYAK RITUAL AND FESTIVAL MUSIC'' (Smithsonian
Folkways). Smithsonian Folkways has been releasing a monumental
series of carefully recorded music from all over Indonesia, with
extensive notes and plenty of selections that non-specialists can
enjoy. Scattered across an archipelago of 13,000 islands,
Indonesian villagers maintain a huge array of traditional styles,
many of them previously unrecorded. The 17th volume presents music
from central and southern Borneo: somber choral songs; peppy,
syncopated ensembles of gongs and bamboo tubes, and the utilitarian
drumming and singing of a shaman ritual, including the sound of the
shaman singing with a spirit's voice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran
</P>
<P>
   KAYHAN KALHOR: ``Scattering Stars Like Dust'' (Traditional
Crossroads). Kayhan Kalhor gives the kemancheh, a Persian fiddle
played upright, an extraordinary workout in the three long
improvisations on this album. Playing alone, or accompanied by
Pejman Hadadi on the tombak (hand drum), Kalhor turns little riffs
and lines into dizzying extrapolations, full of suspense, insistent
rhythms and breakneck virtuosity. He plucks shifting, percussive
accents; he plays somber melodies; he lingers over buzzing tremolos
and then races to the far reaches of his range. With no more than
two musicians, the music is stark but riveting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ireland
</P>
<P>
   SOLAS: ``Words That Remain'' (Shanachie). Solas, a
fleet-fingered Irish traditional band that features Seamus Egan on
stringed instruments and whistles, brings out the kinship of Irish
and American tunes on its latest album. With Woody Guthrie's
``Pastures of Plenty'' and a guest vocal by Iris DeMent, Solas
provides some reminders of the Celtic-Appalachian connection. But
its jigs and reels retain the combination of assertiveness and
delicacy that marks the best Irish traditional music.
</P>
<P>
   Israel-New York
</P>
<P>
   THE KLEZMATICS AND CHAVA ALBERSTEIN: ``The Well''
(Xenophile/Green Linnet). Chava Alberstein is an Israeli singer
whose hits follow the conventions of pop anthems everywhere. But on
``The Well,'' she moves away from pop and collaborates with the
Klezmatics, a New York band that extends klezmer tradition with
touches of jazz and funk. Ms. Alberstein smooths the band's more
raucous tendencies, while the Klezmatics pull her away from pop
orchestrations to sing alongside accordion and clarinet and fiddle,
letting her reveal all the subtleties of her pensive, compassionate
voice. Together, they unveil new songs based on texts by leading
Yiddish poets: tales of longing, loss and a search for identity.

</P>
<P>
   PAOLO CONTE: ``The Best of Paolo Conte'' (Nonesuch). A gruff
smoker's voice, a piano style that wanders from honky-tonk to tango
palace to tony cabaret, and a weathered romantic's world view have
made Paolo Conte a well-known songwriter in Italy. This survey of
his songs, re-recorded with cannily arranged small bands featuring
fisarmonica (Italian accordion), guitar or saxophone, introduces a
wily European character to an American audience. The translated
lyrics capture his incorrigible mixture of seduction and nostalgia.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar
</P>
<P>
   TARIKA: ``D'' (Xenophile/Green Linnet). Madagascar, the island
in the Indian Ocean known for its unique flora and fauna, has
home-grown instruments that are just as unusual: the valiha, the
marovany and the kabosy, bright-toned zithers and lutes that are
plucked in transparent, marvelously intricate patterns. Tarika has
made itself Madagascar's pop ambassador to the Western world,
adding electric guitar and other Western touches to Malagasy music,
but it holds on to the music's charm and its breezy momentum. The
title of Tarika's new album, ``D,'' stands for dance. On it, the
band remakes some Malagasy dance hits alongside its own tunes, and
the music's perpetual-motion rhythms could make anyone want to
learn how to dance the salegy or the tsapika.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico
</P>
<P>
   JUAN GABRIEL: ``Con Banda . . . El Recodo'' (BMG U.S. Latin).
Juan Gabriel, one of Mexico's most popular singers, periodically
hooks up with old-fashioned ensembles like mariachi groups and, on
this album, a banda: one of the brass bands that parades through
town squares, oom-pahing and tootling with grand disregard for the
niceties of being perfectly in tune. He went to the heartland of
banda music, Sinaloa, to hook up with Banda El Recodo. Singing
about love going wrong, Gabriel emotes emphatically, with a sob and
a smile in his voice. Most of the songs use the classic banda
style, waltzing and strutting, while a few try brassy versions of
doo-wop and calypso. Even as Gabriel suffers the pains of love, the
clarinets are laughing his troubles away. It's a short album _ only
33 minutes long _ but a lot of fun.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morocco and Beyond
</P>
<P>
   ``HAMDULILLAH: FEZ FESTIVAL OF WORLD SACRED MUSIC, VOL. 2''
(Sounds True). The recorded memento of the ecumenical Festival of
World Sacred Music held in Fez, Morocco, wisely concentrates on
performers in Arabic and Middle Eastern traditions. One after
another, men and women raise their extraordinary voices in devout
song: meditative music from Turkish whirling dervishes and Indian
dhrupad singers, gracious melodies from Andalusia and gutsy,
impassioned, lavishly ornamented improvisations from Iraq,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Morocco. Although the music was recorded
live at outdoor shows, the sound is detailed and remarkably
intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar
</P>
<P>
   KYAW KYAW NAING: ``Pat Waing: The Magic Drum Circle of Burma''
(Shanachie). Music from Myanmar, formerly Burma, can baffle
Western-trained ears. The melodies hop around, scamper ahead,
circle through a repeating line, speed up and ease off, or pause
before leaping off in a brand-new direction; asymmetry rules.
Burmese music, like such other Southeast Asian music as Indonesian
gamelan music, uses all sorts of tuned percussion instruments.
Among them is the pat waing, a circle of 21 tuned drums played by
one musician, with tones so pure they sound almost electronic. The
pat waing, played by Kyaw Kyaw Naing, is at the center of the music
on this album. It's used for speedy, bubbly solo pieces, alongside
other percussion instruments, or in tandem with the Western piano
(played in a purely Burmese way, with its own skittering lines).
Duets for pat waing and the oboelike hne have the flexibility and
friskiness of Ornette Coleman's jazz. The tunes are exhilarating,
footloose and impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   KING SUNNY ADE: ``Odu'' (Atlantic/Mesa). King Sunny Ade was one
of world music's revelations when his albums appeared
internationally in the 1980's, and he has released countless albums
since then. But he's not to be taken for granted. He and his
African Beats _ his big band of guitars, drums, keyboards, singers
and dancers _ remain one of the world's most satisfying ensembles,
intertwining rhythm and riff in music that bubbles and kicks behind
his sweetly understated voice. ``Odu'' captures the group in all
its clockwork genius, letting listeners hear all the internal
colloquy of hand drums and stick drums, high and low guitars and
plush choral vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and Beyond
</P>
<P>
   ``HOMMAGE A NUSRAT FATEH ALI KHAN'' (Network, German import).
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who died in 1997, introduced the world
outside Pakistan to the driving, spiraling, hand-clapping
improvisations of qawwali: ecstatic songs devoted to the saints of
Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam. Related forms exist across the
Islamic world, and this double album brings together some of the
leading performers from Syria and Senegal, Iran and Kurdistan, as
well as Pakistan, offering tributes and memorials to Khan. The
songs are prayers, elegies and joyous incantations. As they pay
homage to qawwali's towering figure, Mehr and Sher Ali _ brothers
who, like Khan, are in qawwali's Punjabi school _ and some of
Khan's cousins show that the style will endure.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines
</P>
<P>
   ``UTOM: SUMMONING THE SPIRIT'' (Rykodisc). The T'boli, a tribe
in southwest Mindanao in the Philippines, are Minimalists without
the college degrees. Playing lute, tuned gongs, fiddle, zither or
wooden flute, they cast natural sounds _ birdcalls, rushing winds _
into short musical cells, then build them into pieces that use the
repetition of just a few notes to propel and hypnotize. These
skillful field recordings place the listener close to the
instruments, capturing precise nuances of tone; now and then, a
tropical bird chirps along with the austerely compelling music.

UNDATED: compelling music. 
  &HT;    Portugal and Beyond &HT;    ``ONDA SONORA: RED HOT AND LISBON'' (Sonovis, Portuguese import;
an American release is likely this year). Five centuries ago,
Portugal built a colonial empire that stretched from Brazil to
Angola to Macao, and music traveled along with slaves and goods.
The empire left behind an esthetic that prized saudade, the wistful
sadness that permeates bossa nova, Portuguese fado and Cape Verdean
morna.
 &HT;    This album, part of a series of benefit albums for AIDS
education and relief, brings together some of the far-flung results
of that empire, with musicians from Portugal, Brazil, Africa and a
few ringers from the United States (K.D. Lang, David Byrne) and
England (Durutti Column).
 &HT;    The musicians mix and match, with plenty of African-Brazilian
collaborations and styles from an ethereal version of fado to
driving carnival drumming to lilting African pop to dance-hall rap
in Portuguese over a samba beat: world music that dances across
national boundaries.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Zimbabwe
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STELLA CHIWESHE: ``The Healing Tree: The Best of Stella
Chiweshe'' (Shanachie). Stella Chiweshe was the first woman to make
a career of playing the mbira, the thumb piano that's at the center
of Zimbabwe's traditional and rock music. She sings in an earthy
voice, like a gospel singer who can also ululate, and she meshes
the intricate, plinking patterns of her mbira with marimbas and
guitars.
 &HT;    As she sings about spirits and social responsibilities, the
patterns pile up with so much kinetic intensity that in songs like
``Vana Vangu,'' the music simply levitates.

`THE 24-HOUR WOMAN': WORKING 9 TO 5 IN DAYDREAMS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk shows and women's magazines are full of the
matters raised by Nancy Savoca in her new film, ``The 24-Hour
Woman,'' in which a woman with a high-powered job tries to cope
with the high-powered hassles of balancing career and family. But
somebody on the other side of the camera has clearly been here and
done this, and boy, does it show on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicating the film to her own mother, Ms. Savoca describes the
joy and frustration of new motherhood in workaday detail, right
down to the last unmade bed. ``Nobody threw food around!'' one
woman marvels about office life, returning to the work force after
having stayed home bringing up children for a long spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' which had its world premiere at the
Sundance Film Festival last Friday, is also the opening feature for
``The Feminine Eye: Twenty Years of Women's Cinema,'' the
ambitious, far-reaching series that began Thursday at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music Rose Cinemas. It's nothing if not a topical,
well-intentioned way to begin this program, presented by both the
academy and New York Women in Film and Television.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Savoca's film joins Sally Potter's ``Orlando,'' Julie Dash's
``Daughters of the Dust,'' Euzhan Palcy's ``Sugar Cane Alley,''
Jane Campion's ``Sweetie,'' Claire Denis' ``Chocolat,'' Agnieszka
Holland's ``Angry Harvest'' and Barbara Kopple's ``American
Dream,'' among others, as films so alert to the experiences and
sensibilities of women that they could never be mistaken for the
work of men. Even in Ms. Kopple's anatomy of a strike at a
meat-packing plant, there is a particular awareness of hardship for
the strikers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   These are films that aren't likely to gloss over serious
concerns with brutish, escapist fantasy. It's also unlikely that
any man would humorously incorporate a breast-pump scene, as Ms.
Savoca does here.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to report that Ms. Savoca, whose ``True Love''
belongs high on any list of films rich in womanly wisdom and whose
``Household Saints'' and ``Dogfight'' were no less fearless, had
made the most of such a golden opportunity to hit a nerve. But
``The 24-Hour Woman'' is an unexpectedly strained farce, and not
often a very credible one at that.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of a long, classic comedy-of-errors
sequence about a working mother racing to her child's first
birthday party, the film is otherwise a homey compendium of
feminist talking points laced with awkward satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is deal with the little everyday stuff,''
says the film's heroine, Grace Santos (Rosie Perez), echoing the
filmmaker's outlook. ``The little everyday stuff that drives us
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The world in which Grace means to do this is that of daytime
television, where she has had a hyperactive career directing a zany
women's show. The handsome host happens to be Grace's husband,
Eddie Diaz (Diego Serrano), so it is seen as a huge ratings boon
when Grace becomes pregnant and the blessed event becomes
television fodder. On a show that runs stories like an expose about
pantyhose, Grace's pregnancy is big news.
</P>
<P>
   In a screenplay written with her longtime collaborator, Richard
Guay, Ms. Savoca describes the different stages of ambivalence that
herald the birth.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Grace's boss (Patti LuPone) is hard-driving
and unhelpful, that Grace's mother-in-law is discreetly meddlesome,
or that Eddie remains an on-the-air dreamboat while Grace flails
and loses confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it help that despite the huge metamorphosis of
impending motherhood, Grace does her best to resist change. She
clings to work yet feels the thrill of maternity, and to the film's
credit it has no easy answers about such mixed feeling.
</P>
<P>
   What's best about ``The 24-Hour Woman'' is its refusal, most of
the time, to buy into Hollywood's usual happily-ever-after
solutions to this very contemporary dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Far less successful are the film's feeble efforts to send up an
already self-satirizing species of television show. (``You know
what? We gotta do a segment: `Baby Fever!' Who gets it, and why?'')
</P>
<P>
   And its use of supporting characters as straw men and women also
robs the story of life. Eddie is vain and preoccupied, leaving
Grace to pick up the slack. Grace's new assistant, Madeline
(Marianne Jean-Baptiste), is too conveniently her opposite, as a
woman who has stayed home with children and now wants to resume her
career. And Madeline's husband, played with amusing exasperation by
Wendell Pierce, is the obligatory househusband the screenplay
requires for balance.
</P>
<P>
   For all the film's rumpled realism, these characters too often
operate like chess pieces rather than flesh and blood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The 24-Hour Woman'' goes on ruefully to watch Grace at home
with the new baby, stuck in a home that looks as if a tornado had
hit it, while Eddie's perky television partner (Karen Duffy) laughs
and frolics on the air. Then it sends her back to work, confronts
her with the problem of nanny envy, and arrives at a pinnacle of
domestic disaster with that aforementioned birthday-party sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood and workaholism collide spectacularly as Grace works
later than she should have, races to get a present just in time to
see the last flavor-of-the-month toy being sold to someone else,
can't find a taxi and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's final desperate measure _ having the nanny videotape
counterfeit party scenes so that it will look for posterity as if
Grace made it home on time _ makes for an emblematic image of
late-1990s motherhood that will not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez is vigorous, though never entirely convincing in the
film's workplace scenes. But by the last half-hour, nobody could be
persuasive in this role. The story contrives such a heavy-handed
on-the-air crisis for Grace and Eddie that it would be hard to
think of anything less credible, unless it's the Band-Aid
resolution pasted on afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The ending is encouraging, but it also betrays the film's
overall message. In leaping from the real world to an idealized
one, ``The 24-Hour Woman'' loses track of its most important
thought about mixing work and parenthood. It's not this easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 24-Hour Woman'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes brief sexual situations and
much more profanity than the material warrants.

GREENSPAN ON SOCIAL SECURITY FIX: HIGHER TAXES, LOWER BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Thursday that taxes will have to be raised or benefits cut to fix
the nation's Social Security system permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also urged Congress to consider raising the retirement
age and lowering annual cost-of-living increases as part of any
plan aimed at expanding the life of the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Unless changes are made, Social Security will not be able to pay
out the full amount of benefits beginning in 2032 when there will
likely fewer workers paying into the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all likelihood, (Social Security) taxes will have to be
raised or benefits cut, given that the system as a whole is still
significantly underfunded,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said later that ``we
could not agree with him more on the fact that we need to do more.
The president has made clear that he needs to work with Congress in
order to reform. In addition to reserving the surplus and paying
down the debt, we need to do more to reform the system. And we look
forward to having that debate with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman praised President Clinton's plan to put aside
62 percent of the projected federal budget surplus over the next 15
years to bolster the system, saying it ``represents a major step in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But he reiterated his opposition to Clinton's plan for the
government to invest 25 percent of the Social Security surplus in
the stock market. Greenspan said there would be no way to insulate
investment decisions from political pressures and that investing
trillions of government money in the stock market could crowd out
private money, which could damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large surpluses over the next 15 years, if they actually
materialize, can significantly reduce the fiscal pressures created
by our changing demographics,'' Greenspan said. But he cautioned
lawmakers on fashioning a Social Security fix largely or wholly on
projected budget surpluses because, he said, they may not
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-as-you-go Social Security system is funded by payroll
taxes that are taken from current workers' paychecks and given to
current retirees. The system is also supported by a trust fund
invested in government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As the large baby boom generation begins retiring over the next
decades, the trust fund is projected to run out of money in 2032.
At that point, unless something is done, the system would not be
able to make full payments to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton outlined his plan to shore up the system in his
State of the Union speech last week, Social Security reform has
become a major topic on Capitol Hill. Several lawmakers, including
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., and Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, are working on their own plans aimed at
keeping Social Security fully funded beyond 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, $2.7 trillion of the projected $4.4
trillion federal surplus, would be used to bolster Social Security
over the next 15 years. He also proposed investing $700 billion of
the $2.7 trillion in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Social Security, he proposed setting aside $500
billion from the surplus to allow low- and middle-income people to
set up their own individual retirement accounts by investing in
stocks and bonds. The general idea of allowing individuals to
invest some of the money they pay in Social Security taxes in
securities has been endorsed by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who headed a commission that succeeded in boosting
the viability of Social Security in 1983, warned lawmakers that
raising payroll taxes could be ``burdensome'' and said they also
need to look at increasing the retirement age. The current Social
Security retirement age is 65, but beginning next year it will
gradually increase to age 67 by 2022. Last year legislation that
would have gradually raised the retirement age to 70 failed in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also said lawmakers could adjust the consumer price
index that is used to determine annual cost-of-living increases in
Social Security and government programs. He and several other
economists have said that the index, which was adjusted slightly
last year, still overstates annual price increases by about 1
percentage point.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dein Perry has upped the ante exponentially in
``Steel City,'' which opened its 40-city American and Canadian tour
on Tuesday night at Radio City Music Hall. Perry, the creator of
the smaller and more intimate ``Tap Dogs,'' crams the Music Hall
stage with steel stairways, huge steel grids that get flipped every
which way, and trucks and cars of all descriptions. A steel-mesh
front curtain rises and descends, and an immense reflecting disk
opens to frame the show's culminating rock-club scene. Colored
lights and smoke are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   To match this scale, the Australian tap choreographer, dancer
and director has assembled a company of 21 dancers who are
accompanied by a four-man rock band perched high above the action.
Their music and the dancers' taps are heavily miked. What emerges,
along with the big production values, is 90 minutes of sounds: taps
hitting steel stairs, grids and the sides of the various trucks and
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Also in scale are the long lines of synchronized tappers that
sometimes split, excitingly, into smaller ranks like skaters'
whirling group combinations. Dancers slide down a very steep
incline formed by the tipping floor of a truck. They leap from one
steel cage to another as forklifts move the cages up and down. They
bounce against and dangle from high up on the front curtain.
</P>
<P>
   There is a scenario of sorts, with the men playing workers at a
large factory or high-tech garage. They punch in at a clock, put on
their work clothes and construction helmets and dance through the
day, sneaking visits with their girlfriends before reassembling for
more hard dancing at the rock club that night. One waits, however,
for the whole thing to turn into a lavish television ad for upscale
jeans or bargain car tires.
</P>
<P>
   Perry does attempt humanizing moments with a few smaller,
quieter routines, though not very strenuously or with much
confidence. Best of all is his own rough-edged, buoyant tapping as
the factory supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The score is by Tim Finn, with set design by Brian Thomson,
lighting by Trudy Dalgleish and costumes by Michael Wilkinson.

BUCHANAN BRINGS FRESH AIR TO STALE SUPER BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Ray Buchanan arrived at just the right time, etching
himself between the this-coach-hates-that-coach angle and the
actual kickoff of Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   He's a shot of inspiration, a compelling character in a week
when just about anything is considered interesting. He's fresh, and
that counts for plenty because the Super Bowl gets stale long
before it ever begins.
</P>
<P>
   What Buchanan, the Atlanta Falcons' left cornerback, has done is
steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has taken the spotlight away from the everlasting feud
between Mike Shanahan, John Elway and Dan Reeves and we thank him
for that. That issue is just about dead. Terrell Davis is the
league's most valuable player and Jamal Anderson is Atlanta's star
runner, but neither can compete with Buchanan right now because
they don't wear studded dog collars at interview sessions. Elway,
even leading up to what's supposed to be his last game, is just
Elway. Even he seems bored with himself.
</P>
<P>
   So we are left with Denver Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe as
the only legitimate contender to Buchanan's title, and even Sharpe
admitted that his opponent has top billing at this point. All
Sharpe had to do was ask a group of reporters one question:
``Anybody ever heard of Ray Buchanan before he got to Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing started with a prediction. Call it a joke,
because that's how Buchanan and his Falcons view it. Buchanan was
doing a televised interview for HBO's ``Inside the NFL'' last week
when Cris Collinsworth asked him if he thought the Falcons would
win. Buchanan said yes. He did it in a roundabout way, but enough
people who saw it figured this was Broadway Joe and the Jets in
this city all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guarantee is full of confidence,'' Buchanan said. ``We're
a football team that is coming in here believing in ourselves.
There's a lot of buildup to actually giving a guarantee for a win.
But the guarantee is about the fact that we believe in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he hasn't backed down, Buchanan embodies what these
Falcons are all about. They aren't cocky _ you can't be that when
you have this team's horrendous history. They're ebullient,
enjoyable, and one of their few drawbacks is that more of them
can't be as interesting as Buchanan has been this week.
</P>
<P>
   For now, we'll take Buchanan because lately he's talking as well
as he's playing. That's the thing about this guy who no one ever
heard of before this season. The man can play.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was easily the Falcons' most important acquisition
after quarterback Chris Chandler prior to last season. In four
seasons with Indianapolis, he had proven himself an adept coverage
corner and the Falcons hadn't had one of those since Deion Sanders
left town.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan made Jerry Rice irrelevant in a divisional playoff win.
Randy Moss roasted secondaries throughout the season, then faced
Buchanan and caught just one pass for 4 yards in the second half of
Atlanta's upset victory over Minnesota in the NFC Championship
Game. He earned his first Pro Bowl and he's earned the right to
chirp a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand where I'm living on the football
field anyway,'' Buchanan said. ``I'm playing on an island out there
and I'm feeling like Gilligan so I can go out there and hold my
own. I believe you can say what you want and then hopefully, you
can back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan can back it up. So can the Falcons, even if people
aren't as excited about them as they would be about the Vikings.
And now that Buchanan has garnered his fair share of the media's
attention, here's hoping he has a few more tricks left to unveil.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it would be one thing if Buchanan just arrived in
Miami and started spouting off blather to prove the Falcons weren't
scared. Instead, what he's done is make people notice his resume
and realize this man was a star before he stepped onto this stage.

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT'S NEW IN HOME VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>

   `A Brief History' To `Zebrahead' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every January independent film celebrates its high season at the
Sundance Film Festival, now in its 15th annual session, in Park
City, Utah. This year, in need of an independent infusion itself,
home video checked in, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-way collaboration, the Sundance Channel, New Video
and Critics Choice Video have gathered 99 Sundance films and are
offering them as a special package on the Internet at the Sundance
Filmstore (www.sundancefilmstore.com).
</P>
<P>
   The list begins with Francois Girard's ``Thirty-Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould'' (1993) and proceeds alphabetically from ``A
Brief History of Time'' (1991), Errol Morris' documentary about
Stephen Hawking, to Anthony Drazan's ``Zebrahead'' (1992), about
the tribulations of a racially mixed group of students.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way are a mix of documentaries and dramas, many of
them of the small, intense variety one expects to find along the
festival circuit. Tom DiCillo's ``Box of Moonlight'' (1996), with
John Turturro as a man on a journey to find himself, and ``Big
Night'' (1995), with Stanley Tucci, are included, as are Adam
Egoyan's ``Exotica'' (1994), Joel Coen's ``Blood Simple'' (1984),
Mira Nair's ``Mississippi Masala'' (1991) and Todd Solondz's
``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $9.99 to $24.95 each. If you're feeling
especially expansive, the entire collection is $1,360.77. Or one
can choose groups of five films according to category. Sundance
Audience Awards make up two groups: documentary and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are five grand jury prize winners: ``Blood Simple,''
Nancy Savoca's ``True Love,'' Edward Burns' ``Brothers McMullen,''
Victor Nunez's wonderful ``Ruby in Paradise,'' about a young woman
who deserts Tennessee for a new life in Panama City, Fla., and Kayo
Hatta's ``Picture Bride,'' the story of a Japanese woman renovating
her life through an arranged marriage in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories include black directors, Australian movies,
first feature films shown at Sundance (for example, Quentin
Tarantino's ``Reservoir Dogs'').
</P>
<P>
   Some groupings go outside the festival: Hong Kong action, for
instance, five films by Akira Kurosawa and ``docs that rock'': five
music documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the collections of five range from $52.77 to
$123.77. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Indies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While it has no connection to Sundance, a new Web site put up by
the video chain West Coast Entertainment (www.moviebuff.com) also
features independent films (albeit not to the exclusion of big
studio titles), with panel discussions and comments.
</P>
<P>
   In a column called Off Hollywood by Michael Sauter, it is
suggested that the 1999 Academy Awards might resemble those of
1996, when independent films won so many Oscar nominations. Then it
was ``Fargo'' and company. Now it's ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``Gods
and Monsters,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Central Station,'' ``Life Is
Beautiful'' and ``Affliction,'' to name a few. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the dweeb Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) asks the very
attractive Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) to go to the prom with him,
she amazingly says yes. That makes Mary both gorgeous and nice, but
while picking her up at her house Ted zippers himself up too
hastily in the bathroom and winds up in the hospital instead of on
the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Still smitten with Mary years later, he hires a private eye
named Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down in Florida, where
everybody, including Healy, has fallen in love with her or is about
to. As in any film by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``Dumb and
Dumber''), bedlam ensues with, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times, ``a crazy audacity that's worth admiring.'' &QL;

   ``Sign me up for the next war!'' cries the grandmother in a
Chinese fable that elevates the level of violence in children's
animation. When her ailing father is unable to serve in the army,
Mulan dresses like a man and takes his place, accompanied by a tiny
dragon (the voice of Eddie Murphy) perched on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of her father, the Emperor and the son of a
general, the males she encounters are buffoons. They and the often
wooden scenes don't help ``the most inert and formulaic of recent
Disney animated films'' (Maslin). &QL;

   In a paganistic ode to Eros, the camera never stops as youths

Holden). &QL;

behavior scandalizes Gregoris' earnest young protege, Tommy Hudler
(David Arquette), who later has an affair with an attractive 40-ish
divorcee (Kate Capshaw) and becomes the central character in a kind
of no-fault late 90s variation of ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the halfway point, Evan Dunsky's film suddenly decides to
be a murder mystery, turning a light, loopy satire into something
that is ``unable to decide where to go or what tone to adopt''
(Holden). &QL;

SUPER BOWL AD CAMPAIGN GOES DOWN TO THE WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects number of hits on Monster.com site to 5 million per
month.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With airtime costing about $3.2 million a minute, an ad on
Sunday's Super Bowl can be the product of months of planning.
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad is a mini movie, folks in the ad business say, and each
30-second ad on Sunday's big game can represent 2,500 hours of
creative thinking, scripting, casting, shooting, and editing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why advertisers such as Budweiser and Pepsi can start
thinking about the Super Bowl 10 months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to chief executive Jeff Taylor of
Monster.com, an on-line recruiting service in Maynard, Mass. that
looks to match job seekers with employers.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move for a company that has never run an ad on
national TV before, Taylor bought a minute of Super Bowl airtime in
November. That was before he had hired an ad agency. It was before
he even had any idea what the ad might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that the right way to do it?'' quips Taylor, whose
company will spend $4 million, or 18 percent of its 1999 marketing
budget, to air a single ad three times on Super Bowl Sunday, twice
during the game and once during a pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl ads are usually the province of such giants as
Frito-Lay, General Motors, and American Express. Monster.com and a
rival Internet firm are among a few smaller companies betting much
of their ad budgets on the impact of Super Bowl exposure.
</P>
<P>
   To get that exposure, Taylor needed an ad agency in a hurry, and
for that, he turned to Skip Pile, head of a Boston-based consulting
firm that manages ad agency reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a Pile and Co. review lasts eight to 10 weeks with a
company hearing pitches from several ad agencies before picking a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case with Monster.com. It condensed its review
into a mere five days before choosing Mullen, a Wenham, Mass. ad
agency, just before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They moved with the speed of the Internet,'' says Pile of
Monster.com, adding: ``This is the fastest any client we ever
worked with has made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   From Taylor's perspective, advertising on the Super Bowl makes
perfect sense in the context of Monster.com's history.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, the company started as a Web site for local
high-tech workers looking for new jobs. Since being acquired a year
later by TMP Worldwide Inc. of New York, the company has tried to
broaden its reach, posting job listings for everyone from college
interns to high-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Internet shopping exploded over the holidays, so too has
interest surged in on-line Web sites where employers pay to post
job listings and to review job-seekers' resumes.
</P>
<P>
   As with other categories of electronic commerce, a frenzied
stampede is on, with the early birds in on-line job recruiting
likely to emerge as the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   On-line recruitment may be especially lucrative because Web
sites offer employers a cheap, easy way to find new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an impatient work force that values the challenge of a
new job every few years over the security of long-term employment,
and on-line recruitment seems poised to take off.
</P>
<P>
   That's the assessment of Forrester Research Inc., which projects
that spending on Web-site recruitment should grow from $105 million
in 1998 to $1.7 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With 1998 revenues of about $40 million, the Web-site jobs
empire Taylor leads is positioned to be one of the few mainstream
recruitment services likely to survive the Internet's frontier
days, suggests Forrester analyst Chris Charron.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure survival _ and dominance _ is one reason Taylor
decided to advertise Monster.com on the Super Bowl. A recent merger
between Monster and another Web-site recruiting service that TMP
acquired may be a second reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking advantage of the broad reach of the Super Bowl to
increase awareness and encourage viewers to visit our site,'' says
Taylor, who hopes the ad will triple the 5 million monthly visitors
to the Monster.com's site.
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs.com Ltd., a Monster.com rival, has similar ideas.
Looking to exploit the dissatisfaction of workers with dead-end
jobs, the New York-based company hired Boston ad agency Hill
Holliday Connors Cosmopulos to create its own Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   HotJobs's experience shows some of the perils of attempting to
create a Super Bowl ad on the fly. A proposed ad showed a man
cleaning an elephant's cage. The elephant backs up, sits down, and
the man disappears. Despite its taste for risque sitcoms, the Fox
network claimed to be horrified and rejected the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think having a man inserted into an elephant's anus
is funny,'' a Fox executive huffed to Brill's Content.
</P>
<P>
   For HotJobs, the controversy was a public relations bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hill Holliday chief executive Jack Connors, the ad
could have been modified in a way to win censors' approval.
</P>
<P>
   But HotJobs ``decided they wanted the publicity instead,'' says
Connors, whose agency was dropped in favor of another that will
produce HotJobs's Super Bowl ad.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's Taylor says he's uninterested in such hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for big hype and a bunch of stories,'' he
says. ``Our goal is to stand out to the Super Bowl audience.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Mullen staffers have been working furiously.
Between the agency staffers and outside contractors such as
directors and editors, 2,500 hours of effort went into an ad that
took about five weeks to conceive and complete, says Edward Boches,
Mullen's executive creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Taped in black-and-white, the ad shows 13 children saying such
things as, ``When I grow up . . . I want to be a yes-man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to claw my way up to middle management,'' says another
kid. ``I want to have a brown nose,'' says a third.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the ad is: `` `Don't settle for less. Don't give
up your dreams. Find the job you want,' '' Boches says.
</P>
<P>
   Boches hopes the black-and-white ad full of ironic humor will
stand out amidst the often luridly overproduced Super Bowl spots
full of celebrities and cute animals. The ad concludes,
``Monster.com. There's a better job out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, viewers will judge how effective Mullen's whirlwind
efforts were. But today plans call for a champagne toast as Mullen
marks the first Super Bowl ad in its 29-year history, Boches says.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, champagne toasts were far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Oh, my God!,' I thought, `Are we going to be able to pull
this thing off?' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a programmer for a network or cable channel that's not
airing the Super Bowl, you have a choice of two strategies on the
night of the big game: fight or give up.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, of course, has the game this year. But only a handful of
outlets appear to be fighting it directly, with marathons designed
to pull away the nonfootball demographic, which is largely, but not
exclusively, female.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is scheduled to air from 5 to 9 p.m. CST Sunday _
not that it ever finishes on time, or that it's always interesting
throughout. But there's even more time to watch _ or avoid _ the
big event: The official pregame show begins at 1 p.m. CST, and Fox
will begin football-related programming as early as 10 a.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know that this year's game pits Atlanta vs. Denver,
or you aren't even aware that those cities have NFL teams, or you
don't even know what the NFL is, check out this guide to what else
is on.
</P>
<P>
   BROADCAST
</P>
<P>
   ABC: Apparently throwing in the towel completely, ABC is airing
``Muppet Treasure Island'' _ sure to cause strife among young kids
and their football-loving elders _ at 6 p.m. CST. Following that is
something called ``Don't Get Taken,'' a consumer-oriented show
about avoiding ripoffs, and a rerun of ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS: Adding an installment of ``48 Hours'' (6 p.m. CST) before
the venerable ``60 Minutes'' (7 p.m. CST), CBS is also aiming
directly at the non-jock-obsessed audience with a repeat of ``The
Spirit of Liberty Moon,'' a two-hour ``Touched by an Angel''
``movie'' (8 p.m. CST).
</P>
<P>
   NBC: Falling in the Not Quite Giving Up category, NBC is airing
a double-feature of movies directed at young, primarily female
audiences. ``Clueless,'' starring Alicia Silverstone in a
surprisingly well-done high-school version of Jane Austen's
``Emma,'' airs at 6 p.m. CST. ``Miami Rhapsody,'' starring Sarah
Jessica Parker in the most Woody Allen-esque romantic comedy not
directed by Woody Allen, is more of a misfire and airs at 8 p.m.
CST. By the way, the Super Bowl is in Miami this year. Coincidence?
We think not.
</P>
<P>
   PBS: Pledge dollars, not ratings, are PBS' concern, and
KERA/Channel 13 in Dallas-Fort Worth is not taking the Super Bowl
lightly. Beginning at 1 p.m. CST, the public-broadcasting station
will air ``Souper Bowl'' _ six hours of cooking shows, including
the ever-popular ``Two Fat Ladies.'' Afterward, Channel 13 will air
a crooners' double bill against the big game. ``Engelbert
Humperdinck: Love Unchained'' airs at 7 p.m. CST; ``Harry Connick
Jr.: Romance in Paris'' airs at 8 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   UPN: The little network that's suffering is airing one of the
best non-Bowl options: 1995's ``A Little Princess,'' a marvelous,
too-little-seen film that's one of the best family movies of the
'90s. Our recommendation: skip the Muppets and ``Clueless,'' and
watch this at 6 p.m. CST. UPN needs your help more than ABC and
NBC. (Rival netlet the WB is apparently staying out of the fray
with a standard run of sitcoms.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CABLE
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN MOVIE CLASSICS: AMC is pulling out the big guns _ or
rather, the big hankies, with a ``Superbawl Sunday'' tear-jerker
marathon, and the cable channel isn't just going after the Super
Bowl time slot; it wants the whole day. It starts at 5 a.m. CST
with ``Sayonara,'' starring Marlon Brando. In direct competition
with the Super Bowl will be ``Never Say Goodbye,'' with Rock Hudson
(5 p.m. CST); ``Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,'' with William
Holden and Jennifer Jones (7:05 p.m. CST); and for some well-earned
comedy relief, Billy Wilder's ``Love in the Afternoon,'' with Gary
Cooper and Audrey Hepburn (9 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E: Also taking direct aim is A&AMP;E, with a ``Murder, She Wrote''
marathon that begins at 11 a.m. CST and runs straight through the
Super Bowl slot before concluding with the final credits at 3 a.m.
CST. Anyone who watches all the episodes can claim to have more
stamina than John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   CARTOON NETWORK: The hippest 'toon station on TV
(Nickel-what-deon?) does a pretty good job of parodying real-life
sportscast bombast with the ``Sylvester vs. Tweety Marathon'' (noon
to 4 p.m.). The ``pre-game'' show features a look back at last
year's big match-up (Tom vs. Jerry), expert analysis from HBO's
stable of football announcers, great voice-over narration by NFL
Films' Harry Kalas and, of course, cheesy 3-D graphics. (You don't
think this Ted Turner-owned station purposefully mocked the
overblown sportscast style of Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox? Nah,
'course not.) The ``game'' is a series of cartoon moments between
the bad ol' puddy-tat and Tweety, with play-by-play provided by Fox
Sports' Pat Summerall and John Madden. It's all very cute, but the
pre-game is too long, and the cartoons are funnier than the
commentary. The best moments are the on-the-scene reports, in which
rabid fans tailgate and dine according to their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   COMEDY CENTRAL: In a late-breaking program change, what Craig
Kilborn used to call ``your channel of fun'' is airing ``Absolutely
Not the Big Game'' _ a six-hour marathon of the witchy Britcom
``Absolutely Fabulous'' (beginning at 1 p.m. CST). Because over
there, they don't play football with their hands, sweetie darling.
``AbFab'' fans can even vote for the episodes they want to see at
www.comedycentral.com.
</P>
<P>
   FOX FAMILY: We're not sure if this counts as counterprogramming,
especially because this is a sister channel of the Super Bowl
network, but we find it intriguing: ``High School U.S.A.,'' a 1983
movie starring Michael J. Fox, Nancy McKeon _ and a pre-''ER''
Anthony Edwards. That's at 7 p.m. CST. Before it is a solid triple
bill of animated features: ``Charlotte's Web'' (2 p.m. CST);
``Snoopy, Come Home'' (4 p.m. CST); and ``A Boy Named Charlie
Brown'' (5 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   FX: Is this counterproductivity, or is it trying to monopolize
the audience? Fox's cable channel is airing ``The Princess Bride,''
Rob Reiner's delicious fractured fairy tale, at 7 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   LIFETIME: You can bet that ``The Network for Women'' will put up
a fight, and it is, airing ALL of the 1995 miniseries ``A Woman of
Independent Means,'' from 3 to 9 p.m. CST Sally Field stars.
</P>
<P>
   TBS: Although network owner Ted Turner has more than a passing
interest in Atlanta, his cable ``superstation'' is airing a 24-hour
``Andy Griffith Show'' marathon, beginning at 5 a.m. CST Sunday.
Included: the series' first episode.
</P>
<P>
   TNT: One of Turner's ``other'' networks is taking an interesting
tack: Rather than air female- or kid-friendly stuff, it's airing a
series of made-for-TV westerns, including 1996's ``Riders of the
Purple Sage'' (5 p.m. CST) and 1997's ``Last Stand at Saber River''
(7 p.m. CST).
</P>
<P>
   THE TV FOOD NETWORK: Naturally, this network knows which side
its bread is buttered on, and is mostly staying out of the way
during the Super Bowl. In anticipation of the game, however, it's
airing two specials featuring its biggest star, Emeril Lagasse:
``Tailgating,'' at 11 a.m. Saturday, and ``Emeril Live! Superbowl
Cocktail Special'' at noon Sunday. Before you go thinking that
Emeril's gone provincial on you, his tailgate-party menu includes
grilled quail and andouille sausage ragout.
</P>
<P>
   USA: Getting to have it both ways, the USA Network is airing one
of its macho standards, ``WWF Sunday Night Heat,'' at 6 p.m. CST,
then following it with the female- (and Sensitive New Age Guy-)
friendly ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' at 7 p.m. CST.
</P>
<P>
   VH1: Beginning at 1 p.m. CST, the pop-culture cable channel will
run seven installments of its ``Behind the Music'' series. Gloria
Estefan, who perhaps not coincidentally is one of the headliners of
the Super Bowl's halftime extravaganza, goes head to head with the
Super Bowl at 5 p.m. CST; Madonna's segment is at 7:30 p.m. CST.

 &HT;    VETS SEEING MORE CASES OF POTENTIALLY FATAL DISEASE OF DOGS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although dogs often receive annual vaccinations for
leptospirosis, veterinarians say they have started seeing an
increase in cases of the potentially fatal disease _ possibly
because suburban pets are catching it from raccoons and other wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine approved for use in dogs does not protect them from
wild animal strains, college veterinarians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until a few years ago, we saw a few sporadic cases,'' said
Larry Cowgill, a professor at the University of California at Davis
veterinary school. ``In the last three years, we have seen 37 or 38
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most dogs can easily tolerate the strain of
leptospirosis that has traditionally been a canine disease, strains
that ``jump'' from wild animals such as rats, mice and raccoons can
be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   A dog with the disease may have symptoms that are common to many
canine ailments _ vomiting, lethargy and a difficulty standing up
because muscle pain. In some cases, the disease causes kidney and
liver failure and death.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians can treat most cases with antibiotics, but Cowgill
said a number of animals with kidney failure have been given
hemodialysis at the Davis school.
</P>
<P>
   Animal doctors in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and New York also have
reported increases in leptospirosis. The disease is known as a
zoonosis because it can spread from animals to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   It often is spread in water contaminated by the urine of an
infected animal, and aid workers say large numbers of human cases
have appeared in the aftermath of flooding brought to Honduras and
Nicaragua by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard from colleagues in Boston, the New York City area
and in Knoxville, Tenn., that they are seeing an increase in cases
among dogs,'' Cowgill said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, University of Florida small animal
specialists said through a spokeswoman their clinic had ``not seen
a case of lepto in several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Green, a professor at the University of Georgia veterinary
school and author of a widely used textbook on small animal
infections, said part of the perceived increase may lie in the fact
that vets are better able to detect leptospirosis than they were a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been there all along and we're just now
recognizing it,'' Green said. ``People were doing blood tests that
did not detect the strains many dogs were getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said the wild animal strains are likely to be more severe
to dogs than disease caused by the organism to which canines have
adjusted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration are based
on the canine strain and therefore don't prevent infection by the
wild animal disease. Although zoo lions and tigers get
leptospirosis, it does not occur in housecats.
</P>
<P>
   University of Pennsylvania veterinarians say the increase among
dogs may be the result of ``urban sprawl'' with more and more pets
being exposed to puddles and streams that have been contaminated
with wild animal urine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners of dogs that run in areas with a lot of wildlife should
be on the lookout for symptoms and take the animal promptly to a
veterinarian if illness is suspected,'' the Pennsylvania vet school
said in a recent newsletter.

   UNDATED _ We probably shouldn't begrudge filmmakers who want to
give millennials movies like ``She's All That,'' even though it
isn't very well-executed. This high-school ``Pygmalion'' tries hard
but misfires frustratingly on many counts. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story

   UNDATED _ Give that man from Indiana credit. He knows political
balderdash when he hears it, although he might not be able to spell
it. Former Vice President Dan Quayle's denunciation of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' theme as a ``silly
and insulting term'' fused together by ``liberal Republicans''
suggests that his bovine-excrement detector is in pretty good
working order. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story has moved in ``k''

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ Senators are struggling to reach a bipartisan
timetable for the remainder of President Clinton's impeachment
trial as the White House signals it may forgo defense witnesses if
there's no new damaging testimony. (Foskett/Carr/Sherman, Palm
Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   w/IMPEACH-BARR _ ATLANTA _ House impeachment prosecutor Bob Barr
was back in Atlanta Thursday, a day after the potentially
forshadowing Senate votes of Wednesday. Hanging with Barr to get
his take on where the process goes from here and what constituents
think. (Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15-18.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-MANAGERS _ WASHINGTON _ House managers are drawing up
the questions they will ask in the depositions, whenever they
occur. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   PETS-LEPTO _ WASHINGTON - Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease
that infects humans and numerous animals, apparently is becoming
increasingly common in dogs, according to some veterinary schools.
At times the shock to a canine's kidneys is so severe the animal
must have hemodialysis to survive. Only four veterinary hospitals
in the country are equipped to administer the treatment. (Nesmith,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   NATION
</P>
<P>
   PANDA _ Zoo Atlanta is getting two pandas from China and will
build a new exhibit in which to house them. Besides the two pandas
coming to Atlanta this summer, there are only three others in the
U.S. _ two in San Diego, and one in Washington, D.C. (Hendrick,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON _ DAYTON _ Rev. Jesse Jackson comes to Dayton this
afternoon to announce his latest initiative, calling for 1,000
churches to begin investment clubs and mentoring programs for
troubled youths in their churches. This is, in part, a continuation
of his effort to encourage investment in Appalachia. (Franklin,
Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Developing from 4 p.m. EST press conference and 7 p.m. EST
address.
</P>
<P>
   BLACKMEN-MENTORS _ The 100 Black Men of America have launched a
$35 million Miracles of Mentoring campaign with a goal of building
a national youth leadership institute in
</P>
<P>
   metro Atlanta. (PScott, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WACO-CARJACK _ WACO, Texas _ Bystanders thwart carjacking,
detain suspect for police. (Gaar, Waco Tribune-Herald)
</P>
<P>
   TRACK COUGH _ More on the strange `kennel cough' afflicting
greyhound tracks around Florida. Need to talk to experts to find
out: is it a bacteria or virus, what is it exactly, symptoms, how
you treat it, are track owners reluctant to treat dogs because they
can't raise while being medicated, how often do you get this kind
of outbreak, what are the rules about shifting dog from track to
track, where are the Palm Beach kennel dogs bred, do they have an
outbreak, etc? (Donald, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   DOG-COUGH _ An outbreak of kennel cough has shut down dog racing
tracks in Birmingham, Mobile and Palm Beach. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   GA-COMMUTES _ ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes said Thursday that it'll
probably take two multi-modal stations to link the metro Atlanta
bus, rapidrail/commuter rail, auto transportation systems as
invisioned _ one station downtown and another somewhere on the
northside for east-west rail. Wouldn't say where the northside
station would be located or how much both stations would cost.
That's part of the studies to be done, he said, and that the train
from Atlanta to Macon to Albany would be almost self-sustaining _
probably operational in about five years. (Pruitt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   UNITED-WAY _ AUSTIN _ Austin set a national record for
increasing its contributions to the United Way in 1998, the second
year in a row that Austin has seen among the highest increases in
the nation. The big increase in contributions from Dell and the
other high-tech companies, and the increase in people giving over
$1,000, fueled the growth. (Thatcher, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   STATE LEGISLATIVE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   TEX-LEGIS-BUDGET _ AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush unveils his
budget plan on Thursday. We are looking for details on his proposed
$2 billion school property tax cut and how he plans to make sure
local school districts don't simply raise local taxes (like they
did in 1997) to fill the gap. How much money will Bush put into his
plan for remedial programs to stop kids from being socially
promoted? (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   SC-LEGIS-LOTTERY _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ South Carolina legislature
takes the first step toward approving a lottery. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GA-LEGIS-LOBBY _ ATLANTA _ Doors to the House and Senate were
flung open for them but now a badge bars them from the chambers
where they once helped write laws. Once legislators they are now
lobbyists _ among the more than 1,000 who work the Capitol halls;
among the ones targeted by Gov. Roy Barnes in his ``eel-skinned
briefcases and aligator shoes'' comments. (Cook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15-18.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HUSSEIN-0129 _ AMMAN, Jordan _ When it came time to
choose the successor that would ensure his kingdom's future, time
finally caught up with Jordan's King Hussein. Faced with his
deteriorating health, Hussein apparently changed his mind about
which son will take his place and on his last night in Jordan
handwrote the 14-page explanation of why he would dump his loyal
brother from the job: He described ``parasites'' and ``climbers''
sowing discord in the palace. Observers in Jordan have hope in the
new crown Prince Abdullah, the king's surprise choice over his
favorite but much younger son, Hamzeh. But, they believe the king
was not healthy enough to face the resistance that would have
occurred had he made the 18-year-old Hamzeh his successor. The
king's frantic last week involved the ambitions of a queen and
would-be queen, and tragic misunderstandings between brothers.

   IOC-GANGA-0129 _ LONDON _ Signaling a bitter fight ahead,
Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo on Thursday said he intends to oppose
the move to expel him from the International Olympic Committee over
allegations that he accepted improper payments from the Salt Lake
City bidding committee. ``Never in my life will I resign,'' Ganga
said in an interview published in a French newspaper. ``I will
fight tooth and nail before my peers.'' Ganga, the powerful
president of the Association of National Olympic Committees of
Africa, also struck out at IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch,
whom Ganga accused of sacrificing his friends to save himself.
Ganga has been an IOC member since 1964, two years longer than
Samaranch, who has been president since 1980. (Roughton, Cox News
Service).

   HIV-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ In what is believed to be the first lawsuit
of its kind in Georgia, a dental hygenist who is HIV-positive will
file suit Thursday in federal court against his former employer,
who fired him because he disclosed he was HIV-positive. The lawsuit
is unusual because it involves a health-care provider. (Rankin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

sexuality, a little patriotism and a little ancient religion and
you have the makings of a sports fan. Sports, unlike any other
modern institution, evokes the deepest human emotions and genetic
social maps, creating a bonding in a community and in a family
seldom paralleled in today's world _ short of war. Psychologists
and fans talk about why fans act the way they do. (Lore, Atlanta

hot-spot, home of jet-setters, fashion models, movie stars and
various beautiful people. What happened to the folks who used to
live there? (MWilliams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

LOBBYING IS BIG BUSINESS AT SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Corporations and other interests spent more than
$3.3 million last year to hire lobbyists at City Hall, nearly
double what was spent two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the money has gone to three lobbyists with close
business, personal and political ties to the Democratic Party in
San Francisco. Figures for 1998 are still being compiled, so the
figure is expected to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is excessive and obliterates the relationship
between local government, neighborhoods and communities,'' Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano said of the spending to influence
government decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the spokeswoman for Mayor Willie Browns, cheered
the spending as another indicator that the city's economy was on a
roll under the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sign of an economically healthy city,'' Bender said.
``There's no stall at City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran lobbyist Marcia Smolens, whose clients include United
Airlines, was the top earner among lobbyists. Her firm, HMS
Associates, collected $1.1 million in 1998, according to documents
filed this month with the Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   William G. ``Billy'' Rutland Jr., who launched his lobbying
business just months after Brown _ his friend and former boss _ was
sworn in as mayor, reported earning $728,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Solem &AMP; Associates, the firm opened 22 years ago by former
Democratic Party chief executive Don Solem, received $396,829 in
lobbying fees last year, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, City Hall lobbyists have reported earning $3.3 million
in fees for 1998, a figure that will increase when outstanding
reports for the final three months of the year are filed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 fees were almost twice as much as the $1.7 million
reported by lobbyists in 1996, when Brown took office.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said he refuses to meet with lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But other supervisors, as well as lobbyists and the companies
that hire them, contend that paid advocates provide an increasingly
important function because of government regulation and
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, the lobbyists add, while relationships with elected and
other government officials are important, they do not readily
equate into influence over votes, contract awards and other
high-stakes decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that government relations people are able to
do is present both sides of a story, do research and provide
information,'' Smolens said. ``Supervisors are swamped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do good stuff,'' she said. ``We get our clients to do good
stuff they might not have otherwise thought of. ... These are great
things, and should be applauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Under city law, all lobbyists paid to influence the outcome of
legislation or administrative rule-making in San Francisco must
file quarterly reports with the Ethics Commission. The reports
identify clients and fees, and disclose political contributions and
gifts to city officials.

CARING COMPANIES THRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Teller turnover at NationsBank is 46 percent,
which means nearly half the faces at the windows change in a year's
time. Customers may or may not care, but the bank does.
</P>
<P>
   It costs between $2,000 and $3,000 to replace each teller _ a
hefty sum for a notoriously low-paying job. But trying to cut
turnover is not just about money, said Bill Nelson, president of
the Kansas City region of NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about keeping happy workers. That's why, for example,
the bank offers a subsidized child-care program. The subsidy is
only $25 a week, but among tellers who participate, turnover
plummets to a paltry 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto among the bank company's check processors. Turnover among
processors not receiving day-care subsidies is 44 percent; among
those in the program it's 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not every worker needs day care, of course. That's why the
subsidy is just one of the work/life balance programs available to
all bank associates.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson deliberately says associates _ not employees. He wants
the language to mirror an evolving corporate culture. The shift,
Nelson said, involves less reacting to workplace problems and more
proactive programs to make associates' lives better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solutions to workplace pressures begin and end with
corporate culture,'' Nelson said at a ``Best Practices'' seminar
sponsored by the Johnson County Community College's Business and
Industry Institute. ``Those are values that begin at the top and
permeate every aspect of a company.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson arrived in Kansas City in 1988, he joined Boatmen's
First National Bank, which later became a part of NationsBank. He
found an organization still in emotional turmoil from a 3-year-old
merger.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank now is merging with BankAmerica. Change _ and the
pain of smashing two corporate cultures together _ roils on. It
isn't easy to convince associates that the organization believes in
giving its people freedom to make choices and share responsibility
and rewards when change continues to pour down.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a tight labor market, when employers claw to get and
keep good workers, an organization in merger turmoil has to work
even harder. To compete, it must offer the best practices of other
preferred employers. Among them: parental leave, flextime, the
option of reduced hours, job sharing, child-care assistance,
employee assistance programs for mental health counseling and legal
assistance referral programs.
</P>
<P>
   Such benefits are the tools a company has to tell its people it
cares about their personal well-being. No company can promise
paternal, lifetime care. But Nelson is trying to encourage a
workplace partnership that gets commitment and responsibility from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, for example, associates get two hours of paid time
off to spend with their children. Those with no children of their
own are encouraged to use the time for youth-oriented community
service.
</P>
<P>
   These may look like little things. But they're bigger things
than many employers do. They make a place feel like somewhere good
people want to work.
</P>
<P>
   Now if they would just do something about tellers' pay.

ASHCROFT, HARKIN SAY FARM GOODS SHOULDN'T BE TOOLS OF FOREIGN
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Tom Harkin of
Iowa, who are on opposite ends of the presidential impeachment
fight, came together Wednesday to co-sponsor a bill that would give
Congress more control over food embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish rules for congressional approval or
disapproval of embargoes used as leverage in foreign policy
matters. Sometimes, for example, the United States punishes a
country by halting farm exports.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft issued a news release about the bill shortly before the
Senate resumed the impeachment trial Wednesday. Ashcroft, a
Republican, voted against dismissing the case and for the calling
of witnesses. Harkin, a Democrat, voted just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But the two senators from neighboring states see eye-to-eye on
the embargo issue. The bill's other sponsors include Republican Kit
Bond of Missouri and two Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``An embargo that singles out foodstuffs is destined to fail,
harming family farmers without achieving meaningful foreign policy
objectives,'' Ashcroft said. About 40 percent of all food and fiber
farm sales are exported, according to Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978,
would give Congress 100 days to approve or reject a food embargo.
If Congress approved, the embargo would be in effect for one year,
or less if the president desired. If Congress disapproved, the
embargo would end in 100 days unless vetoed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said the legislation would send two messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it tells customers overseas that U.S. farmers and
ranchers are reliable suppliers,'' he said. ``Second, it increases
the security of American agriculture that the farm sector won't be
singled out as a tool of foreign policy without full consideration
by the president and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said about 80 farming organizations support the bill.

   NATIONAL FORECAST  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Protracted heavy rain will result in areas of flooding in parts
of the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley during the next few
days. A slow-moving low-pressure area will drift east from western
Texas, drawing copious amounts of moisture from over the Gulf of
Mexico. The heaviest rain will occur later Friday and Friday night
from eastern Oklahoma to northern Arkansas where a series of
thunderstorm clusters will pass over the region. Later Friday night
and Saturday, the rain will gradually spread into the Tennessee and
central Mississippi River Valleys. Farther west, locally heavy snow
will fall from eastern New Mexico to the panhandles of Texas and
Oklahoma. Some areas will have more than a foot of snow by Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Colder air will spread south from New England to the Middle
Atlantic states as high pressure burgeons over eastern Canada.
Gusty breezes from the north and scattered snow showers will add to
the chill of the day along the New England Coast. Otherwise, partly
to mostly sunny skies will prevail across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably mild air will spread from the interior Northwest to
the northern Plains on gusty breezes from the west. However, chilly
air will remained trapped in some of the deeper valleys of the
northern and central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of fronts will bring windswept rain to
the Washington and Oregon coasts. Locally heavy snow will fall in
the Cascades. Farther south, ample sunshine will cover most of the
Southwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Cut-off Low
</P>
<P>
   Like puddles of standing water that are left behind after a
flooded stream recedes into its banks, high-altitude pools of
stagnant, cold air can be left behind after the jet stream dives
south and then recedes north. These cold pools, having been
separated or ``cut-off'' from the steering winds of the jet stream,
can stall over a region for days. Since cold air at high altitudes
is associated with low pressure aloft, cut-off cold pools can cause
protracted precipitation. During the next few days, a cut-off low
will drift east from the southern Plains, bringing flooding rain to
the lower Mississippi Valley.

GAMING COMMISSION AGREES TO LET HILTON OFF THE HOOK IN BRIBERY
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Gaming Commission agreed
Wednesday to let Hilton Hotels Corp. walk away from a Kansas City
casino bribery scandal unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms recommended by Mel Fisher, executive director of the
commission, the Beverly Hills, Calif., company would voluntarily
surrender its state gaming license at the same time the riverboat
is sold to Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That $15 million transaction, contingent on state licensing of
the Atlantic City, N.J.-based Trump group, was announced earlier
this month and could be completed by late April.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton attorney Jerry Riffel said after the meeting that his
client would not resist the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilton is not admitting anything,'' he said. ``We've done
nothing in Missouri that would affect our suitability to do
business in Missouri. We will surrender our license pursuant to
Missouri regulations because we no longer intend to do business in
Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Fisher said he had been prepared to recommend
harsh disciplinary action against Hilton when the sale to Trump was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter,'' he said Wednesday, ``Hilton has a
right to appeal any action we might take, and we could conceivably
be tied up in court for months or years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our time and our resources can be better spent to
keep 800 jobs open for employees and the facility open for an
orderly transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Hilton been fined, suspended or stripped of its Missouri
license, other jurisdictions with Hilton casinos probably would
have taken their own disciplinary actions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   When New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump offered to buy the
casino for roughly 15 percent of its original $100 million cost,
Hilton accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Trump general counsel Robert M. Pickus on Wednesday introduced
several top company officers to commissioners and urged a quick
investigation and licensing approval for the Trump organization.
``The sooner the better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hilton agreed to pay the federal government more
than $500,000 to avoid a criminal trial on charges that it provided
financial rewards to former Kansas City Port Authority Chairman
Elbert Anderson in exchange for his political support for the
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Under Anderson's leadership in 1993, the Port Authority selected
Hilton over two other applicants for city lease rights to the site
at the foot of the Paseo Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Markland Rousseau, a former Hilton senior vice
president, was indicted in Jackson County on three counts of felony
perjury related to the Anderson affair.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau, now an Atlanta businessman, has pleaded not guilty and
is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases culminated years of state and federal
investigations into a $250,000 grant Hilton awarded in 1993 to K.C.
Perspectives, a private group controlled by Anderson and Michelle
Lathan, a close associate.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Wednesday in Kansas City, the Gaming Commission also
levied a $5,000 fine against Station Casino Kansas City for its
failure to prevent a 16-year-old boy from entering the casino Nov.
22 and gambling on slot machines with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father learned of the incident involving his ex-wife
and reported it to state gaming authorities the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Harrisonville woman has been charged in Clay
County District Court and faces up to six months in jail for
allowing a minor to gamble. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Station Casino said the company had not decided
whether to appeal the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Station's St. Charles, Mo., casino did not contest a $250,000
fine in 1997 after a 12-year-old girl was caught there playing slot
machines while accompanied by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases are the only ones on record in which minors have
been caught gambling in Missouri casinos, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Riverboat Gaming Association said that in 1997, the
latest year for which statistics are available, 29,800 minors were
identified by casino employees and refused admittance.

 &HT;    CONGO'S GANGA VOWS TO FIGHT EXPULSION FROM IOC
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Signaling a bitter fight ahead, Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo was quoted in a French daily on Thursday as
saying that he intends to oppose the move to expel him from the
International Olympic Committee over allegations that he accepted
improper payments from the Salt Lake City bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my life will I resign,'' Ganga said in an interview
published in the French newspaper Liberation. ``I will fight tooth
and nail before my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, the powerful president of the Association of National
Olympic Committees of Africa, also struck out at IOC President Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom Ganga accused of sacrificing his friends to
save himself. Ganga has been an IOC member since 1964, two years
longer than Samaranch, who has been president since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   One of six IOC members targeted for expulsion last Sunday by the
IOC executive board, Ganga, who lives in Paris, made the statements
in the daily's Thursday edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Samaranch) defends his skin by throwing opprobrium on the
others,'' Ganga told the newspaper. ``We had friendly relations but
if he's trying to get rid of his friends it will be dangerous for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said 40 IOC members would oppose his expulsion when a
special IOC session assembles in mid-March to consider the fate of
the accused members. A two-thirds majority -- or 75 members -- must
approve the motion to expel. If Ganga survives the March vote, it
would be a stinging defeat for Samaranch who has vowed to rid the
IOC of members accused of unethical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The members are accused of accepting nearly $800,000 worth of
goods and services from Salt Lake before the city won a vote in
1995. Under IOC rules members are not allowed to receive gifts
worth more than $150.
</P>
<P>
   One of the accused IOC members, Kenya's Charles Mukora, resigned
Wednesday, bringing the total members to leave the organization
over the scandal to four. Accusations against three other members
are still being investigated by a special IOC commission formed to
look into allegations of vote buying related to Salt Lake's
successful campaign for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said none of the benefits he derived from his visits to
Salt Lake City during the bidding process, including large medical
bills, travel assistance and help in a huge real estate investment,
were bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee records show that Ganga, 64,
received more than $200,000 from the bid committee, including
direct payments of $70,010, more than $17,000 for medical expenses
for his family, $115,000 in travel expenses and gifts and
entertainment expenses totaling more than $14,000.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a few minutes on Klickitat Street, you're bound
to think you're in ``Leave It to Beaver'' territory: The characters
include a full-time mother who's always baking cookies, a beaming
paterfamilias who dotes on his wife, and their two daughters, who
have a loving if often argumentative relationship. The only working
women are schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   But if this doesn't sound much like 1990s America, don't worry:
Fans of Beverly Cleary's children's books will recognize the street
as the home of Ramona Quimby, a feisty tomboy with enough spirit
and will to start a feminist movement of her own.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Ramona Quimby,'' Theaterworks USA's stage adaptation of
Ms. Cleary's books, does justice to its spunky namesake: When she
takes a beaten-up doll named Chevrolet to show and tell and later
plunges it into her teen-age sister's baking lasagna (Ramona says
she was only playing ``Hansel and Gretel''), you know this heroine
is no ordinary girl.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is ``Ramona Quimby'' ordinary children's theater. The
staging is refreshingly inventive, from the lively narration
provided by Ramona's sister, Beatrice (known by her nickname,
Beezus), to John Farrell's set, whose backdrop is an enormous green
felt board on which the actors place symbols of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Len Jenkins, who adapted the material, has included Ramona's
many challenges that go beyond show and tell. Her dad (John Ferry)
loses his job and takes up smoking again. Mrs. Quimby (Lisa Levy)
trades in her cookie batter for work in a doctor's office. Ramona's
adored aunt (Alexa Harris) falls in love with an old school chum
(Nicholas Little) and plans to move to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   And while divorce and destitution don't exactly loom, life on
Klickitat Street starts to look a lot more like 1990s America.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Rob Barron, the production, for ages 5 and up, moves
as quickly as Ramona's imagination. And with talented guides like
Jane Mendez and Harley Abrevaya (Ramona and Beezus, respectively),
even adults won't mind returning to third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramona Quimby,'' Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m. at the Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)
627-7373. Tickets: $18.50.
</P>
<P>
   A Taste of Dance
</P>
<P>
   If Doug Elkins hadn't become a dancer, you have a feeling that
he might have ended up a chef. He describes one of his pieces,
``More Wine for Polyphemus,'' as ``the chicken pot pie of
classicism.'' Another, an excerpt from ``Narcoleptic Lovers,'' ``is
the equivalent of a tango and a taffy pull,'' he said. ``It kind of
pretzels around itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The pie, the taffy, the pretzels and other delights are all on
the menu at the New Victory Theater, where the Doug Elkins Dance
Company is the latest to take part in the ``Step Lively'' family
series.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins, known for his energized, highly athletic choreography,
has combined music by Led Zeppelin, James Brown, the hip-hop group
Urban Species, John Adams (composer of ``Nixon in China'') and
Handel, as well as forms like ballet, voguing and martial arts.
Call it a highly spiced stew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to make movement the way a DJ at a house party layers
different sounds,'' Elkins said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite examples is a duo from ``The Testosterone
Diversions,'' a work that pokes fun at machismo. Elkins describes
it variously as ``Robert Bly meets Buster Keaton'' and ``Roland
Barthes meets Jackie Chan.'' As for the a capella score, ``It's the
same music you get when you take your kids to a department store
and try to get them to come along,'' he said. ``The kids will
relate very much.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, no doubt, will the parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Doug Elkins Dance Company, at the New Victory Theater, 209
West 42nd St., (212) 239-6200. Performances: Friday night at 7;
Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m. Tickets, $10.
</P>
<P>
   A Friend in Need
</P>
<P>
   Usually, being a good neighbor doesn't involve anything more
demanding than mutual respect. But during World War II the Danes
discovered that it meant something closer to loving one's neighbor
as oneself. In September 1943, as the Nazis were about to arrest
all the nation's Jews, other Danes risked their lives by helping
more than 5,000 Jews to hide or escape.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue has been dramatized in ``Number the Stars,'' a
Newberry Award-winning novel by Lois Lowry that is required reading
in many New York City schools. Now it has been brought to the stage
by Sean Hartley, whose musical adaptation will open Saturday in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine is Anne-Marie Johansen, a 10-year-old whose best
friend, Ellen Rosen, is Jewish. Although Anne-Marie's parents do
their best to shield her from danger, she ultimately plays a small
but critical role in the Rosens' salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read about people who do heroic things, you often
think, `Great, but I could never do something like that,''' Hartley
said. ``This novel leads you to think, `That much I could do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The production, by the Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center's Poppy
Seed Players, features two 11-year-olds, Chloe Levenson
(Anne-Marie) and Sofia Abassi (Ellen). Older actors, Hartley said,
would not capture the same vulnerability, or perhaps the same joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Holocaust horror story,'' he said. ``All the things
that kids do were still going on, even during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Number the Stars,'' Saturday at 7 p.m. (sold out; call about
cancellations) and Sunday at 11 a.m. at Merkin Concert Hall, 129
West 67th St., (212) 501-3330. Tickets, $10.

<P>
   Riding the rough rapids of the Colorado in a 21-foot power boat
wasn't any picnic. One scientist on the trip stored dead specimens
in one of the boat's cabins, providing a stinking encounter for any
person unlucky enough to have to go in there.
</P>
<P>
   Floating through the relatively still waters of Glen Canyon for
the first time the next year was peaceful compared to the rough
chop of the same river in the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Glen was so soothing, such a laid-back, heavenly, heavenly
place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee would take about 20 trips through her beloved Glen Canyon
before it was flooded. A folk singer and actress, she was hired by
Mexican Hat Expeditions to sing for paying customers during her
early floating years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I just got so that I found out that this canyon had
something to say to me about my life and my career and how I
handled myself,'' she said. ``It taught me about intimacy and the
value of observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whispers in the river told her that pursuing the life of an
actress and folk singer who performed for thousands wasn't the best
course. Lee decided to focus on intimacy _ singing for people in
coffeehouses and small venues where the experience was personal.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Canyon also possessed the power to kill, and Lee respected
that might, especially after almost drowning in a pool in a side
canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in Glen Canyon in a tremendous thunderstorm. It just
feels like the Earth is coming to pieces,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Danger was secondary when exploring beautiful side canyons with
fluted walls. There she could swim, wonder at waterfalls and admire
maidenhair ferns and wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just drags you in. You see the mouth of this canyon and
think, `God, what's in there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some slots had dimensions as drastic as 2 feet wide and 600 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light in the place was enough to drive you crazy,'' she
said. ``It would just glow around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite trips were those that she took with companions Tad
Nichols and Frank Wright, river men who loved Glen Canyon as much
as Lee. Together, they named about 25 side canyons.
</P>
<P>
   When news filtered down to the river runners that plans called
for a dam to generate hydroelectric power and provide water for
growing cities of the day, no one thought it was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said nobody would do a thing like that. None of us really
believed it because there was a law that said that no water could
encroach on a national monument,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and her fellow river mates eventually learned how wrong they
were. Glen Canyon Dam was completed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   That was 34 years ago. Lee finally got to the point where she
could sit down and write the book about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My anger and my hatred seethed and seethed long enough to get
this book done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Lee wanted to do the book as a novel, but a friend
and fellow lover of Glen Canyon, Ed Abbey, talked her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that the canyon itself was so powerful and so
wonderful that all I needed to do was to find a way to describe
it,'' she said. ``I just held out for years. Five years ago, I
finally picked it up and said, `OK Ed, I'll do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lee believes that Lake Powell will one day be drained to reveal
Glen Canyon again. That idea has been proposed by the Sierra Club.
Even the late Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who was instrumental
in the creation of the dam, stated later in life that he wouldn't
vote for it if given a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be drained one way or another. I want Mother Nature to
drain it like, tomorrow,'' Lee said. ``I just hope it happens in my
lifetime.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MILLIONS ARE DENIED THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST MIRACLE DRUG
 &HT;    With VITAMIN-LIST. For release Saturday, Jan. 30.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By failing to invest a few million dollars to add
vitamin A to food supplies in developing countries, the world is
missing the opportunity to prevent deaths of at least a million
children a year, health experts say.
</P>
<P>
   All children in the world were supposed to be free of vitamin A
deficiency by next year under a plan of action adopted in 1992 by
the World Health Organization and UNICEF, the United Nations
Children's Fund. But the year will come and go without the goal
being met.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say an estimated 1 million to 3 million children
will continue to die annually for lack of doses of the vitamin that
would cost about 20 cents for each of them. Others will become
blind.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists speculate that the vitamin works in several ways,
including helping the immune system fight such diseases as
diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, measles and other killers of
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dietary vitamin A is most easily derived from meat, fish, eggs
and dairy products, foods which poverty denies to many children in
developing countries. In addition, milk is routinely supplemented
with vitamin A in the United States and most other developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although vitamin A is found in many vegetables in the form of
beta carotene, the body's ability to produce the nutrient from
vegetables is inefficient, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the U.S. Agency for International Development
recently launched a campaign to get Third World producers of foods
such as sugar and flour to add the vitamin to their products.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will cost the U.S. government about $25 million,
AID officials say, and will take at least four years to reach 60
percent of vitamin-deficient children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sluggish response by health agencies around
the world, the story of vitamin A is one of serendipitous discovery
and scientific skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Alfred Sommer, then an epidemiologist and
ophthalmologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, reported
in the Lancet, a noted British medical journal, on a survey he had
conducted of more than 29,000 children living in 450 villages on
the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   The children in roughly half of the villages were given two oral
doses of vitamin A twice over a period of one year, and children in
the other villages were not.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, Sommer said, there were 34 percent fewer
deaths from all causes among children given the vitamin than among
those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, the reaction to Sommer's paper among other
scientists consisted of a flood of skeptical and even angry letters
the journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind regards new ideas the way the body regards a foreign
body,'' said William Foege, professor of international health at
Emory University and former director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. ``Al's finding is one of
those very crucial discoveries in public health. It was sitting
there for people to discover, but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Following several years of scientific skepticism, Sommer has
been honored for his work. Now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of
Hygiene and Public Health, he received the coveted Albert Lasker
Award for clinical medical research in 1997. Some scientists regard
him as a serious candidate for the Nobel Prize for medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, Sommer recalled that his initial
interest in the diets of children in Indonesia centered around eye
problems already known to be associated with lack of vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   One condition, night blindness, occurs because vitamin A is a
necessary to the body's synthesis of rhodopsin, which the retina
needs to detect dim light. More serious conditions involve eye
damage and permanent blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, a former member of CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service
``disease detectives,'' organized a large survey at the request of
the Indonesian government to relate eye problems to diet, recent
bouts of infectious disease and the amount of vitamin A in a
child's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing data from this survey, he stumbled onto the fact that
not only were children with vitamin A deficiency more likely to
have vision problems, they were more likely to die. He estimated
that adequate vitamin A prevented 16 percent of childhood deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite contrary recommendations from its scientific advisers,
AID then agreed to fund a second study to see if Sommer's first
observation was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The second study produced results that surprised even Sommer. It
found that deaths could be reduced by more than twice that what he
had suspected. This was the study for which he was criticized by
other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To call the reaction skepticism would be too mild,'' said Nils
Daulaire, a former AID worker who now heads the Global Health
Council, an association of nongovernmental organizations such as
Save the Children and CARE. ``He was subjected to broad
pooh-poohing. Very few people believed it could be possible to do
something as inexpensive with the dramatic results he was
claiming.''
</P>
<P>
   Daulaire said he was among the skeptics. At the time, he said,
he was working for a AID contractor in Nepal, so he designed his
own vitamin A trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treated several thousand children with vitamin A and
compared death rate with an untreated group,'' Daulaire said. ``In
a period of five months we observed 26 percent more deaths in the
untreated group and stopped the trial. The effect was so great we
felt we had to dose all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little _ and sometimes reluctantly _ other Third World
countries have repeated the experiment and found the same results.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer said even children who do not have eye problems may have
``sub-clinical'' deficiencies that make them more vulnerable to
disease. He said raising the level of the vitamin in a child's
blood to normal is all that is needed, and there is no need to go
above normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know precisely how improving vitamin A status has
its effect, but most evidence points to a more effective immune
response,'' he added. ``While adequate vitamin A doesn't prevent
infection, it seems to cause the infections to be less severe and
life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has also shown that giving vitamin A when a child has
measles can make the disease less severe.
</P>
<P>
   And Sommer said he recently found an article published in the
British Medical Journal in 1932 in which a scientist reported that
the death rate from childhood measles dropped 50 percent when
patients were given cod liver oil. Scientists now know cod liver
oil is rich in vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   Daulaire compared the effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation
to oral rehydration therapy, the system of giving small packets
containing water-soluble minerals lost during diarrhea. The therapy
has been credited with saving millions of lives, mostly among
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Al Sommer deserves the Nobel Prize for medicine for
what he did with vitamin A,'' Daulaire said, ``and a lot of other
people agree with me.''

   Other low cost life-saving public health measures:
</P>
<P>
   ORAL REHYDRATION THERAPY: Acute diarrhea kills millions of Third
World children each year, mostly through the rapid loss of water
and minerals. Cheap packets of sugar and salts developed in the
1970s at the international center for diarrheal disease research in
Bangladesh effectively replace the lost minerals for less than 2
cents per dose.
</P>
<P>
   SMALLPOX ERADICATION: In 10 years following the decision to
eradicate smallpox, the incidence of the disease went from 15
million new cases a year to zero. Smallpox eradication to date has
saved the world $20 billion in health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   MEASLES VACCINE: Originally ``piggy-backed'' on smallpox
vaccinations administered during the global smallpox eradication
program, measles vaccine now saves an estimated 1 million lives per
year.
</P>
<P>
   POLIO VACCINE: Although relatively few people died of polio,
hundreds of thousands were crippled every year. Thanks to a
worldwide vaccination program, the disease is within a few years of
eradication, health experts feel.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE,'' starring James Woods and Melanie
Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From the
director of the bruising and ominous ``Kids,'' this vibrant,
unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach.
Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but it
comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a
swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent
enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock
value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Woods, as a
junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this
full-throttle role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AT FIRST SIGHT,'' starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino.
Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong
and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr.
Oliver Sacks, Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness
was suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the
bright-eyed New York career woman who falls in love with him and
then urges him to change his once-peaceful life. But the film
brings little more than case-study data to communicating how this
man's restored sight affected him, or what made it a mixed
blessing. Sample dialogue: ``Have you ever listened to the rain? I
mean, really listened?'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room
for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in
the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond and then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``A CIVIL ACTION,'' starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall and
William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes).
This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters,
with Travolta first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a
conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal-thriller
genre. But Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film,
based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in
Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GENERAL,'' starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight.
Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Boorman's best
and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin
Cahill. Nicknamed ``the General'' for his crime-plotting
strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with
splendid brio by Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and
white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his
unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his
singular difficulties with the IRA and the law. Voight is
outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of
Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``HILARY AND JACKIE,'' starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms.
Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her
career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a
talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be
``ordinary,'' is one of the most insightful studies of sibling
rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the
movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child
who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband).
The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the
last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's
arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use
of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E
minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary
intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``IN DREAMS,'' starring Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn and Robert
Downey Jr. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 112 minutes). At heart this
is just a campfire story, and a pretty loony one at that. But
Jordan directs it furiously a la ``Interview With the Vampire''
with a lush, insinuating visual style that gets right under the
skin. Working with the inventive cinematographer Darius Khondji, he
stirs up a nightmare brooding and intuitive enough to recall at
times the richly textured mysteries of Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look
Now.'' Ms. Bening plays a psychic plagued by the thoughts of a
serial killer, whom Downey makes as bizarre and disturbing as he
can, in a performance that makes this story's craziest dreams come
true (Maslin).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``MY NAME IS JOE,'' starring Peter Mullan and Louise Goodall.
Directed by Ken Loach (R, 92 minutes). A splendid, feisty
performance by Mullan energizes this film about a recovering
alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. With humor and scrappy
intensity, Joe throws himself into coaching young athletes and
embarking tenuously on a love affair, only to find the expected
challenges to his new sobriety everywhere. Loach's commitment to
delineating social issues is accentuated by the way his star
breathes life into Joe and makes viewers root for his success.
Special bonus: This film breaks the brogue-and-burr barrier by
including helpful subtitles for the overlapping, heavily
Scottish-accented dialogue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PATCH ADAMS,'' starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
excuse for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,'' starring the voices of Val Kilmer,
Ralph Fiennes Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by
Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes).
First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus
from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily
to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an
admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must
initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and
miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators'
reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc
Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp
dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between
Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain
aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy
envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting
and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the
creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms.
Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first
great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This
one-time cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky,
and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``STEPMOM,'' starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed
Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's
ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his
two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female
stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest
person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the
especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama
lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages
to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the
circumstances) sense of fun. As in ``Home Alone,'' Columbus directs
with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise
(Maslin).

   ``STILL CRAZY,'' starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Bill
Nighy and Jimmy Nail. Directed by Brian Gibson (R, 96 minutes).
Twenty years after they last dropped acid in a Druid circle, an
over-the-hill English rock band tries to reunite, and the results
are meant to be both funny and heartwarming. Not an easy mix,
unless Spinal Tap really is your idea of a band that needs a second
chance. Despite an extremely likable cast that fits right into the
spirit of things, the director of ``What's Love Got to Do With It''
and the writers of ``The Commitments'' don't drum up enough drama
or sustained humor to make the most of their premise. The cast is
cheery and game, the material hit-or-miss (Maslin).

   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick
(R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war
epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's
viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached
visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most
beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if
the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin).

   ``REVOLUTION AND BEYOND: A SURVEY OF CUBAN CINEMA.'' Cuban
peasants wielding machetes fight for independence in 1868 against
Spanish soldiers in ``First Charge of the Machete.'' At 2 p.m.
Friday, this film by Manuel Octavio Gomez will open a retrospective
of some 30 films spanning the last 40 years of Cuban filmmaking. A
presentation of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in collaboration
with the Cuban Film Institute, the series provides an opportunity
to discover unfamiliar films made after the Castro-led overthrow of
the Batista dictatorship in 1959 as well as familiar hits like
``Strawberry and Chocolate'' (1994) by Tomas Gutierrez Alea. Two
films about Cuban slavery are also on the opening-day schedule _
Alea's ``Last Supper'' (1976), at 3:45 p.m., and ``The Other
Francisco'' (1974), by Sergio Giral, at 8:45 p.m. _ as is Juan
Carlos Tabio's political allegory ``The Elephant and the Bicycle''
(1995) at 6:30 p.m. The series continues through Feb. 25 at the
Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Admission: $8.50; $5 for
Film Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees.
Information and screening schedule: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van
Gelder).

CHINO-CORRUPTION (Chino Valley, Ariz.) - The town manager stole
nearly half a million dollars from a trust fund for the blind. The
Town Council concealed his past. A Parks and Recreation employee
who runs the town motocross track is a convicted killer. The town
conducted no background check. Needless to say, Chino Valley is in
an uproar. Especially since the former prisoner town manager was
very instrumental in the firing of the popular town police chief:
Arizona's first woman police chief and an instructor at the FBI
national academy. A recall election for the mayor and four council
members will be held in March. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DRINK-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - It turns out that you CAN drink and drive
in Arizona _ as long as you drink just before you jump in your car,
then drive real fast so you get home before the alcohol kicks in. A
loophole in the state's DUI law is allowing people to beat drunken
driving charges by claiming they drank heavily just before driving,
and that their blood alcohol level had yet to reach the legal limit
at the time they were stopped. The level only exceeded the limit
during the time it took for the officer to conduct an alcohol test,
they claim. The defense is so successful that the Legislature is
considering a bill to eliminate the loophole _ the only one of its
kind in the nation. By HAL MATTERN. Story will move in the `'A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CANYON-UPGRADES (Undated) - The Grand Canyon Foundation announces a
major corporate donation to kick off a campaign to bring light
rail, a new museum, bike paths and other improvements to the Grand
Canyon. This is part of a burst of activity that could drastically
improve _ or in some cases threaten _ the land around the canyon.
By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``a'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
KATIE LEE-BOOK (Phoenix) - Katie Lee was one of the few who knew
Glen Canyon before it was filled with the waters of Lake Powell.
``All My Rivers Are Gone: A Journey of Discovery Through Glen
Canyon'' chronicles her sojourns on the river and her own voyage of
self-discovery that evolved during her trips. Lee was introduced to
the life of a river runner in 1953 when she traveled the Colorado
on the second commercial power boat run through the Grand Canyon.
Rivers ran in her blood after that first trip. With PHOTOS. By
JULIE NEWBERG. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Here she comes, I thought to myself as I
stood in line at Walgreen's. She started off slowly, sliding in a
slight, almost unnoticeable slither up my spine. She began calling
me, louder and louder until it was impossible to ignore her. I felt
the touch of anxiety that she shot my way, and then it hit me like
a 50-foot wave. I could only think about one thing: I WANT A
CIGARETTE. NOW. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) Chevrolet Lumina is headed toward the end of
its road, destined to be replaced for 2000 as Chevy's
bread-and-butter family sedan by a more interesting craft bearing
an old name, Impala. The Lumina's styling is attractive, though
generic. Performance is competent, though bland. The overall theme
is mainstream to a fault, offending no one but not enticing anyone,
either. The big plus during its 10 years of existence has been its
affordability. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category.
Embargoed for Saturday, Jan. 30. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   February may be the shortest month, but it might be plenty long
for a few Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Side Man,'' at the John Golden Theater, have
been trying to cut costs for the remainder of the winter. Jay
Harris, one of the producers, said this week that the production
was working out a four-to-six-week royalty pool, wherein the
playwright, producer, director and major designers would receive
reduced royalty payments, or none at all, if the show begins to
lose money in any week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the show's box-office gross was $166,829, or about
$15,000 above breaking even. But Harris said advance sales for
coming weeks were slow, despite a special $35 ticket offer. ``So
far we've run at a profit,'' he said. ``But suddenly we're facing
some tough weeks and facing some tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The production has also asked for and received a rent reduction
from the Shubert Organization, which owns the Golden. The show's
star, Christian Slater, has also agreed to stay through Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, is going to prevent another daunting
element of February: new competition. The month's openings include
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' on Thursday, and three
straight plays: ``Death of a Salesman'' (Feb. 10), ``Night Must
Fall'' (Feb. 21) and ``Not About Nightingales'' (Feb. 25). And
don't even mention what a blizzard could do to sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade,'' at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, also
saw its box-office numbers slide last week. Bernard Gersten, the
theater's executive producer, said he was evaluating the show's
status, week to week. ``We have not veered in any significant way''
from the show's budget, he said. ``We haven't had any calamitous
surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center Theater, of course, is a nonprofit institution
with a large subscriber base, guaranteeing an audience each week.
Still, the theater produced ``Parade'' with Livent, which is now
bankrupt, and is currently swallowing the running cost and any
losses by itself. Last week, for example, the show grossed only
$245,023, meaning a net loss for Lincoln Center of about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' and ``Side Man'' are not alone; many Broadway shows
have endured sales slumps recently and have austerity measures in
place, from discount ticket deals to long-term royalty pools. And
both Harris and Gersten said their shows would be active contenders
for the Tony Awards. Tonys, of course, mean ticket buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony time is June, and that is a lo-o-o-ong way off. In the
meantime Gersten said he hoped the figures would bloom around St.
Patrick's Day. ``We're working as hard as we can to keep the show
going until the weather improves,'' he said. ``And enjoy the
madness of spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Load Up The Vans
</P>
<P>
   As the hunt for available theaters intensified, one piece of the
puzzle shifted this week with news that ``Peter Pan,'' which had
been booked for a return engagement in April at the Neil Simon
Theater, would play instead at the Gershwin Theater, just vacated
by ``On the Town.'' (All tickets already bought for the Simon will
simply transfer to the Gershwin.) Both theaters are owned by the
Nederlander Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The move opens up the Neil Simon, a smaller, more intimate
space, which is good news for a number of shows currently sniffing
around for Broadway houses. They include two revues, ``The
Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' and ``Putting It Together,'' a
Steven Sondheim sampler.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fervor to install musicals, several producers said,
was fueled by the perception of a weak field of potential Tony
nominees, especially in the new-musical category.
</P>
<P>
   One contender for the Neil Simon, however, is a familiar face:
``The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' The show will likely have to vacate its
current home at the Minskoff Theater in the fall to make way for
the musical ``Saturday Night Fever.'' Instead of closing, however,
the producers are looking to transfer. And for good reason: The
show's advance sale, now at $3 million, continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ta-ta, Mum
</P>
<P>
   One certainty for the spring is ``Ring Round the Moon,'' Jean
Anouilh's fantasy play about a pair of twins _ one good, one evil _
and a Cinderella-like ballerina. It opens on April 28 at the
Belasco Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play's cast is set and includes Irene Worth as a rich aunt
and Francie Swift as the ballerina. The central role (or roles) of
the twins will be played by the British actor Toby Stephens, who
just returned to London after finishing a run in Racine's
``Phedre'' and ``Brittanicus'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Rehearsals start in three weeks for what will be his Broadway
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing's not bad because I just lost my flat and had to
move back in my mum's place,'' said Stephens, from London. (His
mother is Maggie Smith, the actress.) ``She'd begun to look at me
like, `How long you staying here?'''
</P>
<P>
   An Offer Refused
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a near-perfect match of character and actor.
Last May, Alexander H. Cohen said that he would produce
``Othello,'' with Iago, that treacherous schemer, played by Al
Pacino, who has portrayed a few bad guys in his day.
</P>
<P>
   But after several delays the deal seems to be off. Cohen said
this week that he'd never been able to settle on so much as a
rehearsal schedule with Pacino. ``From my vantage point, it has
been a giant waste of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Buxbaum, a spokeswoman for Pacino, confirmed the project
had ``fallen by the wayside.'' But she left open the possibility
that it could be revived. ``Al's a big fan of the material,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along The Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Victor Borge, only 90, is looking for a theater for a
three-to-five-week Broadway run in late April or early May, said
his manager, James Murtha. ``It's not a farewell performance,''
said Murtha. ``He's planning on performing to 106.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Playwright Edward Albee and actor Tim Robbins will give
readings at 7 p.m. on Thursday to benefit the Theater for the New
City, in the East Village. Tickets are $100.

 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kate Clinton thinks reaction to Ellen DeGeneres'
sitcom was pretty funny. Even some gay men and lesbians, she points
out, thought the show was ``too gay.'' Maybe, she suggests, ``it
should have been gay every other week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clinton's imperfect but ultimately terrific one-woman show
at Westbeth, on the other hand, should be gay from beginning to
end. Luckily, much of it is. &UR;  &LR;  ``Correct Me If I'm Right!'' falters
in the beginning, though. Maybe it's time for Ms. Clinton, now an
established urban sophisticate and lesbian humorist, to retire the
jokes about her old days as a high school English teacher in
upstate New York. She's probably right that being a teacher was
great preparation for knowing ``how to work a room,'' but it's
doubtful that many in her audience come to hear about the student
who thought the plural of leaf was tree. The first act of Ms.
Clinton's show also relies on a lot of Manhattan-recognition humor;
she gets appreciative laughs at one point just by mentioning
Fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The first act does have its moments, though. Ms. Clinton is
often asked if Janet Reno is a lesbian, she says. Her answer: ``I
don't know, but her hair is.'' She observes how happy Hillary
Rodham Clinton always looks when she's photographed in another
country these days. She's noticed that there's ``too much skating
on television.'' And she's a little fed up with well-intentioned
but overzealous Manhattan parents who consider every moment a
teaching opportunity, even introductions to Mommy and Daddy's
friends (``This is Kate. What other words begin with K?'').
</P>
<P>
   But things really pick up after intermission, when Ms. Clinton
begins commenting on the state of being gay at the turn of the
millennium, when a ``freedom-to-marry kit'' is for sale. ``We used
to be a movement,'' she says. ``Now we're a market.'' She's a
little perplexed that people think there aren't already gay people
in the military (two words: Gomer Pyle). And although toward the
end she veers back into general political territory, about the
likes of Kenneth Starr and William Rehnquist (when they did drug
testing on him, it turned up traces of formaldehyde), who can argue
with the observation that Marilyn Quayle seems suspiciously like a
new Lily Tomlin character?
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to be gay to appreciate Ms. Clinton's gay
humor, especially observations like ``I'm worried about straight
people; I don't think things are going well for them'' (thank you
for noticing) and ``Gay people are getting more like straight
people, and vice versa'' (there is no question that this is a
compliment to heterosexuals). It's not that Ms. Clinton is off-base
when she's dealing with other subjects; it's just that sexual
identity is such a deeply felt issue and there are still too few
outlets in which to laugh about it, even in 1999. Fairway jokes we
can get from Nora Ephron movies.
</P>

IN JAPAN, FORD BETS ON THE CUTE LITTLE KA 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(See also FORD-VOLVO, FORD-EUROPE) (ATTN: Mich., Japan)   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The steering wheel is on the right-hand side and the
air-conditioning system was specially designed to stand up to
Japan's sticky summers, but the Ford Ka, the most visible plank of
Ford Motor Co.'s efforts to resuscitate its gasping business here,
may have a tough road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The car that Ford is counting on to burnish its image in Japan,
where its market share is one-half of 1 percent, went on sale
Thursday for delivery in late March. Eiji Iwakuni, a former Honda
executive, has been hired to turn Ford around here.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japanese, ``ka'' means mosquito, and the cars are only
available with manual transmissions, which are about as popular in
Japan as diesel engines are in the United States. Only 13 percent
of the Japanese-made cars sold here last year had manual
transmissions, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if there were an automatic
transmission,'' Iwakuni acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The Ka was originally developed for the European market, where
consumers tend to like small, cheap, functional cars. Thus, Ford
never developed an automatic transmission for the car, which was
introduced in the fall of 1996 and is built in Spain. Ford has sold
roughly 500,000 units to date.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker had toyed with the idea of developing an automatic
transmission for the model sold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But, Iwakuni said, development costs and the prospect of a later
introduction here, where Ford is eager to improve its business,
persuaded the company to put a car up for sale that features an
obvious, built-in barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Ford acknowledges the hurdle, with company officials saying Ka's
lack of an automatic transmission forced them to scale back their
sales projections. The company now plans to sell 5,000 of the cars
here this year. Last year, the company sold 21,995 cars, 6,677 of
which were imports. The rest were assembled here by Mazda Motor
Corp., in which Ford holds a 33.4 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   James Treece, the Asia editor for Automotive News, said that
while Ford would have a harder time selling a manual transmission,
it was not overestimating its ability to sell the car. ``Five
thousand cars is not shooting for the moon,'' he said. ``And unlike
in the U.S., where you'd have a really difficult time selling a
manual because almost no one knows how to drive them, in Japan you
still have a majority of people who learn how to drive a manual.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiroo Tanabe, a spokesman for Ford Japan, said that adding an
automatic transmission would have raised the price of the Ka, now
at 1.5 million yen, or about $13,000, to 1.8 million yen, or more
than $15,000, which would have made it less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The Ka will compete here with the Opel Vita, the Volkswagen Golf
and Toyota's new small car model, the Vitz. The most popular
three-door Vitz sells for 928,000 yen, or about $8,070, a Toyota
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ka, with its bulbous figure, has a strong ``kawaii,'' or
cute, factor, which is important to the young consumers who may
help Ford overcome the unpopularity of the manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Ford will bring four models to Japan this year _ the Ka,
the Lincoln LS and two cars that will be made for Ford by Mazda.
</P>
<P>
   It is also overhauling its dealer network, closing some small
storefront showrooms and paring down its outlets. It has hired a
pop music star, Tetsuya Komuro, a songwriter and music producer
behind several popular bands here, to promote the Ka.

`NEW WORLD LANDSCAPES': MAKING THE FAMILIAR SEEM STRANGE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Thailand, N.J., Pa.)   By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a visitor from another planet who has landed on
Earth, the color photographs of Jan Staller mirror an urban
landscape that is eerily, often spectacularly alien. Again and
again he shows that the trappings and detritus of 20th-century life
can be as mysterious as the glyphs of giant creatures and geometric
patterns left on the desert floor in southern Peru by an obscure
pre-Incan culture.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, his book of photographs last year, showing work
made over 15 years, is called ``On Planet Earth: Travels in an
Unfamiliar Land'' (Aperture). Staller's ability to turn the
terrestrial into the extraterrestrial, the ordinary into the
extraordinary, is on display at the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo.
This exhibition of 14 large prints includes two images from the
book _ ``Workshop, Ruins of State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, Pa.''
and ``Tapioca Plants, Thailand'' _ that serve as a kind of bridge
to the mostly newer work. The show runs through Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Through the meticulous framing of his subject and in many
instances the use of harsh stadium lights, Staller can portray an
outdoor scene at dusk as if he has just landed in an unidentified
flying object, the space craft's lights casting a ghostly glow on
everything close by but leaving everything in the distance _ a city
skyline or low mountains and open sky _ looking normal. Even when
he photographs inside a building, he uses existing light (and long
exposures) as if it were lent by an alien spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Workshop, Ruins of State Penitentiary,'' for example, the
white glow from a barred skylight is strong enough to show an
interior that is grim but esthetically striking. Ranged along one
wall are three big blocks: one is full of cubbyholes, another
consists of wood planks bearing old nail marks and strips of wood
with nails in them, and the third, painted red, is a metal door
with odd cutouts in it. To complete the somber decor, wood planks
are laid across the floor, the mostly vertical lines paralleling
the bars in the skylight and offsetting the horizontal lines on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In Staller's daytime pictures, like the delightfully surreal
``Tapioca Plants, Thailand,'' blue sky and brown earth are
frequently the dominant motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Here a big cluster of stalks sitting in splendid isolation on
parched land is crowned with luxuriant green leaves, wisps of
clouds in the blue sky almost forming a halo around the green
crown. Is this, a viewer might ask, the Thai version of the golden
sheaf of wheat?
</P>
<P>
   Although the indoor and outdoor images differ in feel and tone,
they are all part of Staller's vision of a world whose inhabitants
leave puzzling markings that are sometimes darkly, sculpturally
beautiful or dreamily enigmatic.
</P>
<P>
   That the dark and the light are all of a piece is marvelously
illustrated in the exhibition's first four photographs, hung on one
gallery wall.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spray Booth, Brooklyn,'' Staller uses the site's existing
spotlights to transform a grungy industrial paint shop into a place
of exquisitely detailed Old Master beauty. The walls near two of
the spotlights have the texture of black-on-black oil paintings;
the spotlight on the ceiling trains a beam of amber light on the
brownish objects on a rusty brown shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Lending energy to the picture are strips of old wire hanging
from the shelf and rubber hose trailing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond a low stand encrusted with black paint in the middle
of the image are four rows of brilliant turquoise squares (air
filters), with one or several in each row turned pitch black.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the turquoise-square theme are two pictures taken in
a restaurant overlooking the water in East Ocean, South Korea. The
image next to ``Spray Booth'' is a close-up of metal frames
overlooking the restaurant's expansive outdoor balcony with its red
overhead framework and its wall of glass in white metal frames.
What is near and what is far are initially baffling, since Staller
places his camera at a spot where the outside glass wall panels
seem to be part of the metal framing in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   The image's main point of interest is another visual trick. On
two center glass panels, which are of a darker shade of turquoise
blue than the sea and sky beyond, are broad jagged bands (actually
tape holding together the broken glass) that effectively break the
monotony of the metal framing and overhead grids.
</P>
<P>
   In the next picture of the restaurant's balcony, the camera
moves farther back. In the image's foreground are glass sliding
doors, their small red squares echoing the square blue glass panels
but overlapping tidily with one sliding door halfway open.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling even further away, to the great outdoors, Staller in
``DMZ, Korea'' shows coils of barbed wire on an otherwise empty
beach. Instead of looking vicious, the barbed wire with even
notches is arranged in a circular, gently sculptural formation, as
if it were a Christo-like attempt to impose an outlandish note on a
pristine setting. Staller adds his own touch by aligning the tops
of the barbed wire with the edge of the horizon, where the darker
blue of the sea meets the light blue of a peaceful sky. Not all
Staller's images are successful. His ``Rice Paddy, Korea'' is
indistinguishable from many other pictures of bucolic green fields,
despite slightly dissonant metal guard rails in the foreground. His
``Root Ball, Korea'' brings to mind certain of Toshio Shibata's
photographs in which he shows the Japanese tendency to wrap outdoor
objects with infinite care.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Root Ball'' is a striking image, it lacks that
distinctive Staller edge, since it doesn't go much further than
show a huge root ball _ crisscrossed with rope, thick wire and blue
bands _ perched on a ledge of reddish brown earth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, two photographs he took on New Year's Day
this year are astonishing in their powerful and menacing bleakness.
Both are titled ``Elizabeth, N.J.'' In one the entire image is dark
brown mud _ the kind so thick it resembles sea waves and so
malleable someone tracking through it leaves clear, fresh shoe
prints behind. Inexplicably, near the trail of shoe marks is a
large green blotch resembling spilled paint.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, starker ``Elizabeth, N.J.,'' a desolate moonscape
greets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Taking center stage and lying on its side is a section of black
metal tubing with circular ridges. This foreboding land is
featureless all the way to the horizon, where a sliver of white sky
quickly gives way to lowering clouds.

MAURESMO MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE _ St. Tropez was a snoozy fishing village on the
French Riviera until a sultry young unknown called Brigitte Bardot
showed up to inject herself, the town, and a director named Roger
Vadim into the world's consciousness. Their 1956 movie: ``And God
Created Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Today St. Tropeziens, and everybody else in France, are
wondering hopefully if God has created a woman tennis champion in
the form of a similarly undiscovered kid with a St. Tropez address,
19-year-old Amelie Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the quick, supple Mauresmo was a nonentity. She, like
Bardot, had been on favorable view before, as the Wimbledon junior
champ of 1996. But in nervelessly knocking planetary No. 1 Lindsay
Davenport out of the Australian Open Thursday, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5,
coming from 28 lengths behind in the rankings _ and twice a service
break down in the decisive set _ to do it, Amelie has established
herself as the prime outsider in a tournament ravaged by such.
</P>
<P>
   No Riviera fisherwoman herself, Mauresmo nevertheless landed the
most formidable catch of the fortnight, hooking US Open champ
Davenport with a line-drive backhand well out of Long Lindsay's
very long reach on a second match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amelie just threw everything into that last shot,'' whewed
Lindsay. ``Where she surprised me, at the end of the match _ when I
was up a break at 2-1 and again, 4-2 _ she just stepped up and hit
great shots. And I didn't. She beat me in Berlin _ but that was
clay. I didn't think she could play that well on hard courts. Her
serve (nine aces, 12 winners) was tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Every tennis loyalist in France, from First Hacker Jacques
Chirac in the presidential palace on down, must have hummed the
``Marsellaise'' when that match-point replay was shown again and
again. Could it be that the country's first major champion since
Yannick Noah 16 years ago will be crowned at Melbourne Park
Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis may have something negative to say about that in
their callow title bout. Thirty-eight years have passed since the
most recent bracketing of teenagers here. Australia's last, 1962,
was homegrown 18-year-old Margaret Court, over 19-year-old Jan
Lehane, first female to flap a both-handed backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Champ the last two years, 18-year-old Hingis wrecked Monica
Seles's perfect record at the Open, 6-2, 6-4, in the other semi.
Seles, the victor in 1991-92-93 and 1996, was riding a 33-match
streak. Now Martina's is 20.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis already had said something else negative during her press
conference in German: ``Amelie's here with her girlfriend _ she's
half a man.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it will take more than catty sniping to beat the
cheerful, engaging Mauresmo, who has been straightforwardly casual
about that aspect of her life. ``I moved to St. Tropez from Paris
to be with my girlfriend, Silvie Bourdon,'' she has told French
journalists, and feels that traveling together has kept her happy
and ``relache'' (relaxed).
</P>
<P>
   It's evident that her tennis has been happy and relaxed, too,
punctuated by smiles and air-punching elation as she darted across
the court, playing to win. Presenting Davenport with a puzzle of
mixed spins and speeds, power when needed, no shyness about dashing
to the net, she was deceptively deadly with that rarity, a
single-handed backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's strong, big shoulders,'' said Davenport. ``I know she
goes to the gym a lot. Wearing that tank top, there was no question
about her strong physique.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times a week to the gym,'' smiled dark-eyed Mauresmo,
her streaked auburn hair pulled back. Gone is her mysterious court
presence behind huge shades. ``Now I have contact lenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since, as she says, contact with Noah behind the glass of a TV
screen propelled Amelie to this height, maybe her story line goes
all the way back to Arthur Ashe in 1971. That year, on an African
tour, Ashe encountered Noah, a young Cameroonian, batting tennis
balls with a plank. Ashe liked what he saw, gave the kid a racket,
urged the French federation to give him a tennis education. Fair
enough, since Noah's mother is French. Voila _ 12 years later,
Yannick had the French title, becming the first citizen to seize a
major since Francoise Durr won in Paris in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Yannick win on TV when I was 4 and made up my mind I
would be a player,'' Mauresmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Another flashback: to opening day of the Open. Out in the wilds,
Court 14. Few witnesses besides Bourdon and the coach, Christophe
Fournerie. Amelie is virtually out of action before the tournament
has even begun. Floridian Corina Morariu has her embalmed, 6-2,
5-2, with two match points and serving. ``Nothing to lose'' _
Mauresmo swats a forehand winner and is resuscitated on her way to
the penthouse, the stadium, where 14,942 watched her ambush
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first round,'' she said, ``I am loose and think I
can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for Mauresmo-mentum?

FAN INTEREST? DON'T BELIEVE THE POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you were looking for a quiet place to take a midday
nap last week, chances are you were not at the Celtics' Merrimac
Street offices. Unless, of course, the sounds of constantly ringing
telephones put you to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   If you were looking for a safe place to enter a basketball arena
earlier this week, chances are you were not outside Gate 1 at
SkyDome. Unless, of course, thousands of people rushing turnstiles
and taking down doors is your idea of a safe entrance.
</P>
<P>
   And if you were looking for a local place where the polls would
come to life _ a place where large percentages of fans say they
don't care about the Celtics and the NBA _ chances are you don't
have time to read this; it is difficult to read and look for
indifference at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Polls by ESPN/Chilton and the New York Times/CBS Sportsline
indicated that the NBA would have major problems when it returned
from its 204-day lockout. The ESPN poll, taken in November, stated
that 63 percent of fans said they would not care if the season were
wiped out. In a November editorial, USA Today announced that the
``NBA has more than labor problems to worry about. It is suffering
from fan ennui.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason for anyone to doubt the polls. But a strong
case can be made that the pollsters interviewed some of the leading
indecisive minds in America. The NBA season opener is a week away,
and already, the polls are looking obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the Celtics were in Worcester for an open
practice at the Centrum. The practice was free. It was also packed.
Friday night the Celtics and their very familiar neighbors, the
Raptors, play an exhibition game at the FleetCenter. The game is
free. It also will be packed. Long before the 18,624 tickets were
taken, the Celtics were receiving calls from curious fans looking
for a place to pick up their tickets. And long after the tickets
were gone, the phones in the team's offices continued to ring.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic could attribute all this to American indulgence. But
that would not explain the Tuesday night scene in Toronto, when
fans tore down two doors so they could quickly get to obstructed
view seats in a nonbasketball facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Kenny Anderson said Thursday. ``What is it? Paul
Pierce? Rick Pitino? What is it, man? We're putting people in the
seats. I don't know what it is. I just think people are interested
in basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds after saying that, Anderson noticed Pitino walking
a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe everyone is interested in seeing Rick Pitino on the
sideline wearin' one of those nice suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men got a laugh out of that. And at different times, both
would say that the free tickets certainly aren't hurting the
attendance figures. Still, the interest level appears to be deeper
than freebies and handouts. Anderson should know. His summer and
winter were full of public relations disasters. He was held up as
the symbol of what's wrong with NBA players. But the team's point
guard spent part of last Sunday at a ticket window talking with
fans and listening to their remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were cool,'' he said. ``It was nice. It wasn't real
difficult or nothing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson may not have said the right thing during the lockout
when he joked that he would have to sell one of his luxury cars to
generate income. But he seemed to capture the essence of fan
interest with his words Thursday. Very simply: Basketball fans are
basketball fans. It takes a lot to turn them off to the point where
you won't see them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the season starts, people love basketball,'' Dwayne
Schintzius said. ``The Super Bowl will be over and then you'll have
college ball and the pros. People can watch volleyball, soccer, and
stuff like that, but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson may have been joking about fans wanting to see Pitino
in his Armani suits, but there is some truth to that statement.
People do want to see Pitino simply because they also want to see
Pitino's team. It does not appear that the lockout has changed
expectations. Celtic fans were excited about Pierce before the
lockout and they are even more so after his 14-point, 7-rebound
debut Tuesday. Clippers fans, however, are most likely at the same
level now as they were in June. That means chances are you will be
able to find an empty seat at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thing is: If you know who is going to win the race,
there's really not much excitement,'' Pitino said. ``But when you
don't know who is going to win the race, fanfare becomes bigger
than ever. Right now no one knows who is going to win the race and
everybody is smelling a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated 50-game season has given all hope. It has given
hope to young teams who begin strong and then fade because of
youth. It has given hope to older teams who begin strong and then
fade because of age. It has given hope to fans, who have 32 fewer
games to watch and can now see the importance of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was about to finish speaking when he thought of another
example of fan interest. ``Madison Square Garden,'' he said of his
hometown arena, ``was packed (Wednesday night).''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what happened there, right? Latrell Sprewell, a
Knicks guard, was on the floor. He is the same player who once
choked his coach, the same player who saw his name mentioned
unfavorably in headlines, the same player whom fans promised never
to root for again. Before Wednesday night was over, Garden fans
were on their feet, giving Sprewell a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just New York,'' Anderson said. ``People are excited
everywhere.''

HARVARD TO PUMP UP FUNDING FOR SCIENCE PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard University, as part of a long-term plan to fundamentally
alter the way it educates students and conducts research, announced
Thursday it will spend hundreds of millions of dollars during the
next five years for new science programs.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 million to $200 million investment, which officials
described as ``seed money'' that would draw far more in private and
government funds, is intended to keep Harvard at the cutting edge
of research and teaching in genetics, neuroscience, computer
technology, and other young or emerging fields.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the spending on science is part of a strategic
effort by president Neil Rudenstine and his dean for the faculty of
arts and sciences, Jeremy R. Knowles, to accomplish two goals: add
significant resources in relatively new areas of inquiry, and move
the university away from traditional educational formats. The idea
is to restructure the university so that more teaching cuts across
or even combines traditionally separate subjects, while research
increasingly is conducted in a similar inderdisciplinary manner
rather than by individuals who win grants for relatively narrow
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that in your next century, and mine, that
the best things and the most exciting things are done here,''
Knowles said Thursday. ``The idea, simply, is to make Harvard a
place where one can do one's best work, surrounded by colleagues
and students and resources that make it irresistible.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs announced Thursday involve the creation of two new
facilities, to be started with $70 million in funding that already
has been allocated. They are the Center for Genomics and
Proteomics, for the study of genes and their proteins;and the
Center for Imaging and Mesoscale Materials, for examining and
developing minuscule machines composed of patterns of atoms.
</P>
<P>
   Planning has also begun for a third facility, to study
neuroscience. Officials said the $150 million to $200 million total
in the next five years could finance construction, equipment, and
staff for additional centers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, Stanford, the California Institute of Technology, and
other universities already have allotted tens of millions of
dollars for the study of genetics, one of the hottest scientific
fields today. Harvard officials acknowledged they have some
catching up to do to remain academically competitive; the amount of
money they plan to spend, however, makes it appear that their
intent is to get ahead of the pack and not just join it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a combination of playing catch-up in some cases
and, in others, forging out on our own,'' said David Nelson,
chairman of Harvard's physics department. He noted, for instance,
that other schools are plunging deeply into gene research, but that
no other comparable facilites have been started for mesoscale or
neurosciece research.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is able to aggressively pursue its ambitions because its
$13 billion endowment is the largest of any educational institution
in the world, and its current $2.1 billion fund-raising drive is a
success. The university has been sharply criticized in the past for
not using enough of that largess to offset student costs and
institute educational improvements, but that began to change last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Harvard announced the most sweeping restructuring
of its undergraduate financial aid program in three decades _ with
a 20 percent increase in assistance, an additional $2,000 per
student annually, and an easing of work-study requirements. In
December, the school said it would tap its endowment for an extra
$95 million annually to help decrease class sizes, hire more
professors, and make other broad changes.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of science programs is another major way in which
the new infusion of capital will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles said that, since he and Rudenstine arrived at Harvard in
the early 1990s, they have planned to institute a series of reforms
``to secure and strengthen us for the coming century.''
</P>
<P>
   The first was to increase financial aid to lessen financial
pressures and improve students' academic prospects. The second was
to decrease nonseminar class sizes, which fell this year from a
maximum of 20 to 18, and increase the number of faculty; 12 were
added this year, for a total of 650, and Knowles said he will
continue the trend for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The final goal, he said, was to start dismantling the boundaries
among traditionally distinct areas of study.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, various subjects in the humanities were brought
together _ both by housing them in the same buildings for the first
time and by promoting cross-disciplinary teaching. Social sciences
received similar treatment a few years later, and now the physical
sciences are following suit.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for such changes, at colleges around the
country, is the belief that students learn to think more creatively
when teaching isn't segmented or linear. Last year, for instance,
an English professor and a psychology professor at Harvard offered
a class on memory and imagination, with reading material that
ranged from American literature to biology.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the impetus also is rooted in financial and operational
realism.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the equipment needed to conduct scientific
research, especially in genetics and other emerging fields, is
extraordinarily expensive. The work itself is frequently so complex
that it requires biologists, chemists, computer specialists, and
sometimes experts in additional fields.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, research and development in the private sector doesn't
function the way it traditionally has in academic settings, where
individuals with specific ideas might apply for grants and then
guide their research from start to finish. In business, diverse
teams are assembled from the start to expedite the completion of a
project so it can get to market.
</P>
<P>
   So, as with so many aspects of higher education today, operating
in a cross-disciplinary manner is partly intended to prepare
students for the jobs they eventually will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``To maintain and strengthen Harvard's preeminence in higher
education . . . means you cannot do things the same way in the
future as you did in the past,'' said the university's provost,
Harvey Fineberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing how to change is no easy trick,'' he added, ``but
knowing you must change is essential.''

 &HT;    Southern to purchase stake in China power plant operator
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. is expected to purchase a 10 percent
stake in a Chinese provincial electric power plant operator when
the state-owned enterprise sells shares to private investors early
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Electric Power Asia, Southern's Hong Kong-based
electric power subsidiary, is seen as the ``strategic investor'' in
an initial public offering by Shandong International Power
Development Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   According to press reports from Hong Kong, Southern has agreed
to purchase 40 percent of the share offer, which is intended to
raise up to $285 million. The price will be set next week, and
dealing in shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is to begin Feb.
9.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Shandong province would retain majority
control of the power company, but Southern/CEPA would hold 10
percent through an indirectly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are closley watching the deal following recent
decisions by two other state-owned Chinese enterprises to cancel
their offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is one of the largest growth markets for private power
projects and presents tremendous long-term potential for IPP
(independent power plant) investment,'' said Southern spokesman
David Mould.
</P>
<P>
   China's growth potential for electricity is clearly evident in
Shandong province, 300 miles north of Shanghai on the Yellow Sea
coast. There are about 17,000 megawatts of generating capacity for
a population of 87 million _ about the same generating capacity
Southern's Georgia Power Co. subsidiary operates for 7 million
Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong International Power Development owns 13 power plants in
the province with combined capacity of 3,600 megawatts but is
expected to build more to meet growing demand in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for
authority to more than double _ to almost $8 billion _ its
investments in unregulated businesses outside its prime Southeast
service territory. But the company said most of the anticipated new
investments would be inside the United States. Southern last year
announced participation in plans to build and operate a
600-megawatt coal-fired plant in Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's CEPA unit is also currently building a $1.4 billion
power plant in the Philippines and has taken a 28 percent stake in
a prospective power plant project in Thailand.

REPLAYING THE DAYS OF BLACK VAUDEVILLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ga., Mo., Md., Ill. Washington) `ROLLIN' ON THE T.O.B.A.': (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Song, dance, comedy, eloquent prose and fine music
are mingled with nostalgia, bitterness and sadness in ``Rollin' on
the T.O.B.A.,'' the potent and instructive entertainment that
opened Thursday night at the 47th Street Theater here.
</P>
<P>
   This tribute to the last days of black vaudeville transports its
audience back to 1931 for a ride along the circuit that carried
black performers to black audiences in shabby, underequipped
theaters in places like Atlanta, St. Louis, Baltimore, Chicago and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Exploited by the T.O.B.A. _ the Theater Owners' Booking
Association _ some of the finest entertainers in America did as
many as 10 shows a day, had to pay their own travel expenses and
were subjected to Jim-Crow laws that barred them from white-only
hotels, restaurants and bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The performers bore names like Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson,
Pigmeat Markham and Moms Mabley, and this production provides an
affectionate homage.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived and written by Ronald ``Smokey'' Stevens and Jaye
Stewart, and directed by Stevens and Leslie Dockery, this show
stars Stevens as half of the comedy act of Stevens and Stewart
(Rudy Roberson) as they travel the circuit and occasionally hook up
with one of its queens of song, the formidable Bertha Mae Little
(Sandra Reaves-Phillips).
</P>
<P>
   Basically a revue, with enough connective narrative to evoke the
loneliness and hardship of the road and of black life in segregated
America, ``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.'' treats its audience to
routines accompanied sometimes by recorded music and often by the
gifted David Alan Bunn, the musical director, who brings not only
flying fingers but also nimble heel and flexed elbow to the music
bubbling out of his piano.
</P>
<P>
   The composers in question range from Duke Ellington and Charles
Gounod to Fats Waller and Eubie Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Given its age and its quantity, the material is sometimes
uneven. But the multitalented Stevens and Roberson and Ms.
Reaves-Phillips go at it with zest and panache and deliver a fair
share of treats.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens brings down the house with his account of an encounter
with a terrifying hulk. He and Roberson cleverly mime a game of
chess that involves slow-motion combat with guns, swords and
various body parts. They even put over an old joke about the young
Jesse James. Roberson brings the audience to laughter when he sings
``Huggin' and Chalkin','' about a man with a very large girlfriend.
Ms. Reaves-Phillips, often swathed in feathered boas and gowns
glittering with rhinestones and sequins and dripping with fringes,
growls and sashays her way through numbers like ``St. Louis
Blues,'' ``Take Me as I Am'' and the lusty ``One Hour Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, there are caustic, proud, perceptive words from
the writings of Langston Hughes on blackness and the need for black
support for black artists.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, the audience has a chance to join the singing and,
at the evening's end, be grateful for many reasons that the days of
black vaudeville have rolled around once more.

choice: a conventional strip-search or an X-ray. For innocent
travelers, an X-ray would be less degrading than a strip-search by
a stranger in uniform. And for Customs inspectors, it would be

GREENSPAN SEES INTERNET STOCKS AS FASCINATING LONG SHOT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has made a habit of worrying in public that
stock prices are getting out of hand, but when Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve Board chairman, was asked Thursday about the
highest-flying investments of all, Internet companies, his answer
was tinged as much with fascination and even enthusiasm as with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan hardly suggested that he had become a day trader, one
of a new breed of investors who go online to trade technology
stocks on rumor and whim. He left no doubt, though, that he sees
more good than bad in a phenomenon that has driven the market value
of America Online higher than that of General Motors and pushed the
share price of an upstart company like Ebay from $18 to over $300
in just four months.
</P>
<P>
   The upward march of Internet stocks continued again Thursday.
Reaction to better-than-expected earnings from America Online, the
dominant Internet access provider, and an announced acquisition by
Yahoo, the largest World Wide Web search engine, of Geocities, the
biggest provider of personal Web pages, pushed technology indexes
and many company shares to new highs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a Senate Budget Committee hearing by Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., about the attention surrounding Internet stocks, Greenspan
cited not irrational exuberance but the very real prospect of
success for at least some companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you wouldn't get hype working if there weren't
something fundamentally sound under it,'' Greenspan said. ``The
issue really gets to the increasing evidence that a significant
part of the distribution of goods and services in this country is
going to move from conventional channels into some form of Internet
system _ whether it's retail goods or services or a variety of
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential market is so big, Greenspan said, that there are
``pie in the sky'' growth opportunities for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And undoubtedly some of these small companies, which have
stock prices going through the roof, will succeed and they very
well may justify even higher prices,'' Greenspan said. ``The vast
majority are almost sure to fail. That's the way the markets work
in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest he come across like an analyst promoting a hot sector,
Greenspan quickly added that he viewed the entire Internet-stock
phenomenon as another example of human willingness to bet on a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   He compared buying Internet stocks to playing the lottery. For
centuries, he said, people have been willing to pay more for a
lottery ticket than their chances of winning would justify, because
they are captivated by the possibility, however remote, of a big
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means is that when you are dealing with stocks _ the
possibilities of which are it's going to be valued at zero or some
huge number _ you get a premium in that stock price which is
exactly the same sort of price-evaluation process that goes on in
the lottery,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   There always has been a certain dissonance between Greenspan's
libertarian faith in the market and his fretfulness about the
ability of investors to gauge risk. There has been a disconnect of
late between Greenspan's concerns that Wall Street could be in for
a downturn and the policy of interest-rate cuts he pursued last
fall, probably the single biggest factor in the market's latest
rise.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday Greenspan sounded downright sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there's some hype,'' he said, but the securities
markets seemed to be doing a good job of funneling capital to
promising ideas even if they had not yet proved profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good for our system,'' Greenspan said. ``With all of
this hype and craziness, that is something that at the end of the
day probably is more plus than minus.''

AT LEAST 8 DEAD, 60 INJURED IN BLAST IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ An explosion Monday in a county seat in southeastern
China killed at least eight people and injured more than 60,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blast has not been determined, officials said,
but a local journalist said there was evidence that it was
intentional, and one doctor said victims had nails in their wounds.
There has been no announcement of a suspect or a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, in the town of Yizhang along the southern border of
Hunan province, became widely known only after a brief account
appeared Wednesday night in a major newspaper in neighboring
Guangdong province. As of Thursday evening, China's official
national news agency and Beijing newspapers had not reported it.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred just after 11 a.m. Monday in front of a
row of grocery stalls, and almost across the street from the county
government office, a local television editor said in a telephone
interview. The explosion left remnants of victims' clothing hanging
in the trees, according to an article Wednesday night in the
Yangcheng Evening News, published in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the county hospital confirmed by telephone that
eight people had died, one on the scene of the blast and seven more
at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor at another nearby hospital, the Traditional Medicine
Hospital, told the Reuters news agency that nine had died. He also
said there were nails in the victims' wounds, suggesting the
possibility of a homemade nail bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone, an official of the Yizhang Public Security
Bureau would only say the case ``is still under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But an editor with the local cable television station, Zong
Zhijun, said, ``Preliminary investigation has found that the
explosion was intentional and that handmade explosives were used.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was the second this month in Hunan province, which
has been the site of recent worker and farmer protests over
corruption, unpaid wages and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Used in mines and elsewhere, explosives are widely available in
rural China. Accidental explosions and blasts set in personal
vendettas or robberies are not rare. There has been no public
evidence that the recent explosions in Hunan or others reported
around the country involved political motives.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, a crude bomb exploded in a bus in the provincial
capital of Changsha, seriously wounding four people including a
woman who lost both legs. Witnesses said a man who appeared to be a
farmer put a lighted cigarette into a bag and got off the bus
before the bag exploded, according to the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been announced in that case.
</P>
<P>
   In early January in Daolin township, just outside Changsha,
thousands of farmers held protests against what they called
excessive and arbitrary taxes levied by corrupt local officials. On
Jan. 8, as police dispersed the crowd with clubs and tear gas, one
protester was killed when he was hit by a gas canister and bled to
death, according to witnesses and a human rights group in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy slowing, unemployment rising and protests by
unpaid workers or overtaxed farmers erupting frequently, China's
leaders have said that social stability is their pre-eminent goal
for 1999. They have announced campaigns against crime and
corruption as well as their intentions of arresting any people who
try to organize alternative political groups or labor unions.

GAY RIGHTS GROUP TO INVESTIGATE LACKLAND AFB GAY DISCHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force agreed Thursday to allow a gay rights
organization to investigate the high rate of homosexual discharges
at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, which accounted for more
than half of the Air Force's homosexual discharges last year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came during the first-ever meeting between senior
Air Force officials and leaders of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, which represents military personnel discharged from the
armed forces because they are gay or lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director for the group, said Air
Force representatives agreed to allow the gay rights organization
to visit Lackland and interview service members, including military
training instructors, recruits and military attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Air Force's 414 homosexual discharges last year _ a
record high number _ 271 were at Lackland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know what the command climate is like and whether
the level of anti-gay harassment there is pervasive,'' said Osburn.
``We want to understand the entire training process, and to
understand where in the process gays are being kicked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also agreed to provide the group with information
comparing Lackland's homosexual discharges with those at other Air
Force training centers, according to Osburn. In addition, the Air
Force will provide discharge data for the last 10 years to enable
Osburn's organization to compare discharges at Lackland before and
after President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue''
policy went into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force spokeswoman T'jae Gibson, confirming the outlines of
the plan, said the gay rights organization's representatives while
at Lackland will be allowed ``to talk to personnel, talk with
people who work there and look at the training site.''
</P>
<P>
   Osburn said the gay rights organization's representatives will
visit Lackland in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Osburn said of the first-ever encounter between the group and
top Air Force officials: ``It was a very open and welcome
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Osburn and Michelle Benecke, also a co-executive director at the
group, met with three Air Force officials: James Wolffe, a special
assistant to F. Whitten Peters, the acting Air Force secretary;
Col. James Swanson, a staff judge advocate for Lackland, and Col.
Jack Rives, a military lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The gay rights organization has complained that the Air Force
and other military branches actively root out homosexuals, even
though a controversial policy implemented by the Clinton
administration allows them to serve under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the Air Force officials ``explained the current
procedures for implementing federal law and Defense Department
policy on discharges for homosexual conduct,'' said Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The officials maintained that Air Force commanders are not
violating the homosexual policy, as the gay rights group alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said a majority of the Air Force's homosexual discharges
last year _ 391 cases _ were because the service member voluntarily
came forward and revealed his or her homosexuality to a commander.
That is a violation of the ``don't tell'' policy and is basis for
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   She said an internal Air Force report conducted at Lackland
found that most of those at the facility who said they were
homosexual did so ``solely for the purpose of self-eliminating from
basic training and the Air Force.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of homosexual discharges in 1998 _ 1,145 personnel in
all four branches of the military _ compares with a total of 997 in
1997 and was the highest level since 1987 when 1,380 men and women
were released, according to a report by Rudy de Leon,
undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also discharged record numbers of homosexuals in 1998,
according to Pentagon figures, with 310 personnel dismissed. The
Navy released 345 sailors in 1998, while the Marine Corps, the
smallest military branch, released 76 homosexual troops in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   The current Pentagon policy of ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' _ the result of a bruising battle among the White House,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress in 1993 _ means that
homosexual activity is banned in the military, but that gays and
lesbians may serve as long as they keep quiet about their sexual
orientation and aren't caught engaged in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that commanders may not inquire of a service
member's sexual orientation, according to the rules. However, they
may do so if they have ``credible information'' that a service
member engages in homosexual conduct.

COHEN SEEKS TO SHUTTER MORE MILITARY BASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen called Thursday for
two additional rounds of base closings to save $20 billion that he
said would be better spent on military pay raises, benefits and
weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should offend every one of us that serious needs for our
troops remain unmet while we squander money on facilities that we
no longer need,'' Cohen told the Illinois House of Representatives
in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is expected to meet stiff opposition in Congress,
where lawmakers, in the past two years, have rejected similar
proposals to close more bases.
</P>
<P>
   Under previous rounds of closings prompted by the end of the
Cold War, 97 installations were ordered shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out there who believe we have done
enough closing,'' said Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes are not there,'' said Rodriguez, a member of the
House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen used his speech in Illinois to outline President Clinton's
military spending proposals for the next fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1. The Pentagon's budget requests are expected to be released
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking a $112 billion increase in defense spending
over the next six years. The increase includes a 4.4-percent pay
raise for service personnel, improved benefits and purchases of
more state-of-the-art weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is speaking to audiences outside Washington to drum up
support for the administration's spending plan and for closing more
bases in 2001 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon analysts said reducing the number of bases would save
$20 billion, plus $3 billion annually after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preserving our security tomorrow means we have to make some
prudent investments today,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers from states with large numbers of military
installations are opposed to the politically unpopular procedure of
shutting bases, a key source of federal spending and jobs for many
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Antonio is working with the Air Force and Army
to stop the potential closure of Brooks Air Force Base and Fort Sam
Houston. An aircraft repair base in San Antonio, Kelly Air Force
Base, is expected to close in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 97 installations ordered closed in the 1988, 1991, 1993
and 1995, 82 have been shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a member of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittees on defense and military construction,
has called any future base closings ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   But support for base closures has grown in the Senate. And
Clinton administration officials said this non-election year could
provide a climate to reduce the number of military outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been an ardent supporter of
eliminating unneeded bases and is sponsoring _ with the support of
Republicans and Democrats _ a bill seeking new rounds of closings
in 2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the support of more lawmakers, McCain's bill would
prohibit the administration from privatizing workloads at
facilities scheduled for closing. In 1995, Clinton tried to
privatize military work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Base in
Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers accused Clinton of meddling in the process
to secure support in the vote-rich states of Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, signalled his support for legislation to close more
bases, but warned that any bill must include language making the
process immune from political meddling.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, R-Va., said no support for base closures would be
forthcoming until the process is ``absolutely bulletproof to
politics.''

FINDING A WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the tortured last-minute maneuvers of Senate
Republicans searching for an exit from President Clinton's
impeachment trial were efforts to drag him personally back on to
center stage, as if constantly befouling his name were not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since the president successfully stared down his legislative
tormentors during his State of the Union address, he has kept his
distance from the heated Capitol Hill debate over his moral
failings and possible criminal behavior. After all, what is there
left to say? We already know more than we need to conclude that he
has done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is clear that the Senate cannot muster a
two-thirds majority to impose the ultimate penalty of removing him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing more that Clinton can responsibly do in public
for his own defense beyond maintaining his policy of carrying on
with the nation's business. It is in the hands now of his lawyers
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate GOP leaders wanted one last crack at him, sending 10
provocative questions seeking detailed answers in writing to the
White House and ``inviting'' him to grovel before the them in the
well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise! Both times he politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   Did they really think he would fall for a transparent strategy
that could prolong his public humiliation and potentially trap him
into self-incrimination?
</P>
<P>
   This latest move was supposed to provide a patina of
``fairness'' to soften a continuing sense, heightened by the
calling of witnesses, that Congress has not given the president a
fair shake in the partisan rush for a sacrifice on the altar of the
GOP right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The senators tried to create the inference that they were
generously giving the president another chance to clarify details
that are now murky. If he would just titillate us with more
details, it would settle everything and we would feel more kindly
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the only reason they have insufficient evidence
to hang Clinton from the nearest tree is that he has stonewalled
them. If only he had offered minimal cooperation their
investigative efforts, so sincere and high-minded, the trial would
have been satisfactorily concluded by now.
</P>
<P>
   This argument did in fact meet with some public applause. A USA
Today/CNN Gallup Poll published Thursday indicates that while 43
percent of those surveyed approved of his decision not to answer
the questions, 52 percent disapproved. The pollsters do not tell us
whether those surveyed actually knew what the questions contained.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the numbers were reversed when it came to the
issue of continuing the trial rather than wrapping it up promptly.
The survey said 57 percent disapproved of the Senate vote not to
dismiss the trial and only 41 percent approved. Calling witnesses
didn't bother a majority, but the inevitable consequences in terms
of stretching out the trial did.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators could not press their ``invitation'' to the
president to appear before them because they have no constitutional
authority to compel such a breach of the separation of powers. Once
the White House said thanks but no thanks, that was that.
</P>
<P>
   When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and nine other GOP
senators tried the 10-question tack, they must have thought the
presdent had a short memory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fabled skills as a political genius have not been up
to snuff throughout this scandal, but he still knows how to learn
from his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He was burned badly by answering 81 questions submitted by the
House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment debate. Repeating
that miscalculation would be stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee's GOP majority didn't like his
answers to their prying quiz. Their questions often had the
patronizing tone of a school teacher grilling an inattentive
student, and the White House responded in the same vein.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP committee members were so incensed that they even
proposed the answers become the basis for a fourth article of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, was too much for many responsible GOP House
members to swallow. The committee made no attempt to prove the
president was lying in his answers rather than simply reverting to
evasive legalese.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed article, contending the president ``misused and
abused his office by making false and misleading statements to
Congress,'' was properly defeated with 81 Republican votes as well
as 204 Democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 questions submitted by Lott and his allies were similarly
dopey and insulting. Clinton has little dignity left, but even he
should be allowed some limits. There's no point in answering
questions that can be harmful but cannot be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Clinton's major mistake throughout this sorry
saga was in not invoking his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent
during his grand jury performance. No testimony, no videotape
dumped by the GOP for world-wide viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The political lesson left by Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974
to avoid impeachment, is: Burn any tapes or official records that
can reveal what you did in your own words. The political lesson for
Clinton is similar, though less draconian: Don't let your enemies
get you under oath unless you really, truly know you don't have
anything to hide.
</P>
<P>
   This does not make for noble politics. But where is it written
that politics is noble?

COMMENTARY: QUITE A PAIR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bibi and Bill, two politicians running for their lives. One the
prime minister of Israel. The other president of the United States.
So different, yet so much alike.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Bibi tells the truth about his sex life (sort
of), but lies about his politics. Bill lies about his sex life, but
tells the truth about his politics (sort of). What does this tell
us about them and their respective countries? Actually a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Prime Minister Netanyahu. In January 1993, two
years into his third marriage, Bibi was faced with a whisper
campaign that he was cheating on his wife, Sara. In a pre-emptive
strike, Netanyahu went on Israeli TV and boldly disclosed the
affair himself. Israelis tittered about it for a week, his wife
throttled him, but Bibi's tele-confession ended the matter as a
political threat. Unlike Americans, Israelis have more immediate
dangers to worry about than where their prime minister slept last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Where Netanyahu has had a harder time telling the truth _
judging from the number of his former ministers who have called him
a liar _ is when it comes to his own policies. Here Bibi has a
certain structural problem. His core right-wing constituency hates
the Oslo peace process, but he can't get elected without attracting
part of the Israeli center, which favors Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building an ideological synthesis to bridge the
center-right and center-left, which might capture the 75 percent of
Israel in the middle, Bibi has opted for a strategy of division.
His campaign is based on arousing, energizing and holding his core
right-wing base by dividing Israel between his supporters _ whom he
calls the true guardians of the national interest _ and ``the
leftists.'' Bibi uses the term ``leftist'' the way U.S.
conservatives use ``liberals'' _ as a way to smear anyone who does
not agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two ways,'' Netanyahu told his followers last
week, ``our way or the left.'' No sooner did his tough,
Kurdish-born defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, announce that he
would not run with Bibi anymore than Bibi denounced him as a
``closet leftist.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Bibi probably knows that no one believes anything he
says about politics anymore. He's cheated on his core supporters,
without any explanation, too many times. So his strategy is to
insure that even if his supporters don't fully trust him they will
hate the other side even more.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, politics is about building a broad coalition of the
center that can protect him from the radical extremes. For
Netanyahu, politics is about building deep divisions through the
center so that the extremes will keep him in office, even if he
satisfies them one day and cheats on them the next.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bibi supporters will always overlook his lying about
policies. Many of them enjoy the idea of him lying to all these
pretty-boy, upper-class Israeli WASP politicians, and they love
even more that in a neighborhood with lots of lying Arab leaders,
Bibi can lie with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, lives in a different neighborhood, one where
sexcapades can get you in a lot of trouble. He's had to do a great
deal of lying to cover up these antics. In politics, though,
Clinton finds it easier to tell the truth, because he is telling a
majority of Americans what they want to hear. And what they want to
hear is that he has stolen all the best programs from the
Republicans _ welfare reform, balanced budgeting, missile defense,
100,000 more police on the streets, free trade _ given them a
humanizing patina and made them the core of a 21st-century
Democratic politics and a new American center.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton developed so much personal trust and even affection with
his core Democratic constituencies that he was able to build a
bridge between them and centrist Republicans, thereby consolidating
the American middle. He got NAFTA through because labor trusted
him, welfare reform through because blacks and Hispanics trusted
him, and the balanced budget through because many liberals trusted
him.
</P>
<P>
   America will survive Clinton's lies about sex because there is a
huge middle that still identifies with his politics. But Israel is
another matter. This is the first Israeli election that is
primarily going to be about Israel _ not Israeli-Arab relations.
Bibi has already made clear he is going to run a campaign of
demonization. If his opponents do the same, Israel might have a
hard time surviving the first election about Israel.

GILLETTE REPORTS SUCCESSFUL FOURTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gillette Co. announced Thursday its fourth-quarter
profit rose 4.1 percent, after a disappointing third quarter,
largely on sales of its Mach3 shaving products.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest maker of razors and blades said net income
rose to $435 million, or 39 cents per share, from $418 million, or
36 cents, for the same quarter last year _ a performance that
matched the average forecast of analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mach3 is definitely a success,'' Robert Thornburg, an analyst
with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co., told Bloomberg News. ``It's exceeding
everyone's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred M. Zeien, Gillette chairman and chief executive, said six
months after the launch in the United States and three months after
the launch in Europe, the Mach3 razor ``is number one in every
country in which it has been introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Mach3 blade cartridges _ which eventually will drive sales in
the category once consumers have purchased the razor _ already
account for 14.6 percent of blades sold in the United States. Zeien
said Gillette's previous blade technology, Sensor, achieved that
market share 18 months after its introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current share of the total blade market in the US,
considering all of our products, is 70.7 percent,'' he said.
``That's the highest share the company has achieved since 1972.''
</P>
<P>
   The razor _ the handle portion of the shaving product _ is
already the top seller in all six European markets where it has
been introduced, after four months, he said. According to company
figures, the Mach3 razor has garnered an 83 percent market share in
Spain and 77 percent in England. In Italy, only three weeks after
its introduction, the market share is 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company also produces Duracell batteries, Papermate pens,
Braun appliances, and other consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous quarter, Gillette's profit fell for the first
time in eight years, with company officials and analysts blaming
economic problems in Asia, Latin America, and Russia. One-third of
Gillette's revenues come from outside the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Mach3 technology cost $1 billion to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the company's experience with the introduction of
its Sensor line of razors and blades in the early 1990s, Zeien said
healthy sales of razors led to a boom in sales of the products
after about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to the third quarter of 1999, Zeien said, ``A
tidal wave is about to hit the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect international sales growth to return to double
digits in the third quarter of '99, bringing growth rates up to the
traditional 15 percent to 20 percent that the company has
experienced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's stock closed up 3 9/16 Thursday, at 57.

SNOWDEN TO HEAD BANKBOSTON RETAIL BANKING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ BankBoston Corp. has appointed Gail Snowden as head of
New England retail banking, replacing R. Nelson ``Oz'' Griebel, who
resigned to join a chemicals company.
</P>
<P>
   The changes shifted one of BankBoston's mergers and acquisitions
specialists, 37-year-old William Parent, to Connecticut to oversee
retail banking there, a duty Griebel, 48, had fulfilled. Parent was
one of three staffers reporting to mergers and acquisitions
director Peter Manning, and his reassignment was viewed as a sign
BankBoston was not in any major deal discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change would suggest to me that BankBoston pretty much has
its franchise in place,'' said Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony
Inc. ``There may be some isolated deals, but things have been quiet
for BankBoston, and some talented people in the organization are
going to use their skills elsewhere in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent's old position has not yet been filled.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, New England's second largest bank after Fleet
Financial Group Inc., has struggled to expand its niche in
Connecticut, where it competes against Fleet and two smaller banks,
Webster Financial Corp. and People's Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Parent said BankBoston was not in combination talks with the
latter two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, 53, among the most prominent black women in US banking,
was also appointed to BankBoston's executive management group,
which sets overall policy and strategy. Five executives covering
retail banking in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire report to Snowden, who continues to oversee BankBoston's
community banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Griebel, a 22-year BankBoston veteran who was promoted to
oversee New England regional banking only five months ago, is now
president and chief operating officer of MacDermid Inc., a
chemicals company in Waterbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden reports to Brad Warner, vice chairman in charge of
global consumer banking. BankBoston has yet to replace its former
New England consumer banking head, Thomas Hollister, who left in
September to head up Citizens Bank of Massachusetts.

 &HT;    Philips Electronics expected to nab naming rights for Atlanta
arena
 &HT;    By Henry Unger and Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting System is expected to announce
soon that Philips Electronics has purchased the naming and major
sponsorship rights to the new Downtown arena, according to people
familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although similar deals in
other cities have recently topped out at more than $100 million
over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would give Philips, a Netherlands-based
conglomerate that has its North American consumer electronics
division based in suburban Atlanta, a broad promotional platform to
market its products.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the arena, Turner Broadcasting and its parent, Time
Warner, control many media outlets Philips could tap into.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hawks nor Thrashers officials would confirm any aspect
of the deal. ``When the naming rights is done and we're ready to
announce it, we'll let you know,'' said Hawks Executive Vice
President Lee Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Gordon, a spokesman for Philps Electronics, said, ``We are
not able to make a statement or an announcement at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several companies said Turner Broadcasting's initial asking
price for the arena's naming rights totaled about $180 million over
20 years. But they also said the promotional benefits were
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Philips has about 300 employees near Perimeter Mall, where it
moved from Knoxville, Tenn., in 1997. The company's presence is
expected to grow in the metro area.
</P>
<P>
   Philips is active in about 100 businesses, including consumer
electronics, domestic appliances, security systems and
semiconductors. It reported $39.2 billion in sales in 1997, the
last year annual figures were available.
</P>
<P>
   The $213 million arena, now under construction on the site of
the demolished Omni, is scheduled to open this fall for the Hawks
basketball team and Thrashers hockey team's inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   This would not be the first time a foreign-based company bought
naming rights to a U.S. sports facility. The Swedish
telecommunications company LM Ericsson, for example, paid $25
million to have its moniker on Ericsson Stadium in Charlotte.

 &HT;    Lockheed Martin to lay off 280
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ About 280 workers at Lockheed Martin Corp.'s
Marietta plant face layoffs this winter as the company copes with
slow sales and high costs in the C-130J cargo plane program.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will trim the work force at Lockheed Martin
Aeronautical Systems by 3 percent from the current level of 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must get overall costs down. There's no way around it,''
Bill Bullock, president of the division, and Chief Operating
Officer Terry Graham said in an employee newsletter article
disclosing the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs come from various areas and take effect by the end
of February. In addition, ``non-critical'' hiring will be frozen.
</P>
<P>
   More layoffs can't be ruled out, Graham said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens the rest of the year depends in large part on
what business we are able to generate and how efficient we are,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long term does look brighter,'' Graham added.
</P>
<P>
   The plant last week won a $450 million contract to update
cockpit systems on older C-5 airlifters, but it won't offset the
need for immediate job cuts, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs come amid contract negotiations between plant
management and the Machinists union Local 709, which represents
nearly half the Marietta workers. Their three-year contract expires
March 1.
</P>
<P>
   A union official declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin developed the C-130J as an updated version of
the venerable airlifter, older models of which are used around the
world. The program fell behind schedule and development costs
soared, inflating the price of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 90 orders so far, including 35 from the U.S. Air
Force, enough to keep workers busy into 2001. Six planes were
delivered to the Air Force just this week. But sales stalled in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many customers acknowledge their need for the C-130J,
they simply can't _ and won't _ buy the aircraft at its current
price'' of $50 million to $60 million, Bullock and Graham wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has indicated it needs 150 more of the planes
starting in 2004 but wants the price cut 10 percent. Complicating
the situation, Lockheed Martin is lobbying the Air Force to begin
those purchases by 2001 to avoid a break in production.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also faces pressure in the fledgling F-22 fighter
program, whose costs are capped by Congress. Final assembly will be
done in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the pressure on Marietta management, Bethesda,
Md.-based Lockheed Martin on Thursday said fourth-quarter profit
fell 15 percent to $308 million, not counting write-offs from a
subsidiary shutdown. Operating profit in its aeronautics group,
which includes the Marietta plant, fell 17 percent to $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin shares fell $1.25 to $35.93 3/4 in heavy trading
Thursday.

BCBS-NH ACCEPTS PURCHASE OFFER FROM ANTHEM UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Hampshire has
agreed to accept a $120 million offer that will make the
57-year-old non-profit a wholly-owned subsidiary of Anthem Inc., a
$4.4 billion Indiana-based mutual insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover, should it win regulatory approval, would mark
Anthem's second acquisition of a New England Blue Cross plan and
would leave the region with four remaining non-profit Blue Cross
organizations. Anthem merged with Connecticut's Blue Cross Plan in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary method of operation and our primary approach to
growth will be as a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee,'' Anthem
president L. Ben Lytle said Thursday at a press conference held at
New Hampshire Blue Cross headquarters in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, which has made no secret of its intentions to become a
major player in the Northeast, recently divided its
Indianapolis-based company into midwestern and eastern divisions.
It opened its own managed care company, Anthem Health, in New York
last year and now insures some 4 million people. The cash
acquisition of New Hampshire Blue Cross will add another 350,000
people to that total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in New England is to hopefully merge or acquire other
Blue Cross Blue Shield operations, but if we are never successful
beyond New Hampshire we would be thrilled,'' Lytle said.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Blue Cross has had a roller-coaster financial
history, losing $20 million last year on revenues of $600 million.
By contrast, Anthem, which also operates Blue Cross plans in
Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio, had earnings of $172 million last year
on revenues of $5.9 billion, according to unaudited figures
provided by the company.
</P>
<P>
   As a mutual company, Anthem may legally pay dividends to its
three million policy holders, though it has never done so, Lytle
said. ``Any money we collect in excess of claims and operating
costs goes into reserves. If reserves get to the point where we
feel we have excess reserves, we lower our premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of New Hampshire Blue Cross was set at $120 million by
investment banking firm Wassterstein Perella, according to New
Hampshire Blue Cross chief executive David Jensen. Out of that, $30
million will go to repay loans by Blue Cross plans in South
Carolina, Chicago, and Michigan that helped New Hampshire Blue
Cross fund its 1997 purchase of the Matthew Thornton Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remaining money _ between $70 million and $80
million _ would be used to set up a health care foundation to
compensate the state of New Hampshire for the charitable value Blue
Cross accrued over its years as a non-profit.
</P>
<P>
   Though the regulatory review process is the same whether the
takeover applicant is a for-profit or non-profit, any decision will
have to await an independent analysis of Blue Cross' charitable
value, said Monica Ciolfi, New Hampshire's Assistant Insurance
Commissioner. Jensen said he expected approval could come within
six months.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by New Hampshire Blue Cross dashed the hopes of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which also had a bid
on the table. That offer, sources said, called for Massachusetts
Blue Cross to pay off New Hampshire Blue Cross' $30 million in
loans and arrange details of a merger or affiliation later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This region may soon face the question of whether or not
not-for-profit health care is worth fighting to preserve,'' said
Susan Leahy, spokeswoman for Massachusetts Blue Cross. ``We've said
for those interested in preserving the not-for-profit heritage of
Blue Cross plans in New England, a regional solution accomplishes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy declined to discuss whether Massachusetts Blue Cross was
engaged in talks with any other Blue Cross plan in the region.
Aided by the sale of its Summer Street headquarters, the plan had
an after-tax gain of $64 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance of Anthem bodes ill for Blue Cross of
Massachusetts, said Stephen Caulfield, chairman of the Chickering
Group, a Cambridge-based student health-care insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when they appear to be turning things around and
looking, if not robust, at least viable, the opportunity to grow
their market share has been frustrated,'' Chickering said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Blue Cross plans have not been immune to the rapid
consolidation taking place in the health-care industry, shrinking
from 100 plans in 1989 to 54 today. ``To survive you have to become
bigger,'' Lytle said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sager, a Boston University School of Public Health
professor, however, called news of the sale ``another sad day'' for
health care. Such acquisitions are part of a health industry arms
race that is leading to bigger hospitals, doctors groups, and HMOs,
Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Britain and Germany before World War II with
everyone building bigger battleships and bigger guns,'' said Sager.
``There is a great risk that patients will be trampled in all of
this.''

UNION MEMBERSHIP RISES 7.1 PERCENT IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the push to gain new union members, Massachusetts
labor leaders added 30,000 workers to their rolls last year,
increasing rank-and-file membership by 7.1 percent, the federal
Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's findings came two days after it reported a
nationwide net gain of 101,000 union members as well as a drop in
the overall proportion of union employees in the work force to 13.9
percent in 1998, down from 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But while the national news was bittersweet, Massachusetts labor
leaders had much to celebrate. According to federal statistics, not
only did they add union members but the proportion of people in the
state's work force who are unionized also increased in 1998, to
15.9 percent from 15.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indicates that Massachusetts was organizing union members
faster than the rate at which the work force was growing,'' said
Lane Windham, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO in Washington, D.C.
``This is definitely a sign of good organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several Massachusetts unions have increased recruiting
efforts over the last two years. Between the spring of 1997 and the
fall of 1998, for example, the New England Council of Carpenters
added 1,100 new members, increasing overall membership to 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Nurses Association in Canton, which serves as
both professional organization and union, has organized 1,735
nurses since 1997, according to Julie Pinkham, director of the
association's labor program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wild out there right now,'' said Pinkham. ``Nurses are
concerned about managed care. They are fed up. So, we are telling
them, `Organize! Get a voice, or you'll never have a say in the
workplace and you and your patients will ultimately suffer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkham said the association has added three new organizers to
keep up with calls from registered nurses at hospitals and health
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Local 285 of the Service Employees International
Union in Roxbury signed up 811 health workers during the first
seven months of 1998 alone, up from 707 for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts was the not the only state where unions received
good news. California's labor movement added 87,000 new union
members last year, posting an increase of 4.2 percent. And the
proportion of unionized employees in California's overall work
force increased to 16.1 percent, from 16 percent in 1997.

 &HT;    BankAmerica's shares up on earnings outlook
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of BankAmerica (ticker symbol BAC) rose $2.75
to $64.87 1/2 Thursday after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hugh L. McColl Jr. told analysts in New York the company would
produce earnings gains of 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, BankAmerica's operating income was $6.49 billion, or
$3.64 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The news from the nation's largest banking company contrasted
sharply with that from First Union (FTU), the sixth-largest bank,
which said Tuesday its earnings will rise less than 10 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, also based in Charlotte, saw its stock slip again,
by 43 3/4 cents to $51.75. It fell $4.87 1/2 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica also said it will buy Fleetwood Credit from
Associates First Capital. The price was not disclosed. Fleetwood
Credit lends money to buyers of recreational vehicles.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Gay group backs HIV-positive dental hygienist's
suit over lost job
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Atlanta dental hygienist who contends he was fired
solely because he is HIV-positive filed an employee discrimination
lawsuit Thursday in what gay rights groups say is the first case of
its kind in Georgia involving a health care provider.
</P>
<P>
   Lamba Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc. also said the case
is expected to test a U.S. Supreme Court decision issued last June
recognizing that the Americans with Disabilities Act protects
people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Spencer Waddell, 35, said that shortly after he
told his employer, Valley Forge Dental Associates Inc., in
September 1997 that he was HIV-positive, the company immediately
placed him on leave of absence. Four days later, Valley Forge
offered Waddell a lower-paying position that did not allow him to
treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   When Waddell declined, the company deemed him to have
``resigned'' and then fired him, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating, on a personal level, to be betrayed by
people who should not discriminate against someone because of his
HIV status,'' said Waddell, a hygienist since 1992 who now works
with patients at the Grady Health System Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a simple answer to concerns about HIV in the health
care setting _ gloves, masks, sterilized instruments,'' said
Stephen Scarborough, a Lambda attorney who represents Waddell.
``Instead the dental clinic in our case chose to defer to stigma
and fired our client.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Valley Forge, headquartered in King of Prussia,
Pa., could not be reached for comment.

SENATE APPROVES VIDEOTAPE DEPOSITIONS OF THE THREE WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday approved the videotaping of
testimony by former White House intern Monica Lewinsky after
rejecting a hurry-up vote on impeachment charges against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to videotape her deposition opens up the
possibility that the public could see Lewinsky's testimony on
television, if the Senate decides later to use the videotape in the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, voting along party lines, rejected a proposal by
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to end the 12-day
impeachment trial with an immediate up-or-down vote on the perjury
and obstruction of justice charges pending against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans also rejected Daschle's proposal to limit the
admission of testimony from sworn depositions from Lewinsky,
Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan or White House staffer Sidney
Blumenthal to printed transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP majority then adopted rules for the remainder of the
first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years _ with sworn
depositions beginning Monday, deliberations on various options next
Thursday and a target date for ending the trial on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   All three votes were along strict party lines, with 54
Republicans and 44 Democrats voting as blocs. Those votes, coupled
with a pair of equally partisan votes on Wednesday to admit three
witnesses to the trial and to reject dismissal of the case,
appeared to spell an end to bipartisan cooperation in the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The votes also underscored that Republican advocates of
convicting and removing Clinton from office do not currently have
the two-thirds majority of 67 votes they need to meet the
constitutional requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the roadmap
for the trial ``a good plan'' that was ``fair'' to the White House
and House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the trial timetable aimed for a final vote by noon on
Friday, Feb. 12, but he cautioned that deadline could slip if new
information comes out during the rest of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really still trying to be fair to all sides,'' said
Lott. ``That's a real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle sounded a conciliatory note even though he had failed to
win Senate action to speed the trial to a conclusion or to set a
Feb. 12 deadline for completion of the trial, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply couldn't bring this matter to a successful
bipartisan conclusion,'' Daschle lamented, adding that Republicans
and Democrats had worked ``diligently'' to find agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Blumenthal will give sworn testimony Monday; Lewinsky
on Tuesday; and Jordan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors won Senate permission to summon testimony from
the trio to clarify questions that have come up during the
impeachment trial about Clinton's alleged efforts to cover up his
sexual dalliance with Lewinsky by misleading special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr and lawyers for Paula Jones, who filed a civil suit
against Clinton alleging sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown on the Senate floor followed negotiations over a
24-hour period _ negotiations that failed to bridge the partisan
divide.
</P>
<P>
   Lott twice came to the floor of the Senate to update colleagues
on the fitful progress before recalling the Senate shortly after 5
p.m. to allow votes on the conflicting approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan calls for the depositions to be videotaped. It puts
off a decision on whether portions of the tapes will be played on
the Senate floor where they could become available to national
television networks. Democrats had been fighting to limit the use
of the videotape to senators and senior staff only.
</P>
<P>
   The White House vigorously opposes the videotaping of the
witnesses or the potential release of the material.
</P>
<P>
   The outline also allows lawmakers to vote later on whether to
call the three witnesses to the Senate floor and allows lawmakers
to vote on whether to call additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Democratic plan would have only allowed the
possible release of a written transcript of the three depositions
and restricted videotapes of the depositions to senators and senior
staff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Republican senators want to
permit the possible showing of videotaped testimony to the Senate
because ``there's a fair amount of sentiment against bringing live
witnesses to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said Republican senators merely
wanted to reserve the right to decide later whether to show the
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no one who is going to be jumping up and down to use
a videotape on the Senate floor, unless there is a good reason to
do so,'' Thompson said. ``We're in agreement to have videotapes.
It's whether or not to agree on the front end what you will do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats expressed opposition to permitting
videotaped testimony to be used in the trial. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., said ``you don't need to take the videotapes
onto the Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats remain at odds, as well, on what will
be permitted in the final stages of the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insist that the Senate has the option of condemning
Clinton's conduct with a ``finding of fact'' without removing him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans advocates said the ``finding of fact'' within the
Senate impeachment trial itself would be a stronger form of
condemnation for Clinton's conduct and would assure that Clinton
could not claim vindication.
</P>
<P>
   The ``finding of fact'' would allay some Republicans' concerns
than an acquittal of Clinton would imply exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, one of seven GOP senators looking
at a finding of fact resolution, said the measure ``would not use
legal terms like `perjury and obstruction of justice''' in order to
give Democratic senators ``a basis to acknowledge the president has
committed wrongdoing but not impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said senators could ``feel good'' about voting for the
measure, adding: ``It doesn't give the president a right to claim
acquittal or to claim vindication or to claim exoneration, which he
should not have under these circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the ``finding of fact''
option should be viewed merely as an ``expression of sentiment'' in
the Senate and ``should not be a step toward criminal action''
against Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice after he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats challenged the approach.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the proponents of
such an approach were trying to ``construct a procedure where they
can convict the president but not remove him. They want to have it
both ways. They can't. The Constitution doesn't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., challenged the effort to open the
door to a ``finding of fact'' approach because it could expose
Clinton to legal prosecution after he leaves office on Jan. 20,
2001.

 &HT;    Legacy of Elway remains the cause
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It is happening to John Elway again and there is nothing
he can do to stop it. The longer Super Bowl week lasts, the less he
becomes ``The Quarterback'' and the more he becomes ``The Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Denver Broncos were harangued to please allow
Elway to win a Super Bowl before he retires, which they gloriously
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't you here last year?'' safety Steve Atwater said. ``For
everybody, that was the million-dollar question.''
</P>
<P>
   But Denver's return engagement this year has not reduced that
price tag. With the consensus that Sunday will be Elway's final
game, the Broncos now are being pushed to send out their great
quarterback as a winner. As if this game isn't hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's got that in the back of their minds.
Everybody understands that,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``This
isn't a game where you need a lot of motivation. But everyone
respects the job he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys on this team, it might be their only
opportunity (to reach the Super Bowl),'' wide receiver Ed McCaffrey
said. ``For the older guys, they may not ever get another chance.
This is what it all boils down to. No one will take this game for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   For a game that can go decades without a genuine emotional
angle, this Super Bowl has two of them: Elway at the end of the
line and Dan Reeves' refurbished heart. With Elway getting a title
last January, the Reeves campaign has an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get that feeling,'' tailback Terrell Davis said. ``But
people who feel that way, they're not playing the game. The game is
between the Falcons and the Broncos and the players who are on the
field. But that's fine. We recognize that. The shoe was on the
other foot last year. We had a chance to feel it, and we know what
to expect from a team that's been put in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win rings for everybody who's here,'' Sharpe
said. ``Yeah, we'd love to have one for John, especially if this is
his last game. It's not something we're rattling around. We didn't
have T-shirts printed up, and we don't have things on the bulletin
board saying, `Win one for John.'''
</P>
<P>
   But a legion of fans are thinking exactly that. Elway, for one,
seems to be enjoying this trip more than his first four. Sunday, he
becomes the first quarterback to start five Super Bowls. By the end
of the evening, he hopes he won't have joined Jim Kelly as the only
quarterback to lose four of them. The game is hard enough without
playing ``The Cause,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I gone and said, `This is going to be my last practice?'
No, I haven't,'' Elway said. ``After last year, though, it's a lot
easier to get excited and enjoy what's going on, having won a Super
Bowl. The atmosphere is so much more positive, not having to answer
the questions of never having won a Super Bowl or why the AFC can't
beat the NFC. Those are negative questions that I answered for 10
years.''

   ABy Mark Bradleyc. 1999 Cox News ServiceMIAMI _Paul Tagliabue
gives his State of the NFL address today. Here's what Art Shell
wants to hear from the commissioner about minority hiring: ``That
there's progress being made, that we'll continue to work through
dialogue.'' But hearing won't necessarily mean believing.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has 31 franchises, three black head coaches. More than
two-thirds of the league's players are African-American. Nine
head-coaching jobs were open this postseason. Only one was filled
by a black man _ Green Bay hired Ray Rhodes, who'd just been fired
by Philadelphia. Art Shell, who coaches the Falcons offensive line
and who won 58.6 percent of his games as the Raiders' head coach
before being dismissed in 1994, still awaits a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Unprovens galore were chosen to do what they've never done,
which is run an NFL team. Shell has already proved he can run one
and win. ``I'd like to think (not being hired is) not because of my
color,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has moved heaven and Earth to make the Falcons offensive
line a punishing unit. Why not entrust him with a whole team? ``I'm
trying to find out, too,'' Shell said. ``Ask the owners. Ask the
general managers. ... `Why wouldn't you consider a guy like Art
Shell? Why wouldn't you hire (Green Bay offensive coordinator)
Sherman Lewis, who has an impeccable record as an assistant?' We
don't have the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   As an expansion team, Cleveland was given license to interview
assistants on teams still playing. Shell met with team president
Carmen Policy and thought the interview went well. ``It was
legit,'' he said. The Browns hired Jacksonville offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer instead. Kansas City asked if Shell would
be interested in talking after the Super Bowl. He said yes. This
week the Chiefs promoted Gunther Cunningham, their defensive
coordinator. No other club expressed a willingness to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aspire to be a head coach,'' Shell said. ``Every assistant
in this league does. Anybody who says otherwise is telling a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   That Shell isn't technically a coordinator is thought to have
hurt his resume. ``You can put any spin you want on it,'' he said.
``It's not so much X's and O's. All coaches know those. You have to
be able to deal with men. If players don't respond to you, you
might as well be talking to that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   How has the Falcons' O-line responded? Splendidly. Considered a
liability in preseason, Shell's men opened enough holes to make
Jamal Anderson the NFC's leading rusher. And who are these guys? A
rookie tackle, a second-year guard, a transplanted center, a career
journeyman and Bob Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   This line could claim a championship ring Sunday. Its coach has
three _ two as a player, one as a Raider assistant. In 1977 Shell
had the greatest Super Bowl any blocker has had, essentially
erasing Jim Marshall. The Minnesota man had no tackles and no
assists.
</P>
<P>
   That no black head coach has yet won a Super Bowl means nothing,
Shell said. ``The Super Bowl should not be a criterion to enhance
black hiring.'' He looked pointedly at his visitor. ``I coached a
team to the AFC championship game (in 1991), but I'm still an
assistant.''

 &HT;    Now that he knows what he can do, Terrell Davis sets some lofty
goals
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As a visionary, Terrell Davis failed. Said so himself
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be a back to get 50, 60 yards a game,'' said
Davis, the feature back of the Denver Broncos. ``Maybe catch a pass
or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you know whom not to consult on betting advice. Davis
couldn't see that his speed, strength, determination and instincts
were qualities of a star NFL running back. No one is more surprised
than Davis that he amassed 2,008 rushing yards this season, that he
has a chance to win consecutive Super Bowl MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any award that I receive at this point, on this level, is
something that words can't ever explain,'' he said. ``Everything
that I'm achieving is pretty much something I never, ever would
have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has, however, his vision has cleared, to the point
where he sees himself leaving the game someday as the most prolific
back in history. That's a quantum leap from anticipating a career
as an average contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple'' Davis said. ``I love to play the game.... After
you win the championship, you want more.... But I think my cast
makes me look better than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Davis' small but athletic and technically sound
offensive line and punishing blocking back Howard Griffith have
produced running lanes for the 5-foot-11, 211-pound former Georgia
runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Terrell is the one who hits the holes,'' Griffith said.
``We expect him to do what he does. But it's hard to not get
spoiled. To put up the numbers he has, he's raising the bar of
excellence. It's tough to stay there. But we'll keep trying to keep
him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Davis wants to go is into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave this game, I want to leave my signature on it,''
he said. ``By doing that, I can come back each year and be the best
I can be. That's just the way I think right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The next order of business for Davis and the Broncos is the
Falcons in Sunday's Super Bowl. The Falcons were the second-best
team in the league against the run, a fact not lost on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Atlanta, with (Jessie) Tuggle and (Cornelius) Bennett,''
he said, ``they seem to be very patient with what they do and they
just hold the back sides off the front side. It's kind of like they
just play gap control very well, and it's the type of team that I
hate to see. I like to see people a little bit more undisciplined
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he didn't seem too worried: ``I know what I have to do.''

 &HT;    Spies? Birds circling at Broncos' practice
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Broncos practiced in helmets and shorts for nearly
two hours Thursday, and coach Mike Shanahan agreed that his players
are getting eager for game day to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another day. Nobody went down. Nobody got hurt,'' Shanahan
said. ``I'm sure the players are looking forward to playing the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the practice, some birds circled the field
and swooped down near Shanahan. ``Was it a falcon?'' Shanahan said.
Man in demand
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers coach Mike Heimerdinger figures to be a popular
guy after Sunday. Four teams _ Kansas City, Cleveland, Jacksonville
and Chicago _ are interested in him for offensive coordinator.
Heimerdinger, 46, was offered the coordinator's job in Dallas last
year by Cowboys coach Chan Gailey but elected to stay with the
Broncos. He likely would have been promoted to coordinator by
Shanahan had Gary Kubiak accepted the head coach job at the
University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy returns
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff-return specialist Vaughn Hebron and punt returner
Darrien Gordon both have noted how difficult it is to get solid
runbacks against Atlanta kickers Morten Andersen and Dan
Stryzinski. The key, said Gordon, is patience. ``You're not going
to get a lot of chances against Stryzinski, because he forces so
many fair catches,'' Gordon said. ``He wants you to make a bad
decision out of frustration. You have to fair-catch four or five
balls in a row, and the normal reaction is to try to make something
happen even if it's not there. He can punt the ball 10 times, and
you're still not going to get more than one or two returns. So I'm
looking to make maybe one play that helps us win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Put me in, coach
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Willie Green of Athens has been bugging Kubiak all
week to get him more involved in the game plan, and the eight-year
veteran has good reason to be seeking a shot at the Atlanta
secondary. During Green's two seasons in Carolina, he played four
games against the Falcons and had 24 catches for 431 yards and two
touchdowns. ``I've been in his ear like a bee,'' Green said.
``You've got to look at the past history, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Days numbered
</P>
<P>
   After talking for days about retiring after Sunday's game, free
safety Steve Atwater now seems set to return for 1999. ``My body
feels good, and I'm pretty certain now that I'll be back,'' said
Atwater, who probably will be asked by Broncos' salary-cap
specialist Dave Blando to restructure a contract with a '99 cap
value of $2.6 million. Not so sure is the return of strong safety
Tyrone Braxton. The 12-year veteran conceded again on Thursday that
Sunday probably is his swan song with the Broncos. Braxton lost his
starting job this year to second-round draft pick Eric Brown and
then regained it late in the season after the rookie suffered a
groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   The son shines
</P>
<P>
   Third-string quarterback Brian Griese, the son of Hall of Fame
passer Bob Griese, was not even born when his father led the Miami
Dolphins to consecutive Super Bowl victories. The youngster doesn't
have any of his father's Super Bowl rings and hopes to get one of
his own. ``To be here as a rookie is an incredible experience,''
said Griese, who played in only one regular-season game this year.
If John Elway retires, Griese will battle Jeff Lewis for the backup
job behind Bubby Brister next season.
</P>
<P>
   Kickers of a sort
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Rouen and Olympic swimming gold medalist Amy Van
Dyken, a hot item for about six months, have been seen in several
Miami restaurants this week. One Denver columnist said, ``Wonder
who has the more powerful kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Terrell Davis had a league-best 15 rushes for 20 or
more yards during the '98 regular season. The Atlanta defense
surrendered an NFL-low three.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Elway listed his three favorite quarterbacks as Dan Marino,
Johnny Unitas and Roger Staubach.... Offensive line coach Alex
Gibbs thinks defensive end Chuck Smith is the key to the Falcons
front four. Because Davis prefers to run left, the Broncos must
stop the quick penetration of Smith.... Middle linebacker Glenn
Cadrez on stopping Jamal Anderson: ``Low is the only way to go. If
you're up high on him, he'll just rip right through you.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Tony Jones when asked if the Broncos'
seal-blocking schemes are revolutionary: ``The only thing I know is
we had a running back go for 2,008 yards, so if we're doing
something wrong, everyone will be doing it next year. I don't think
Terrell Davis getting all those yards is just luck, you know? I
guess we've got to be doing something right.''

 &HT;    Flocking to the Dirty Bird
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about getting swept up in Super Bowl hype.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Larry Peterson walked into a local mall to get some
film. He walked out as a Dirty Bird dance contest winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the people up there having fun, so went for it,'' said
Peterson, 31, of Cobb County. ``I just got up there and did
something. I didn't have anything to lose. The Dirty Bird just gets
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Kids do it. Adults do it. Even Dan Reeves has tried to do it.
There are several Dirty Bird songs out on the streets, and it seems
that a Dirty Bird dance contest is happening on every raised
platform or stage in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has galvanized the whole town, moreso than the Braves ever
did,'' said Gerard Ingraham of Marietta, who watched the contest
with his 10-month old daughter, Demi. ``Everybody is having fun.
Everyone can get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen King, her husband and two sons drove from Cartersville
to Cumberland Mall in Marietta to watch the contest. King was
trying to convince her husband to participate for a chance to win a
big-screen television and a recliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fun. It gets the people excited about the team,
especially if they can't go to the Super Bowl'' said King. ``We
came down here today because we wanted to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatched in the minds of a couple of Atlanta Falcons players, the
Dirty Bird has become Atlanta's defining dance craze for the close
of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is pretty cool,'' said Falcon linebacker Jesse
Tuggle. ``I never thought it would be that big. But it just lets
you know how much fun we are having. We have been having fun and
winning all year. The Dirty Bird has been good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Bird innovator O.J. Santiago revels in the madness he
helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to be up there with the great dances,'' said
Santiago, the Falcons' starting tight end. ``Everybody is trying to
do it and copy it. If other teams are doing it, it has gotta rank
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Santiago is quick to point out that he did not invent the
Dirty Bird. That distinction goes to running back Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before the (Nov. 8) New England game, we said we gotta
come up with something,'' said Santiago. Anderson devised the
framework of the dance, but Santiago, who scored a touchdown after
Anderson in the 41-10 blowout of the Patriots, was the first player
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has called Santiago the Jermaine to his Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be mad when you play football. You have to be in
the right frame of mind to make plays and make blocks,'' said
Santiago. ``So when you get into the end zone, it is time to
release and let loose _ to do the Dirty Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Dirty Birds'' actually came from Alan Weiss, a
12-year season-ticket holder. Weiss, who managed Nicky's Seafood,
which is near the Dome, had been hanging a Dirty Birds banner in
the lower southwest corner of the Georgia Dome for three seasons
before the name caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Like any great dance _ the Charleston, the Hustle, the Electric
Slide _ the Dirty Bird comes in many varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you raise the roof, then bring your arms across
your body,'' said Santiago, who may be the only person who clucks
while doing the dance. ``From there you can do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Dirty Bird so unique is that everybody does it
differently. At the Cumberland Mall contest, Peterson borrowed
heavily from the classic Funky Chicken. Co-winner Betty Daniel, on
the other hand, mixed several genres of dance to get the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they are doing now, I've done,'' said Daniel, a
47-year-old nurse's assistant from Atlanta. ``When I do the Dirty
Bird, I incorporate the Bird, the Dirty Bird and the Funky
Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   John Welker, a professional dancer with the Atlanta Ballet, said
the Dirty Bird is one of the ugliest dances he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to say it is bad, but it is ugly. Usually, I wouldn't be
caught dead doing it, but everybody is doing it, so I have to,''
said Welker, 22. ``Aesthetically, it is not too pleasing. Maybe
they should add some Swan Lake to it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the clear exception of Swan Lake, the Dirty Bird does owe a
lot to its fowl-inspired predecessors. The Bird, popularized in
1985 by the funk legends The Time, involves spreading your arms and
flapping them while hopping from one foot to the other.
</P>
<P>
   With the older Funky Chicken, dancers tuck their hands beneath
their armpits and flap, while their legs flail in and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing the Funky Chicken. We used our legs a little bit
more, but it is similar,'' said the Falcons' Coordinator of Player
Programs Billy ``White Shoes'' Johnson, the Godfather of end-zone
dancing during his playing years. ``This adds to the excitement of
the ball game, from here on out. I look forward to people doing the
Dirty Bird. We have found something that the fans enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tore Bowman, promotions manager for Flava 2000, a local dance
club, said versions of the Dirty Bird have made it to the dance
floor there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, if the DJ says something about the Falcons, people
will start doing it,'' said Bowman. ``But it is not a strict Dirty
Bird. It is the Dirty Bird with a little Bankhead Bounce and Jiggy
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who has seen dances come and go, gives the Dirty Bird
until March before it peters out. The key to the Dirty Bird's
staying power may be how well the Falcons do next year. Because
they go to the playoffs annually, the Braves have managed to make
an institution of the Tomahawk Chop. Conversely, the Ickey Shuffle
came and went as fast as its inventor, former Cincinnati Bengals
running back Ickey Woods. A lame leap frog routine tried by the New
Orleans Saints this year lasted until the next loss.
</P>
<P>
   While they're pleased with the response of the Dirty Bird, you
won't see every Falcon stepping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do that thing, man,'' said the Falcons' gregarious,
310-pound offensive tackle, Bob Whitfield. ``I'm not going to run
45 yards after Jamal to do it. Tell them to pan the camera around
to the line of scrimmage if they want to see me doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Star receiver Tony Martin, who has caught six touchdown passes,
said he has never done the Dirty Bird, but has no problem with
dancing. He even claims to have something up his sleeve for the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my own routine that I have been practicing and I will
unveil it when I score a touchdown in the Super Bowl,'' said
Martin. ``You heard it here first.''

 &HT;    Ephraim Salaam : A ready rookie
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Ephraim Salaam has gotten used to the target that seems
to be tattooed on the middle of his chest, but it doesn't mean he
has adjusted completely to life in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, 22, is the Falcons' right tackle and the youngest player
on either team in Sunday's Super Bowl. With his start at that
position comes pressure that he says he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie, you always have a bull's-eye,'' said Salaam, a
6-foot-7, 290-pounder. ``I've been reading all year how teams are
going to move their best pass rusher over me, but you can't worry
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   All this fuss at the Super Bowl is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I catch myself just looking, and I can't believe
it. I really can't believe it,'' he said. ``There's millions and
millions of kids all over the world dreaming about playing in the
NFL, and I was one of those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But he almost wasn't one of those players.
</P>
<P>
   After building a reputation for indifference at San Diego State,
six rounds of the draft came and went before the Falcons selected
him in the seventh and final round, with the 199th overall pick. He
showed up in Suwanee looking out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a kid who was a basketball player, was quick, had good
feet, long arms ... needed strength,'' offensive line coach Art
Shell said. ``I said to him, `Do you know why you were drafted
where you were? Because there's a rap on you that you don't work
hard.' But I haven't seen any of that. He struggled early. As time
went on, he got better and better. Our last game, he had the
highest grade of any of our linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam has played much better late in the season, not allowing a
sack or pressure in the Falcons' two playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would have made that prediction during the summer.
Atlanta signed free agent Corey Louchiey in the offseason with the
intention of plugging him in at right tackle, but he got hurt and
played inconsistently in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   He was released, and Salaam won the starting spot over fellow
rookie Jose Portilla.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam's NFL debut came on Sept. 6 at Carolina, when Kevin
Greene roasted him for two sacks and pressured Chris Chandler
several other times in the Falcons' 19-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of hard work, once thought unlikely for Salaam, has helped
him improve dramatically his habit of squaring his shoulders toward
the sideline. That makes it easier for defensive ends to get to his
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened up a lot, opened the gates, as they call it, and
shortened my corner,'' said Salaam, whose draft stock had been
weakened further when he didn't work out at the NFL combine because
he had a strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art worked with me, (left tackle) Bob Whitfield worked with
me, and I have a much more physical approach now. Instead of
waiting for the defender to come to me, it's more of an attacking
style.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday against the Broncos, Salaam will play against Maa
Tanuvasa (6-2, 270) and Alfred Williams (6-6, 265), who combined
for 11 1/2 sacks in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   If recent results are any indication, he has the right mindset,
no matter whom he faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start your first game against ... Kevin Greene and give up
a couple of sacks and you don't get rattled the rest of the year?''
Whitfield said. ``That's a hell of an accomplishment. He bounces
back so quick. He's got the right attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam wants to improve on his power during the offseason, to
let his strength catch up to his height. But he's not thinking
about that now. ``There's a lot of guys who got drafted in rounds
one through six who haven't played a snap in the NFL,'' he said.
''I'd much rather be in the situation I am in right now.''

   FROM THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION
</P>
<P>
   FBN-BENNETT _ MIAMI _ There's a good reason Falcons linebacker
Cornelius Bennett is proclaiming himself this year's John Elway:
After four unsuccessful Super appearances, he thinks this is his
year. He enters this game with more fans than he had last year _
they are located in cellblock C in Buffalo. That's where Bennett
spent much of the summer. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta

<P>
   FAN-PSYCHOLOGY _ ATLANTA _ Mix in a little tribalism, a little
sexuality, a little patriotism and a little ancient religion and
you have the makings of a sports fan. Sports, unlike any other
modern institution, evokes the deepest human emotions and genetic
social maps, creating a bonding in a community and in a family
seldom paralleled in today's world _ short of war. Psychologists
and fans talk about why fans act the way they do. (Lore, Atlanta

   SOUTHBEACH _ The Super Bowl party is for the elite only, and so,
in increasing measure, is South Miami Beach. Ten years ago it was a
rundown stretch of seedy hotels populated by Mariel boatlift
refugees and aging New York retirees. Today it's an international
hot-spot, home of jet-setters, fashion models, movie stars and
various beautiful people. What happened to the folks who used to

grass of the '90s. (Waresh, Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   FBN-OFFICIATING _ The NFL's Greg Aiello says the league's worst
nightmare is having an official's blown call decide the Super Bowl.
After the kind of year the NFL officials had in1998, the

Bowl, Tostitoes, etc. They roll out
</P>
<P>
   celebs, former players, swimsuit models . . . some taking this
stuff too seriously. Write each one live, or pick a day when there

   tremendous midwinter ritual it truly is, were it not elevated
and dignified with a glorious, graven Roman numeral at the end:

NATO ALLIES SAY THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO allies warned on Thursday that they
were fully ready to take military action to stop further violence
by both sides in Serbia's ravaged Kosovo province, and Britain and
France said they were willing to send in ground forces if needed to
reinforce a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The allies acted after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told
them on Thursday that the threat of force was essential to enable
diplomacy to bring peace to Kosovo, where Serbian security forces
and armed rebels from the province's ethnic Albanian majority have
been battling with varying degrees of intensity for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Allied governments expect an international political ultimatum
to be issued on Friday in London by foreign ministers of the United
States, Russia, Germany, Italy, Great Britain and France, urging
both the Kosovo Albanians and President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to begin negotiations swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration's top national
security officials will meet on Friday morning to decide whether
the United States will commit troops to Kosovo after a settlement.
With the public commitment of France and Britain on Thursday, the
administration is feeling strong pressure to agree to be part of a
NATO peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its European allies have all agreed that
the two warring parties must be forced to accept a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Albanian rebels and Milosevic accept a solution
peacefully or after force is used, the Europeans are adamant that
American and European ground troops go together into Kosovo to
monitor the settlement. Administration officials say they
understand that the situation is moving quickly and hope a decision
can be reached on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No country has said exactly how many troops might be needed to
enforce an eventual agreement in Kosovo, but both European and
American diplomats said that the allies were willing to contemplate
sending tens of thousands of troops into Kosovo as peacekeepers.
Allied and associated soldiers, including Russians, have been
keeping the peace in Bosnia since the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that the six countries meeting on Friday
in London, members of the ``contact group'' coordinating
international policy in the Balkans, would give both the leaders of
Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's
independence a short deadline to negotiate ways to restore autonomy
to the southern province and stop the violence and a longer
deadline to reach a permanent political solution.
</P>
<P>
   The allies warned, ``The appropriate authorities in Belgrade and
representatives of the Kosovo Albanian leadership must agree to the
proposals to be issued by the Contact Group for completing an
interim political settlement within the time frame to be
established.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday evening, after President Jacques Chirac of France
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had met in London,
Chirac's office in Paris issued a statement saying that France and
Britain were ``ready to consider any military action, with their
partners and in the framework of the Atlantic Alliance, including
sending ground troops required to accompany a negotiated
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said in
Bonn that negotiations would be held in France within a week, but
French diplomats here said the talks could take place in Vienna or
in Italy. The parties would be given two weeks, Fischer said, to
agree on a transitional solution.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said that the allies would meet again this
weekend to back up that ultimatum with a credible threat to use
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are at a very important turning point,'' the
alliance's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said after reading out
a 10 point warning he said he had also sent personally to Milosevic
and to the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova. In 1989, when he
was the Serbian president, Milosevic rescinded autonomy in Kosovo,
which is 90 percent populated by Albanians, although it is part of
Serbia and formed the heart of the Serbs' medieval empire.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's statement was part of a complex international
choreography insisted on by France and other European allies to
give diplomacy a chance to enlist the support of Russia in putting
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their warning, the allies demanded that Milosevic live up to
promises he made last fall to withdraw Serbian special police and
military units and heavy weapons used in attacks against Albanian
villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those promises, which diplomats said had never been kept, were
made after NATO authorized wide bombing unless Yugoslavia agreed to
negotiate peace with the rebels. The Albania rebels, too, kept
fighting and thus talks never got off the ground _ despite a
framework negotiated by the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of 45 civilians in the village of Racak two weeks
ago, French diplomats said, made the allies realize they had to
make a fresh attempt to halt the violence or risk seeing more
massacres weaken their own credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, visiting NATO allies at their headquarters here on
Thursday, noted that the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia carried
some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bloody wars of the last decade have left us with no
illusions about the difficulty of halting internal conflicts _ by
reason or by force _ particularly against the wishes of the
government of a sovereign state,'' Annan said. ``Nor have they left
us with any illusions about the need to use force, when all other
means have failed. We may be reaching that limit, once again, in
the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance warned, ``NATO stands ready to act and rules out no
option to insure full respect by both sides of the demands of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana, NATO's secretary-general, said later, ``The next few
days will be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had had its way, according to some
diplomats, NATO could have issued an ultimatum of its own on
Thursday, authorizing the alliance's military commander, Gen.
Wesley K. Clark of the United States, or Solana to initiate
military action if the Serbs or the Albanians refused to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats said the French prevailed with the view that with
Russia opposed to the use of military force against fellow Orthodox
Serbs, it was better to wait until after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other foreign ministers had met on Friday
with Russia in London.
</P>
<P>
   None of the allies, diplomats said, were now insisting on
getting explicit authority for military action from the U.N.
Security Council, as France urged last year before the United
States and Britain bombed Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats noted that the major question is how to
exercise military pressure on both the Serbian and the Albanian
side. While NATO has had plans for attacking Serbian military
targets in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia since last fall, it has
had more trouble coming up with ways to use force to get the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that NATO could impose naval blockades
around Albania, which the rebels use as a staging area, and deploy
forces along Albania's border with Kosovo to stop rebel
infiltration.

 &HT;    The Atlanta Broncos?
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It almost came about
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It comes to my attention that I have been withholding
information of intrigue from you. That the Denver Broncos almost
became the Atlanta Broncos, or whatever Leonard Reinsch would have
named them. Before that, however, the Broncos played a preseason
game in Atlanta _ or almost Atlanta _ in a ``stadium'' that
disappeared almost as fast as it was built. Like a traveling
roadshow, here today, gone tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   It was one puff of a pipe dream out of the mind of a man named
Bill McCain, one of several who had visions of bringing
major-league football to Atlanta. He was overoptimistic and
underfinanced. With plywood and bleachers borrowed through the
courtesy of Bud Adams and the Houston Oilers, McCain created
America Field _ I think that was the name _ on a chicken farm on
what is now Panola Road. With the help of Adams, McCain matched the
Oilers against Denver on an August night in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver media guide records that 11,500 came, on the one road
that led to the chicken farm, owned by a man named Roy Jones. There
were locker rooms, so to speak, but no running water. It was a
disaster. The bleachers went back to Houston, America Field
disappeared, and it all went up like, ``poof!'' As did Bill
McCain's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1965, with the new Atlanta Stadium rising on Capitol
Avenue and the Braves already pledged to the city, Mayor Ivan Allen
Jr. wanted a football team to be a sharing tenant. He went to his
friend Reinsch, president of Cox Broadcasting, and asked him to go
find one. Reinsch accepted the challenge and took aim on the
neophyte American Football League and its commissioner, Joe Foss,
who had been a fighter pilot ace in the Great War. Atlanta would
have been a plum to the AFL, and Foss apparently pointed Reinsch in
the direction of the Broncos, then gasping for life in Denver,
operating as Empire Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch took a flight to Denver, had a meeting with the men who
ran Empire Sports, Cal Kunz and Gerald Phipps. Here it becomes a
bit muddled, but Reinsch came home with the assurance that he had
an AFL franchise _ if not Denver, then one that Foss would award
him under Cox Broadcasting ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch reported to Mayor Allen, ``Here is the franchise you
asked for,'' then left for New Zealand, where his wife was
scheduled for delicate heart surgery that was only available there.
Wheels were turning in Denver, where Phipps and his brother Allan
bought control of the Broncos. Until then, the most season tickets
the Broncos had been able to sell was 8,000. The Phipps brothers
set off a drive that netted an amazing 22,905 season tickets, and
the Broncos were saved for Denver.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Reinsch returned from New Zealand, Pete Rozelle had
swung into action and cut in on the AFL. It was a war of leagues,
and commissioner Rozelle didn't want Atlanta to slip away. He met
with Mayor Allen and Arthur Mongomery, chairman of the Atlanta
Stadium Authority, and Gov. Carl Sanders made the scene. Suddenly,
Atlanta had an NFL franchise, but it needed an owner. There were
two major bidders, Lindsay Hopkins Jr., a sportsman of note with a
huge bankroll, and Rankin Smith, of the insurance firm of Life of
Georgia and a close friend of Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   With such connections and $8.5 million, Smith landed the
franchise, the AFL was left hat in hand, the Atlanta team became
the Falcons and 33 years later plays the Broncos, who almost came
to Atlanta, in the Super Bowl. (That the NFL revived America's
interest in Roman numerals might seem strange, since nobody ever
refers to World Series XCVII, or whatever, but the Super Bowl, in
this case, is XXXIII.)
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Reinsch, who has since passed away, was a bit miffed
with his friend, Mayor Allen, but it was between the two of them.
To speculate that the Broncos might have become the powerful force
they are today in Atlanta is just that, speculation. While the
civic-minded Phipps brothers saved the franchise for Denver, they
were getting nothing more than a dismal football team. The Broncos
had a stretch of futility longer than the Falcons'. They hadn't had
a winning season at the changing of hands, and wouldn't until 1973,
with John Ralston coaching.
</P>
<P>
   So, no matter how it all comes to pass Sunday at the stadium Joe
Robbie built, Atlanta can say it had a hand in it, preferably with
both hands on the trophy named for Vince Lombardi, who might have
become the coach of the Falcons. But that's another story.

&HT;        PA LAWMAKERS DISAGREE WITH GREENSPAN'S PREDICTION TAX HIKES
OR BENEFIT CUTS ARE NECESSARY TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 -- Several Pennsylvania lawmakers disagreed
with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning Thursday
that the only way to save Social Security is to raise taxes or cut
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said there are a host of options for
saving the program if all of the federal budget surplus is put
toward bolstering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are projecting a very substantial surplus for many years
into the future,'' Specter said. ``It is my thinking that we don't
need to have any additional taxes, but can make Social Security
sound with that surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that
President Clinton's plan to save Social Security is a ``major step
in the right direction,'' but tax hikes or benefit cuts are
inevitable to make it solvent.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Greenspan was correct that more work
needed to be done to save Social Security, adding that Clinton
would be working with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tax hikes or benefit cuts won't be necessary if Clinton allows
for individuals to set up personal investment accounts, said a
spokesman for Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``He thinks individuals
should invest directly in the stock market instead of the
government making those choices,'' Santorum spokesman Robert
Traynham said. ``It's Big Brother all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also resurrected concerns he expressed last week about
Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the federal budget
surplus in the stock market. He said it would be nearly impossible
for investments of the money to be protected from political
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton said he wants to use
60 percent of the federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years
to shore up the system that pays benefits to America's retirees.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of that money would be invested in the stock
market. An independent board would make the decisions about
investing. Clinton also proposed that 11 percent of the surplus be
set aside to create new private retirement accounts with a variety
of investment options individuals could choose among.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been grappling with how to prevent Social
Security from going bankrupt, which experts say will happen in 2032
unless it is reformed. As early as 2013, the system will be paying
out more in benefits to retirees than it takes in from taxes on
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, said he had serious doubts about
investing Social Security dollars in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not only risky but President Clinton's plan also raises
many difficult questions -- should the government decide which
stocks to buy or not buy, when to buy and when to sell, whether to
invest in defense companies or tobacco companies or international
companies doing business in say, China?'' Murtha said. ``Who's
going to make these decisions?''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, Santorum and Murtha said they were pleased that Social
Security was at the forefront of the national agenda, because the
issue is especially important in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   While 12.6 percent of the nation is 65 years of age or older,
Pennsylvania has 15.9 percent, the third highest percentage of
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Census data, which includes Cambria and Somerset counties in the
Johnstown regional count, reported that last year 18.7 percent of
the population in the Johnstown area is at least 65 years old.

U.S. GENERAL WARNS OF DANGERS IN TRYING TO TOPPLE SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The general who commands American forces in the
Persian Gulf on Thursday openly questioned the administration's new
policy of supporting Iraqi opposition groups in the hope they will
overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   In blunt testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
the Marine Corps commander, Gen. Anthony Zinni, said, ``I will be
honest: I don't see an opposition group that has the viability to
overthrow Saddam at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinni said the policy of supporting the dissidents, which was
embraced by President Clinton late last year as a cornerstone of
American policy in dealing with Iraq, ``would be very difficult,
and I think if not done properly, could be very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The general, who leads the U.S. Central Command, which directs
American military forces throughout the Middle East, said that the
administration had identified about 90 Iraqi opposition groups but
that ``they have little if any viability.'' He continued, ``Even if
we had Saddam gone, we could end up with 15, 20 or 90 groups
competing for power.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's open criticism drew expressions of alarm from
elsewhere in the administration, which has attempted to promote a
unified front in its support for opposition groups that might
topple the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Zinni was testifying on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright jetted across the Middle East, trying to drum
up support among Arab leaders for the new American strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the administration identified seven dissident groups
that could be eligible for a share of $97 million in military aid
allocated by Congress last year and approved by President Clinton.
Also last week, the administration named a veteran foreign service
officer, Frank Ricciardone, as its special representative to the
Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Administration spokesmen did not directly criticize Zinni. They
insisted, however, that whatever the general's concerns over the
policy, Clinton remained committed to helping Iraqi opposition
groups that seek to bring down Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is determined to redouble its efforts to
work closely with the members of the Iraqi opposition in order to
promote regime change in Iraq,'' said James Foley, a State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point is that we have begun this effort,'' he
said. ``We have accelerated our outreach with members of the Iraqi
opposition, credible groups who have support inside Iraq and who
can work, if they work together, towards hastening the advent of a
democratic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ``fully endorse General Zinni's conclusion that
we believe that this is not going to be an easy or short-term
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinni's criticism of Iraqi opposition groups is in fact widely
shared within the administration, although no other senior official
has been willing to state that view so publicly since Clinton,
under pressure from Congress, signed the aid to dissidents into law
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dissident groups are poorly organized. Western
diplomats who have dealt with them say their leaders spend much
more time feuding with one another than trying to unite behind a
strategy to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni, who oversaw relief efforts to the Kurdish minority in
northern Iraq after they were attacked by the Iraqi army in the
weeks after the 1991 Gulf war, suggested that there could be chaos
_ not only in Iraq but among its oil-rich neighbors _ if rival
Iraqi opposition parties overthrew Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need is a disintegrated, fragmented Iraq,''
he said. ``Saddam should go. There's not a doubt in my mind. But it
is possible to create a situation that could be worse. And that's
my concern. These groups are very fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   American support for the Iraqi opposition is part of what the
administration announced last year was its new two-step approach
towards Iraq: in the long term, to seek the ouster of Saddam
through support for Iraqi dissidents; in the short term, to prevent
him _ by force if necessary _ from threatening his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that force was necessary again on
Thursday when two American warplanes dropped bombs on an
antiaircraft artillery site in northern Iraq after observing firing
from the site. Military spokesmen said the two F-15E's fighters
returned safely to base after dropping two bombs on the site. There
were no immediate reports on damage to the Iraq installation.

AUTO INSURANCE DISCOUNTS SLASHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' largest auto insurance companies have
slashed the discounts they offer good drivers to around 5 percent,
but a handful of tiny firms bucked the trend and offered rate cuts
two to three times higher.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent rate filings mean customers and companies are now
faced with some tough choices. Customers will have to choose
whether to stick with a large, well-known company or go with a
smaller, unknown firm and save $20 to $70 on a typical $800
premium.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which company they select, good drivers will pay more
this year than last because the discounts available from every
company are smaller. At Commerce Insurance, the state's largest
insurer with over a fifth of the market, drivers with clean records
will pay about $80 more this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that companies have announced their discounts, the larger
companies have to decide whether to stick with their 5 percent
filings, and run the risk of losing customers to the smaller firms,
or amend their filings to match what the smaller companies are
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should switch carriers,'' said Josh Kratka, spokesman
for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group. ``I say
reward the small companies and change the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kratka said a mass exodus of customers to the smaller firms
could force the larger companies to raise their discounts. But
officials contacted at several of the larger firms said that was
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be wrong, but I don't think you'll see the market
respond to these smaller companies,'' said Ed Rinehimer, president
of Premier Insurance Co. in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Commerce Insurance, the state's largest carrier,
said he did not think the company would amend its filings as long
as the other major companies in the state were offering similar
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Even a spokesman for Horace Mann, the Springfield, Ill., insurer
that is offering a 14 percent discount to good drivers this year,
the highest of any company, seemed wary of a major influx of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we'd like to say `come one, come all,' we're not
really able to handle an all-out blitz,'' said John Hoffmann.
Horace Mann, which caters primarily to teachers, insures fewer than
1 percent of Massachusetts drivers and has only 22 agents in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state in the nation where regulators
set all aspects of auto rates. Three years ago insurers, flush with
profits, started offering discounts off of the state-set premiums
to increase market share.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of discounts: those offered to good drivers
and those offered to members of specific groups. Consumers trying
to get the best rates generally seek out the best combination of
the two.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting was particularly aggressive in 1996 and 1997, but it
began to slow last year and this year has been scaled back
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce, for example, cut its discount for drivers in the best
Step 9 classification from 15 percent to 5 percent. It reduced its
discount for Step 10 drivers to 3 percent and held the discount
offered to members of the American Automobile Association steady at
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's filings with the Division of Insurance indicate most
other major insurers are bunched up around Commerce. Arbella,
Safety, Liberty Mutual, Metropolitan and Plymouth Rock all filed
good-driver discounts matching Commerce. Most other major insurers
were within a couple of points, including Premier (8 percent for
Step 9s), Hanover (7 percent), CNA and Commercial Union (6
percent), and Trust (4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In all, companies with 88 percent of the state's drivers as
customers are offering discounts to Step 9 drivers in the 5 percent
to 8 percent range. Nearly 57 percent of the state's drivers are in
the Step 9 classification. Another 14 percent are in the Step 10
category.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the larger companies have claimed they cannot afford
to offer larger discounts because state regulators have set base
rates unrealistically low. Rates have been cut the last four years
and were increased just 0.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But six companies with a combined market share of less than 4
percent offered large discounts to good drivers. Horace Mann said
it would offer Step 9 drivers a 14 percent discount, give Step 10
drivers an 11 percent discount and award Step 11 drivers a 2
percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies offering double-digit discounts included Amica
(10 percent), newcomer Clarendon National (12 percent), Casco
Indemnity (12 percent), Masswest and Electric Insurance (10
percent).
</P>
<P>
   Step 9 drivers, who account for nearly two-thirds of the state's
drivers, have the most options. A Step 9 driver with a state-set
premium of $800 would pay $688 with Horace Mann's 14 percent
discount. The same driver would pay $752 with one of the major
insurers' 5 percent discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major insurers, however, offer group discounts in
addition to the good-driver discounts. Commerce, for example, would
charge a Step 9 driver who belongs to AAA $714. That same Commerce
driver last year paid $640 with the company's higher 15 percent
Step 9 discount.

FIXING THE BLAME FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRACKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Among the movers and shakers gathered here
for the World Economic Forum, a striking metaphor is helping to
frame the debate over the global financial crisis that began in
Asia and has spread to several other developing countries. The
debacle, some say, brings to mind a slick stretch of highway, scene
of a half-dozen recent auto accidents. So is it careless driving or
the highway that is the cause of the accidents?
</P>
<P>
   Substitute freewheeling worldwide capital flows and unrestricted
lending for the slippery, fast-moving highway. Make South Korea,
Thailand, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil stand-ins for the drivers
and their cars. The accidents are the panics and recessions _ the
crackups _ that have devastated each of these countries. And the
question now so widely debated is simple enough: Are the countries
mostly to blame or the unrestricted capital flows, or both?
</P>
<P>
   After the first accidents, the countries came in for almost all
the blame. It was because of crony capitalism, bad banking and
overleveraged real estate investments, many experts said. Fix the
sloppy financial practices and also make enough bailout money
available when a country gets into trouble _ basically the current
strategy of the International Monetary Fund for Brazil _ and the
accidents will be avoided or, at worst, will be mere fender
benders.
</P>
<P>
   But spectacular wrecks have occurred with alarming frequency and
severity in the last 18 months, even in Brazil, and some who had
mostly blamed the countries have begun to argue, here and in
earlier interviews, that the system needs serious fixing, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had placed most of the blame on the
countries, and still does. But its view, like that of the IMF, is
starting to reflect a more nuanced appraisal. ``We have seen that
countries need to pursue sounder policies and avoid lurching for
short-term capital, as Mexico and Thailand did,'' said Lawrence
Summers, the deputy treasury secretary. But in a phone interview
this week from Washington, he also called for ``more prudence on
the part of the lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the administration's most direct acknowledgment so far
that it is not necessarily always committed to unrestricted capital
flows, he added: ``Where countries have controls that restrict
short-term lending, we have not in general sought to dismantle
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on Wall Street are similarly shifting ground. ``It is
appropriate to certainly consider fixing the system,'' said Stephen
Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Morgan
Stanley normally makes more money when capital flows freely and the
firm can lend where and how it sees best.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent string of crackups has given Roach second
thoughts. ``I am not completely convinced that restrictions on the
system are necessary,'' he said, ``but unstable capital flows have
clearly been a precipitant of these crises.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top of many lists for fixing the system are proposals to
limit the flow of short-term foreign loans to developing countries,
loans that often contributed to more rapid growth but which piled
up in huge amounts in Asia, Russia and Brazil. Then, at the first
hint of trouble, much of the money fled, precipitating and
worsening a full-scale financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But other systemwide suggestions are winning favor as well:
pursing flexible exchange rates, for example, to avoid sudden,
frightening devaluations; introducing bankruptcy laws that let
companies deep in foreign debt borrow and resume operations even
before they pay off the old debts; and standstill provisions in
lending agreements that would temporarily prevent a foreign lender
from withdrawing loans from a South Korea or a Brazil in the midst
of a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is an effort to put more of the burden
on international banks and other lenders to evaluate risks more
carefully early on and suffer more of the consequences later if
things go bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks don't like this; they value liquidity of lending,''
said Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``But if they had a provision
in their loan agreements that they cannot pull out their money
right away when a crisis is developing, maybe they would not lend
the money in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts now favor rules that prevent not only foreign
lenders but wealthy nationals _ Brazilians, for example _ from
canceling their short-term loans and investments, then converting
this money from local currencies into dollars and taking the
dollars out of the country. Wealthy Brazilians, many of them
already moving chunks of capital abroad, hold more than $150
billion in their government's debt and rushing this money out of
the country would quickly exhaust Brazil's dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that basically all short-term debt constitutes
potential capital flight,'' said Paul Krugman, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``Brazil is at risk not only
from foreign lenders, but from anyone who can take money out of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some of these measures would make the highway safer for
ordinary drivers. But before the dangerous stretch of road is
rebuilt in hopes of preventing future accidents, the smashed cars
of the last 18 months have to be repaired and put back in
operation. There is little agreement on how to do that. Rather
there are two diametrically opposite, so far unyielding,
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The current practice, carried out at the insistence of the
Clinton administration and the IMF, is to require countries in
trouble to adopt policies intended to limit devaluations of a
country's currency and restore the confidence of international
lenders. If currencies plunge too far, the argument goes, then
foreign loans become much harder to repay and inflation sets in as
imports shoot up in price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainstream view would still be that the key solutions to
crises remain policy adjustments within the countries themselves,''
said William Cline, chief economist at the Institute for
International Finance, which represents lenders. ``Once you restore
confidence in a country's financial system, then you can get its
economy growing again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The chief tools in this approach are sharply higher interest
rates and cutbacks in public spending. But the high rates and
spending cutbacks invariably produce recessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argues that once confidence in a
financial system is restored, interest rates can then come down, as
they have in South Korea and Thailand, and nations can begin the
long climb out of recession. But even Thailand and South Korea are
still on the side of the road, their economies spinning their
wheels rather than moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too facile to say, `Look at Korea and Thailand, they are
turning around,''' said Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist. ``Their
economies have taken bigger hits than either country has
experienced in the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the East Asian countries, Brazil, the latest victim of a
financial panic, is hewing to policies that are plunging that
country into recession. And as the hobbling of giant Brazil slows
economic activity everywhere in Latin America, the odds rise that
even the United States and Europe could be caught in the spreading
global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That would not happen so much because of recession in Latin
America, but because some new blow _ a major bankruptcy, for
example, or a sharp decline in American stock prices _ undermines
confidence in an American financial system still nervous about Asia
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting view is argued most vehemently by Jeffrey Sachs
of Harvard, who insists that high interest rates and austerity
measures are bringing disaster to many emerging markets. He would
keep interest rates down to encourage economic activity and let
exchange rates find their own level. A growing economy is more
likely to restore investor confidence, he says, than a recessionary
one burdened by high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Treasury and the IMF have driven a large part of the
developing world into recession,'' said Sachs, who directs
Harvard's Institute for International Development. ``And the Brazil
case makes absolutely clear that the first step is not to defend
overvalued currencies. The punishing cost of this is overwhelmingly
high. This is a lesson that the IMF and the Treasury have continued
to ignore. I don't understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the disagreement over how to repair the damaged East
Asian and Latin economies, much of the debate centers not on the
present, but on how to avoid financial crises in the future. And
here the proposals increasingly involve a mixture of fixing the
system and fixing the countries _ repairing the highway and making
the drivers more cautious and skilled.
</P>
<P>
   On the country side, several proposals have been made to set up
a super central bank that would make huge amounts of money
available to bail out a country in the event of a crisis. George
Soros, the speculator and philanthropist, has offered one version,
and another comes from Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy
managing director. But to qualify for such bailouts in the future,
the countries would have to strengthen their banking and financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would shore up the international system by providing a
more meaningful lender of last resort,'' said C. Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Those who focus mostly on the system would require, among other
things, that banks put aside extra money in a reserve fund if they
lent into emerging countries heavily burdened with foreign debt.
``Putting aside money in that fashion reduces the profitability of
a loan, which in turn makes lenders more cautious,'' said Ricardo
French-Davis, a Chilean economist who works in Santiago with the
U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman of MIT goes further in blaming the system and in arguing
that the need to fix structural problems in individual countries
should not stand in the way of broader macro-economic measures,
particularly those designed to stimulate growth in hard times.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, he writes that over the
last 25 years, much of the global economy has returned in many ways
to a ``pre-Depression free-market capitalism,'' with its virtues
but also its vices _ the main vice being a vulnerability to
spectacular crackups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to avoid concluding that sooner or later we will
have to turn the clock at least part of the way back,'' he writes.
``To limit capital flows for countries that are unsuitable for
either currency unions or free floating; to reregulate financial
markets to some extent; and to seek low, but not too low, inflation
rather than price stability. We must heed the lessons of Depression
economics, lest we be forced to relearn them the hard way.''

HUSSEIN'S DECISION ON SUCCESSOR LEAVES JORDAN IN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Inside King Hussein's palace, time was running
out.
</P>
<P>
   Fever and exhaustion wracked his body. It was late Monday night
and the 63-year-old monarch's doctors had just informed him that
six months of cancer treatment in the United States had failed.
He'd have to return immediately to Minnesota's Mayo Clinic for
emergency care, making it possible he'd never return to the kingdom
he ruled for nearly a half century.
</P>
<P>
   So for five hours, until 1 a.m. Tuesday, he struggled to compose
a letter in longhand that would explain why he would not pass the
crown to his 51-year-old brother, Prince Hassan, the expected heir
for 34 years. Then he appointed his oldest son as successor _ and
shocked the nation with his flight to the United States, just 12
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into his new role, the 36-year-old Crown Prince Abdullah
was already hearing from the world's policy-makers Thursday,
meeting US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about steadily
mounting tensions in Iraq. Thursday his father was listed in stable
condition, but palace sources fear he does not have long to live.
</P>
<P>
   The week's stunning turn of events inside the palace sent
shockwaves through the nation and the region, where Jordan is
caught between Iraq and Israel. It is a story of grand political
significance in one of the Middle East's most pivotal nations. And
it is a deeply personal tale of family dynamics and the struggle to
reconcile the loss of a patriarch to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tragedy, a kind of King Lear tragedy. If I were a
playwright, I would write it that way,'' said one former palace
official who served as a close confidant to the king for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Hassan's downfall is that, after waiting more
than have his life to be king, he suddenly grasped too quickly for
power. The King interpreted his actions, and the actions of his
wife, sources say, as an attempt to usurp power while he was
fighting for his life at the Mayo clinic through six months of
chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hassan's actions went to the core of power. Hassan tried
to replace the army chief of staff, which infuriated the King. And
some were the more banal workings of a family. Hassan's wife, the
Pakistan-born Princess Sarvath, began redecorating the palace to
her tastes, which infuriated the American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   The King's handwritten, 11-page letter to his brother and his
subjects, published in the Jordan Times, scathingly rebuked Hassan
for his actions. In the official English translation, the king made
reference to ``climbers,'' which sources say referred to Princess
Sarvath and some of Hassan's confidants. But the Arabic version
went further, using a word that translates as ``parasites.'' The
King also described remarks, presumably by Princess Sarvath, made
about his wife and children as ``slanderous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a rush,'' one former ambassador for the palace
said of Hassan and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The result: the learned, experienced, and loyal brother _ who
Jordanians for more than three decades had expected to be their
future king _ was suddenly cast aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of misinterpretation of motives. The younger
brother saw (his actions, such as changes in the military) as a
rational responsibility. The sick man saw them as a conspiracy
against him,'' one source explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now the King's relatively obscure son, a boyish looking military
commander who loves sports and has little experience in
international affairs, is ascendant. It says a lot about Abdullah
that even though he was the King's oldest son by his second
marriage, he was never considered a likely successor.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, palace watchers believed that Hussein wanted to
pass the crown to Prince Hamzah, the favorite son of Hussein and
eldest son of Queen Noor, the King's fourth and current wife. But
Hamzah is only 18 and now enrolled in Sandhurst, the British
military academy where his father and brother Abdullah also
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King was favoring Hamzah,'' said Ahmad Obeidat, a former
prime minister and palace official who last month visited the King
in the hospital. ``Nobody even thought about Abdullah. But the time
element became very important. ... The calculations changed very
fast'' when the king received the news this week that his condition
was detereorating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Obeidat explained that immediately after the King's homecoming
last week, the king was still entertaining the idea that perhaps
his health would hold out long enough for him to reorganize the
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources believed Hussein was planning to make Prince Hassan
a regent, or acting King, and make his son Hamzah Crown Prince so
that when he came of age he would inherit the throne. But this
would have required a long campaign to change the nation's
constitution _ and parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   With the King's sudden return to the Mayo Clinic, the option
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple. The King wanted his son to be king, not his
brother... When he realized it could not be Hamzah, he settled for
Abdullah,'' said Obeidat. ``This has left Queen Noor
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Lisa Halaby, a woman known worldwide for her beauty,
grace and work in advocating a global ban on landmines, is suddenly
facing an uncertain role in the Hashemite kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   For Hassan, the king's brother, the disappointment showed
clearly on his face, even while he publicly embraced Abdullah and
said he accepted the king's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was in shock,'' said Obeidat, who visited
the Crown Prince in the palace. ``It's not easy for a man after 34
years in a post to find himself out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, known as is his father for his common touch, inherits
a Jordan with a stagnant economy, climbing unemployment and
severely limited opportunities for its younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to find a way to convince a nation that they should
give the peace process with Israel more time, despite little
economic return so far. And he must closely watch the unpredictable
regime of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts in Jordan expressed concern that nations in the
region, perhaps Iraq or Israel, might take advantage of the
instability in Jordan to further their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also question whether US officials may have played
a behind-the-scenes role in the rapid change in succession to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   None would dispute that Hussein and Hassan both value the long
relationship and strong economic support provided by the United
States to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan was widely viewed as more skeptical than his brother
of the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace plan. He was more likely to be
outspoken in demanding Israeli compliance with the terms of the
pact, regarding both Jordan and Palestinian interests.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was also generally viewed as more ``lenient'' than the
king on Iraq, as one former Jordanian minister put it, and more
likely to speak out against the human suffering caused by eight
years of crippling economic sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's meeting, Albright was quick to back Abdullah with
American aid and introduce him to Frank Ricciardone, the US
official overseeing Washington's pressure campaign against Iraq.
The two men chatted on the steps of the palace while Albright
fielded questions Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether Washington did not prefer the younger
Abdullah, a perhaps more impressionable ruler whose views could be
shaped to fit the contours of US interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important question,'' said Obeidat. ``It will take a
long time to find out the answer.''

CHEMOTHERAPY BEFORE SURGERY AIDS BREAST CANCER PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Giving breast cancer patients chemotherapy before surgery _ a
reversal of the usual order _ shrinks many large breast tumors
enough to qualify women for lumpectomy instead of more radical
surgery, researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   The chemo-first approach sometimes leads to a more dramatic
result: dissolving even microscopic traces of malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   One in eight women with large breast tumors or malignancy that
had spread to nearby lymph nodes had such ``complete remissions''
from presurgical chemotherapy. Nearly 90 percent of these lucky
women were alive and cancer-free five years after treatment, a rate
that parallels survival of women diagnosed at the earliest stages
of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The largest impact of putting chemotherapy first, the Texas
researchers said, would be to spare many more women from breast
amputation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. S. Eva Singletary of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston
said the chemo-first approach can safely provide many thousands of
breast cancer patients an alternative to mastectomy now offered
only to women with the smallest malignancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually surgeons consider lumpectomy only for small breast
tumors,'' said Singletary, herself a surgeon. ``We're saying: Wait
a minute, you can give chemo, shrink that large tumor to a small
one, and do a lumpectomy safely.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer
currently undergo mastectomy, in which the breast is removed along
with nearby lymph nodes in an attempt to excise malignant cells
that can lead to recurrence of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, which so far is being done only in some
academic cancer centers, may apply to about 45 percent of newly
diagnosed breast cancer cases. That translates to about 81,000
American women annually, out of 179,000 new diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if US surgeons adopted the chemo-first approach,
the nation's mastectomy rate would plummet _ apparently without
raising the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there appears to be no disadvantage with going with
preoperative chemo first,'' Singletary said in an interview.
``There's nothing wrong with doing surgery first, but going with
chemo first is safe, it's effective, and it may make the surgery
less radical. So you haven't lost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence comes from an analysis of two separate studies of
breast cancer patients who got varying combinations of chemotherapy
drugs before and after surgery, with or without supplemental
radiation to the affected breast and regional lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   The 372 women in the two studies had ``locally advanced'' breast
cancer, classified as Stage II or Stage III. That means their tumor
was larger than 1 centimeter in diameter at diagnosis or that
cancer cells were found in nearby lymph nodes. In fact, the average
tumor among women in the studies measured six centimeters across, a
size that would rule out lumpectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients also had skin puckering from the underlying tumor
or positive lymph nodes above the collarbone, giving them a
less-favorable prognosis. But none in the Texas studies had
evidence of malignancy in the liver, bones, or brain.
</P>
<P>
   Giving these women chemotherapy first shrank the breast tumors
by more than half in 80 percent of the study subjects. Sixteen
percent had their breast tumors disappear entirely, and 12 percent
had no microscopic evidence of malignancy in either breast or lymph
node tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, women with such ``complete responses'' were more
likely to have more aggressive tumors. Because malignant cells in
such tumors are dividing faster, they give anticancer drugs more
opportunities to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cannot yet claim an overall survival advantage from
the chemo-first approach, partly because they have not studied
enough cases. In ongoing studies, they are adding taxol to other
drugs to see if they can demonstrate a long-term survival advantage
among women who do not achieve a complete remission from
chemotherapy alone.
</P>
<P>
   The new analysis, published in the current issue of the Journal
of Clinical Oncology, may not convince many doctors to try
chemotherapy first because it is not based on random assignment of
women to this approach versus the traditional one, in which
patients receive anticancer drugs only after surgical removal of
the breast tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary said ongoing studies, and some on the drawing board,
will provide more data. For instance, the Houston researchers are
conducting a trial in which all chemotherapy is done ``up front,''
or before surgery. Prior studies have split drug treatments into
pre- and post-surgical components.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, studies have shown that chemotherapy
substantially improves survival in women who have breast lumps
measuring more than 1 centimeter at the time of diagnosis. Thus,
many women receive chemotherapy already, and the Texas researchers
say the issue now is one of timing.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston specialist advised women facing breast cancer
surgery and subsequent chemotherapy to ask her doctor whether he or
she would consider giving chemotherapy first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman is told, `You need a mastectomy because your tumor
is too large,' she should ask, `What about the option of using
chemo to downstage this tumor to see if I could be a candidate for
lumpectomy?' '' Singletary advised.
</P>
<P>
   In another cancer study in the British journal The Lancet, Dutch
doctors claimed partial success in using a vaccine against colon
cancer made from patients' own cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental vaccine reportedly reduced the risk of
recurrence among colon cancer patients with Stage II disease, which
means malignancy that has penetrated the bowel wall but has not
spread to area lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Robert Mayer of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a
colon cancer authority, called the results ``pretty inconclusive''
because of the study's small number of subjects and what he called
``marginal benefits'' in only a subgroup of patients.

 &HT;    `Family Guy': A wonderfully bent little show
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's hoping that none of us in Atlanta will be
paying a bit of attention when ``The Family Guy'' debuts after the
Super Bowl Sunday on Fox, at around 10 p.m. We'll all be too busy
mobbing the streets, blowing our horns, behaving like
elbow-wiggling glorious fools, celebrating our victory.
</P>
<P>
   But those still sprawled and glazed in the front of the tube
will see Fox give its most visible platform to yet another animated
series, the third new one in three weeks, following ``The PJs'' and
``Dilbert.'' ``The Family Guy'' is better than either of them, a
wonderfully bent little show that blends some of the nasty
sensibility of ``South Park'' with some of the basics of ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of 25-year-old newcomer Seth McFarlane, the guy in
``Family Guy'' is Peter Griffin, whom you'll recognize instantly as
a Homer Simpson knock-off (beer-guzzling incompetent loser). Mom
Lois stands in for Marge, but in this household there are two teens
(Meg and Chris).
</P>
<P>
   And then there's baby Stewie, the one you'll remember. Stewie
plots to kill his family from his highchair, and sounds like a bad
James Bond villian in his cultured British accent. ``Damn you, vile
woman!'' he curses his mother. ``You've impeded my work since the
day I escaped from your wretched womb!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy'' is one of those shows that throws everything out there
and hopes that some of it works. And some of it does, even as a lot
of it doesn't. There are scads of throwaway jokes, like the ``G.I.
Jew'' doll, a porno spoof of ``Casablanca,'' old sitcom send-ups,
and even Michaelangelo's David, which has a crucial bit broken off.
</P>
<P>
   The big risk for Fox is that it still hasn't decided on a slot
for ``Family Guy.'' The post-game premiere is a one-shot, and the
show will then not come on until sometime in March, at a time to be
announced. In today's programming logjam, some viewers may have
forgotten about it by the time it comes back.
</P>
<P>
   As a programming strategy, a cross between ``South Park'' (with
more staying power, perhaps) and ``The Simpsons'' (they should be
so lucky in the long run) is just what Fox needs. Whether this is
what television really needs will depend on your taste for bodily
appendage jokes, but these days, this is the level you get.

FORD MOVE RESHAPES EUROPEAN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FORD-VOLVO and FORD-JAPAN) 
(lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOTEBORG, Sweden _ Ford Motor Co.'s victorious bid for AB
Volvo's car business increases the pressure on other European
automobile companies to either buy or be bought, industry
executives and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the most precarious futures are middle-sized
companies like Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and, as
it clearly recognized by trying to buy Volvo itself, Fiat SpA of
Italy. Each of those companies lacks the size to compete with the
giants like DaimlerChrysler AG or General Motors Corp. On top of
that, they remain bogged down in brutally competitive markets for
midsized and small cars.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's agreement was a particularly big defeat for Fiat,
which had openly courted Volvo in recent weeks and was reported to
have offered about $7 billion for the entire company. Besides the
car business, Fiat executives were also entranced by the idea of
combining the two companies' truck and construction-equipment
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, the bid failed,'' said a discouraged Fiat
executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Volvo decided
to sell exclusively its car-making activity and to hold on to the
other businesses, which were, I might add, of greater interest to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it also marked a setback for Renault and
Peugeot, which remain heavily dependent on the French market and on
lower-priced and less profitable mass-market vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford has taken a very appealing brand out of the market, and
that is bad news for almost everybody else,'' said Chiara Tirloni,
an automobile analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. announced their $36
billion merger last year, European car manufacturers have been
engaged in a frenzy of matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the European and in the global automobile market, it's not
just fusion but also confusion that you're seeing,'' said Bernd
Gottschalk, the president of the German Automobile Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Though Volvo is a small player, producing fewer than 400,000
cars a year, it has important strengths, the most important being
its strong appeal to affluent consumers who are willing to pay
comparatively higher prices for family cars. In addition, Volvo has
a well-established distribution network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's automobile industry is divided into several different
camps that face somewhat different pressures. DaimlerChrysler is
essentially in a league of its own, a goliath with a huge
mass-market presence in North America and an equally strong base in
high-priced luxury cars in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   BMW AG and Porsche AG, meanwhile, have continued to be
successful as smaller producers of more expensive sedans and sports
cars. BMW has been the subject of repeated takeover rumors, but the
company has adamantly denied any interest in selling.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Europe's other producers are struggling to bridge
the gulf between mass and class. Thanks to global overcapacity and
a reluctance by European consumers to spend money, competition has
been brutal for the last several years among producers of midsized
or small cars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Volkswagen AG, which has cut costs and streamlined its
production, has been one of the biggest sources of pressure for
companies ranging from Fiat and Renault to GM's Opel subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   After a painful reorganization in the early 1990s, Volkswagen's
sales and profits have surged in the last year. But even though its
Audi subsidiary has been successful as a producer of upscale
sedans, a few of which compete with DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes, the
company is still searching for ways to move beyond mass-market
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of its European peers, Volkswagen is already big
enough to compete in today's environment. It produces more than 4
million cars a year and has about $11 billion in cash to make
additional acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is considerably grimmer for French and Italian car
companies. Though Fiat has a significant international presence, it
has far less cash than Volkswagen or Ford and has been under
increasing competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat's profits were depressed last year by the end of
government-sponsored rebates in Italy, and weakening in two big
overseas markets, Poland and Brazil. And after announcing its
intention to invest $400 million in Russia, the company had to put
plans on hold when that nation's economy collapsed last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat had at least a half-dozen meetings with Volvo officials,
most of them near Fiat's headquarters in Turin, Italy. But Fiat
executives said their real target was Volvo's truck-making unit,
which produces heavy trucks that might have complemented Fiat's
line of smaller trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But Volvo surprised many of its suitors two weeks ago when it
bought a 12.8 percent stake in a rival Swedish truck maker, Scania
AB, and said it wanted the two companies to merge their truck
operations. But the relationship is still in doubt because it has
provoked strenuous objections from Scania's majority shareholder,
the investment firm Investor AB.
</P>
<P>
   Renault of France had a strong year in 1998, thanks to the
success of its new Scenic minivan in Europe. But it still produces
fewer than 2 million cars a year, and Peugeot Citroen is only
slightly bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say both companies are in a poor position to keep up
with the accelerated pace of developing new models at low prices.
The heightened competition means that all companies are under
pressure to spread research and development costs over a much wider
array of cars.
</P>
<P>
   While companies like BMW and Porsche can avoid the problem to
some extent because they charge premium prices, mass-market
producers like Renault and Peugeot have no such maneuvering room.
And the pressure is intensifying: Toyota is building a $700 million
factory in France to build its small Yaris car for the European
market.
</P>
<P>
   But the French companies face political as well as financial
challenges. The French government has traditionally blocked
attempts by foreign companies to acquire major French corporations
in almost any industry. The government owns more than 40 percent of
Renault and is not likely to relinquish control any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Renault has made its own overtures abroad. It has
held talks about acquiring a minority stake in Nissan Motor Co. of
Japan, which is in dire financial straits and needs a new partner.
But DaimlerChrysler is also in formal talks with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Stuerzer, an automobile analyst at Bayerische Hypo-und
Vereinsbank in Munich, Germany, noted that the easiest political
solution for the French companies would be to merge them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am not at all sure that would be sensible, in part
because they are both in the same market and wouldn't gain that
many advantages,'' he said.

SCIENTISTS WARN AGAINST IGNORING CLIMATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Geophysical Union, the United States' most broadly
based professional organization in earth and space science, said in
an official policy statement Thursday that there was a ``compelling
basis for legitimate public concern'' about human-induced climatic
change.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific uncertainty about the problem, the statement said,
``does not justify inaction'' in coping with it.
</P>
<P>
   The statement dealt with the burning of fossil fuels like coal,
oil and natural gas. The burning produces carbon dioxide, a gas
that traps heat in Earth's atmosphere as in a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The geophysical union said ``there is no known geologic
precedent'' for the conversion of carbon from Earth's crust into
atmospheric carbon dioxide, in the amounts being burned as fossil
fuels, without changing the climate.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is the eighth the union has issued on some aspect
of science-related public policy, and the latest in a long list of
statements on global warming over the last two decades by
prestigious scientific groups that have reached similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer always comes back: `Global warming is a serious
problem, and policy-makers have got to figure out what to do about
it,''' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the
Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental research and advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   But the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public policy group
that promotes free enterprise and limited government, said the
geophysical union, by making a judgment favorable to the Clinton
administration's policy of action on global warming, had ``crossed
the line separating science from advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The average surface temperature of Earth has risen by about 1
degree Fahrenheit over the last century, compared with a difference
of 5 to 9 degrees between now and the depths of the last ice age,
some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An international panel of scientists convened by the United
Nations has projected that if emissions of the heat-trapping gases
are not reduced, the surface temperature will rise by another 2 to
6 degrees by the end of the 21st century, producing widespread
climatic disruptions. The world's industrialized countries in late
1997 bound themselves to reduce their emissions of these gases by
about 5 percent over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of mandatory action to reduce such emissions have
cited the uncertainties surrounding predictions about climate
change, and Thursday's statement dealt prominently with those
uncertainties. It noted, for instance, that while the observed
global temperature rise ``appears to be unusual in the context of
the last few centuries,'' it is ``not clearly outside the range of
climate variability of the last few thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said, the complexity of the climate system ensures
that uncertainty ``will never be completely eliminated.''
</P>

 &HT;    Georgia `Bubba' is winning votes for S.C. lottery
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As the South Carolina Senate prepares for its
final vote next week on a statewide lottery that would compete with
Georgia's, Republicans opposed to the legislation already appear
defeated by a Georgia hayseed named ``Bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters met Bubba last fall when the bearded character in a
Georgia Bulldog cap and T-shirt appeared in state Democratic Party
television ads ridiculing Gov. David Beasley, a Republican who had
denounced lotteries as immoral gambling, even if proceeds would
benefit public education.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley lost to Democrat Jim Hodges, whose main campaign pledge
was to use millions of dollars in lottery proceeds to improve South
Carolina's bottom-scraping public schools. Recent Democratic
polling indicated nearly seven out of every 10 voters favored a
lottery referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubba is a folk hero,'' said Sen. Ernie Passailaigue, the
Charleston Democrat who sponsored legislation that would allow
South Carolinians to vote on erasing the state's 104-year-old
constitutional ban on lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Passailaigue contends the Republican-controlled House will be
risking a voter backlash in the Nov. 2, 2000, general election if
it derails the lottery vote when the legislation moves there. ``If
they sit around and hem and haw with it, and bog this down, they
are going to be turned out in droves,'' he said. ``Bubba is going
to be back in 2000 big time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker David Wilkins, a Greenville Republican who opposes
the lottery, conceded Thursday that ``it is a foregone conclusion''
that legislators will schedule a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The Bubba character, played by actor Kerry Maher of Rock Hill,
S.C., was used by Hodges' supporters to point out that South
Carolinians were crossing into Georgia and spending millions a year
in that state's lottery. South Carolina Democrats estimate that
amount at $80 million or more a year, although Georgia lottery
officials don't keep exact tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Georgia, we just luuuvvv David Beasley,'' Bubba
hee-hawed in the commercial, which Democrats insist galvanized
strong but unspoken sentiment among South Carolinians who hated the
idea of their money paying for HOPE scholarships for Georgia
college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in South Carolina has a relative in Georgia who is
going to school for free,'' Passailaigue said Thursday, shortly
before the state Senate resumed debate on the lottery and scheduled
a third and final vote for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate voted 37-8 in favor of a bill that
would schedule a lottery referendum for the Nov. 2, 2000, general
election. The legislation, which requires three votes, also would
set up a referendum on whether the state should ban the $2.3
billion-a-year video poker industry. Republican senators later
expressed regret about scheduling both votes on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's top priority is establishing a lottery as early
as 2001 in hopes that it would generate $90 million for public
education and $150 million in subsequent years. He favors holding
both referendums at the same time. ``I think the people ought to
decide thumbs up or thumbs down whether or not we have the lottery
or ... video poker in the year 2000,'' he said.

   IQALUIT, Northwest Territories _ The day the map of Canada is
redrawn and native people in the frigid north start to govern
themselves is still more than two months off. But this frontier
city, which will become North America's newest capital on April 1,
is already undergoing a strange Arctic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The new territory has a name, Nunavut. But streets do not, which
means that houses do not have addresses, just haphazardly assigned
numbers like items in a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iqaluit (ee-KA-loo-eet) has its third bank, which will start
taking cash deposits as soon as the ice clears and a cargo ship can
deliver a safe. And by the end of the month it will be the
northernmost community in Canada to have cellular telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 4,200 residents still have to flick on a red light
at the side of their houses to signal the water-delivery man that
their tanks need refilling. But there are now two tanning salons in
this new capital, which used to be called Frobisher Bay, and a
Chinese restaurant, a local Internet service provider and a
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.
</P>
<P>
   All over town, construction crews are working 10-hour days where
the wind-chill sometimes sinks to minus 94 Fahrenheit to finish
commercial buildings, dozens of apartments and the new Nunavut
legislative building by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to get too involved emotionally over what's
happening,'' said Tagak Curley, president of Nunavut Construction
Corp., an Inuit enterprise that is building the igloo-shape
legislative chambers for the Nunavut government. ``Otherwise we
might lose our focus, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   Curley, 55, an old Inuit warrior in the battle for native
rights, said he felt a great sense of accomplishment now that the
vision of an Inuit homeland is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be nervous wrecks, many years ago, worrying about
what was going to happen to us,'' he said. ``Now I'm not worried
about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to the people of Nunavut is the latest and
biggest example of a trend across the hemisphere. Native groups are
demanding self-determination and achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes in the United States have largely won the power to
run their reservations. Eskimos in Alaska govern municipalities
where they form majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Nisga'a Indians of northern British Columbia
signed a treaty with the Canadian government that gave them the
right to govern themselves in an area more than half the size of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut dwarfs them all. But despite optimism as boundless as
the sea ice, the capital is uneasy. The extra money of boom times
has brought extra problems. In December, teen-agers' sniffing
gasoline for a high set fire to and destroyed seven new town houses
that were being built for employees of the new government.
</P>
<P>
   The growing mound of trash in the town dump has attracted a huge
flock of ravens, whose mad heckling pierces the howling wind. And
Inuit lured from the countryside by the possibility of jobs stand
in ever longer lines for the night's allotment of vouchers to buy
beer and a drink called the paralyzer at the Tulugaq Bar here, one
of the few places in Nunavut that serve alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been anticipating the negative effects of the economic
boom,'' Mayor Jimmy Kilabuk said through an interpreter. ``And now
they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile nothing but the core functions of the new government _
legislators, courts and tax collectors _ will be up and running by
April 1. Other services been temporarily contracted from the old
Northwest Territories government because it has proved impossible
to hire enough Inuit with the training to fill new management
positions.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 workers have been hired to work for the executive
branch. But the goal of having Inuit fill 85 percent of the
hundreds of jobs has been reduced, for the time being, to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has yet come up with anything but a vague, promissory
response to the most nagging question about Nunavut's future: Will
the new territory always be a financial drain on the well-meaning
but sometimes resentful rest of Canada?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a danger that Nunavut will end up as a
perpetual welfare state,`` said Graham White, a professor of
political science at the University of Toronto who specializes in
northern politics. ``But it would have been worse to leave things
as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges for Nunavut loom like icebergs during these
final, frantic months before the new territory is created from the
eastern 60 percent of what today is the Northwest Territories. The
two current territories in Canada _ the other is Yukon _ have their
own governments, but because of their small populations, they rely
more on the federal government than do the 10 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut will be enormous, some 770,000 square miles of snow and
ice roughly the size of Western Europe with only a few scrub trees
and a handful of paved roads. Caribou outnumber the 25,000
residents more than 25 to one. There are just 28 communities within
the boundaries of what will become Nunavut on April 1, and most are
no bigger than a few hundred hardy souls.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are what the Inuit call the ``high statistics:''
Nunavut will rank among the leaders in unemployment, births, teen
suicides, spousal abuse and sniffing gasoline and solvents to get
high. All are troubles that existed before the Nunavut government
was created; all will be dumped in the new government's lap.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Nunavut remains a bold experiment. Its first official
step came early this decade, as part of the largest land-claim
settlement in Canadian history. Like other native groups, the Inuit
sought control of their traditional hunting and camping grounds, as
well as demanding compensation for land that had been confiscated
long ago by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a complicated settlement in which Inuit ownership
was recognized over 137,000 square miles of land, including about
14,000 square miles where the Inuit also owned subsurface mineral
rights. The rest of the land within Nunavut will be federally
owned. There was also a settlement of about $1 billion to be paid
out over 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the land-claim settlement called for splitting the
Northwest territories in two. The eastern part, or Nunavut, would
be governed by the Inuit simply because Inuit compose 85 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a public government with popular elections,``
said Simon Awa, executive director of the Nunavut Implementation
Commission, which studied and then recommended the form the new
government should take. ``We are respecting the Canadian
constitution and parliamentary system and marrying them with the
Inuit traditional knowledge and way of dealing with things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result is a government unlike anything that now exists in
North America. Even though they chose not to restrict the right to
vote or run for office to just native people, the Inuit of Nunavut
will be the first indigenous people in the Americas to govern
themselves so completely. It will be something akin to Utah, where
the Mormon people, by their numbers and not by law, tend to run
things.
</P>
<P>
   There will not be one official language in Nunavut but three _
English, French and Inuktituk _ and many of Nunavut's planning
documents already are printed in all three. Non-partisan elections
for the assembly on Feb. 15 will determine the first 19 members of
the territorial legislature, and those lawmakers will then select
the territory's first premier.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal that was only narrowly defeated in a public
referendum, each legislative district would have had two
representatives, one man and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something never tried anywhere in the world,`` Awa
said. ``It may have been too radical an idea to start with, but we
may come back to it in two or three elections.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legislature will meet in Iqaluit, and the premier's
office will be located here as well, many of the remaining 10
departments will be spread out over 10 far-flung Inuit communities.
By decentralizing the government in this way, the Inuit hope to
distribute the obvious economic benefits more widely.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut will have Canada's first department of sustainable
development, and a department of culture, language, elders and
youth. Managers throughout the government will be instructed to
take a more flexible approach to time, and will be expected to
allow workers time off to pursue traditional activities like seal
hunts, which do not always fit into a five-day work week.
</P>
<P>
   Inuit leaders like Curley know there are many people ready to
declare the folly of Nunavut. ``There are a lot of doubters, I know
that,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while he acknowledges that some of the criticism might be
fair, he points out that Nunavut has not enjoyed the advantages
that Canada provided to develop other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't build us a railroad,`` he said, referring to the
government support that in the 19th century created a
transcontinental railroad that opened up the west. ``Economic
development in this part of the world is an ongoing challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the birth of the new government is providing jobs
and economic opportunities, especially here in Iqaluit. Officials
hope the current boom is bigger and longer-lasting than earlier
ones. The area's first flurry of activity came during World War II
when the U.S. Army, with permission from the Canadian government,
built an air strip here.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials once seriously considered building a dome
over the settlement. But when the Northwest Territories were
established as a separate government almost 30 years ago, the
government constructed a hideous complex on the hill that combines
housing, offices, a hotel and even a pool so the new government
workers would not have to brave the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Although he worries that some poorly qualified people have been
put in management positions just because they are Inuit, Kenn
Harper, a local entrepreneur who settled here and for several years
was involved in plans for the creation of Nunavut, remains
optimistic about Iqaluit. He's building dozens of apartments, and
will build even more next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling me all the time asking about housing,`` he
said. ``There will probably be 7,000 people in Iqaluit in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Canadians from provinces stuck in economic downturns,
Nunavut is a beckoning opportunity, a frozen rainbow. ``There's
tons of work here,'' said Terry Charter, a contractor from Nanaimo,
British Columbia, who is working on one of the many residential
construction projects in Iqaluit. ``The creation of Nunavut is
great for the people of Nunavut and it's great for us, too, because
it puts us to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilabuk, who was born in a native camp about 60 miles from
Iqaluit, said that as an Inuk, the term for an individual Inuit, he
is proud that Nunavut will soon be a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is confident about the town's future, he remembers a
story the elders of his community, now long gone, told him as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can tell you is that they said Iqaluit will become a
big center and have a lot of problems and a lot of challenges that
would come from outside,'' he said. ``I don't know how they were
able to predict that so accurately, but they did.''

COMMENTARY: DEFINE DEVIANCY UP  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On just one condition, journalists and lesser Americans have
every right to deride the way the Senate is conducting the trial of
President Clinton. If they don't, they should.
</P>
<P>
   The senators wear their nonpartisan clothes, walk, talk and
probably sleep in them. But when it comes to voting and maneuvering
they strip right down to their partisan buff.
</P>
<P>
   The senators cannot stand the strain of their trial regulation
forbidding all of them to speechify inside the chamber. So they run
outside during the day to line up for TV time; right away they feel
better.
</P>
<P>
   The senators are supposed to use any ponder power they possess
and however long it takes to come to a decision on whether the
president should stay or go. But most act as if their real job is
to rid themselves of the whole thing right away and return to more
important matters, unspecified. They keep waving their hands,
hoping the teacher, or anybody, will let out school.
</P>
<P>
   And they pass up the critical witness on influencing a witness,
the president's secretary. She is a nice woman, and understandably
nervous. Do you expect them to take the chance of her breaking into
tears?
</P>
<P>
   All Democrats and many Republicans decided long in advance of
the trial that although they thought Clinton terribly naughty, his
lying and obstructing justice are not grounds serious enough to be
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of my very favorite
politicians, goes along with them. In 1993 he warned America
against ``defining deviancy down'' _ acceptance of actions we once
regarded as acutely offensive, immoral or illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Derision time right enough _ on that one condition: Remember who
got us here, who forced the trial, who put the country brain-deep
in his own muck. Forgetting that is like forgetting that Judge Ito
did not kill O.J. Simpson's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton gambled the moral, political and historic
reputation of the presidency _ showing what he thought of the
office and himself.
</P>
<P>
   He lied. He lied in private and in public, with or without oath.
He lied to friends, enemies, subordinates. He proved what the
Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska once said about him _
``Clinton is an unusually good liar, unusually good.''
</P>
<P>
   If perjury aggravated by repetition is not enough, examine
damage to government. He captured and tied up the entire White
House in his lies. He lied directly to some of his government
employees, used others as shields, and kept some theoretically
ignorant so they could say sorry, we cannot inform the public.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a political and moral matter, as well as legal.
Nobody I know except senators even pretends ``nonpartisanship''
about the trial results.
</P>
<P>
   I voted for him twice _ first with great hope, the second time
because near Election Day I thought he might be better equipped
than Bob Dole. I was wrong, trapped in the remnants of old hopes
about Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict would repair the presidency and country. The
voters would for at least two years retain the political and
economic continuity so many want. The man Clinton picked would be
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, in terror of the public, say there is no
chance of a two-thirds majority for a guilty verdict, so let's quit
trying and get out of here. That is nullification of law by jury,
openly and during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Censure: The Constitution makes no place for any decision on
impeachment but guilty or not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But, atoning for my second Clinton vote by laying down my status
as a constitutional expert, temporarily, I sacrifice opposition to
censure if the move to convict fails.
</P>
<P>
   Censure must be plain and tough enough to leave a reminding bite
mark through history. In The Washington Times of Jan. 15, Jim
Guirard Jr., a Washington attorney, proposes one such. The motion
of censure, passable by simple majority, would consist of the
impeachment articles already approved by the House of
Representatives but deleting reference to trial or verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The president would not have to agree or sign _ a demand that
would guarantee insipidity. But both Houses would support and
preserve the validity of the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no punishment but history's. And deviancy would
be defined upward.

FAA ORDERS WIRING INSPECTION ON MD-11 JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration Thursday ordered
inspections of wiring and insulation in the cockpit and cabin of
all of The Boeing Co.'s MD-11 jets in the U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest FAA-ordered inspection of the widebody planes
following the crash last year of a Swissair MD-11 near Halifax,
Nova Scotia. The jet plunged into coastal waters 16 minutes after
the crew reported smoke in the cockpit. All 229 people aboard the
plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The new order affects 65 U.S.-registered MD-11s, which were
built by McDonnell Douglas. The company was acquired by Boeing in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing issued a service bulletin earlier this week suggesting
airlines inspect wiring and insulation on their MD-11s, said Boeing
spokesman Russ Young. The FAA directive makes those inspections
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. operators, which include Delta and American airlines, have
60 days to perform the inspections, make repairs and report their
findings to the FAA. The inspections will cost about $720 per
aircraft, or $46,800 total for the U.S. fleet, according to the
FAA.
</P>
<P>
   There are 174 of the jets operated worldwide. While the FAA's
orders do not apply to foreign-registered planes, their operators
frequently follow U.S. safety suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign carriers operating MD-11 aircraft include Swissair,
Varig, Japan Airlines, KLM-Royal Dutch Airlines and EVA Airways
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the cause of the Swissair accident is still unknown,
the FAA will continue to use information from the (Canadian
Transportation Safety Board's) investigation to push forward with
preventive measures that improve safety for the flying public,''
FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   She indicated there may be additional MD-11 inspections as the
investigation into the Swissair crash unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an interim action until we can determine the full
extent of any potential wiring problems on the MD-11,'' Garvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is assisting Canadian
investigators in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the NTSB recommended that airlines inspect wiring and
insulation in the cabin and cockpit of all all MD-11s. The FAA said
it was planning to order such inspections before the NTSB's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect two lighting
dimmer switches in the cockpits of MD-11 aircraft because they may
overheat and smoke, distracting the pilots. McDonnell Douglas had
issued a service bulletin suggesting the changes in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found that when brighter cockpit lighting was needed,
and thus a higher voltage required, the part sometimes overheated
and emitted a burning odor and smoke. It was ruled out as cause of
the accident, however.

 &HT;    Game helps meet our primal needs
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mix together a little sex, tribalism and religion, and you have
the makings of a great sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   Fans act the way they do because sports _ especially the Super
Bowl _ tap into a host of ancient human rites and beliefs,
psychologists say. The result is a temporary swell of emotional
solidarity. Families and communities suddenly find common bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl has become the national Bacchanalia,'' said
Dennis Perrin, author of the book, ``American Fan,'' scheduled for
release this year. ``It's a national holiday that allows everyone
to jump on the bandwagon and get carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   For most fans, the biggest hook in sports is that they get to
vicariously square off against an outside enemy, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbolic war after all, and wartime is notorious for
solidarity,'' said Dr. Neil Smelser, director of the Center for
Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole point of rooting for the home team,'' said
Dr. Paul Ramirez, a psychology professor at Long Island University
specializing in crowd and sports psychology. ``It gives you a
chance to identify with your city and your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans are territorial creatures,'' said Smelser. ``But when
there's a clear outside threat, it's very easy for those closest
together to put aside their differences and unite against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connection with a home team is only part of why a fan is a fan.
Many who attend or watch will have no geographical stake.
Psychologists say those fans are hooked because of a complex tangle
of sexual energy, ego and emotional attachment.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply put, some fans get worked up about sports because it
reminds them subconsciously of _ ahem _ another type of
extracurricular activity.
</P>
<P>
   For men, football feeds into a basic male need _ political
correctness aside _ for conflict and conquest, experts say. Unlike
women, who psychologists say tend to admire individual players, men
tend to concentrate on the team and a sense of oneness.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard fans add the element of emotional commitment. For them,
psychologists say, the team's fate is more than a game, it's part
of an ongoing relationship. And in this case, it makes no
difference whether the fan is a man or a woman, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember listening to a sportscaster talk about how his
holidays were ruined because his team lost,'' said Ramirez, who's
pulling for the Falcons. ``I think when people get depressed over a
sports event it speaks to the emotional investment they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Powder Springs resident Deniz Zoeller, 30, said she has been
going to Falcons games since she was 6 months old. And despite some
frustrating and difficult times, she said she has enjoyed being
able to express loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sitting in the stands, with 10 rows free on each
side of me,'' said Zoeller, who now takes her 4-month-old, Alex,
and 8-year-old stepson, Scotty, to games. ``But now, I can be proud
I stuck it out with them.''
</P>
<P>
   There's anther emotional element that draws fans to this year's
Super Bowl: The Falcons, kicked around for years, are the underdogs
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love underdogs,'' said Ramirez. ``Everyone enjoys
someone who wasn't supposed to make it, work this hard, and get so
far. And it's clear that if they're going to go down, they're going
to go down with a fight.''

 &HT;    Falcons bring the noise to practice
 &HT;    By Matt Winklejohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro Player Stadium doesn't create near the noise problems that
the Metrodome in Minnesota does, and the Falcons will be surrounded
by a less hostile crowd than viewed their NFC title game against
the Vikings. But they're not taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons practiced in Coral Gables with three speakers on the
field blaring loud crowd noise. Atlanta coach Dan Reeves said he
didn't know what to expect Sunday, but he added, ``Certainly, this
is an AFC city, certainly, if you get into one end zone. . . . At
least we want to have some practice in case there is some noise.
You go in anticipating you won't have a problem, but I certainly
don't want to go in without practicing. We'll hit a couple of
drills (Friday) the same way, just the way we've done when we've
been on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' two-hour practice included work on the nickel
defense and the two-minute offense. Reeves was pleased that the
team had a chance to work in slightly windy conditions, in case
there are strong breezes Sunday at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concentration was good,'' Reeves said. ``You know, you're in
the Super Bowl. You ought to be that way. Now it's the distraction
of the families coming in, and, hopefully, we'll handle that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Punt returner/wide receiver Tim Dwight practiced despite a
stomach virus. Dwight said he thinks the problems resulted from
something he ate for lunch. Reeves said, ``He didn't miss anything
but he didn't practice with his usual spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau (ankle) and tight end/fullback
Brian Kozlowski (foot) both practiced Thursday and reported no
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell -- not!
</P>
<P>
   Falcons backup running back Ken Oxendine is playing Denver
running back Terrell Davis on the scout team in practice this week
and is taking his role seriously. Oxendine even is wearing one of
Davis's actual game jerseys. The Bronco sent it to his friend, the
Falcons' Jamal Anderson, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Ken is getting his head knocked off in practice,'' tight
end O.J. Santiago said. ``Guys are zeroing in on that Broncos
jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine, who attended Virginia Tech, said Davis was his
designated ``host'' when he visited the Georgia campus in 1994.
Davis was a senior at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make some cuts like Terrell,'' said Oxendine,
who has played the opposing running back in practice all season.
``We have the same style, so it's not too hard. The (Falcons'
defense) is definitely adjusting. Some holes that were there last
week aren't there this week.''

 &HT;    Booker hoping to get the corner spot
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - Falcons cornerback Ronnie Bradford continued Thursday to
get more practice time than Michael Booker, but there still are no
guarantees who will start in Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said last week that Bradford
was likely to re-take the starting role he surrendered when he
suffered a slightly separated shoulder Dec. 27 against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   His shoulder, though, is still not exactly rock solid, which
could impact not only one of the starting cornerback spots, but
also the nickel safety spot on passing downs.
</P>
<P>
   Booker, the team's first-round draft choice, replaced Bradford
in the lineup in the Jan. 9 playoff game against San Francisco,
when Bradford dressed but didn't play at all.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the cornerback Jan. 17 against Miami, when Bradford
replaced Devin Bush as the nickel safety in passing situations.
Bush strained a hamstring a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still not 100 percent, but nobody is at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Booker, who is 6-foot-2, 203 pounds, started six games in the
regular season after Bradford (5-10, 188 pounds) strained the
medial collateral ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   There was noticeable improvement in Booker over his rookie
season, but he was erratic against both the 49ers and the Vikings.
He does, however, matchup better size-wise against Denver's Ed
McCaffrey (6-5, 215) than any other Atlanta defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, returned to practice last week and was under
the impression he was going to re-take the nickel safety job that
he held during the final 13 regular season games, and against San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But in practices Monday and Wednesday this week, his role was
limited as Bradford got most of the work in that spot while being
replaced at corner by Booker.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Fuller has been getting most of the work at nickel
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, Bush got a little more action at the nickel
safety, as it is not yet clear if Bradford's shoulder is going to
be able to withstand a game's worth of pounding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Practice went smooth, like it usually does back at (team
headquarters) in Suwanee,'' said Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan,
who will play a lot of man-to-man coverage Sunday. ''We were really
crisp even though sometimes I was getting confused by all the
different combinations we had going.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a theme Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Broncos) really do a lot of different things,'' he said.
''They move around a lot. They've got so many offensive sets, they
can confuse you.''

 &HT;    Ex-lawmakers may face delay in becoming lobbyists through
`cooling-off' proposal
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a time, doors were opened for them to breeze
freely into the House and Senate chambers, but now a 2-by-3-inch
badge limits them to the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   They are legislators turned lobbyists; no longer writing
Georgia's laws but still trying to shape them.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases, they now wield more influence from outside
the chambers than they once did inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cashing in on public service,'' said Ed Davis of the
Washington office for Common Cause, a nonprofit government watchdog
group. ``It's using your experience in public service and your
knowledge and contacts ... for the benefit of private interests and
for your own interests. There's nothing wrong with lobbying. But we
think that the public's interest is better served by having a
cooling off period.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress and 16 states have passed laws requiring waiting
periods before one-time lawmakers and top government officials can
begin lobbying their colleagues. Georgia has no such cooling-off
period, but one has been proposed. A bill drafted by State Sen.
Sonny Perdue (R-Bonaire) would require former legislators and state
officials wait at least a year before lobbying for a private
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolving door,'' Perdue said of legislators who retire
and immediately begin lobbying the Georgia Legislature. ``The
relationships one develops while you serve in this body or as a
department head, those relationships can be unfairly used.''
</P>
<P>
   In office less than three weeks, Gov. Roy Barnes has twice
turned a sharp tongue on lobbyists. The governor said members of
his staff and executive branch employees cannot accept gifts from
lobbyists, and on Wednesday took a pointed swipe at lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch those eel-skinned briefcases and alligator shoes. It's
their job to put a wedge between us and what the people want and
demand and deserve,'' Barnes said in his State of the State speech.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of the way through the 1999 session, 1,000 lobbyists
have registered, just 15 shy of the number that signed up by the
end of the 1998 General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of those registered lobbyists were once legislators or
high-ranking state officials themselves _some of them as recently
as a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some come to the hallways for the money, while others just
weren't ready to leave the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections, for example, hired former Rep.
Grace Davis, who is friends with the new chairs of the House and
Senate committees that oversee the state prison system. She was not
re-elected to represent her southwest Atlanta district.
</P>
<P>
   For two sessions, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles has
used former Rep. Carlton Colwell, who chaired the State
Institutions and Property Committee, which handles legislation
affecting the clemency panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I'm back. But it's tough to phase out of
here,'' said Bill Lee, who did not run for re-election last
November, retiring from the House where he had served 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he is an ``consultant,'' not a lobbyist, representing
Zoo Atlanta. He signed on with Joe Tanner, who was in charge of
former Gov. Zell Miller's privatization effort and a state employee
for 28 years. Tanner's list of clients is long and includes KSL
Lake Lanier, the company that won the state contract to manage the
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Republican Leader Arthur ``Skin'' Edge joined
another former legislator, Boyd Pettit, working the 1997
Legislature, the first session he was not a member. They have a
long list of clients like Egleston Children's Health Care System,
Equifax and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Edge, leaning on a wall just outside the member's entrance to
the Senate, said he quit the Legislature after serving a decade
without any ``intention to lobby. But I enjoy the process up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge said he can participate, see old friends, and still focus
on his Newnan law practice during the nine months that the
Legislature does not meet without ``the political demands'' of
elected office.

 &HT;    Georgia `Bubba' is winning votes for S.C. lottery
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As the South Carolina Senate prepares for its
final vote next week on a statewide lottery that would compete with
Georgia's, Republicans opposed to the legislation already appear
defeated by a Georgia hayseed named ``Bubba.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters met Bubba last fall when the bearded character in a
Georgia Bulldog cap and T-shirt appeared in state Democratic Party
television ads ridiculing Gov. David Beasley, a Republican who had
denounced lotteries as immoral gambling, even if proceeds would
benefit public education.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley lost to Democrat Jim Hodges, whose main campaign pledge
was to use millions of dollars in lottery proceeds to improve South
Carolina's bottom-scraping public schools. Recent Democratic
polling indicated nearly seven out of every 10 voters favored a
lottery referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubba is a folk hero,'' said Sen. Ernie Passailaigue, the
Charleston Democrat who sponsored legislation that would allow
South Carolinians to vote on erasing the state's 104-year-old
constitutional ban on lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Passailaigue contends the Republican-controlled House will be
risking a voter backlash in the Nov. 2, 2000, general election if
it derails the lottery vote when the legislation moves there. ``If
they sit around and hem and haw with it, and bog this down, they
are going to be turned out in droves,'' he said. ``Bubba is going
to be back in 2000 big time.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker David Wilkins, a Greenville Republican who opposes
the lottery, conceded Thursday that ``it is a foregone conclusion''
that legislators will schedule a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The Bubba character, played by actor Kerry Maher of Rock Hill,
S.C., was used by Hodges' supporters to point out that South
Carolinians were crossing into Georgia and spending millions a year
in that state's lottery. South Carolina Democrats estimate that
amount at $80 million or more a year, although Georgia lottery
officials don't keep exact tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Georgia, we just luuuvvv David Beasley,'' Bubba
hee-hawed in the commercial, which Democrats insist galvanized
strong but unspoken sentiment among South Carolinians who hated the
idea of their money paying for HOPE scholarships for Georgia
college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in South Carolina has a relative in Georgia who is
going to school for free,'' Passailaigue said Thursday, shortly
before the state Senate resumed debate on the lottery and scheduled
a third and final vote for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate voted 37-8 in favor of a bill that
would schedule a lottery referendum for the Nov. 2, 2000, general
election. The legislation, which requires three votes, also would
set up a referendum on whether the state should ban the $2.3
billion-a-year video poker industry. Republican senators later
expressed regret about scheduling both votes on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's top priority is establishing a lottery as early
as 2001 in hopes that it would generate $90 million for public
education and $150 million in subsequent years. He favors holding
both referendums at the same time. ``I think the people ought to
decide thumbs up or thumbs down whether or not we have the lottery
or ... video poker in the year 2000,'' he said.

EVEN A MINIVAN CAN USE SOME MOTHERING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   While serving as vehicle line director, supervising the
development of the 1999 Ford Windstar, Mary Ellen Heyde was struck
by the unusually large number of women with young children who were
working on the redesign. She thought it made sense to tap the
maternal expertise of these 30 ``Windstar Moms,'' most of them
engineers, and she consulted them routinely as the design
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of making the minivan more family-friendly, the
mothers offered suggestions for innovations and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Martha McMahon, a lead electrical systems
engineer, noted that her sleeping baby often awoke at night when a
door was opened, switching on bright overhead lights. So she
developed lighting that can be turned to ``sleeping baby mode,'' in
which the opening doors activate only footlights. These dimmer,
lower lights provide some illumination, but are less likely to
disturb sleeping infants.
</P>
<P>
   Another convenience feature is a storage bin for a diaper and
wipes in the front seat area for easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the mothers suggested cup holders that pull down from
the edge of the rear seats, where children can easily reach them
without stretching, as they must when cup holders are farther away
on the doors. That should cut down on spills.
</P>
<P>
   The door handles are designed for women's smaller hands, yet
provide ample room for jewelry and long fingernails. The manually
operated sliding doors glide smoothly in their tracks so that women
and children can open and close them better.
</P>
<P>
   The new Windstar will also be the first minivan to include a
reverse parking aid that warns drivers, with a beeping sound, if
they are close to hitting an object.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Zobel, a Windstar engineer, said that the emphasis on
comfort and convenience was bound to win over women, who account
for 75 percent of the Windstar's regular drivers. And the company,
recognizing the public appeal of mothers as designers, is featuring
some of the Windstar moms in corporate advertising that began this
month.

BUSH'S PROPOSED BUDGET TARGETS $2.6 BILLION IN TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Yielding to budgetary restraints, Gov. George W.
Bush on Thursday unveiled $2.6 billion in proposed tax cuts, a
slightly thinner package than he promoted during his re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed spending $96.4 billion on state government
during the next two years, an $8 billion increase over the current
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said his proposed budget ``meets the basic needs of
the state, makes the schools the No. 1 funding priority and sends
money back to the taxpayers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax reduction plan is close to the $2.7 billion he
promised last year. It includes a $2 billion cut in local school
property taxes; a $330 million cut in sales taxes on diapers, other
health aids, over-the-counter medicine and Internet access; and
$307 million worth of business tax credits and exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush deleted a proposal to temporarily suspend the sales tax
on children's clothing for two weeks before school starts. It would
have saved Texas consumers an estimated $97 million during the next
two years, but the governor said that so-called ``sales tax
holiday'' had ``faded'' because of a lower-than-expected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've (still) got the largest tax cut in the state's history _
$2.6 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander has told legislators
they will have an additional $5.6 billion in general revenue to
spend during the two-year budget period that begins Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposed spending increase of $8 billion includes a
projected increase in federal funds as well. Almost $28 billion of
the governor's proposed budget is federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he is prepared to negotiate with lawmakers
but, ``We're giving no tax cuts away. The people of Texas don't
want any tax cuts given away.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic senators said the governor should give a
higher priority to health care and other state needs before he
tries to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we have taken care of our responsibilities to the
citizens of Texas, then we should return the surplus to the
taxpayers,'' said state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, chairman
of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to increase state funds to the public schools by $1.6
billion during the next two years _ on top of the $2 billion that
he wants the state to reimburse districts for lower property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget director, Albert Hawkins, said changes in
state law, which are still being drafted, will be necessary in
addition to the budgetary provisions to carry out the governor's
plan to force school districts to cut their property tax rates by
an average of 13 cents for every $100 valuation.
</P>
<P>
   That would be $130 a year on a home valued at $100,000. The
reductions also would apply to business property.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said school districts would be reimbursed for their
lower tax rates with $1.55 billion in new state aid. The remaining
$450 million would be money that some districts will owe the state
because of higher-than-expected property values during the current
budget period. That money also would be distributed among school
districts to provide property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed that school districts use $1 billion of their
increased aid to raises teachers' salaries or hire more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   His budget also includes money to hire 380 new caseworkers to
investigate child abuse, expand juvenile detention facilities and
provide pay raises for prison guards, youth correctional officers,
parole officers and Department of Public Safety officers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins also responded to criticism from state Sen. John
Whitmire, D-Houston, that the governor's proposals didn't include
enough money to tackle transportation problems, particularly in
cities like Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said Bush's budget calls for a ``substantial increase''
in transportation funding, including a $700 million increase in
federal highway funds alone.

IOC BOARD THREATENS TO RESIGN

<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's executive board will quit
if its colleagues do not expel five members implicated in the Salt
Lake City payoff scandal, vice president Richard Pound of Canada
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though four members have already stepped down amid the worst
scandal in modern Olympic history, three others _ Jean-Claude Ganga
of the Republic of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali and Agustin Arroyo
of Ecuador _ have vowed to contest their expulsion before the full
115-member body in Lausanne, Switzerland in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people show up and fight and can persuade two-thirds
of the membership not to expel them, you'll have the entire
executive board resign,'' said Pound, who chaired the IOC's special
inquiry into the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member board recommended unanimously Sunday that six of
the 13 members involved be expelled. A seventh member, Charles
Mukora of Kenya, quit on Monday, and IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has urged the others to follow suit. Three additional
members _ Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea and
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast _ are still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said others could be implicated as the IOC broadens its
probe to other bid cities from other years. Samaranch has written
to the national Olympic committees from every candidate city for
the Games from 1996 to 2006, asking for evidence of further
wrongdoing by IOC members before the March special session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that requires a major exhumation,''
Pound said. ``Either these things happened or they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pound said that four or five new names could surface from
other cities, he expects that an expanded list would largely
duplicate Salt Lake's. ``I suspect a lot of the same fish were
bottom-feeding in all of the ponds,'' he said.

 &HT;    Jackets rated a preseason favorite
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Expectations for Georgia Tech baseball are the highest
this year since 1994, when the Yellow Jackets lost in the finals of
the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The top three college baseball magazines ranked Tech No. 2, No.
7 and No. 9 nationally, and league coaches chose the Jackets first
in the ACC, ahead of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Danny Hall doesn't back away from his team's potential.
``From a talent standpoint, this is the best team we've had since
1994,'' Hall said. ``We've got better (pitching) arms and more of
them than we've had in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which has been to 14 NCAA tournaments in a row, finished
last season 41-22 and advanced to the title game of the NCAA
Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets open their 1999 season today against 12th-ranked
Auburn in the Disney Baseball Blast in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Also
in the field are Oklahoma and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets, returning eight position players who started 34 or
more games, are led by senior catcher Eric McQueen, second baseman
Matthew Boggs, catcher-first baseman Bryan Prince, first baseman
Stephen Donaghey and outfielders Jason Basil and Derik Goffena.
</P>
<P>
   All-America pitcher Chuck Crowder, a senior from Mantua, Ohio,
who posted a 12-4 record and ranked third in the ACC in ERA (3.03),
leads an experienced group of starters. All-American lefty Cory
Vance and Simon Young join Crowder in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   As if that weren't enough, Tech also boasts the consensus top
recruiting class in the nation, including six players drafted in
the first nine rounds of the 1998 major league draft.
</P>
<P>
   Hall will start two new position players _ freshmen Mark
Teixeira at third base and Victor Menocal at shortstop. ``I love
their attitude,'' Hall said. ``They're very competitive and want to
be in the middle of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Tech looks on paper, Hall realizes that he's still
going to have to rely on youth to succeed. ``The key to our team
early is our freshman pitchers,'' he said. ``We've got some
upper-classmen to lead the way, but our new pitchers are going to
have to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also is counting on Goffena, Basil, Prince and Teixeira to
carry an offensive load that they weren't expected to carry last
season. ``They're going to have to knock in some runs,'' Hall said.
``We're a very good defensive team, but I'm waiting to see about
our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's schedule is tougher than in years past. It includes
Auburn, Oklahoma, UCLA, West Virginia and Georgia, along with
Florida State, Clemson, Wake Forest and the rest of the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   In the ACC regular season, Hall has finished no worse than
third, and he won the regular-season title in 1997. With all of
that success in his five years, including an overall 215-100
record, the affable coach has had little success in the ACC
tournament. Tech's last ACC tourney title came in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bothers me big time,'' Hall said. ``We have not been a
good ACC tournament team, and I don't know why.''

INDIA ORDERS INQUIRY INTO MISSIONARY'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Indian Cabinet on Thursday ordered a
judicial inquiry into the killings of an Australian Christian
missionary and his two young sons _ who were burned to death in
their van on Saturday in a tribal village _ after a team of
government ministers who visited the village said they had found no
local people with a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The police in the eastern state of Orissa, where the killings
took place, had blamed a mob they said was led by a local activist
from the Bajrang Dal, a militant Hindu youth group that is part of
the same family of Hindu nationalist organizations as the Bharatiya
Janata Party, which heads the national coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Minister George Fernandes, a Christian who led the
team of ministers from the national government, said at a news
conference that they had found no evidence that any particular
group had committed the crime, but also cited a possible political
motive. Relations between the 100 Christians and the 700 tribal
residents of Manoharpur village had been ``generally cordial,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes suggested that the killings and the outcry they
engendered might be part of a larger design by ``forces'' in the
nation and abroad to bring down the government led by Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who heads the BJP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to see that beginning from Atal Behari Vajpayee down to
the last man in the government be crucified over the issue,''
Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes, who met with residents and officials in the village
for about an hour on Wednesday, declined to identify the forces
that he said might have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the ministers' findings, Fernandes did say he had
heard complaints that the state government, which is ruled by the
opposition Congress Party, had failed to arrest the accused
ringleader of the mob, Ravinder Kumar Pal, before the crime,
despite numerous criminal complaints against him. Pal is still at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see not just a political party but I see a whole lot of
forces in this country which would like to see the government go,''
Fernandes said. ``There are forces abroad which are not prepared to
tolerate this government.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Bajrang Dal have denied any role in the deaths of
the missionary, Graham Staines, 58, and his sons, Philip, 10, and
Timothy, 6. They say that Pal is not a member of their group and
that they have no chapter in the district where the killings took
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government has come under pressure in recent months
from Western diplomats and some members of its own coalition to
stop the growing number of attacks on Christians and their places
of worship. Last year, there were 86 such cases reported to the
police, more than half of them in the western state of Gujarat.
</P>
<P>
   Christian groups say Hindu nationalist militants have been
emboldened to attack them because of the presence of a Hindu
nationalist-led government. The Hindu militants, while denying any
role in the attacks, have recently been harshly critical of what
they call Christian efforts to convert Hindus through bribes and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said the attacks on Christians, while serious, had
been blown out of proportion by Western reporters. ``I was in
France about 10 days before Staines' murder, and the only question
on everybody's lips was `What is happening to Christians in
India?''' he said. ``It had taken the place of the old questions on
snakes and cobras and elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has announced that he will fast this Saturday, on the
anniversary of the assassination of Gandhi, to promote harmony
among religious groups. His critics have called the fast a stunt to
draw attention away from his government's failure to stop the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   India's home minister, L.K. Advani, said the government had
decided to establish a judicial inquiry, led by a Supreme Court
judge, to look into the killings in part because the incident has
tarnished India's image abroad as a tolerant, secular nation. The
judge, yet to be named, will be required to report back within two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Staines killings have drawn the world's attention because
``he was a foreign national working in this country for a worthy
cause,'' Advani said. Staines, who was with the Evangelical
Missionary Society, had devoted himself to the care of lepers and
ran a hospital and clinics for them in Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since his death, national television news programs
have carried images of weeping Indians, rubbing their eyes with
hands reduced to stumps by leprosy, grieving for their lost
champion.

D.C. MAYOR CRITICIZED IN AIDE'S RESIGNATION OVER OFFENSIVE TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rap from some quarters on Anthony A. Williams,
Washington's new mayor, is that he isn't black enough. Others say
he isn't political enough. This week, Williams, a bow-tied
bureaucrat, tried to prove he is both, and now he's in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Julian Bond, the chairman of the NAACP, accused
Williams of having ``niggardly'' judgment for accepting the
resignation of David Howard, one of Williams's top aides, after
Howard used the word ``niggardly'' in a conversation about the
tight budget and offended some co-workers who thought it was a
racist remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole episode speaks loudly to where we are on the issue
of race,'' Bond said in a statement. ``Both real and imagined
slights are catapulted to the front burner. Seems to me the mayor
has been niggardly in his judgment on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam Webster's ``Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition,''
defines niggardly as ``grudgingly mean about spending or granting;
stingy.'' Niggardly is unrelated in its etymology and meaning to
the similar-sounding word that is an inflammatory racial slur.
Some, including Bond and gay leaders, believe Williams extended
political correctness too far in punishing his aide, a white man,
for saying it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, stung by the criticism, has opened an inquiry into the
incident and says he might reassign Howard, who was his director of
constituent services, to another job in his young administration.
Williams insists Howard did the right thing in resigning because
his insensitive choice of words was akin to being ``caught smoking
in a refinery that resulted in an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   But some observers think the flap says less about Howard than it
does about Williams, a soft-spoken Ivy Leaguer who was the chief
financial officer for the powerful control board set up by Congress
to manage the collapsing city during former Mayor Marion Barry's
last term. Williams won the Democratic primary for mayor by
trouncing his opponents in Washington's white wards and picking up
the votes of the city's black professional class. He breezed to
victory in November with the blessing of the business community,
and he quickly brought in an administration heavy with young, white
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Williams has an image problem,'' said Mark Plotkin, a
political analyst with WAMU, the local public radio station. ``From
the day he got here, he was viewed by some as not black enough. He
was an outsider in a black city; he was the bureaucrat who had to
fire black people from government jobs; and he won the election
because wealthy white people supported him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This made him skittish, even defensive, about the racial
issue,'' Plotkin said. ``So when faced with the Howard issue, he
took the easy way out and acted like a conventional politician.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a senior analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank, said Williams
should not have accepted Howard's resignation. Williams's success
as mayor in a multicultural city under Congress's watchful eye
depends on proving he is in charge and not carrying on Barry's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's no political Arnold Schwarzenegger, he needs to
establish himself quickly,'' Bositis said. ``He is responsible and
going to be judged for getting rid of 500,000 rats, controlling the
trigger-happy cops, mending broken schools, and fixing thousands of
potholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Washingtonians were abuzz Thursday with the
``niggardly'' story. Joe Madison, host of Newstalk Network on local
WOL radio, said it was all his listeners wanted to talk about. He
said 98 percent of them are black, and almost all were offended by
Howard's remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different cultures have different reactions to language as it
relates to race,'' Madison said. ``Black people have heard the word
`niggardly' used in a derogatory way by people who have misdefined
it. They think David Howard used poor judgment in saying the word
and he should have been a little more conscious of the impact its
sound would have on people hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Language has social consequences, said Colleen Cotter, an
assistant professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, and
the fact that ``niggardly'' sounds like a racial slur may explain
why this Middle English word of Chaucer and Shakespeare has fallen
out of common usage.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Walters, a professor of government and politics at the
University of Maryland, said Williams should not be identifying
himself with the erudite elite _ including Bond and some national
leaders _ who offer brainy dictionary definitions in the place of
common sense and political wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor better not change his tune on Howard,'' Walters
said. ``He can't pretend that Washington isn't a city that is 67
percent black where mistakes like this don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, a white elementary school teacher in Brooklyn was
threatened by a group of angry black parents, and eventually
reassigned to another school, after she read the children's book
``Nappy Hair'' to her students. The parents accused the teacher,
Ruth Sherman, of being racially insensitive. Carolivia Herron, the
black author of the book, defended the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Herron, a professor of English at Cal State-Chico,
said the reaction to Howard's remark was sad but not surprising.
Herron recently gave her mother, who lives in Washington, an
audiotape of Charles Dickens's ``David Copperfield.'' When one of
the characters spoke the word ``niggardly,'' her mother reacted
with shock and disgust, Herron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoid the word _ I never use the word _ because it causes
those kinds of problems,'' Herron said. ``It's a sad commentary,
isn't it, because the language is poorer for it.''

 &HT;    Bennett reborn as Bird
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The world has been swirling around Cornelius Bennett
this week, racing by at a breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons linebacker, who will play Sunday in his fifth
Super Bowl of the 1990s, is in some ways moving as slowly as ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, he was nearly as fast as ever, leading the team
with 121 tackles, second-most in his 12-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But when a man becomes a reborn Christian, as he did in August
1997, and swears off his hedonistic ways, change is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 33, spent 36 days in the Erie County Correctional
Facility last spring after pleading guilty to sexual misconduct
charges from May 1997 in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he takes his time when he talks, almost always
measuring his words, calculating much of what he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my life has changed, this (Super Bowl) is more special
than anything (in football),'' he said. ``I wouldn't trade anything
for those four that I played with Buffalo, don't get me wrong. But
just on a personal level, I'm seeing everything clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been given another opportunity at a career most can
only dream about. I didn't think I was going to be around because
of the offseason trouble I had. Who wants that kind of thing on the
team? Coach (Dan) Reeves could have blackballed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has said several times that Bennett has paid his debt to
society.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has never gone into detail about the May 1997 incident,
which took place after a roast for retired Bills quarterback Jim
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once ran off and hid anywhere. I did what I had to do
as a man,'' he said. ``I asked for forgiveness where needed, and I
took it to where any human being should take their troubles. I took
it to God.''
</P>
<P>
   While in jail, he also took it to his mates in misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of fans in there,'' he said. ``I was in
Buffalo, basically, and there were a lot of people who know who I
was. They were all just excited by the idea of me being around
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent most of my time in the Bible, or in chapel. There was
a lot of time to share, and a lot of guys in there were trying to
get their lives together at that particular time, just like I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has corresponded with a few of his former
``colleagues,'' but not this week. ``I've written to a couple guys,
but it's not something I want to keep going back on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the man has gone from jailbird to Dirty Bird, swearing off
alcohol, a lousy diet and other vices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him play when he was at Alabama,'' said linebacker
Henri Crockett, a second-year pro. ``Other guys all wanted to be
Walter Payton. I wanted to be Cornelius Bennett, a big guy who can
run like that and make all those plays. I just love watching him
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has been one of the most obliging players on the team.
But when he was asked at one point this season if his tackles were
decreasing because he was wearing down, he flared. ``Don't start
talking to me about ... getting old,'' he said. Earlier this week,
Bennett was preaching that the worst thing his teammates could do
would be to party too much this week, which is what the Bills did
before their Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, he got tired of seeing it all blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, he was the anti-Ray Buchanan, speaking in a
clipped voice, sipping coffee and reading between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going with these questions?'' he asked a
reporter who just arrived. ``I don't want all of what I said
misinterpreted. (Former Buffalo coach) Marv Levy was a very good
coach and a fine man. We had rules; we broke them. All this makes
him look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bennett cares now in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons beat the Broncos on Sunday, he said it will be,
in a way, for former Buffalo teammates Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Bruce
Smith and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what about (current teammate) Jessie Tuggle? He wasn't
even drafted, but he has become one of the greatest middle
linebackers to play the game,'' Bennett said. ``And (kicker) Morten
Andersen took 17 years to get here. This game is not just about me;
it's about a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said the Falcons' chances are
a lot better with Bennett, who at Buffalo played inside and outside
linebacker, defensive end and nose tackle while going to the Pro
Bowl five times.
</P>
<P>
   He can't forget a play Bennett made in Atlanta's 20-18 victory
against San Francisco in a Jan. 9 playoff game _ a play that might
have kept the Falcons' season alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using him a lot more in (pass) coverage this year, ...
and (running back) Terry Kirby was behind him, and Steve Young was
scrambling,'' Brooks said. ``He turned around and ran downfield and
knocked that pass down _ coming from 20 yards away. He turned on
the jets. He's still got the wheels to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his own admission, he's in better shape at this stage of
the season than he would have been because he has taken care of his
body. Maybe in his old lifestyle, those wheels would have had a
blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Kirby would have scored, sending the Falcons home
instead of to the Super Bowl.

 &HT;    For talkin' trash, Sharpe has no match
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _We could take you deep inside the Super Bowl, dear
reader. To the game within the game, where X meets O in a clash of
complex schematics.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what the week before is all about. It's about
such truly weighty questions as: Does Ray Buchanan wear a
Wonderbra?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying (Buchanan's) a cross-dresser.'' Pause. Snickers
and nudging comments from others at the back of the class. ``That's
what I heard,'' said Shannon Sharpe, the loose-lipped tight end.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's final meeting with the massed media, Denver's
Sharpe let go one of the great verbal carpet-bombings in Super Bowl
history. Hollywood Henderson once suggested Pittsburgh quarterback
Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell ``cat'' if you spotted him the ``c''
and the ``a.'' That was during the primitive days of smack. It now
has been raised to the level of performance art.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the worst of it was Falcons cornerback Buchanan, a
noted vocalist himself from whom an interviewer had extracted a
victory prediction early in the going.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Buchanan) goes to the Pro Bowl for the first time, and now
all of a sudden he's great,'' Sharpe vented. ``I remember last year
when the guy from the Rams had that big game. What did Isaac Bruce
do to him?'' 233 yards receiving in one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he should have done with all that money he got to sign,
he should have given half of it back, because he stole last year's
salary. He backed up to the window with a mask on and a hood and
said, `Give me my check.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, Ray only started talking this year. When he was
in Indianapolis, he didn't say anything. He never guaranteed
anything there, except that the other team was going to win, and
that he'd aid the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The material is not highbrow, nor particularly instructive. It
basically is a variation of the ``your mama's so fat'' jokes. But
such mouth-to-mouth combat has become a charming part of the Super
Bowl ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan really has no one to blame but himself. He fired the
opening salvo during the Falcons' interview session first thing
Thursday morning. He began the war he couldn't win by questioning
Sharpe's looks. Like I said, this isn't exactly a Harvard debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shannon looks like a horse. I tell you, that's one ugly dude.
... You can't tell me he doesn't look like Mr. Ed,'' Big Say Ray
opined.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad opening gambit. But no one can run long with Sharpe.
He's going to get in the last, and most, words. His mouth is an
army.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were dutifully shuttled to Sharpe by a devious
media. The response was even better than expected. Some exerpts
from Def Comedy Football follow:
</P>
<P>
   ``He said what? Now I know he couldn't be talking, with the big
teeth in his mouth. Those teeth look like dominoes in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he my friend? No. Did I ever view him as a friend? No. Did
I ever view him as an acquaintance? No. Do I like him?

<P>
   If Denver Broncos officials are fretting that commissioner Paul
Tagliabue might favor the Falcons in the Super Bowl, just to keep
peace on the homefront, they can quit worrying. Yes, the NFL's
first lady, Chan Tagliabue is a Milledgeville native. But Mrs.
Tagliabue pointed out Thursday that her brother, Charles Minter,
resides in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thrilled to see the Falcons in the Super Bowl, not because
they're from Atlanta, but because I like to see different teams in
the spotlight,'' Mrs. Tagliabue said. ''I want both teams to play
well so that we have a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tagliabue will today lead a contingent that will include
the commissioner, Jack Kemp, Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga and Hall
of Fame cornerback Mel Blount in ''Kickoff to Rebuild '99.'' The
program is part of the ''Christmas in April'' endeavor and the
group will extensively rehabilitate three low-income homes in the
West Little River section of Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tagliabue's mother, Elizabeth Minter, still lives in
Milledgeville.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION, FALCONS
</P>
<P>
   New Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick, here for a press
conference on Thursday, didn't exactly seem sold on backup
quarterback and former Georgia star Eric Zeier. ''It would be
difficult to live with a 6-foot quarterback,'' Billick said. ''He
makes plays, but . . .'' Billick didn't even try to camouflage his
ardor for Vikings backup Brad Johnson and predicted he will be with
another team in 1999. The Falcons signed Zeier to an offer sheet
last spring, but the Ravens retained his rights by matching it.
</P>
<P>
   SO LONG, TIM
</P>
<P>
   Former NFL cornerback Tim McKyer, who played two seasons in
Atlanta (1991-92), visited the media center this week and announced
that he has officially retired. ''Or to be more accurate, the NFL
retired me,'' McKyer said. The longtime veteran is less than
thrilled that no team signed him for the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   THE ZEBRAS
</P>
<P>
   The NFL on Thursday announced the game officials for Super Bowl
XXXIII. But poll of the learned group of scribes in the media
center, it's believed that none of the zebras were involved in any
of the horrid calls that marked NFL games in 1998. The crew: Bernie
Kukar (referee), Jim Daopoulos (umpire), Sanford Rivers (head
linesman), Ron Baynes (line judge), Tim Millis (field judge), Gary
Lane (side judge), Don Hakes (back judge).
</P>
<P>
   DAN THE MAN
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Dan Marino was named as the Sprint/NFL ''Man
of the Year'' for the '98 season. The annual honor is awarded to a
player for his charitable indeavors and community service. The
Dolphins star established the Dan Marino Foundation, which was
created to benefit children's charites in South Florida. He hosts
several events each year to raise money for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER SHORTS
</P>
<P>
   Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association,
noted Thursday that the league in the future will look at moving
back the date for the free agency signing period. Upshaw predicted
the '99 salary cap limit will be $57.5 million, but NFLPA estimates
typically are a bit low. . . . The league's finance committee met
with the trustees of the estate of late Washington owner John Kent
Cooke to determine if the sale of the team to Howard Milstein was
handled appropriately. . . . Former Chicago Bears offensive
coordinator Matt Cavanaugh will join the Ravens in the same
capacity

GREENSPAN WARNS THAT SOCIAL SECURITY'S FUTURE MAY STILL BE
JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
warned Congress on Thursday not to count on projected government
budget surpluses to solve Social Security's problems, and he
suggested that Republicans and Democrats would still have to cut
benefits or raise taxes to insure the retirement system's future.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan was
clearly trying to interject a dose of hard reality into the debate
over Social Security, which for the last week has centered on
President Clinton's proposal to shore up the system with $2.7
trillion out of the $4.4 trillion in surpluses the White House
anticipates in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the surplus reduces the sacrifices that would be
necessary from today's workers and tomorrow's retirees, and for
that reason Republicans too have generally endorsed allocating a
big portion of the surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has alluded in general terms to the need for measures in
addition to using the surplus but has avoided specifics, while
Republicans have been silent or called for solutions that require
neither tax increases nor benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's message on Thursday was that budget forecasts have
been notoriously unreliable in the past and are likely to remain so
in the future, making 15-year surplus projections a rickety
structure on which to base a solution to Social Security's
long-term financial gap.
</P>
<P>
   The country should be wary of assuming ``extraordinarily large
projected surpluses as far as the eye can see,'' Greenspan said.
``I use that term advisedly, because it was originally used on the
deficit side, and it was obvious that as far as the eye could see
wasn't all that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that the Congressional Budget Office had
predicted in February 1997 that the government would run a deficit
in 1998 of $121 billion. The actual outcome was a surplus of $70
billion, an error of $191 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, though, how receptive Congress will be to
Greenspan's message. Just hours after Greenspan spoke, the
Congressional Budget Office distributed a new budget forecast to
congressional leaders showing a total surplus over the next 11
years of nearly $2.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office's projections, which appeared to be roughly in
line with the $4.4 trillion, 15-year surplus projected by the White
House, show the overall surpluses mounting rapidly, from $107
billion in the current fiscal year to $381 billion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   They also include $794 billion in surpluses over the eight years
starting in 2001 that would not rely on excess payroll taxes that
are nominally earmarked for Social Security _ in other words a true
surplus derived from annual spending being lower than annual
revenues from general tax collections. Republicans have been
counting on the emergence of a true surplus to finance their plans
for an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the overall surpluses materialize and are not used
for new spending programs, Greenspan said, Clinton's strategy of
using the surplus to bolster Social Security by paying down the
national debt is the soundest policy option available.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the debt held by the public would be the best way to
strengthen the economy in the long run, Greenspan said, and would
make it easier for the country to cope with the financial strains
that will be created by its aging population.
</P>
<P>
   But given the risk that a downturn in the economy or the stock
market could cause the surpluses to evaporate, Greenspan said,
Congress and the administration need to keep looking for ways to
increase the amount of money available for Social Security or to
decrease benefit payments. Greenspan led a commission in the early
1980s that pushed through both tax increases and benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Raising taxes now or altering the Social Security system to
require increased savings and investment through private accounts
might prove too politically ``burdensome,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, the country would have to examine a long
menu of potential benefit cuts. These might take the form of
increasing the age for retirement, reducing cost-of-living
increases or making less generous the formula used to calculate
lifetime earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considerations such as these should not be taken off the
table,'' Greenspan said.

   In his State of the Union address last week, Clinton said his
plan, which also called for the government to invest a portion of
Social Security's reserves in the stock market, would keep the
system afloat until 2055, compared with 2032 if no changes are
made.
</P>
<P>
   But the benchmark for financial health in Social Security is
solvency for 75 years, and Clinton acknowledged that the two
parties would have to ``to make hard-headed but sensible and
achievable choices'' to meet that goal.
</P>
<P>
   He did not lay out the possibilities, much less endorse any of
them, and most Republicans have avoided the subject altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Greenspan's comments, Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary, said the administration ``could not agree with him
more'' about the need for further bipartisan steps to insure the
system's solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to reserving the surplus and paying down the debt,
we need to do more to reform the system,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior House Republican aide said the issue was a ``crucial
question'' facing both parties and was part of a broader debate
over whether Congress and the administration should settle for a
partial solution on Social Security and defer the hard choices for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Before it became apparent that the budget surplus could ease
much of the pain of addressing Social Security's woes, the two
parties had been circling warily around a variety of options.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had ruled out increasing the 12.4 percent payroll tax
rate _ split equally between workers and their employers _ that
finances Social Security. But liberal Democrats were advocating
other ways of increasing revenues, including an increase in the
wage level subject to the payroll tax, currently $72,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, have been adamant that they will not
accept any kind of tax increase. They have been more open to other
options, including an increase in the retirement age, which is
already scheduled to rise gradually to 67 over the next several
decades. But organized labor has promised a ferocious effort to
block any further increase in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony on Thursday came as Republicans continued
to question whether Clinton's plan to use the surplus for Social
Security was anything more than an accounting gimmick. And it came
as members of both parties are increasingly pessimistic that there
will be enough bipartisan trust in the aftermath of the impeachment
trial for Congress and the administration to reach a deal on Social
Security.

SENATORS ARGUE OVER HOW TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT REMOVING
HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the prospects of President Clinton's removal
from office all but gone, Senate Democrats and Republicans on
Thursday began arguing about how to say that he still did something
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are pushing the idea of a ``finding of facts''
resolution that would ask senators to acknowledge that Clinton
committed perjury and obstructed justice. If the proposal passed,
the Senate would take a second vote, while the trial is still in
session, on whether to remove Clinton, a vote all but certain to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats prefer a formal resolution of censure that would
harshly reprimand Clinton for his conduct without mentioning or
describing specific felonies.
</P>
<P>
   However they resolve this argument, most senators seem intent on
seeing the trial through to the end, with a vote on the articles of
impeachment, although Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has talked of
offering a motion to end the trial by adjourning it without a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, neither resolution may ever reach the floor.
Republicans scorn censure as a meaningless political ploy.
Democrats fault ``findings of fact'' as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is for politicians,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
``Censure is to give political cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president is found not guilty, the president is found
not guilty,'' Gramm added. ``They want it both ways. The art of
politics, I know, is the art of having it both ways. But with this
thing, you can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate voted against dismissing the
impeachment charges and to summon three witnesses for depositions.
But since both votes fell far short of a two-thirds majority, most
senators are now convinced that the president will not face the
highest penalty _ removal from office. As a result, pressure is
mounting for some sort of formal denunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
appointed a six-person task force to examine the ``finding of
facts'' idea. The proposal would ask the Senate to ``find'' that
the facts in the case, as presented to them by House managers, are
true, namely that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice.
Most Republicans say the proposal has piqued their curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea, which is being spearheaded by Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., faces a series of
obstacles. On Thursday, it became a topic of contention as both
sides tried to reach agreement on trial procedures. Republicans
left open the door for a ``finding of facts'' resolution, something
Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are already dubbing the proposal, which is tougher
than censure, ``a third article of impeachment,'' and remain almost
unanimously opposed to the idea. The White House, too, finds it
altogether objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I read that the findings were going to include
`offenses,' that was the word of the sponsor,'' said Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich. ``It seems to me that just complicates and confuses
an impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republicans appeared lukewarm, if not outright
opposed, to the idea. They say they have serious reservations about
its constitutionality. ``The Constitution doesn't say anything
about a bifurcated finding, in other words _ finding somebody
guilty and then not ousting them,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala. ``Basically, if you find that he did all these things under
the impeachment law, you ought to vote aye for conviction. If you
are doubtful about the burden of proof, or whether these are
impeachment offense, you ought to vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sponsors, who have been meeting regularly with
Republican leaders, say they are being careful to keep the proposal
on firm constitutional ground by avoiding words like guilty, which
goes hand in hand with conviction and removal. ``The finding of
fact does not equal the guilty or not guilty vote that is required
on the articles,'' said Brooke Simmons, a spokesman for Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is finalizing a
censure resolution of her own, which has attracted the support of
about a dozen senators, including one Republican, Sen. Robert
Bennett of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Feinstein said in an interview on Thursday that her
resolution, envisioned as a stern reprimand, would not require
House approval or the signature of Clinton, freeing it from
concerns over its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, she said, ``is a statement based on wrongful and
willful misconduct'' which describes the impact the misconduct has
brought ``to the office of the president, to himself and to the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be some who would not support it,'' Mrs. Feinstein
acknowledged. ``I don't know why. I don't see how anybody could
find the conduct acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Democrats support a resolution of censure, which
would be brought to the floor after the trial's conclusion and
would require a simple majority to pass, others remain
uncomfortable with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution doesn't provide for that,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla. ``It says that Congress has one means of sanctioning
the president, and that is removal, but you don't have the option
of keeping the president in place and throwing mud on him.

AGENCY SETTLES CASE OF SEXUALLY ABUSED BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A private agency that placed a troubled girl in a
foster home where she allegedly sexually abused the family's
11-year-old son, Thursday settled with the family for what sources
said was roughly $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys involved in the negotiations said the sum was
confidential. But sources familiar with the case said the agency _
Mentor, Inc., with which the state contracts to find foster homes _
agreed to the cash payment and issued an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The apology was for any negligence Mentor, Inc. showed when
seven years ago when it placed a 15-year-old girl in a home where
she repeatedly forced or coerced an 11-year-old boy into sex. The
girl became pregnant with the boy's child.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is witholding the name of the girl because she was a
teen when the alleged offenses took place.
</P>
<P>
   The case, full of finger-pointing and contradictions,
highlighted the lingering effects of sexual abuse, the complicated
bureaucracy of social service agencies that struggle to place
foster children and the rights of foster parents to be forewarned
about potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a success,'' said Traver Clinton Smith, an attorney for
the foster family, who lived in Duxbury at the time. ``Our job was
to show, not that these incidents took place, but that she never
should have been placed in that home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Social Services was also named in the lawsuit,
but the agency was able to show that Mentor, Inc. had agreed to
take full responsibilty for the girl, whose case file specified she
should be placed, ``where there are no young males residing.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl had a long history both as a victim of sexual abuse and
as a perpetrator of sexual abuse on younger children, both sides
agreed. Thursday's settlement was reached after a little more than
four days of testimony in front a Suffolk County Superior Court
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is now a 20-year-old college student who hopes to become
a Massachusetts State police officer. Broad-shouldered and
clean-cut, he bowed his head and cried during testimony this week
from his sister that he was transformed from a happy-go-lucky kid
to a withdrawn, forlorn boy.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was 11 when the incidents of sexual abuse allegedly
occurred, the Globe has agreed to withhold his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young at the time,'' he said, talking to reporters
outside the courtroom Thursday. ``It would happen frequently.'' He
said he did not tell his mother about the sex until the day she
caught the pair kissing atop a stairwell, and ordered the girl out
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled teenage girl, now a mother of a 6 year-old,
testified Thursday that she would frequently visit the 11-year-old
boy's room in the early morning hours, or invite him to hers. She
said she considered it a romantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had attempted to show that foster mother was
neglectful for having occasionally left the pair alone.
</P>
<P>
   A former Mentor Inc. case worker, Frank Fitzgerald, testified
that he warned the foster mother that the girl had a traumatic past
and might be sexually aggressive. The foster mother says she was
denied crucial information.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was unclear who in the agency was responsible for
knowing that a staffer at St. Vincent's Home for Children had
recommended she should not be in a home with boys. Fitzgerald said
upon cross-examination that he would not have gone along with the
placement had he been aware of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand Thursday, the former foster teen told the court
that she believed her foster parents were aware that the two young
people shared a sexual relationship. But the plaintiffs scoff at
the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the foster mother and her son have visited with
the baby girl and her mother several times, although they say it is
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wondered about the child,'' said the foster mother,
who has a long history of taking in troubled children. ``But I had
mixed feelings'' about whether to visit, ``because of how she came
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The family says they waited seven years to file a lawsuit
detailing their pain and suffering because they were worried about
their son's privacy and warned by prosecutors that criminal charges
would result in a public trial. The foster mother also said she did
not expect much sympathy from the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt that if he had been a girl (who was raped)
rather than a boy,'' the courts and a public would be more
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Inc. continues to be a service provider to the state. The
foster mother acknowledged in interviews that she had received
dozens of successful placements from them prior to November 1990.
Attempts to reach agency officials Thursday were unsucessful.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After an extraordinary personal appeal from Pope
John Paul II, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a supporter of capital
punishment, commuted the death sentence of a convicted murderer on
Thursday to a sentence of life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said his decision was a one-time event and a
tribute to the pope rather than ``a signal'' that he had changed
his mind on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to say I was moved by his concern for this
prisoner,'' Carnahan said in an interview Thursday afternoon in
Washington, D.C., shortly before he was to receive an award from a
meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. In a statement, he added:
``I continue to support capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision came one day after the pope concluded a
brief pastoral visit to St. Louis, during which he preached a
homily that included the strongest condemnation of the death
penalty he has made on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   After his final public event, a prayer service at St. Louis'
Roman Catholic Cathedral, the pope approached Carnahan, a Southern
Baptist, who was seated in a front pew, and, the governor said,
``asked me to show mercy'' to Darrell Mease, who was scheduled to
be executed on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a 64-year-old Democrat serving his second term, has
approved 26 executions since taking office in 1993. He said he had
commuted one other death sentence, that of a prisoner he described
as being ``very retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mease owed his life to a chance event, Carnahan said,
``You may wish to call it that. It is the coincidence of the pope
being there, taking a personal interest in him, making a personal
request that I chose to respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Catholic Conference, which handles social
policy for the American bishops, said they could think of no
previous instance in which a direct appeal from a pontiff had
persuaded an American governor to grant clemency to a death row
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II issued an unsuccessful plea last year on behalf of
a condemned Texas prisoner, Karla Fay Tucker, who had become a
born-again Christian while in prison. In 1987, he spoke out on
behalf of an Indiana woman, Paula Cooper, who was sentenced to die
for a murder she committed when she was 15. Her sentence was later
overturned by an Indiana court and she is serving a life sentence
for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, a nonprofit research organization in
Washington, said it was ``certainly unusual'' for an elected
official to respond favorably to a religious leader's request for
clemency for a condemned prisoner. ``The clemencies themselves are
rare, about one or two a year since the death penalty was restored
in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty
constitutional in 1976, 510 prisoners have been put to death, with
the greatest number of executions taking place in Texas, Virginia,
Florida and Missouri, respectively, Dieter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mease's lawyer, Laura Higgins Tyler, said she was
``ecstatic'' over Carnahan's decision, Jim Justice, who prosecuted
the case, said he was disappointed by it, although he said he
respected the governor's right to make it. Describing himself as a
``strong Christian,'' Justice said he believed all things happen
for a reason. ``If the pope would've come two weeks earlier, it
would have been the previous guy,'' he said, referring to another
death row inmate who was executed. ``It just happened to be
Darrell, and I guess there's a reason for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's decision brings a dramatic end to a controversy that
had shadowed preparations for John Paul's two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Mease, 42, was convicted of the 1988 ambush slaying of a Taney
County couple, Lloyd Lawrence, 69, and his wife, Frankie, 56, along
with their disabled grandson William, 19. Mease, who killed the
trio with a 12-gauge shotgun as they rode all-terrain vehicles near
their rural Taney County farmhouse, alleged that the senior
Lawrence had been his former partner in a drug-manufacturing
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Mease had been scheduled for execution Wednesday at 12:01 a.m.,
while the pope was in St. Louis. But shortly after setting that day
last November, the Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation,
re-scheduled the execution for Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action drew strong praise from Bishop Joseph
Fiorenza, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
the organization that represents the American prelates. ``The Holy
Father's plea for one man's life, someone who has been convicted of
having done great evil, reflects the church's concern for all human
life,'' Fiorenza, spiritual leader of the Galveston-Houston Diocese
in Texas, said in a statement. ``We oppose the death penalty not
just for what it does to those guilty of heinous crimes, but for
what it does to all of us; it offers the tragic illusion that we
can defend life by taking life.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show, however, that most Catholics do not agree with this
position, but rather support the death penalty by a roughly 2-1
margin. In this way, they do not differ much from other Americans
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pambianco, chief policy counselor at the Washington Legal
Foundation, a public interest law and policy center that supports
the death penalty, criticized Carnahan's decision because of the
nature of Mease's crime. ``It's exactly the sort of crime that the
death penalty was intended for,'' Pambianco said. In granting
clemency, he added, Carnahan was ``undermining the death penalty's
deterrent role, because he's weakening the consistency of the
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pope's intervention on behalf of Mease unfolded rapidly on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning Mass attended by an estimated 100,000 people,
he called on Catholics to be ``unconditionally pro-life,'' a stance
in which he included opposition to the death penalty. ``Modern
society has the means of protecting itself without definitively
denying criminals the chance to reform,'' the pope said. He called
for ``a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary
of state, who was traveling with the pope, invited Carnahan to an
afternoon meeting at the residence of St. Louis Archbishop Justin
Rigali. ``The governor was asked to come to my residence, precisely
to discuss this case, and he very graciously agreed,'' said Rigali,
who also attended, along with Joaquin Navarro Valls, the pope's
chief spokesman. Carnahan was accompanied by Joe Bednar, his chief
legal counsel, and Angie Heffner, another state legal counsel.
Rigali said the meeting lasted 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Carnahan attended the interfaith prayer service with his
wife, Jean, sharing a front pew with Vice President Al Gore Jr. and
Tipper Gore. The service ended about 6 p.m., after which the pope
stepped away from the altar and came forward, blessing some
children, speaking to local religious leaders, then greeting Gore.
``And then he stopped and talked to me and asked me to show mercy
to Mease,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an unusual circumstance, having a papal visit in St.
Louis,'' Carnahan said. ``It was a very high and emotional event in
itself. And the pope, during his time there, to show particular
interest in this individual, to seek me out to discuss that,
through his secretary of state and then personally, moved me very
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, the governor's spokesman, said Carnahan made up
his mind to commute Mease's sentence at about 9 p.m. Wednesday
night, shortly after the pope had departed on a return flight to
Rome. He signed the commutation order Thursday morning, Sifford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, the former Taney County prosecutor, said the governor's
office called him for his opinion Wednesday before Carnahan reached
a decision. ``I told them I felt when I prosecuted the case that it
was a death penalty case and I still think that,'' he said. He
added that he had prosecuted 20 murder cases and sought the death
penalty only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyler, Mease's attorney, said she called her client at the
state correctional center in Potosi to share the news. ``He felt
much like I did, overwhelmed, grateful to the pope and to the
governor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lexie Mease, Mease's mother, said, ``Oh, there are just no words
to describe how thankful and happy we are!'' She also said she had
been expecting news like this since her son's sentencing. ``I've
been listening and looking for it and today it came,'' said Mrs.
Mease, 71. ``We knew God was on Darrell's side and God is the best
lawyer you can get. He's never lost a case.''

IN A COMPLICATED QUARTER, RJR EARNINGS SIMPLY DECLINE

<P>
   Buoyed by the improving fortunes of its cookie and cracker
business but battered by the cost of tobacco-related litigation,
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. posted fourth-quarter earnings Thursday
of 58 cents a share, 9 percent lower than a year ago, excluding
unusual charges.
</P>
<P>
   With the charges, however, the company reported a net loss of
$1.83 a share, mostly stemming from $780 million in
tobacco-settlement payments and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought the Hubble Telescope was complicated, you
should take a look at RJR's fourth quarter,'' said Emanuel Goldman,
an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, RJR lost $585 million, compared with a loss of
$197 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the
quarter fell 2.5 percent, to $4.47 billion from $4.58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, the company's earnings declined 23 percent,
to $2.10 vs. $2.72 a year ago, without the unusual charges.
Including the one-time charges, the company had a net loss of $1.91
a share, up from $1.03 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of RJR's stock were unchanged Thursday at $27.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Salomon Brothers, called
the quarter ``reasonably good for the company.'' Most noteworthy,
he said, was that without spending much on promotions, RJR's share
of the cigarette market eroded just 0.2 percent, from 25.4 percent
to 25.2 percent. ``RJR's advertising and promotional expenditure
had been less than Philip Morris','' he said, ``yet it essentially
managed to stabilize its market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Income from the company's U.S. tobacco business rose 25 percent
in the fourth quarter, largely because of a 20 percent, or 45 cents
a pack, price increase that RJR and other cigarette companies
imposed in November, shortly after the $206 billion tobacco
settlement was approved by 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales of brands like Winston and Camel increased 15 percent,
to $1.5 billion, despite the price increase, although volume
declined 9 percent. For the full year, tobacco profits rose 7
percent, to $1.62 billion, the company said. Volumes for major
brands were down slightly, although the company said inventories
had been unusually high in anticipation of the tobacco settlement,
resulting in less demand in the fourth quarter from wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   International tobacco was disappointing for the company. While
sales in Western Europe and Japan were steady, sales in Russia and
other emerging markets fell. In Russia, sales volume grew 7
percent, but income fell because consumers traded down to cheaper
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a global shrinkage of 5 percent in the high margin
brands,'' Feldman said. Net sales of tobacco overseas fell 10
percent, to $3.07 billion, the company said, and earnings from
international tobacco fell 30 percent, to $468 million.
</P>
<P>
   Profits on RJR's food business _ brands like Ritz crackers, Oreo
and Mallomar cookies and Grey Poupon mustard _ fell significantly,
largely because of reorganization costs and increased marketing
expenses to drive sales. Earnings from the cookie-and-cracker
division were down 29 percent, the company said, at $143 million
compared with $202 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, market shares rose, for the first time since late 1996,
the company said. Sales of cookies and crackers were up 4 percent,
and sales of the company's food products altogether were up 3
percent for the year, at $2.05 billion.
</P>
<P>
   International food sales fell 4 percent, to $677 million in the
quarter vs. $707 million a year ago. But earnings in the
international division rose 5 percent, mostly because of lower
costs in Brazil and Argentina, the company said.

 &HT;    Panda pairings? Zoo officials hoping so
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that they've pulled off a major zoo coup, the main
concern for folks at Zoo Atlanta is whether they can teach
Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun to make love love.
</P>
<P>
   In a festive ceremony Thursday at the 40-acre animal park, zoo
officials announced they'd signed a deal to bring two rare giant
pandas from China for a 10-year study aimed at finding out why the
black-and-white creatures have such a hard time mating in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   As employees passed out Chinese fortune cookies and panda plush
toys, zoo director Terry Maple, wearing a panda necktie, enthused
about plans for Yang-Yang, the male, and Lun-Lun, the female. He
thinks bringing the 2-year-old animals to Atlanta might help save
the species, one of the planet's most endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo executives elsewhere _ and Maple, too _ likened the
agreement to the deal two decades ago that brought the ``Treasures
of Tutankhamen'' exhibit to the United States for a tour.
</P>
<P>
   As bulldozers flattened land to build a $10 million panda
habitat, Maple said his other big concern is how to handle the huge
crowds expected when the public is allowed to see the pandas up
close, probably in October. ``That's really going to be a zoo,'' he
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's hopes of breeding the pandas are critical, he told a
large crowd of patrons and a delegation of scientists from China.
There are three other pandas in the United States, two at the San
Diego Zoo and another at the National Zoo in Washington. Only about
1,000 are believed alive, including about 100 in captivity. China
is their only native habitat. Other zoos have tried to breed
pandas, but with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo expects more than 1 million patrons to visit the exhibit
in the first year, a significant increase over normal attendance.
In fiscal year 1997-98, 823,984 people visited Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There's good reason for optimism. When pandas were lent to the
Toledo Zoo in 1988, attendance zoomed to 1.3 million, from 800,000
in most years, said Nancy Foley, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lines. We had people waiting to see them. It wasn't
just the community. It drew from Chicago and all over.
Attendance-wise, there's nothing better in a zoo than pandas,''
Foley said. ``I definitely plan to come see them myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo will send at least $1 million a year to China to help
scientists there with panda conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Maple and fellow scientists Rebecca Snyder and Megan Reinertsen,
like him psychologists at Georgia Tech, suspect pandas don't mate
in captivity because they're taken away from their mothers far too
soon _ as early as 4 months old. Chinese researchers are reluctant
to adopt this theory. In the wild, it's normal for pandas to live
with their mothers for two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that young pandas learn mating skills by watching their
parents' lovemaking _ they don't, Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   But by yanking them away from other of their species, Snyder
said, they become depressed, even sullen, and apparently too shy to
form close relationships with other pandas when they reach mating
age at 4 to 7. Maple said he hopes Yang Yang and Lun Lun will learn
to like each other. Really like each other, enough, eventually, to
make some itty-bitty giant pandas. ``They will grow up here to be
breeding pandas in the same way as Willie B., so that they'll
become prime breeders when they go back to China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willie B., a 40-year-old gorilla, didn't sire his first
offspring until he was 36, but apparently learned to like the
process. He's the father of three females and one male and is one
of the biggest hits at Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   By living together, Maple hopes the pandas will gain the
confidence required to do what should come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what's going on in their minds,'' Snyder
said. ``Hopefully Lun-Lun's association with Yang-Yang will help
socialize them.''
</P>
<P>
   Their habitat will feature indoor and outdoor amenities designed
to simulate their native land. Outside, there will be rocks, pools
and places to climb and get some shade. The 1,674-square-foot
indoor quarters will include holding areas out of public view as
well as two climate-controlled indoor exhibits and storage space
for lots of bamboo, the pandas' preferred food. It will contain
three porches and a private ``cubbing'' den where Maple hopes the
pandas will make whoopee, or at least entertain such thoughts. The
pandas will have plenty of time to become good friends before
they'll be expected to go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two of the most lively pandas that you will ever
know,'' Maple said like a proud pop as a video played on a nearby
screen, showing the two cubs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said the deal represents ``probably the most
important project that Zoo Atlanta has ever undertaken. ``We're
really excited,'' Maple said. ``We're thrilled. We like running the
zoo for the public. But what really gets us excited as animal
people is when we can save an animal, when we can teach the world
about animals, and when we can study them and observe them. And
this project has all those features.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta has been sending researchers for two years to
China's Chengdu Zoo and the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda
Breeding. Maple said Chinese researchers will be coming to Atlanta,
and he and his colleagues returning there, on a regular basis. The
pandas are on loan, and part of a research project involving Zoo
Atlanta scientists and researchers in China and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, the zoo will raise $4 million for the China-based
panda research program, $2 million for Zoo Atlanta's International
Giant Panda Scientific Breeding Center in Chengdu and $5 million
for conservation and education programs in Georgia. That phase
won't be completed until December 2007.

YAHOO TO PAY $5 BILLION FOR GEOCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The red-hot market for Internet companies has just gotten even
hotter, as the leading search service Yahoo Inc. agreed to plunk
down $5 billion of its stock to acquire GeoCities, whose technology
lets people publish pages on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the GeoCities community of 3.2 million members to Yahoo's
vast audience could create the single most popular destination on
the Internet, surpassing the current industry leader, America
Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, what you get is a superbrand,'' said Bruce Zanca,
a spokesman for California-based GeoCities.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of Internet mergers, many of them worth billions of
dollars, have been announced in recent months as companies jockey
for audience and market position in the new media industry. The
merger wave has been fueled by the sky high values of Internet
stocks, which are used as currency in many of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the investors basking in the afterglow of the
Yahoo-GeoCities deal is CMGI Inc., an Andover, Mass. company that
owns about 27 percent of GeoCities. CMGI bought its stake less than
$6 million in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yahoo stock closed up $31 7/8 at $367 1/4 on the
Nasdaq exchange, making CMGI's investment worth $948 million. ``Now
we're the proud owner of just under 3 percent of Yahoo,'' said Bill
White, president of CMGI's Internet business group. White added
that CMGI has every intention of hanging on to its Yahoo shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ullas Naik , an Internet analyst for First Albany Corp. in
Boston, called the Yahoo-GeoCities deal ``another validation of
CMG's strategy.'' The company has made strategic investments in a
wide range of Internet companies, including a 23 percent stake in
the Internet service Lycos Inc., a Waltham, Mass. company that
gained $11 5/8 on Thursday's news, closing at $123 1/8 on the
Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As its competitors have rushed to merge, speculation has
increased that Lycos will have to find a merger or investment
partner. The company says it intends to stay independent, but is
searching for strategic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' vice president of network strategies, Bo Peabody, in an
interview with the Reuters news service, said the Yahoo deal
demonstrates the value of Lycos strategy. Over the past year, Lycos
has leaped into the first rank of Internet firms by purchasing a
number of popular Web sites and weaving them into a network.
Peabody said that Yahoo's purchase of GeoCities is an attempt to
emulate the Lycos approach. ``One of our goals was to make Yahoo
sweat,'' he said, ``and we've clearly accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa Bane, an analyst for the Yankee Group in Boston,
said that Yahoo isn't interested in Lycos' network model, in which
each Lycos Web site has a different look and feel. Instead, Bane
said Yahoo would integrate GeoCities into its existing services, in
an effort to drive an ever greater number of visitors to the main
Yahoo site.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Internet sector benefited Thursday from the deal. The
Nasdaq stock index soared to a record close of 2,477.34, with help
from a host of on-line stocks. GeoCities' own shares skyrocketed to
$117 1/4, a gain of $42 1/4. Infoseek Corp., another Web portal,
gained $12 1/2 to close at $83 15/16. Meanwhile, on the New York
Stock Exchange, AOL closed up $8 15/16 at $174 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will swap about one-third
of a share of its stock for each outstanding GeoCities share or
stock option. GeoCities has about 40.3 million outstanding shares
and options; these will be exchanged for about 13.6 million Yahoo
shares and options, valuing GeoCities at about $5 billion, based on
Thursday's closing price for Yahoo. The deal is expected to close
in three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal of most Internet companies is to attract the
maximum number of viewers, so that companies will pay handsomely to
advertise at the site. According to the market research firm Media
Metrix Inc., Yahoo was in third place in December, with 48.2
percent of the entire Internet audience visiting Yahoo during the
month. Sites run by Microsoft Corp. did slightly better at 48.4
percent, while AOL sites held a solid lead at 54.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo officials said that GeoCities would deliver 10
percentage points of additional audience share, putting Yahoo at 58
percent. That could be enough to make Yahoo the Internet's No. 1
site. It could also help to stave off the fierce challenge from
Lycos, which has gone from below 20 percent reach a year ago to
46.5 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo chief operating officer Jeff Mallett admitted that the
GeoCities move was partly inspired by the aggressive expansion of
Lycos. ``They shocked people,'' he said. But he still believes that
Lycos will remain ``a mid-tier player'' among the major Web
services, with Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL vying for dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's Mallett downplayed his firm's chances of passing
AOL. He noted that AOL would complete its acquisition of Netscape
Communications Corp. this year. The audience from Netscape's
Netcenter service should once again give AOL the biggest Web
audience, Mallet noted.

IOC BOARD THREATENS TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's executive board will quit
if its colleagues do not expel five members implicated in the Salt
Lake City payoff scandal, vice president Richard Pound of Canada
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though four members have already stepped down amid the worst
scandal in modern Olympic history, three others _ Jean-Claude Ganga
of the Republic of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali and Agustin Arroyo
of Ecuador _ have vowed to contest their expulsion before the full
115-member body in Lausanne, Switzerland in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people show up and fight and can persuade two-thirds
of the membership not to expel them, you'll have the entire
executive board resign,'' said Pound, who chaired the IOC's special
inquiry into the bidding process for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member board recommended unanimously Sunday that six of
the 13 members involved be expelled. A seventh member, Charles
Mukora of Kenya, quit on Monday, and IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch has urged the others to follow suit. Three additional
members _ Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea and
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast _ are still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said others could be implicated as the IOC broadens its
probe to other bid cities from other years. Samaranch has written
to the national Olympic committees from every candidate city for
the Games from 1996 to 2006, asking for evidence of further
wrongdoing by IOC members before the March special session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that requires a major exhumation,''
Pound said. ``Either these things happened or they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pound said that four or five new names could surface from
other cities, he expects that an expanded list would largely
duplicate Salt Lake's. ``I suspect a lot of the same fish were
bottom-feeding in all of the ponds,'' he said.

SUIT SAYS CANADA IMPORTED TAINTED BLOOD FROM U.S. INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ark.)  (bl) 
By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A group of Canadians who claim they were infected by
tainted blood products collected from prisoners in the United
States filed a $660 million lawsuit Thursday against the Canadian
government and several private companies for failing to adequately
safeguard the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit charges Ottawa with neglect for failing to
keep out blood plasma collected in Arkansas prisons in the early
1980s after health officials in the United States had already
determined that using such products was ``imprudent'' because there
was a high risk of infection. At the time there was no test to
indicate the presence of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Red Cross had stopped collecting plasma from
inmates in Canadian prisons in the early 1970s, because of
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the suit filed in the Ontario Court of Justice
in Toronto on Thursday is a commercial blood broker in Montreal
that imported the prison plasma, its U.S. associates and the
Toronto laboratory that used the plasma to manufacture a medication
called clotting factor that hemophiliacs need to control their
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about it in the papers, I was just appalled,''
said Michael McCarthy, 39, a hemophiliac from Sebringville,
Ontario, who used clotting factor in the early 1980s that contained
tainted plasma from Arkansas. McCarthy is lead plaintiff in the
suit, which seeks compensation for about 1,000 hemophiliacs who
contracted hepatitis C from 1980 to 1985. ``There has to be some
questions asked about the role of some people who allowed this
activity to continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's lawsuit is the latest development in a long and
painful episode involving the deaths or infections of thousands of
Canadians who received tainted blood from a number of sources in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government established a panel to investigate the
scandal. In its report in December 1997, the panel laid out a long
list of mistakes, oversights and careless procedures that allowed
the infections to spread though the population.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Canadian Red Cross has been forced to declare
bankruptcy and has been removed from the direct collection of
blood. Thousands of Canadians who contracted AIDS from tainted
blood between 1986 and 1990 and their families have already been
compensated by the government. Thousands more who have hepatitis C
or who were infected before 1986 are demanding government
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The prisons were not the only suspected source of tainted blood
but the disclosure that suspect blood from American inmates had
infiltrated Canada has stirred outrage here since it was first
revealed during hearings by the blood panel in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to the panel's final report, blood plasma that never
should have been collected from certain inmates at the Cummins
prison at Grady, Ark., was shipped to Canada in 1983 even though
all American blood processors by then refused to accept prison
blood products.
</P>
<P>
   John Byus, administrator of medical services for the Arkansas
prison for 21 years, said there is no question the plasma should
never have been collected from the inmates who had tested positive
for hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he does not think that Arkansas is responsible for
what happened in Canada. ``No I don't think that we have any
involvement,'' he said. ``But do I feel like we did anything wrong?
Yes, there were errors.'' Arkansas had one of the largest plasma
collection programs of any prison system in the United States,
producing 300 to 500 units of plasma every weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting plasma is more complicated than collecting whole
blood. A unit of blood drawn from a donor is put into a centrifuge.
The plasma then is spun off, leaving the rest to be returned to the
donor. The plasma is used to manufacture various products,
including the clotting factor that hemophiliacs need because of a
deficiency caused by their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Byus said the Arkansas plasma collection program, which
continued until 1994, was a way for inmates to earn from $7 to $10
for each donation. But Food and Drug Administration inspectors
regularly recorded problems with the way the program was handled.
And despite controls, inmates who should have been prevented from
taking part were accepted, probably because they bribed or offered
favors to other inmates who administered the program, Byus said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, before a definitive test to detect the AIDS
virus was available, the presence of hepatitis B was considered a
strong indicator of AIDS. The prison regularly sold plasma to
Continental Pharma Cryosan Inc., a blood broker in Montreal that
sold blood products around the world. At least 72 units of
questionable plasma collected from five Arkansas inmates in 1982
and 1983 were sold to the Montreal company.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Terance Mathis used the
Super Bowl stage to reveal his past problems with alcohol. Mathis
said he feels better after speaking openly about his drinking for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to open up that closet door and let that demon run
out,'' Mathis said. ``I was not a alcoholic. I had a drinking
problem. Only three or four people knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who surprised his teammates with the admission, said he
decided to get help and come clean because of his obligation as a
role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want some kid to see me drinking and he starts to do
it and something bad happens,'' Mathis said. Last stop for Reeves
Atlanta coach Dan Reeves says he isn't sure how much longer he will
coach but says the Falcons are his last team.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do I want to coach? It really hasn't crossed my
mind,'' said Reeves, 55, who was an assistant with the Cowboys
before head coaching stops in Denver and New York before Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved one time in 28 years \RDallas to Denver\S. And I've
moved twice in the last six years \RDenver to New York and New York
to Atlanta\S. I'm not moving again. So how many more years... I
don't know. But my wife won't go with me if we move again. So I'm
not planning on leaving her. This will be the last place I go.''

fullback/tight end Brian Kozlowski (ankle) practiced Wednesday and
Thursday for the first time since the NFC Championship Game and are
expected to play Sunday in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau led the Falcons with 10 sacks, and Kozlowski has been
running back Jamal Anderson's lead blocker since starting fullback
Bob Christian injured his knee with two games left in the regular
season. HAPPY WITH CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges Reeves faced when he came to
Atlanta two seasons ago was revamping the Falcons' offense after
seven years of using versions of the run and shoot under the
direction of offensive coordinator-turned-head coach June Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons players say they welcomed the change. Some offensive
players said the run and shoot wasn't physical enough, and
defensive players said it was useless to practice against because
they weren't going to face it on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably play 475 years in the run and shoot,''
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield said. ``I never had to hit anybody.
Now, we are pounding every play. Everything is real aggressive, a
more powerful game.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Chuck Smith, who was suspended for the final game
of the 1996 season because he said the Falcons needed a coach that
kept the defense in mind, is happy as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that I played all those years in the
run and shoot, and we never practiced against a tight end,'' Smith
said. ``That's why you finish last in run defense. No one else puts
five receivers out there every down.'' /

TRACK BUYING, SELLING SAID HEALTHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ America Online bought Netscape. Exxon merged
with Mobil. And the horse racing industry is getting in on the
feeding frenzy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs just paid $86 million to acquire Calder Race
Course in Miami. Six days earlier, an unlikely partnership of
gambling interests that included Keeneland Race Course paid about
$45 million for Turfway Park. In November, Frank Stronach's Magna
International Corp. bought Santa Anita for $126 million. Also last
year, Call Now Inc., which operates Retama Park, signed an
agreement to purchase Louisiana Downs, Remington Park and
Thistledown from the DeBartolo Corporation, then apparently
couldn't come up with the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Considered poison as recently as two years ago, racetracks
suddenly seem almost as popular as Internet stock.
</P>
<P>
   Or are they?
</P>
<P>
   The buyers mentioned above were already heavily involved in the
horse business, so it isn't as if AT&AMP;T or Microsoft suddenly
decided racetracks are a blue-chip investment. Also, remember that
wherever there is a buyer, there often is a seller who believes the
time is right to get out.
</P>
<P>
   The opinionated Stronach owns more racehorses than perhaps
anyone in the world, other than a couple of sheiks, and he
desperately wants to show the industry how a track should be run.
But when he bought Santa Anita, the stock price of his Magna
International faltered at the news.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs is a publicly traded corporation, thus is under
continual pressure from stockholders to show growth. Also last
year, the Louisville, Ky., track, which is the home of the Kentucky
Derby, bought Ellis Park in Henderson, Ky. Many in the racing
industry believe that in its haste to expand, Churchill paid too
much for Calder.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one impartial observer believes the recent flurry
of track sales is a sign that the beleaguered sport has turned the
corner: outspoken Jerry Carroll, the real estate entrepreneur who
bought run-down Turfway Park (then called Latonia) in 1986 and sold
it this month for a huge profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime tracks like that are selling, the industry is good,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though things may be for sale, if those things are bad,
nobody wants to buy them. These are not foreclosure sales. Every
one of these racetracks is making a profit. In that kind of
climate, selling is good, not bad. That's called business.''
</P>
<P>
   The bartering of racetracks probably isn't over with, either.
Churchill Downs, which used up most of its $100 million credit line
to buy Calder and has also been rumored to be interested in
Gulfstream Park and Fair Grounds, has indicated it is planning to
go back to the bank for more money to buy other tracks.
Stockholders love that kind of talk. Last week, news surfaced that
Stronach is considering buying Bay Meadows racetrack near San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Much more of this, and we'll need a program to identify not just
the owners of the horses, but the owners of the tracks they are
running at. SPOTLIGHT Gone are the times when Oaklawn Park housed
the stables of trainers such as D. Wayne Lukas, Shug McGaughey,
Bill Mott, Frank Brothers and Bobby Barnett. And Pat Day is riding
at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The day-to-day racing quality continues to erode, but although
Oaklawn is no longer booming, it hasn't gone bust, either.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hot Springs, Ark., track opens today for a 52-day season,
enough of its faithful horsemen have remained to ensure some
interesting races.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lynn Whiting, who saddled Lil E. Tee to win the
1992 Kentucky Derby, is still based at Oaklawn. So is owner John Ed
Anthony, an Arkansan formerly of Loblolly Stable fame, who has
rebuilt a 13-horse string with trainer Don Von Hemel.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers Kenny Smith, Donnie Von Hemel, Pete Vestal, Joe
Petalino and Cole Norman win races wherever they go. Jim Gaston
tied for Lone Star Park's training championship last summer. Jack
Van Berg returns after an absence, and Bob Holthus has collected
more Oaklawn titles than any active trainer. Leading jockeys at
Oaklawn are again expected to be Tim Doocy, Calvin Borel, Don
Pettinger, Jon Court, James Lopez and Carlos Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Albarado is now based at Fair Grounds, but will ride at
Oaklawn today for the mount on The Happy Hopper, favored in the
Dixie Belle Stakes for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Racing at Oaklawn will be conducted on a Wednesday-Sunday
schedule, with a post time of 1:30 p.m. on weekdays and Sundays,
and 1 p.m. on Saturdays. This Sunday, the track has a special Super
Bowl post time of 1 p.m.
SERIES PILOT Silver Charm helps kick off the new NTRA Champions on
Fox series tomorrow when he runs in the $500,000 Donn Handicap in
his first visit to Miami-area Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old will be a heavy favorite in the 11-8-mile race.
But even before the gates open, he has received a test. The Donn
attracted 12 entrants _ a surprise to officials who expected fewer
_ and Silver Charm drew the far outside post position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys already got me here ... I can't go back now,''
quipped trainer Bob Baffert when informed of Silver Charm's post.
``Gary \RStevens\S is a great rider. He'll figure something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible upsetters are Puerto Madero, Frisk Me Now,
Behrens and Texas Mile winner Littlebitlively, who nearly defeated
Silver Charm at Churchill Downs in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Donn will be televised live on Fox Network from 3 to 4
p.m.The national series for older horses consists of 11 races.
ANSWERING THE BELL Answer Lively returns to action in tomorrow's
$100,000 Lecomte Handicap at Fair Grounds, his first start since
winning the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Juvenile. The prospect of running
against the likely 2-year-old champion of 1998 didn't scare away
competition: 14 horses were entered in the 1-mile stakes. The
3-year-old colt, owned by John Franks of Shreveport, drew post No.
11 and will be ridden by Robbie Albarado, because Jerry Bailey is
staying in Florida to ride Sir Bear in the Donn. THE ACID TEST
Undefeated 3-year-old speedball Bet Me Best will finally be tested
against top-class competition Sunday in Gulfstream's seven-furlong
Hutcheson Stakes. Also expected to run are Texas Glitter and Cat
Thief. Bet Me Best was purchased privately last month by a
partnership headed by Houston-owned Prestonwood Farm. INAUSPICIOUS
START Texas apprentice jockey sensation Jeremy Beasley shifted his
tack last week to New York's wintry Aqueduct, picked up a winner in
his fifth mount, and now is sitting out a seven-day suspension for
careless riding. He is scheduled to resume riding Monday. ANOTHER
COMEBACK Jockey Mike Smith, 33, who hasn't ridden since suffering
fractured vertebrae in an Aug. 31 spill at Saratoga, is scheduled
to make his comeback aboard Truluck in the Donn. Actually, his
first mount will be one race earlier, when he is scheduled to ride
Close Up in an allowance sprint. TEXAS CELEBRATION Michael
Dickinson, who saddled Da Hoss to win last year's Breeders' Cup
Mile in one of the finest training accomplishments in racing
history, is scheduled to be a featured speaker tomorrow night at
the Texas Thoroughbred Association's annual meeting and awards
banquet in Austin.

THE MOUTH THAT MADE MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Thirty-three years later, and one thing never changes
about Super Bowl week. A national media army, which grows larger
and less-organized each January, descends upon the host city,
everyone clutching the same set of marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   Find a theme.
</P>
<P>
   And if that fails, which it usually does, then invent a theme.
Even if you have to make it all up.
</P>
<P>
   But just a week ago, this particular edition of the Super Bowl
had the makings of a journalistic dunk. That whole ``Denver Thing''
involving Elway-Shanahan-Reeves was the media equivalent of a fat
batting-practice pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the dunk died, as if it was slammed too hard off
the back-iron. And our batting practice was rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves stopped talking about his nasty Denver memories. John
Elway and Mike Shanahan never wanted to start in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So then, what's the theme?
</P>
<P>
   Even though bad-blood talk can be muzzled by the characters,
it's obviously still there. One Denver newspaper columnist is
openly predicting a 50-something-to-nine victory for the Broncos,
apparently because Shanahan has a burning-hunk-of-dislike for
Reeves and won't hesitate to run it up on the former boss who fired
him for being disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   But without verbal fire-feeding, this much-anticipated theme has
basically vanished this week.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with the game itself, and frankly, it's a nice
consolation prize, at least in this opinion. The game itself will
be a good one, well-worth all the action stoppage for commercial
messages.
</P>
<P>
   But no Super Bowl game _ even the rare competitive, exciting and
well-played affair _ has ever saved Super Bowl week, which is
totally apart from the actual football. At least in the media
pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I hereby bestow upon Denver's Shannon Sharpe the
highest honor this country's sports media can offer: The Medal of
Mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Super Bowl weeks, this one has been lowered
to a last resort: listening to the players talk.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe arrived here with a reputation for being one of the best
talkers in the game, but to his credit, the man has outdone
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy from small-town Georgia and small-college Georgia
(Savannah State) who _ again, personal opinion _ has the best
combination of mouth and game ever seen in one of these Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him. Sharpe will tell you he's Hall-of-Fame bound because of
what he does at tight end, being both a big-yardage receiver and a
blocker. Even more important, however, is how he saved this Super
Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was verbally sharp a year ago in San Diego _ his first
Super Bowl _ but the Broncos were considered so outclassed, no one
paid much attention to him. Until after the game, that is, when
Denver had sprung the large upset on the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   In a role reversal here, with Denver being the favorite over
Atlanta, Sharpe's mouth was under much more intense pressure. He
knew he would be on the media's Most Wanted list. He knew he was
expected to deliver. Tongue, don't fail me now.
</P>
<P>
   Like a true champion, Sharpe has become the Sultan of Sound
Bite. He has, in this one week, established himself as a talking
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But how did it all begin?
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe warms to the question quickly. Elementary school, he
says. Glennville, Ga. A speech class.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy named Johnny was reading, and the teacher said, ``No,
student, don't you help him. Let me help him.'' She wanted him to
sound the words out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnny began stumbling badly over a word he couldn't
pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it sounds like?'' Sharpe said the teacher told Johnny.
``Sounds like?'' she asked again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said, ``it sounds like Johnny can't read,'' Sharpe
recalled, proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the teacher said, ``Shannon Sharpe, you get out of the
class. Get out of class.''
</P>
<P>
   But right then, on his way to the principal's office, a legend
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a good talker... I'm a great talker,'' Sharpe noted,
``because I do it so often. I think if you do something well enough
and often enough, you become great at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the great ones always worked hard on their
``game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I'd get in front of the mirror for 20
minutes every night,'' he said. ``I'd talk to myself. I'd ask
questions, answer questions and just talk in general. I've kind of
perfected it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not kind of. The Medal of Mouth stands for ultimate perfection.
The best here. The best ever. And no matter if Denver makes another
Super Bowl, the NFL should bring back Shannon Sharpe every January.
He can always be the man who saved Super Bowl week.

<P>
   MARTHA-GRAHAM-LEGACY (subslug) (New York) _ Monday, one day
before opening a three-week season at the Joyce Theater, the Martha
Graham Dance Company will vacate the school and studios at 316 East
63rd Street, where Graham taught and choreographed for 40 years
before she died in 1991. The small brick building will be
demolished, sold to pay off debts, retire a $1.5 million mortgage
and establish an endowment. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSHMORE-FILM (Undated) _ Wes Anderson, the 29-year-old director
of ``Rushmore,'' which opens on Friday, is as singular a
personality as Max, his comic creation. Where Max is flamboyant,
however, Anderson is quiet. Underneath this reticence, though,
lurks a gentle fierceness that has enabled him to make two
thoroughly offbeat films within the Hollywood studio system.
Anderson wrote both ``Rushmore'' and his first movie, ``Bottle
Rocket,'' with his friend, and fellow Texan, Owen Wilson. By Laura
Winters. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FEMALE-FILM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ ``Directing is the final
frontier,'' said the producer Gale Ann Hurd, who was involved with
``The Terminator'' and ``Armageddon'' and who knows a bit about the
perils of breaking into a male bastion. ``It's the one area where
women have made no real inroads.'' In fact, while the 1980s saw
dramatic gains _ the number of women directing studio releases rose
from zero to 7 percent or 8 percent of the total _ those figures
have remained flat through the 1990s. By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-DONATIONS-FILM (New York) _ Early last month at the New
York Public Library's Donnell branch, a standing-room-only
screening was held of ``The Kindness of Strangers,'' a 104-minute
documentary that provides a close look at organ donation and
transplantation from the personal perspective of donors, survivors,
recipients and their families. When the lights came up, teary
audience members could be seen fishing for their drivers' licenses
and filling out the organ donor consent information. By Jean
Nathan. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-HEART-THEATER (London) _ ``Blue Heart,'' one of two one-act
plays by Caryl Churchill was widely acclaimed in its London debut
nearly 18 months ago at the Royal Court Theater, where critics
praised an ever-adventurous dramatist _ perhaps Britain's most
consistently daring _ as well as a cast that illuminated fully what
in lesser hands might have come across as a stunt. The double-bill
made its American debut last Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Majestic Theater, following an international tour last
year. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-THEATER (Undated) _ The retooled ``Scarlet Pimpernel''
has given theatergoers a rare glimpse of the critical role played
by the directors of Broadway musicals. Yet when you talk to them
about what they do for a living, they resort to simple metaphors
that belie the complexity of their task. They will tell you the job
is about finding a rhythm, seeing a picture, hearing a motor. Or
maybe making an arc, weaving a spell, taking a journey. By Sylviane
Gold. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-GRAHAM-PHOTOS (Undated) _ Imogen Cunningham
photographed Martha Graham in the summer of 1931, in Santa Barbara,
Calif. They worked outside, in front of the barn at Graham's
mother's home. The afternoon was hot, the smell unpleasant and the
flies bothersome, but together they managed to produce a collection
of nearly 90 images, an extraordinary double-portrait of both
photographer and choreographer. By Ann Daly. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FELDMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may not be helpful to living
musical practitioners to know this, but death does wonders for a
composer's reputation, at least as measured by representation on
CD. Numerous recordings of works by Luigi Nono, John Cage, Witold
Lutoslawski and Toru Takemitsu have come too late for them to hear,
and the posthumous crescendo is even more spectacular in the case
of Morton Feldman. At the time of his death, in 1987, the CD
catalogue included barely a handful of his pieces. Now his whole
immense output is heaving into view, and the peaks are beginning to
become evident. Most recently, three releases have started to
repair the neglect of his orchestral compositions. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCHOENBERG-MUSIC (Undated) _ Arnold Schoenberg probably gets the
nod as the most reviled composer in history. So when the
Metropolitan Opera presents its first production of his masterpiece
``Moses und Aron'' on Feb. 8, more of the animosity the composer's
music has always attracted will undoubtedly be whipped up. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ No one is bolder in his embrace of a
tonal, lyrical and Romantic past than Lowell Liebermann. And not
coincidentally, perhaps, Liebermann, 37, a New Yorker, has been
blessed with enthusiastic audiences and big-name performers, many
of whom rarely champion contemporary music. Just now, Liebermann
seems to be everywhere at once. His opera ``The Picture of Dorian
Gray,'' based on the novel by Oscar Wilde, will receive its
American premiere on Friday at the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee.
Two weeks ago, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and its music
director, Andrew Litton, appointed Liebermann
composer-in-residence, a three-year position to take effect in the
fall. The New York Philharmonic has scheduled the premiere of his
Trumpet Concerto in May 2000. And BMG Classics recently released a
disk of his flute music, played by James Galway. By K. Robert
Schwarz. (Moved).

   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-LACY-ABROAD (subslug) (Undated) _ Since the be-bop era,
jazz musicians seeking a better life have landed with their
suitcases on the shores of Europe. In cities like Paris, Stockholm
and Berlin, they have found steady work, low rents, congenial
audiences and a more hospitable racial climate. But for all its
attractions, living abroad has seldom advanced the art itself. By
Adam Shatz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TEN-ARTISTS-EXHIBIT (Undated) _ At the little-known Mercury
Gallery in Boston, a mostly forgotten group of American artists
from the 1930s is the focus of an exhibition that also turns
attention to the group's sole surviving member, a very fine painter
named Joseph Solman. The show in Boston (through February) is about
the Ten, as the group chose to call itself, somewhat eccentrically,
considering that there were only nine of them in the beginning.
(The numbers changed over the years.) Solman was the youngest
member and became something of a ringleader. By Michael Kimmelman.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CARAVAGGIO-ART (Boston) _ Since it was rediscovered in the
Jesuit Residence in Dublin in 1990, Caravaggio's ``Taking of
Christ'' has left Ireland only twice. In 1995, the painting spent a
month at the National Gallery in London and two months in Rome.
``The Taking of Christ'' was not scheduled to leave Dublin _ where
the Jesuit Fathers have left it on indefinite loan at the National
Gallery of Ireland _ for the next 25 years. Yet Monday it will be
on view in Boston, as the centerpiece of ``Saints and Sinners:
Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a show of 17th-century Italian
religious art that opens at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston
College, through May 24. By Ken Shulman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-HOLOCAUST (Undated) _ Television and the Holocaust are
clearly an odd couple, says Jeffrey Shandler, who teaches in the
department of Hebrew and Judaic studies at New York University. But
they are also ``age mates,'' having entered the American
consciousness around the same time. And more than film or art or
literature, Shandler says, the much-maligned small screen is
responsible for turning the Holocaust from a calamity befalling a
foreign people in a different time and place into a ubiquitous,
paradigmatic part of American culture. By David Margolick. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOLK-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Outsider art continues to upstage
American folk art in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in
the press. But at the auctions, traditional American folk art
chalks up spectacular prices for the choicest examples, while the
quirky, visionary Outsider art lags far behind in the prices
fetched at auction. This month's folk-art sales began with the
proverbial bang at Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by
Edward Hicks rewrote the records for the artist and for folk art.

<P>
   Taking its biggest step yet toward becoming a large-scale seller
of high-profit luxury cars, Ford Motor Co. formally announced on
Thursday that it had agreed to buy the car operations of Volvo AB
of Sweden for $6.45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There is more money to be made on luxury cars, whose sales are
rising in the United States and Europe. Automakers' profits on less
expensive cars have evaporated as low-cost manufacturers in places
like South Korea flood markets in the United States and elsewhere
with ever-cheaper cars. Ford has already bought Jaguar and
Aston-Martin in recent years, but the acquisition of Volvo, a
favorite of affluent families in the northeastern United States and
northern Europe, represents a far greater bet on the luxury market.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that the
automaker sold 200,000 luxury cars last year but wanted to sell a
million annually within several years. Volvo sold 399,700 cars
worldwide last year while Ford sold 6.8 million cars, sport utility
vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser and William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman, said that they
liked Volvo's current lineup of cars and were not planning
immediate changes. Both men also said that they admired Volvo's
tradition of paying attention to safety and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important because it fits very nicely with the
social values at Ford,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor has increasingly emphasized the same issues as Volvo
in recent months, making its sport utility vehicles pollute as
little as cars and announcing plans to offer side air bags on all
cars. The shift has come as Ford has reasserted family control over
the automaker in recent months and begun re-emphasizing the Ford
family's longtime tradition of public service, best shown by the
creation of the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's purchase of Volvo, while costlier than many auto analysts
had predicted, was well received on Thursday on Wall Street. Ford's
stock rose $2.1875 a share, to $62.50, while Volvo's American
depository receipts fell 81.75 cents each, to $26.5625.
</P>
<P>
   While Volvo's popularity among affluent Baby Boomers may be
useful to Ford now, some auto industry experts questioned whether
Ford's long-term strategy truly required Volvo. Susan Jacobs, a
consultant in Rutherford, Conn., noted that Lincoln recently
introduced its LS cars to appeal to the same market _ sporty
vehicles costing $30,000 to $45,000 _ while Jaguar will soon start
selling its new S-type cars in the same market segment of luxury
family vehicles costing less than $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln and Jaguar are both evolving toward the market of
Volvo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said that Volvo's car business was attractive because it
filled gaps in Ford's current lineup. Volvo has a much higher
proportion of women buyers than Ford has for its existing luxury
brands: Lincoln and Jaguar. Volvo sells 60 percent of its cars in
Europe, while Ford sells only 24 percent of its cars there. And
Ford has an extensive distribution network that can be used to sell
Volvo cars more widely, Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that the automaker also thought it could learn from
Volvo's techniques for assembling the main metal structural
components of cars and for achieving high customer loyalty and
customer satisfaction ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Leif Johansson, Volvo's president, said that Volvo would use the
50 billion Swedish kronor from the sale of its car division to
strengthen the company's huge and more profitable commercial truck
and bus division. Volvo took a 12.8 percent stake earlier this
month in Scania, its Swedish archrival in the commercial truck
industry and has expressed an interest in taking control of it.
Thursday's agreement must be approved by Volvo shareholders.

</P>
<P>
   International auto mergers have a history of producing ruinous
culture clashes. So Ford executives took great pains on Thursday to
try to reassure Swedish workers and managers that the change in
corporate control would not mean an immediate imposition of
American managers and production techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in Sweden since 1924 _ they know us, and they know
how we operate,'' Ford said. ``I don't think we've ever been viewed
as a parochial company.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo tried to merge with France's Renault in 1993, but the deal
collapsed when midlevel Volvo managers complained publicly that
their French counterparts were too bossy. After Renault took
control of American Motors Corp. in the early 1980s through a
series of stock purchases, cultural differences produced managerial
chaos, and American Motors was eventually sold to the Chrysler
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When Daimler-Benz AG acquired Chrysler last autumn, it tried to
avoid cultural differences by leaving virtually all of Chrysler's
senior management in place, although Germans still outnumber
Americans by 9-2 in the top tier of management at the new
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been unusually successful at international mergers,
having bought Jaguar a decade ago and made it profitable while
fixing the chronic quality problems that long tarnished Jaguar's
reputation. Probably not by coincidence, Ford has also been more
aggressive in promoting foreign-born executives to top jobs: Nasser
was born in rural Lebanon and grew up in Australia, while his
predecessor, Alexander Trotman, was British.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, all of the top 16 executives at General Motors
Corp. are American men. GM owns half of Volvo's main rival, Saab,
and has an agreement to buy the other half, but Saab is still
struggling and its brand image remains murky despite GM's efforts
to clarify it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's success at Jaguar and its international staff were the
main reasons that Volvo chose Ford's bid over a slightly higher
offer from Fiat SpA of Italy, people close to the negotiations
said. Fiat said on Thursday that in any case, it had been
interested in buying all of Volvo, including its business in heavy
trucks and buses.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said at a news conference in Volvo's hometown of
Goteburg, Sweden, that Ford would use its experience with Jaguar as
a model for its management of Volvo's car operations. Ford has
begun replacing inconspicuous Jaguar parts like suspensions and
electrical systems, which it can buy at much lower prices because
of the economies of scale available to it as the world's
second-largest auto maker. Ford has also started encouraging
dealers to own both Ford and Jaguar dealerships, although they
seldom sell both kinds of vehicles side by side so as to avoid
blurring distinctions between the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But even 10 years after Ford's purchase of Jaguar, the biggest
savings are still several years away. Ford plans to build the next
Ford Thunderbird and Jaguar S-type car on the same underbody it
already uses for the Lincoln LS cars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jaguar, Volvo is profitable and has a fairly wide
selection of modern car designs. As a result, Ford will move only
gradually toward using common parts and building Ford and Volvo
cars on virtually identical underbodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term that will not be needed; in the long term I
certainly hope so,'' Nasser said. ``More integration and more
cross-fertilization will certainly be part of the business
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford will pay the $6.45 billion entirely in cash, which will be
easy for a company with $23.8 billion in cash reserves. Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp., the credit rating agency, reaffirmed Ford's and
Volvo's strong ratings on Thursday.

SERBS' TALK ABOUT KILLINGS INTERCEPTED, U.S. SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American officials said on Thursday that
conversations among senior Serbian officials about a massacre of 45
civilians in Kosovo were intercepted and that this underscored the
need for an international war crimes investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The killings of those ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak
two weeks ago sparked international outrage and galvanized efforts
to try to impose an agreement on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The intercepted conversations are confirmation that Serb
officials ordered an attack on Racak, the officials said. The
attack was presumed to be in revenge for the killing of four men
from Serbian forces. But the conversations are not conclusive on
the question of whether senior Serbian political and military
officials ordered the killings of the civilians, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a smoking gun,'' one senior American official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the Serbs ordered an attack on Racak,'' he said. ``We
still don't know about the massacre. We need to have a full
independent investigation into the massacre'' by a U.N. war crimes
tribunal, which could determine the role of senior officials in
Belgrade in the killings, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military and intelligence agencies have seen transcripts of
the telephone conversations among senior Serb officials, which were
intercepted by Western military intelligence services during and
after the military operation in Racak. They show Serb leaders,
including the deputy prime minister, Nikola Sainovic, and a senior
Interior Ministry official, Sreten Lukic, discussing the political
implications of the killings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the intercepted conversations was first
reported by The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   While the intercepted conversations suggest plans for a
political cover-up of a military massacre, there is still some
disagreement among American officials as to whether ``rogue
elements'' killed the civilians without orders from above, one
American official said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.N. war crimes investigator, Louise Arbour, has been
blocked by Serb officials in her attempts to reach Racak. In
Strasbourg, France, on Thursday, she said that she would keep
trying to ``find out the truth.''

OLYMPIC GYMNAST MOVES FROM TEXAS TO FLORIDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Hoping to put family turmoil behind her and focus on
the 2000 Olympics, gymnast Dominique Moceanu has moved from Houston
to Orlando, Fla., to resume intensive training.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's happy there,'' her attorney, Ellen Yarrell said
Thursday. ``Her No. 1 priority is training for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said Dominique moved Sunday to be reunited with her
former coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26, whom Dominique credited with
reviving her career last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Olympics will be in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Miscenco left Houston after police told Dominique on Nov. 13
they were investigating allegations that Dominique's father
negotiated with a hit man to kill Miscenco and another friend of
Dominique's.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu has denied involvement in such a plot, but he
took the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination when asked
about it in court in December. Police say the investigation is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Miscenco and the other friend, Brian Huggins, 32, helped
Dominique run away from her parents' Houston-area home Oct. 17.
Dumitru has said Miscenco and Huggins ``brainwashed'' his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, Harris County Family Law Judge John Montgomery
granted a protective order to keep her father away from her for a
year. Yarrell said she will ask a Florida court to issue the same
order there.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said Dominique will train for free at an Orlando gym
owned by Rita Brown, who also owns a gym in Katy, Texas, where
Dominique resumed training earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said Dumitru Moceanu plans to close in early February
the 70,000-square-foot Moceanu gym in Houston that was built with
money from Dominique's trust fund. The gym has floundered
financially without Dominique's presence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes ``common sense will prevail'' and Dumitru
Moceanu ``will not attempt to disrupt Dominique's training.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone Thursday, Dominique's mother, Camelia, said
``no comment.'' She said her husband also did not want to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus' attorney Katherine Scardino confirmed that the
gym, which she has said cost $2 million, cannot survive without its
star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main draw was Dominique, and she knew that,'' Scardino
said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said she is unsure what will happen to the gym and
said there is a chance the parents will declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said if the gym closes, it could create some legal
issues over Dominique's trust fund because it is liable to repay a
bank loan for the property and building.
</P>
<P>
   She said the bank has been cooperating with Dominique, but it
might be in her interest to try to hire someone to keep the gym
running.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu owns 100 percent of the company that runs the
gym, Moceanu Gymnastics Inc., so he is within his rights to shut it
down, Yarrell said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said he has been selling expensive gym equipment
and that would be a violation of the loan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said she ``keeps hearing'' that Dumitru Moceanu is
selling off gym equipment, but there is no evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   She said the parents plan to stay in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique has said she believes her parents bought their home
and other personal items with her money. Yarrell said under Texas
law, the parents had a right to do whatever they wanted with
Dominique's money before the trust fund was set up in 1996. After
that, all her money was supposed to go to the trust fund, which she
does not have access to until she turns 35.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu has said all of Dominique's money went into the
gym, which she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrell said Dumitru Moceanu still has not provided the
financial records she has requested and a hearing will be held
Monday to try to depose him on those records. No lawsuit has been
filed on the financial matters, but Texas law permits depositions
before lawsuits are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique's parents were gymnasts on the Romanian national team
before defecting to the United States. Dominique was born in
Hollywood, Calif., in 1981 and started gymnastics training at age
3. The family moved to the Houston area in 1990 so Dominique could
train with famed coach Bela Karolyi, also a Romanian immigrant, who
had trained Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, 17, sued her parents Oct. 19 to be declared a legal
adult. She said her parents had squandered her money and ruined her
childhood, and she needed to be declared an adult to get an
accounting of her money and live her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, then 14, was the youngest member of the gold-winning
U.S. women's gymnastics team in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After a growth spurt that saw her go from about 4-foot-4 to
5-foot-2, Dominique did not fare well in competitions after the
Olympics until she hired Miscenco as coach. In August, Dominique
was the first non-Russian to win the all-around competition in the
Goodwill Games.

FALCONS SAY BRONCOS USE ILLEGAL BLOCKING 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Colo., Ga., Calif.)  (Eds: This replaces FBN-FALCONS-CHANDLER, which was skedded
earlier.) 
(DW) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Defensive end Lester Archambeau of the Atlanta Falcons
is usually a calm man. Just a guy from Montville, N.J., who is part
of one of the best _ and mostly unheralded _ defensive lines in
football. But when Archambeau starts discussing the blocking styles
of the Denver offensive linemen, his blood boils.
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau said Thursday that a block that had been banned by
the National Football League consistently was used by Broncos
linemen, an accusation that Denver players denied. When pass
blocking, linemen are forbidden to do what is commonly called chop
blocking. That is, one player will block a defender high, while
another simultaneously blocks below the waist, usually around the
knee or upper thigh.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is in place because chop blocking can cause serious,
even career-ending, injuries _ especially to the knees. In the last
few years, several defensive linemen _ like Minnesota's Jerry Ball,
who sustained a season-ending knee injury in 1991, before they were
banned _ have been hurt by the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   While some teams may try to slip in such blocks during a game _
this is football, after all _ Archambeau said that the Broncos
constantly used the illegal technique. He accused some of the
linemen of intentionally trying to injure opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their tendency is to hold and cut,'' he said of the Broncos'
linemen. ``That high-low stuff they do is supposedly illegal, but
they get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau said that as a pre-emptive strike, some Falcons
players as well as their defensive line coach, Bill Kollar, plan to
speak to game officials sometime Sunday before Super Bowl XXXIII.
They want to make sure the officials will be looking for any
potential chop blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau said that based on his film study of the Broncos, he
believes Denver offensive linemen use chop blocks more than any
other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch them do it on film and it angers you,'' he said.
``They can flat-out hurt you, and their coach teaches that cheap
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gibbs, Denver's offensive line coach, denied that the
Broncos used illegal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We block hard and we do things within the rules,'' Broncos
center Tom Nalen said. ``Anyone who says otherwise is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Archambeau, a Stanford graduate with a degree in industrial
engineering, is not the only player who has accused Denver of
pushing the envelope when it comes to blocking. After the Giants
beat the Broncos this season, several Giants defensive linemen said
Denver used chop-blocking techniques in passing situations
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Giants said they complained about it to game
officials but, those players said, no warning was ever given to the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The league often protects quarterbacks by fining defensive
players who make late or questionable hits on them, Archambeau
said, but defensive linemen are given no such protection. He said
defensive players were becoming increasingly frustrated with what
they felt was a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They protect the quarterbacks because who does the MCI
commercials, the Pizza Hut commercials?'' he said. ``It's the
quarterback club. They protect the quarterbacks more than any other
position. They don't care about defensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after complaining about the Broncos' offensive line, most
opponents, including Archambeau, quickly add that they are a
hard-working, skilled group. Denver's line completely outworked
Green Bay in last year's Super Bowl. This season, the Broncos'
Terrell Davis ran for 2,008 yards and 21 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver's front has yet to go against a talented group like
the Falcons' defensive line, which consists of Archambeau,
defensive tackles Shane Dronett and Travis Hall and defensive end
Chuck Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the most underrated, unappreciated group in the
National Football League,'' said Atlanta's defensive coordinator,
Rich Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because of the line, Atlanta's run defense was ranked
second in the league, allowing only 75 yards a game. The only back
to gain at least 100 yards in the past 26 games against the Falcons
was the Jets' Curtis Martin. The Falcons also led the league in
total takeaways (44) and fumble recoveries (25).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tremendous play on the field, the defensive line is
relatively unknown, except in Atlanta, where it is nicknamed the
Bomb Squad.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to the line are the bookends, Archambeau and Smith, two
smart and talkative players who have had a major impact on their
team this year but did not make the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This is Smith's seventh season with the Falcons, and one of his
best, thanks to eight and a half sacks and 82 tackles. Smith is the
heart of the line, but he is also a thinker. He owns a video
library containing some 30 tapes of some of the greatest pass
rushers in history, like Reggie White, Lawrence Taylor and Bruce
Smith. Smith also has some tape of his good friend, Giants
defensive end Michael Strahan. He uses the videos to learn new
moves or enhance old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like hitting people,'' Smith said. ``I like chasing the
ball. I like hitting running backs. I like it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been the biggest crusader this week in trying to get
his defensive linemates some respect. When a reporter asked him on
Thursday how the Falcons expected to stop Davis when no team this
season had been able to do so, Smith got irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said we couldn't stop Minnesota and we did,'' he said.
``We can stop Terrell. There is no superhuman back in this league.
Any player can be stopped.'' &QL;

PRISON GANG EXPERTS AND MEMBERS ON WITNESS LIST IN JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Prison gang experts and members are among the
witnesses subpoenaed for the capital murder trial of a white man
accused in the brutal dragging death of a black man last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said the newest subpoenas in the trial of John
William ``Bill'' King, 24, may indicate prosecutors intend to try
to prove that King planned to commit a racially motivated crime
while he was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to testify to helpful things,''
said court-appointed defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs.
</P>
<P>
   King, his prison cellmate, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and
former home-town buddy Shawn Allen Berry, 23, are accused of
chaining James Byrd Jr., 49, to the back of a pickup and dragging
him almost three miles along back country roads early June 7.
Brewer and Berry will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Bill King has had an idea of racial violence for a
long time,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said
Thursday. ``As for if he planned this will be for a jury to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said he doesn't plan to call prisoners Roy Lee Birnbaum
and Michael Lee Mahan to the witness stand because their prison
records may make their testimony suspect. He wouldn't say if Texas
prison system gang expert Sammy Buentello or William Knox, a
nationally-known expert on gangs, will testify.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum, 30, is an Aryan Brotherhood member serving a prison
term for burglary. Gray said Birnbaum, who has the prison nickname
``Dirtball,'' is a prison tattoo artist who drew some of the racist
tattoos on King's body while he was in prison between 1995 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan, 36, is serving a term for escape and aggravated assault
of a police officer. Identified as a member of the Aryan Circle, he
listed King and Brewer as prison enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the witness list are two other men who apparently knew
King in prison. The list also includes numerous law enforcement
agents, acquaintances of King, his girlfriend, Byrd's sister, the
wrecker drivers who towed Berry's truck after he was arrested and
the man who said he saw Byrd riding in the back of the pickup on
the night of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the trial is expected to begin Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers continued Thursday to talk to potential jurors in an
attempt to find 46 qualified jurors from a pool of 122. The tally
rose Thursday to 20, including five blacks. Each side will be able
to strike 16 names from the shorter list. The first dozen jurors
not struck will be on King's jury and the next two will serve as
alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Among the jurors qualified for the pool Thursday was a former
private prison guard who said her first husband was a member of the
Aryan Brotherhood who was imprisoned for kidnapping her. Officials
said she and her children were being held in a rural area next to
an open grave when lawmen rescued them.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is currently married to another prison inmate she
met while working at a private prison in Newton. She said her
husband is serving a term for murder from Hawaii. ``It was
self-defense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 10 potential jurors excused from service Thursday was
a middle-aged woman who said she couldn't impose the death penalty
for King because she knows and respects King's father, Ronald, too
much. ``Mr. King has done a lot for my family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King, sitting in a wheelchair and breathing bottled
oxygen, attended the opening day of the trial Monday, but hasn't
returned. The woman said his son's incarceration has hurt the elder
King's fragile medical condition. ``It's really broken his heart,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on the witness stand, King, who has been taking notes
throughout the jury selection process, stared intently down at the
table in front of him. He never looked at the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of individual questioning of jurors was so fast
Thursday that Cribbs quipped that he plans to tell judges in the
courts of Beaumont, his home town, that they work too slow. It is
common there, he said, to question about eight jurors a day in
capital cases. Lawyers in King's trial questioned 17 jurors
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that they might not be able to get enough jurors out of
the original pool of 122, state District Judge Joe Bob Golden had
earlier said he might also use jurors subpoenaed for Feb. 1. Jurors
in that group were notified Thursday that they won't be needed.

 &HT;    Duval ends day with 65 strokes
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was no 59 for David Duval on Thursday in the
first round of the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he used 65 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 holes.
</P>
<P>
   With early morning temperatures of 35 degrees causing a one-hour
frost delay Thursday at the TPC at Scottsdale, 45 players were
unable to finish before darkness. Among them: Duval, who is 2 over
par through 16 holes; and Tiger Woods, who is 2 over through 14
holes.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 birdies and an eagle last week in his stunning 59 to
win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Duval actually made a few
mistakes Thursday. In windy conditions that were knocking down
shots with regularity and quickening the greens, Duval bogeyed his
final two holes, the 15th and 16th, before darkness in the desert
suspended play.
</P>
<P>
   Weather permitting, 15 threesomes will attempt to finish first
rounds Friday morning, then begin the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard is the first-day leader with a 4-under 67 and
stands one shot ahead of Paul Azinger, who had a 68. Former Georgia
player Franklin Langham shot a 1-under 70 and trails by three.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, 27, the former four-time All-American from Georgia Tech,
has won his first two events of the PGA Tour season and already
passed $1 million in earnings. Through his first eight rounds of
the season he stood 52-under par.

 &HT;    Bystanders derail carjacking
 &HT;    By Brian Gaar

<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Bystanders Thursday slashed the tires of a
suspected
</P>
<P>
   robber's getaway car outside a Subway restaurant, chased down
the
</P>
<P>
   escaping man and held him until Waco police arrived, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, a 41-year-old Woodway man was arrested by Waco
police in
</P>
<P>
   connection with the robbery of the restaurant at 1020 S. Fifth
St.,
</P>
<P>
   where Subway shares the building with an Exxon service station.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Exxon employees and other bystanders foiled the
escaping
</P>
<P>
   man's efforts to carjack another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A man entered the store at around 11:40 a.m. and, indicating
that he
</P>
<P>
   had a weapon, demanded money from an employee, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Dryden, the employee confronted by the man, said she
handed him
</P>
<P>
   money, then hit the panic button behind the counter after he
fled.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden said she then shouted a warning to employees working in
the
</P>
<P>
   garage of the Exxon station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a big family,'' Dryden said. ``When somebody yells
help,
</P>
<P>
   everybody runs.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the store, the man's getaway attempt was tripped
up when
</P>
<P>
   he discovered his tires had been slashed, witnesses said, adding
that
</P>
<P>
   employees of the Exxon station had cut the car's tires.
</P>
<P>
   In searching for another car, police said, the man allegedly
went to a
</P>
<P>
   neighboring car and tried to pull a woman out of the driver's
seat. He
</P>
<P>
   allegedly struck her in the face but couldn't remove the woman
because
</P>
<P>
   she was wearing her seatbelt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, employees of the Exxon station had spotted the man
and
</P>
<P>
   gave chase, along with other bystanders, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The onlookers chased the man away from the car and over to the
</P>
<P>
   intersection of Fourth Street and Dutton Avenue, where they
caught him,
</P>
<P>
   police said.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuers restrained the man until police arrived at 11:43
a.m.,
</P>
<P>
   minutes after receiving the intial call from Subway employees.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was taken to the McLennan County Jail on robbery
charges,
</P>
<P>
   said Larry Murphy, a Waco Police Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy praised the actions of the citizens who helped stop the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the circumstances, it was pretty heroic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waco police believe the same person may be responsible for the
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday robbery of a Diamond Shamrock store in Waco, said Sgt.
Dennis
</P>
<P>
   Kidwell, a Waco police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police are also investigating the possibility that the Thursday
</P>
<P>
   incident may be related to the shooting of an elderly Corsicana
man by
</P>
<P>
   a carjacker on Monday, Kidwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the Subway store were visibly upset after the
robbery, but
</P>
<P>
   happy at the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did get money, but he didn't get much,'' said Dryden. ``He
didn't get
</P>
<P>
   any of us, and that's all that matters.''

WHAT TO DO WITH THE BONUS CHECK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Ill., Texas, N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's bonus season again, and not just on Wall Street.
Sure, the financial-services bonus babies are as numerous as ever,
offering up silent ``show me the money'' prayers that last fall's
market gyrations will not eat too far into the six- or seven-figure
checks they are counting on to finance a swank Upper East Side
duplex in Manhattan or a little place in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   But though the dollars in other industries do not approach the
lofty heights enjoyed on Wall Street, the culture of bonuses is
spreading steadily through the ranks of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Once the exclusive preserve of top executives, bonuses and other
variable compensation plans are now going to middle managers,
production workers and support staff at many companies. And as they
do, the new swimmers in the bonus pool must adjust to receiving a
substantial fraction of each year's income in one lump.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 72 percent of 1,069 companies surveyed by Hewitt
Associates, a management consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.,
reported having variable pay plans _ incentive bonuses, stock
options, profit sharing and so on _ for nonexecutive workers,
making the pleasure of having one's efforts translated into a fat
check at year's end a more common experience now than in any of the
previous 21 years Hewitt has conducted the survey; the figure is up
from 60 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   These programs vary pay based on performance; they are distinct
from holiday bonuses, routine employer matching of 401(k)
contributions or traditional company stock purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this growing kind of variable pay is that it
is, well, variable: There's no knowing for sure what's coming.
According to Hewitt, the great majority of variable compensation
plans do not put base pay at risk; they pile bonuses on top of
regular salary. But with bonuses making up an ever larger part of
total pay, there is a danger that employees will give in to the
temptation to spend in advance and be caught short if the bonus
falls through.
</P>
<P>
   Hard data on the effects of incentive pay systems on employees'
financial habits are scarce. But anecdotal evidence suggests that
Jane and John Q. Public are not following in the footsteps of those
in the Wall Street crowd, who dive into lavish lifestyles that
render them dependent on a hefty year-end check.
</P>
<P>
   Away from Wall Street, it is not unusual to find employees who
have received bonuses like clockwork for several years running and
still insist that they do not rely on the money or allow it to
alter their standards of living, instead treating each year's bonus
as a unique windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we'd jinx it if we bought something ahead of time,''
Bjorn Berstein, a Seattle-based carpenter, said of his
performance-based bonus, which came to about $1,200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Savings and investment seem to be the most popular uses for this
found money. ``That check comes in and goes straight to the bank,''
said Sue Koehler, an operations manager with Sanders Tool &AMP;
Supplies in Peoria, Ill., where bonuses can, in some cases, amount
to several months' pay. ``Usually we've got something cooking that
we want to invest it in. Maybe we'll take a little trip with part
of it, but the majority is definitely for investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tobert, a clinical researcher at Merck &AMP; Co., the drug
giant, said he had gone even further, opting to defer receiving all
of his bonus income until he retires. (The company invests it for
him in the meantime.) He won't have to pay income tax on the money
until then, either.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone can squirrel away the whole bonus. Some
people put the money toward big-ticket necessities like a child's
college tuition. For Lesli Hicks, a media specialist with USAA Life
Insurance in San Antonio, where bonuses can be about 15 percent of
a worker's base salary, this year's check will help as she and her
husband pursue adopting a baby from China _ a process that they
expect will cost $15,000. ``Without the bonus we would be able to
do it eventually, but it would be longer in the making,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Herring's sons are married and out of the house, so she
feels free to spend her bonus on expensive toys. For Christmas one
year, Ms. Herring, a shipping manager at Sanders, bought her
husband a 1951 Ford to restore. Another year, she said, the couple
went touring on ``the biggest Harley you can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories contradict the conventional wisdom of compensation
experts and financial planners that it is human nature for
employees to start thinking of bonuses as entitlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall expectation is that they're going to get a bonus,
almost regardless of the success and prosperity of the country or
company,'' said Hrach Bedrosian, a New York University professor
and management consultant. ``When the bonus doesn't come through or
doesn't come through as large as expected, they're really put
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people say they have little choice but to think that way.
``I'd love to invest the money, and I would if I didn't need it so
badly,'' said Gina Szczepanski, a sales representative for USAA.
After contributing 10 percent to her church and paying her property
taxes, Ms. Szczepanski's plans for her bonus run to new tires and a
brake job for her car. Still digging out of debts left over from
her divorce two years ago, she said she didn't know what she would
do without the bonus money each year.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who are not in dire straits may be kidding themselves
when they say bonuses don't affect them: Without realizing it, they
may spend their regular pay more freely, on the unspoken assumption
that bonus checks will be there for rainy days. People may say they
don't count on a bonus, in order to keep from being disappointed if
it falls through, Bedrosian suggested. ``It's a way of saving face
or rationalizing if it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the rank and file has a better grip on its financial
best interests than it is usually given credit for.

REGULATORS LOOKING AT SPINNING OFF OF RESEARCH SUBSIDIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors in Peoplesoft, the large California software company,
opened their mail boxes this month to find a bonus: shares of stock
in Momentum Business Applications, the technology firm's new
subsidiary. True to its name, Momentum's stock almost doubled in
its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the new company, which shares office space with Peoplesoft,
has little more than a former Peoplesoft executive and $250 million
of Peoplesoft's cash. And anyone reading deep into the company's
documents will learn that Momentum expects significant losses as it
pays for the research that Peoplesoft wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept, of creating a new company for research and
then spinning much of it off to shareholders but retaining some
control, has been used in many industries in an attempt to improve
the bottom line. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies,
including Allergan Inc. and the Alza Corp. began setting up such
research companies several years ago. Expanding on their success,
investment bankers are now promoting the idea in other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Now the growing popularity of the approach has caught the
attention of federal securities regulators. Jane B. Adams, deputy
chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said
that she could not comment on transactions at any specific company
but added that regulators feared that some of the deals could
mislead investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is likely that there are some abusive transactions out
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals allow companies to transfer research costs to new
affiliates, while bolstering the parents' bottom lines. At times,
the parent companies record large, one-time charges for payments to
the subsidiaries, payments that Wall Street analysts often play
down, saying they mean little to the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams said that the commission had referred the matter to a
task force at the Financial Accounting Standards Board. That group,
the Emerging Issues Task Force, has authority from federal
regulators to write opinions that force public companies to change
the way they account for certain transactions. For example, the
task force could require companies to disclose many more details of
the research transactions in their financial statements, something
that could diminish the attractiveness of these deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is the main body
that sets the nation's accounting rules, has already agreed on a
proposal that would eliminate the loophole in the accounting rules
that the companies have been squeezing through. But that plan still
needs final approval, a process that could take more than a year.
The task force, however, could issue an opinion within months.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what moves, if any, regulators might take
against companies that have already completed these spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Paul A. Brooke, a stock analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, wrote a report about Alza Corp., a
pharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, Calif. Brooke said that
Alza's stock price was weak on Jan. 7 because of speculation that
regulators were raising questions about the company's accounting
for its research subsidiary, Crescendo Pharmaceuticals. Federal
regulators are reviewing Alza's financial statements as they decide
whether to approve its proposed accounting for a merger with Sequus
Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke said last week that regulators might ask Alza to disclose
more information about its transactions with Crescendo but he did
not expect the two companies to be forced to consolidate their
financial statements or to recombine their operations. Alza's stock
closed Thursday at $45.6875, well off its 52-week high of $54 on
Nov. 23. Crescendo's shares have risen 4.6 percent this year to
close Thursday at $14.25.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Alza said Thursday that company officials were
not immediately available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft says Momentum allows it to separate the risk of the
research from its core operations and allows shareholders to decide
whether to increase or decrease their own risk.
</P>
<P>
   At Peoplesoft Thursday , Kip Meintzer, who is in charge of
investor relations for Momentum, said that the relationship between
the two companies was clearly described to shareholders in
documents filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum is a separate entity,'' Meintzer said. ``Decisions
will be made by Momentum. It just happens that their main business
is from Peoplesoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft, whose earnings have sagged, said in documents filed
with the SEC that it created Momentum so it could spend more on
developing software.
</P>
<P>
   While Peoplesoft employees will create the programs, Momentum
will dip into its $250 million cash fund to pay for the work, and
even chip in an extra 5 percent or more to cover Peoplesoft's
administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum has two classes of shares. Peoplesoft owns all of
Momentum's B shares, which prohibits Momentum from merging,
liquidating or transferring assets without Peoplesoft's consent;
the A shares were distributed to Peoplesoft shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors in Momentum who have read the agreements between
Momentum and Peoplesoft see a payday if the research is fruitful.
Momentum will own any new software that is developed, and
Peoplesoft has an option to buy licenses for the products or to buy
back the portion of Momentum's stock it does not now own.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing requires Peoplesoft to buy back the shares or to pay
Momentum any more money, meaning the stock could become worthless
when Momentum's cash runs out. Peoplesoft has said that the $250
million should cover research for three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under accounting rules, companies must consolidate their
financial statements with those of any subsidiaries they control.
That requirement is intended to prevent parent companies from
simply shipping more goods to these units or entering into other
transactions simply to make their businesses look stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Peoplesoft and other companies say they are now allowed to keep
separate financial statements because they own less than 50 percent
of their subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board,
which sets the nation's accounting rules, has said it plans to
eliminate the 50 percent threshold and look more at the
relationships between the companies to determine the issue of
control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In documents sent to shareholders, Peoplesoft said that Merrill
Lynch, the Wall Street investment firm, had advised the company's
board last year on how to modify transactions done by
pharmaceutical companies to fit its needs. Merrill Lynch is to
receive $2.5 million for its financial advice and for its written
opinion that the deal was fair to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   About two months before the Momentum stock was issued,
Christopher C. Shilakes, a stock analyst at Merrill Lynch, issued a
report that said the Momentum spinoff was ``a positive long-term
move'' for Peoplesoft. Shilakes said that Peoplesoft and Momentum
shareholders would benefit from separate financial statements since
they would be aware of ``the degree of separation of these efforts
and the relative cleanliness of earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Shilakes noted in his report that Merrill Lynch would earn a fee
from the transaction and that a significant portion of the fee was
contingent on the deal's completion.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Momentum's A shares began trading on Jan. 19,
investors _ who may have been attracted by the company's plans to
develop software for use on the Internet _ quickly bid the price up
as high as $25.50. Thursday, the price closed at $11.25, down 25
cents. Stock in Peoplesoft has fallen 60 percent over the last
year, to $22.4375.

COLUMBIAN LEADER TAKES OVER QUAKE RECOVERY EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Facing the most urgent test of his five-
month-old administration, President Andres Pastrana personally
intervened Thursday, dispatching thousands of military troops to
restore order to this heavily damaged city and establishing a
dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of this earthquake is beyond what we could
imagine,'' Pastrana said during a &UR;  &LR; press conference after walking
through parts of downtown. ``Whoever wants to break the law will be
met with the fullest force of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As people and machinery continued to claw through dusty mounds
of brick and rubble Thursday, the official death toll rose to 881.
Authorities say more than 3,500 are injured. Some 200,000 were left
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to this city of roughly 300,000 people, where
bands of desperate and hungry residents looted stores on Wednesday,
Pastrana ordered 4,000 troops and national police to patrol
streets, and set up roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokeswoman in Bogata said the president's decision
to visit Armenia with his top emergency and military officials was
heavily influenced by news reports he saw on Wednesday showing
angry mobs tearing down storefront doors and shattering windows.
</P>
<P>
   Without running water or toilets, public health was also
becoming a serious concern.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the curfew, Pastrana banned liquor sales and said
he would announce an economic emergency and could impose a tax to
finance reconstruction in this hard-working heart of Colombia's
coffee country.
</P>
<P>
   To help rescue crews, Pastrana also ordered a moratorium on
traffic throughout the city, except for essential vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers from Miami-Dade County, Fla. recovered six bodies
Thursday from the remnants of a collapsed apartment building in the
south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens, if not hundreds, were still missing and efforts by Red
Cross and other relief workers to take inventory of families and
damaged homes was proceeding slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said 290 tons of humanitarian aid had been sent to the
region, which needs 150 tons of food daily. The military said it
was distributing 120,000 military rations to the hungry, but
officials clearly couldn't cope with the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food we've gotten is minuscule,'' said John Mairo Cohecha,
mayor of the neighboring town of Calarca.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana called on the world to help, especially with tents and
medicine, but significant international aid was still wanting.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the United Nations announced pledges of $2.7 million
Thursday, while the US Agency for International Development has
pledged $2 million in initial aid.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Colombians themselves had donated some $1.4 million
for quake relief, and Pastrana's aid organization, the Solidarity
Network, said 10,000 people had donated goods and shipped 190 tons
of supplies to Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up to our necks in bureaucracy, and that's what slowing
this up,'' a relief worker, too harried to identify himself, said
at Armenia's Eden Airport, which was bustling with incoming supply
flights Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aid _ everything from sacks of potatoes to boxes of shampoo
_ was trucked five miles to a warehouse, where it piled up because
there were too few workers and vehicles to get it to stricken
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake is the largest and most serious challege yet to
Pastrana's young presidency. A former television journalist, he was
elected last summer largely on his pledge to reopen peace talks
between the government and leftist rebels. Those talks stalled
earlier this month when rebels demanded the government put an end
to right wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's response _ relocating the seat of government to the
disaster area and taking charge of the operation _ is a gambit to
distract attention from the faltering peace talks with the FARC,
says Alfredo Rangel, a Colombian political analyst. ``He's trying
to reduce a little the effect of the problems of the suspension of
the peace dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its densely populated business and residential
districts, Armenia suffered the most extensive damage. More than
half the casualties from the temblor, 544, were from here,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of corpses Thursday remained unidentifed. They have been
collected at a basketball gymnasium on the grounds of the state
university where a temporary morgue has been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of bloated and bruised faces were displayed along a
wall to help relatives identify the unclaimed bodies. Three white
refrigerated trucks held most of the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how much longer we can keep the bodies here.''
said Juan Guillermo Gouzy, 35, a forensic doctor on the scene.
``Maybe we can wait until the weekend, but beyond that something
will have to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Alina Castro, arrived at the gym around midmorning and found the
body of her nephew, Carlos Martinez. She and her adult children
placed the body into a wooden casket _ a gift from the morgue _ and
strapped it to the top of their car.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later the Castro family brought the coffin to Jardinez
Armenia, the local cemetary.
</P>
<P>
   There in a common prayer service a priest sprinkled holy water
on Martinez's and six other caskets. Afterward they quietly carried
the casket to a fresh plot, where he was buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find him, and give him a respectful goodbye,''
Castro said, while holding her daughter's hand.

FOR FOX, IT'S HYPE-HYPE HURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the ways to define the word ``hype'' _ and
not even in relation to the Super Bowl _ is that it's the pursuit
of profit over performance and anticipation over delivery.
</P>
<P>
   We dredge up the annual media question concerning hype for the
greatest show on earth presented by the greatest TV sport in
America because, it seems, we have a new answer.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-hour-plus pregame show, thanks to those party animals at
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has 11 shows and 16 hours of Super Bowl programming _
including the Super Bowl itself _ in the 35 hours between 11 a.m.
Saturday and 8 p.m. Sunday. However, that doesn't count the Super
Bowl-themed episode of ``The Simpsons'' where News Corp. CEO Rupert
Murdoch and Fox broadcasters Pat Summerall and John Madden are
among the special guest voices.
</P>
<P>
   The title of that episode, by the way, is ``Sunday, Cruddy
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates are that Fox will take in as much as $180 million in
Super Bowl ad revenue from all day Sunday, which justifies all the
programming from a business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But from a content consideration ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going into an exercise in semantics, I'm not sure what
hype stands for... is it hyperbole?'' asked Fox network president
David Hill, not trying to sound hypersensitive when asked this week
if the endless amount of puffery justifies the means.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the term is short for hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's nothing hyperbolic about this,'' Hill continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the single-most-popular event in the world. People are
more concerned about its outcome than anything else. All we're
doing is what newspapers have been doing and that's mirroring the
public's interest. And in the final analysis, that's part of our
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ed Goren, Fox Sports' executive producer: ``The audience
tells you what is hype and what isn't. If they're buying the papers
and advertisers are buying ads in the supplements, it's not hype,
it's good business. And it's entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   With that said, maybe it's once in a blue moon over Miami _ and
check the calendar, 'cause that's what we're dealing with _ that a
Super Bowl pregame hypefest three hours longer than the previous
longest pregame hypefest can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Especially by those who put it on.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ackerson, Fox's pregame show producer, said he actually
had enough material to run another half-hour. There was discussion
about starting the whole carnivorous TV carnival an hour earlier
with an exercise show and a food show, but even Fox couldn't
stomach that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep in mind we don't expect a huge part of the
audience to watch all seven hours,'' said Ackerson. ``Anyone who
does _ my mom and dad could be the only persons _ might find they
have wasted their time. But if they do, they'll enjoy the broadcast
and get something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox analyst Madden, who helps fill in the pregame with his
90-minute ``All-Millennium Team'' that'll pull some Forrest Gump
movie magic and have him interview Vince Lombardi and includes
musical interludes with Ice Cube and Mack 10, admits that the hype
might be useful for this game since it'll help viewers learn about
the Atlanta Falcons players.
</P>
<P>
   Concludes Madden: ``With all the parties going on, what the heck
would you rather be doing leading up to the Super Bowl than
watching stuff about it? It's not as if you'd say, `Doggone, it's
Super Bowl Sunday, I'd like to watch some bowling.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, Super Bowling.
</P>
<P>
   More hype: Fox Sports Net _ especially Keith Olbermann _ should
benefit most from the overexposure at Super Bowl week events.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami to anchor the Super Bowl news while others stayed back
in Los Angeles, Olbermann also has a part in the pregame
festivities. He's hosting an ``All-Access'' (not ``All Excess'')
show Sunday at 9 a.m. that goes behind the scenes of Fox's
broadcast and intends to answer the question: How does a network
cover a game like this? Self-serving, maybe, but informational
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann also has a live Internet-only show at halftime on Fox
Sports' website (http://www.foxsports.com).
</P>
<P>
   But the Fox marketeers have more. More than 50,000 temporary
Olbermann tattoos have been distributed around the South Beach area
of Miami. Also, Good Humor trucks and pushcarts wrapped in the Fox
Sports News logo with Olbermann's face will give out more than
50,000 free ice cream treats this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which should provide a delirious irritant to more than just
skin-rashed, lactose-intolerant beach-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Even more hyperventilation: Hill was asked in a media conference
call if he was sensitive to a tune-out factor for folks who happen
to see Fox stars sitting in nice seats at the Super Bowl _ stars
who are there for overpromotion of entertainment programming. And,
basically, would we see fewer of those camera shots Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Hill said. ``A personality is a personality is a
personality. If you see Jack Nicholson at a Lakers game, you've got
to show him, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Except the difference is Jim Lampley's golf partner actually
bought his courtside seats and wasn't planted there by a network
pushing the next episode of ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which,
incidentally, has Jason Priestly hosting another one of the pregame
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you we haven't got Fox stars coming in on the TV
and movie side and we'll be taking shots of them,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we'll be taking shots at them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
_Remembering the ``other'' O.J.: In ESPN's SportsCentury project,
in which a panel of journalists picked the 100 greatest athletes of
the 20th century, O.J. Simpson has come in at No. 49. A half-hour
profile of the former USC and NFL star is featured today at 6 p.m.
in the weekly countdown to the top two, which will be shown on ABC
in late December. ESPN has taken some flak for it and will address
Simpson's off-field life in the show, but it's his athletic
achievements here that are being, uh, celebrated. Says former Rams
star Deacon Jones in the show: ``You gonna take all your cheers
back? Nothing he did outside the game has anything to do with his
contributions to the sport. Not one iota. Now, if you hate him over
here for what he was accused of, you understand, then hate him over
there, but over here you have to give him his dues.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
_A $14.95-per-game charge _ as an alternative to the
$39-per-package price that DirecTV is charging for its supplemental
coverage of CBS' first three rounds of the '99 NCAA Tournament.
Viewers who ordinarily wouldn't get the game they wanted now have
the option of watching it on the small satellite dish service. Buy
the entire package and the customer gets 34 games for $39, which is
by far the greater savings over the one-time buy games that loyal
fans would be more inclined to take. The other interesting aspect:
DirecTV's recent merger with PrimeStar does not affect this
package, but both services are going to be offering ``NBA League
Pass'' for $69 through Feb. 11. There's also a free preview week
starting Feb. 5 that gives subscribers up to 40 NBA games. &QL; 
_A new stack of ballots in the Daily News ``Q-T'' sportscaster poll
has resulted in the postponement of releasing the results. We
apologize.

MISUNDERSTANDING OF WORD EMBARRASSES WASHINGTON'S NEW MAYOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an incident that has become an embarrassment to
the fledgling mayoral administration here, Washington's new black
mayor, Anthony Williams, has accepted the resignation of his new
ombudsman, who is white, after the aide's use of the word
``niggardly'' was construed as a racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   The recently appointed head of the Mayor's Office of the Public
Advocate, David Howard, used the word in a Jan. 15 budget
discussion with two co-workers, saying, ``I will have to be
niggardly with this fund because it's not going to be a lot of
money.'' Linguists say that word, which means `miserly,' is derived
from a Scandinavian word and has no racial overtones or link to the
racial slur it sounds like.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Howard resigned earlier this week, he was being
inundated with calls from blacks in the District of Columbia who
believed he had used the actual racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the incident has captured national attention, divided some
black leaders, incensed conservatives and outraged the gay
community, where there is feeling that Williams should have given
Howard, his first openly gay appointee, a minute to explain before
sending him on his way.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NAACP chairman Julian Bond weighed in, saying it
was Williams who had been ``niggardly in his judgment on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to think you have to censor your language to meet
other people's lack of understanding,'' he said. ``This whole
episode speaks loudly to where we are on issues of race. Both real
and imagined slights are catapulted to the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   When Howard, a 44-year-old former restaurant manager who ran
Williams' volunteer office during the campaign, offered his
resignation, the mayor immediately accepted. Said Williams later:
``I think it was appropriate that he resign,'' and he compared what
Howard said to getting ``caught smoking in a refinery that resulted
in an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, some community leaders are arguing that anyone insensitive
enough to use a word that could be so easily misconstrued should be
out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really know where the Norwegians got the word?'' asked
Keith Watters, past president of the mostly black National Bar
Association. ``And how would another ethnic group react if you came
close to the line with a phrase inappropriate to that group?''
</P>
<P>
   Others are pleading for a little compassion.
</P>
<P>
   H. Patrick Swygert, president of Howard University, said he
hoped people would realize that they needed to ``at least count to
three'' before jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, we're at a point in time that even an official who
as far as I can see has no history of this kind of conduct still
has no opportunity to put this in context,'' he said. ``It would
appear there was no intent to inflict pain. Should this be fatal
for a budding public official? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the issue was a hot one on conservative talk radio,
where it inspired fresh outrage on the excesses of political
correctness. ``Some poor overeducated slob loses his job over a
Swedish word and Bill Clinton keeps his job after perjury and
obstruction of justice,'' conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh
said on the radio Thursday. ``Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sol Steinmetz, a New York lexicographer and former editorial
director of Random House reference division, said that for the
record, the word goes back to the 14th century Scandinavian
``niggard,'' meaning miser, thus preceding by hundreds of years the
circa 1700 Latin word ``niger,'' or black, that the offensive term
derives from. ``There's no connection between the two,'' Steinmetz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in another recent dust-up over the same word, The Dallas
Morning News last month ran an apologetic clarification after using
the word in a restaurant review that accused a black chef of being
``niggardly'' with his use of spices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chunk of our readers apparently did not know what the word
meant and took it as a racial reference,'' said Stuart Wilk, the
paper's managing editor. ``It wasn't a good word to use. We're in
the communication business and in 1999 that word does not
communicate as well as some other equally good words.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Howard, he is so contrite that he sounds apologetic about
even knowing the word. ``I learned it for my SAT test as a junior
in high school,'' he says, miserably.
</P>
<P>
   He remains loyal to the mayor and is spending most of his time
at home kicking himself, he says, saying he deserves to be out of a
job over such an inelegant word choice. He said he had not heard
from anyone in the mayor's office since resigning on Monday, but
offered, ``I've been on the phone a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And he fairly begged that the mayor not be blamed for accepting
his resignation. ``I used bad judgment in using the word niggardly.
It's an arcane word that's unfamiliar to a lot of people and I can
see how someone not familiar with the word could perceive it
differently. You have to be able to see things from the other
person's shoes and I did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that immediately after using the word, he saw the
startled looks on the faces of both of his colleagues in the
meeting, one white and one black. The white colleague, Jack
Fanning, seemed to accept his explanation, he said, while the
other, Marshall Brown, stormed out and would not let him explain.
(Neither could be reached for comment either at home or work, where
the mayor's new redesigned ombudsman's office wasn't answering.)
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Howard seemed heartbroken that he could have anything to
do with worsening already fragile race relations in Washington. And
certainly, he never intended to end up as a poster boy for a
crusade against political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is not fighting for his job, others are. In a letter
to the mayor, 22 local gay activists furious on his behalf wrote,
``The facts have to count. If we fail to distinguish between decent
people and bigoted people, if we acquiesce in treating the former
like the latter, then we sent a poisonous message to the people of
this city, not to mention an illiterate message to our
schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David Howard is the one owed an apology,'' said Rick
Rosendall, a prominent gay activist who signed the letter. ``The
mayor has been making incredibly lame statements defending the fact
that he accepted his resignation without even looking into it
first. The fact that he would cave in like this doesn't bode well
for his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   At a community meeting Thursday night, Williams walked away from
a reporter who asked him about the matter. A spokeswoman, Peggy
Armstrong, said only that ``his position is that in this
environment it may have been poor judgment for someone in his
position to use that word, and based on that, he accepted his
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the gay groups, Williams has said he will
review the situation, to see if there was any wrongdoing by Howard,
and may offer him a different city post if there was not. The
review is to be completed quickly, by next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests some instability'' on Williams' part, said City
Council member Kevin Chavous. Chavous suggested that there must be
more to the story, or Williams would surely not have accepted the
resignation. But in any case, ``I don't think the mayor's being
decisive enough on this'' he said. ``Where does it end?''

BOMB EXPLODES NEAR CAPE TOWN'S MAIN POLICE STATION, WOUNDING 11  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A bomb, the third in five months,
went off in central Cape Town on Thursday, wounding 11 people at
the doors of the city's main police station.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for the bomb, which the police
tentatively said was a pipe bomb left in a garbage can outside the
Caledon Square station. They said they were questioning two people,
whom they did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the wounded, none of whom were police officers, had
serious burns or shrapnel injuries. Shards from the garbage can
littered the street next to a khaki VW Beetle with holes blown in
it and police cars with their windows shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which took place just after 1 p.m., came one day
after the official announcement of a police plan to return peace to
the Cape Town area, where a three-way conflict pits the police,
criminal gangs and conservative Muslim vigilantes against one
another. The gangs, which are rich with drug money, and the
vigilantes are both based in the huge mixed-race Cape Flats
neighborhoods along the airport highway.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-race South Africans are of many religions, but hundreds of
thousands are descendants of Malaysian slaves brought here by the
Dutch in the 18th century, and are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The vigilantes, most prominently a Muslim group calling itself
People Against Gangsterism and Drugs, are suspected of setting off
as many as 80 bombs in the last year in an attempt to kill drug
dealers, police officers and moderate Muslim leaders and to damage
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   They began operations about two years ago and came to wide
public attention when a gang leader was shot dead and set on fire
as he tried to force his way through a crowd demonstrating outside
his house against drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the group has been taken over by hard-liners from an
organization called Qibla, and is thought to have spun off less
secretive groups calling themselves Muslims Against Global
Oppression and Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They are suspected of two recent blasts on the Victoria &AMP; Alfred
Waterfront, a popular tourist spot. The first exploded in a packed
Planet Hollywood restaurant on Aug. 25, killing two people and
wounding 25.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of those hurt were Britons and South Africans, it
was thought to be aimed at a symbol of the United States, which had
just fired cruise missiles into Afghanistan and Sudan in
retaliation for the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The second, on Jan. 1, blew up cars outside a theater that was
to show ``The Siege,'' an American film in which the villains are
Muslim terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in any of the blasts, but the police
said the two bombs and those used against drug dealers and police
substations all had design similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been trying to infiltrate the vigilante group,
with little apparent success. On Jan. 14, Capt. Bennie Lategan, one
of the chief investigators, was shot dead in his car.

 &HT;    Witnesses to appear before Senate, against complaints of
extending impeachment trial
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans muscled through a plan Thursday
that opens the door for Monica Lewinsky to appear before the Senate
in person or in videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP framework, President Clinton's impeachment trial
could end by Feb. 12 _ provided the Senate doesn't grant any more
requests for witnesses from either Clinton's defense lawyers or
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The party line vote, taken just a day after a party line vote to
extend the trial with deposition testimony from three witnesses,
represented a setback for Senate Democrats who pushed an alternate
plan to explicitly exclude videotape testimony or live witnesses on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   On a party line vote, the Senate also defeated a Democratic
amendment that would have dispensed with taking depositions
altogether and moved to closing arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that their plan could lead to a fair and
relatively quick end to the trial, but Democrats said it could lead
to delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their resolution calls for a date certain, but with all sorts
of provision for delay,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the
Democratic minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Ore.), an architect of the GOP plan, said
he gave the Senate better than even odds of finishing on or before
Feb. 12, the start of the President's Day recess.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors will begin deposing Lewinsky on Monday,
Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan on Tuesday and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal on Wednesday, according to White House spokesman
Jim Kennedy. The agreement calls for the depositions to be
supervised by two senators appointed by Lott and Daschle and
concluded Wednesday. Each deposition will last eight hours, with
four hours for prosecutors and four hours for White House defense
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was not directly involved in any of the back and
forth that led to the trial plan, but communicated some of their
concerns to Daschle throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy condemned the GOP plan for leaving what he called ``trap
doors'' for extending the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans do not have the votes to end this presidency,
but they do have the votes to extend this trial indefinitely,''
said Kennedy. ``The spirit of bipartisanship that has characterized
these proceedings has evaporated, leaving a Republican impeachment
trial in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not decided whether it will exercise its
right to call witnesses, thereby extending the trial even further,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will not meet again as a court of impeachment until
Feb. 4 while the depositions are taken and senators have an
opportunity to watch the videotapes of the three depositions. White
House lawyers and House prosecutors will also have an opportunity
to resolve objections raised in the depositions during the week
that the court is in recess.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan requires a vote of the Senate to allow any of the
deposition transcripts and videotapes into the impeachment record,
a vote that would in effect make the materials public.
</P>
<P>
   Separate votes would also be required to allow for live
testimony from any of the three witnesses deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial plan leaves open the question of whether or not the
Senate will vote to depose additional witnesses. White House
lawyers will have 24 hours after Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal
are deposed to submit a request for their own witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If the House prosecutors want to call additional witnesses, they
will have to submit their request to Lott and Daschle. Daschle said
the agreement as worded required he and Lott to agree on the
witness request, but Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said
he believed Lott could make a witness request on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the agreement makes it more difficult for the
managers to call more witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to make the case for more witnesses, it's
going to have to be a pretty important need,'' Hatch said. ``I
don't expect any additional witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were clearly upset at the prospect that Lewinsky might
ultimately make her way into the trial, either in person or in
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about live witnesses,'' Daschle said.
``We don't want the spectacle of Monica Lewinsky or any one else''
on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also argued that Republicans had left open the
possibility that ``salacious material'' would find its way to the
floor of the Senate, despite a pledged by prosecutors to avoid
questioning Lewinsky about the details of her sexual relationship
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (R-Vt.) said, ``In depositions, lawyers often
go far afield.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Republican senators said videotaping the
depositions might actually reduce the likelihood that Lewinsky or
other witnesses would be called to testify in person.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could vote to play the videotape of the depositions,
rather than call the witnesses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we want witnesses yet,'' said Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.). But as for videotaped depositions, he said,
``What's the fear? Let's hear what they have to say, maybe it's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also upset that the Republican plan did not
explicitly rule out the chance for senators to introduce a
so-called finding of fact motion. Such a motion would say that
Clinton was guilty of the charges as alleged in the articles of
impeachment, but not remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue such a maneuver would be unconstitutional, and
some Republicans have expressed skepticism about such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle worked throughout the day Thursday to come up
with a mutual agreement that would see the trial to conclusion. But
gaping differences emerged on the question of videotape testimony,
the prospect of live witnesses and the fixing of a firm end date to
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders called off their negotiations in the afternoon and
headed to a vote at about 5:30. The Democratic amendment to
preclude videotape testimony and additional witnesses was defeated
54-44, with Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and Wayne Allard
(R-Colo.) absent.
</P>
<P>
   The second Democratic motion to short circuit the trial and move
to closing arguments was defeated 55-43, with Sen. Russ Feingold
(D-Wis.) voting with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Final passage of the Republican plan prevailed 54 to 44. On this
vote, Feingold voted with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were quick to characterize the vote as ``the
Republican plan,'' neither party engaged in much overt sniping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody got 100 percent of what they wanted,'' Lott said. ``I'm
smiling. I'm not ranting and raving and .... blasting (Democrats)
for this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) said,''It's become a partisan
matter. It never should have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Democrats want to end it,'' said Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). ``The Republicans want to extend it.''

GOP CONGRESSMAN FEELS CONSTITUENTS' IRE OVER HIS IMPEACHMENT VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (bl) 
By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Rep. Tom Campbell knew his vote to impeach
President Clinton would make some people unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when he was part of a small group of moderate
Republicans who had not declared which way they would vote, the
majority of the thousands of calls to his office were against
impeachment. His vote to impeach in, Campbell acknowledged then,
might hurt him politically in this traditionally Democratic
district.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Campbell, who was handily re-elected in November in a
district that includes parts of San Jose and the rest of Silicon
Valley, is beginning to see how unhappy people are with him, and
just how much it might hurt.
</P>
<P>
   As he described it, he has been inundated with protest calls and
e-mail, and not just from Democrats. Some local Republicans are
switching parties and organizing to defeat him in 2000, convincing
him that the impeachment vote will be an issue here in the 15th
Congressional District in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition my vote has engendered is by far the most I've
ever received on one vote,'' Campbell said. ``The only vote that
comes near it is when I voted for the Persian Gulf war.''
</P>
<P>
   His situation may be a sign that there is trouble ahead for
other Republican moderates, who are usually in districts with a
high proportion of swing voters. Campbell has long been known as a
political independent who could be relied on to rise above partisan
politics _ voting against Newt Gingrich's re-election as House
speaker, for example. Now, voters who have relied on him in the
past say he bowed to political pressure in what he himself said was
the most important vote he could cast.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable among his angry constituents is Republicans Against
Campbell, made up, thus far, of a core group of 12 professors at
Stanford University, where Campbell is on the law school faculty.
Gerald Fisher, a visiting professor of physics, said the group,
which believes that Republicans have used the president's affair
with Monica Lewinsky as an excuse to try to subvert his
re-election, considered Campbell ``a lame duck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of my colleagues put it, we're his base,'' said Fisher,
who is creating a list of potential contenders for Campbell's House
seat. ``If he has lost the confidence and support of his home base
_ and I don't know anyone who isn't disgusted with him _ then he's
finished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials of the Democratic Party in Santa Clara County, which
includes a large part of Campbell's district, are a little more
circumspect. But they said that in recent weeks they had been
flooded with calls from Republicans who said they wanted to switch
parties, so many that the Democratic Party is planning ``conversion
registration days'' in front of Campbell's district office as soon
as next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really angry,'' said Steven Preminger, the party
chairman. ``They're not simply angry at the Republicans; they're
angry especially at Tom Campbell because they think that as a
moderate, he paved the way for the president's impeachment by
giving the vote credibility, leading to what Clinton is facing now
in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Campbell, Republican Party officials in the district
(where Democrats hold a 45 percent to 37 percent advantage over
Republicans in party registration ) said they had not seen any
significant backlash against the congressman or the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Abbott, treasurer of the Santa Clara County Republican
Party central committee, said he had not noticed a swing in the
party's registration, though the county registrar has reported a
recent drop of 643 Republicans (and 247 Democrats).
</P>
<P>
   ``People are dropped from rolls for all kinds of reasons,''
Abbott said. ``People move. There are deaths. There are all kinds
of reasons. But a switch of that few voters will not affect the
standing that Campbell has in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are small for a district with a quarter million
registered voters. But interviews with a dozen Republicans in
Campbell's district who have switched parties or plan to suggests
that disenchanted voters will not forget the impeachment come the
next election.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Pinther of San Jose, a 68-year-old retired restaurant owner
and lifelong Republican, said he would like to actively campaign
against Campbell. ``What does `representative' mean, anyway?''
Pinther said. ``Does it mean they represent us? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dumas, 48, a sheet metal worker in Santa Clara who plans
to switch parties before the next election, said he thought the
last straw was when the president was actually impeached. ``I
didn't think it was going to happen,'' Dumas said. ``But now, it
has just dragged on and on. It has reached ludicrous proportions. I
think this is going to be remembered for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Isom, 65, a mother of three in San Jose who said she
comes from a long line of Republicans, voted a straight Democratic
ticket in November ``as a protest'' and switched parties after
Campbell's impeachment vote. ``I've really had it with the
Republicans,'' Ms. Isom said. ``They think that people are going to
forget about this in 2000, but I know I'm not. I've never actively
campaigned, but I think I may. I think all the Republicans should
be voted out and replaced with people who don't just follow the
herd.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the impeachment vote, Campbell enjoyed a reputation as a
true representative of Silicon Valley, where voters tend to be
fiscally conservative but socially progressive. Campbell was one of
only nine Republicans who voted against Gingrich's re-election as
the House speaker in 1996. He has supported civil rights bills that
mandated racial quotas, and a bipartisan campaign finance reform
bill that was killed by Republican House leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to the House in 1988 in the 12th District,
where he became known as the most liberal Republican from
California. In 1992, he left the House to run for the Senate, lost
in a primary, and was elected to the state Senate. He returned to
the House in the 15th District in 1995 after a special election and
was elected to a full term in 1996. In California, he is most
famous for drafting an initiative (passed as Proposition 198 in
March 1996) that allows voters of any party to vote for the
candidates of their choice in any primary.
</P>
<P>
   Although every Republican in the House voted for Clinton's
impeachment and every Democrat voted against it, Campbell said that
in his case, he was not voting the party line. He voted for
impeachment, he said, because Clinton broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never received one iota of pressure from the Republicans,''
he said. ``All the pressure came from the Democratic side. I got
calls from two Cabinet members, Steve Jobs and Robert DeNiro, all
telling me the White House asked them to call.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he still believed he voted the right way: ``Oh,
absolutely. Without a doubt.''

WORLD BANK CUTS OFF LOANS TO 2 BRAZILIAN STATES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The World Bank on Thursday froze
development loans to two Brazilian states that are locked in an
economic war with the central government.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear bid to support the beleaguered government of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the lender held up $209
million in development loans for works already in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it was cutting off the states of Minas Gerais and
Rio Grande do Sul for a series of projects, including programs to
improve education, reduce pollution and combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Minas Gerais, former Brazilian President Itamar
Franco, triggered the crisis by suspending payments on $13.5
billion of debt to the federal government for 90 days. Olivio
Dutra, governor of Rio Grande do Sul from the opposition Workers
Party, is paying his state's debt into an escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   The two state governments defend their actions by saying that
they inherited deficit-ridden administrations after elections last
October, and that they risk not being able to pay their normal
operating expenses. The challenge of Franco, who has gone from
political ally to foe of Cardoso, set off a wave of defiance by
other governors.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Menzes, a spokeswoman for Franco, said that state
officials were awaiting a Supreme Court ruling concerning federal
funds that are being withheld from Minas Gerais, and that the bank
had not commented on the World Bank's decision. Dutra could not be
reached for comment, but his office said earlier that it would seek
a judicial ruling to bar the federal government from telling
international agencies that there was a risk of default.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said the money for projects in both states would
be withheld for 60 days, and would be reviewed if the states
restored direct payments on their debt to the federal government.

AUGUST EVERDING, 70, DIRECTOR OF HAMBURG AND MUNICH OPERAS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Germany, England)  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   August Everding, the German opera director and administrator who
once ran the Munich and Hamburg State Opera companies and created
five productions for the Metropolitan Opera, died Wednesday in a
Munich, Germany, hospital. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Everding died following a long illness, officials at the
Bavarian Theater Academy said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the productions Everding developed for the Met was, in
1985, Mussorgsky's ``Khovanschina,'' which returns to the Met in
March. Although he employed the latest stage technology and
innovative lighting designs in his productions, Everding considered
himself fundamentally a traditionalist. He brought to his work a
wide range of knowledge, rich artistic experience and a gregarious
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Everding was born on Oct. 31, 1928, in Bottrop, Germany. He
studied the piano, philosophy, theology and dramaturgy at the
Universities of Bonn and Munich. He first worked in the theater,
becoming the director of the Muenchner Kammerspiele from 1963 until
1973. During this period, he began directing opera, including the
world premiere of the English composer Humphrey Searle's ``Hamlet''
at the Hamburg State Opera in 1968. He became the resident director
there in 1973, then accepted the post of General Intendant of the
Munich State Opera in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in several international houses, including the
Bayreuth festival in Germany and the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, in
London. His Met debut came in 1971 with a visually breathtaking and
widely acclaimed production of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde.'' He
next directed Mussorgsky's ``Boris Gudonov'' in 1974. Two years
later, he directed a new production of Wagner's ``Lohengrin,'' with
sets by Ming Cho Lee, which the New York Times critic Harold C.
Schonberg called the ``most striking `Lohengrin' ever to be seen in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   This was replaced last season with a production by Robert Wilson
that got a decidedly mixed reception. His last directorial work at
the Met was Wagner's ``Fliegende Hollaender in 1989, perhaps
Everding's most boldly abstract work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Everding was a top candidate to replace Anthony Bliss
as general manager of the Met. He was of the old school, used to
supervising all aspects of the companies he was associated with.
News reports at the time suggested that Everding was concerned that
James Levine, who had been appointed the artistic director the
previous year, would have exclusive say over artistic matters,
though Everding publicly denied this, saying that he and Levine had
worked together and were ``good friends.'' He eventually took his
name out of contention and the job went to Bruce Crawford, who
served until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Everding is survived by his wife, Gustava, and four sons.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Everding in rehearsal for the Met's ``Lohengrin'' in
1976, the critic Peter G. Davis described him in The New York Times
as ``a short, stocky prancing Pickwickian figure whose extra
reserves of nervous energy are taken out on chewing his large,
floppy necktie.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Everding was engaged as the artistic
director for the German display at the World's Fair planned in
Hanover in 2000.

FOR GAY MEN, HIV PERIL AND RISING DRUG USE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (sw) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Phillip, a 41-year-old gay man in Atlanta, had always
been scrupulously safe in his sexual practices until one night last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Normally somewhat straitlaced, Phillip went that night to a
Midtown club and decided to cut loose. ``I'm not even a big
drinker,'' he said, speaking on the condition that he be identified
only by his first name. ``But sometimes I can let my hair down and
I decided that this was going to be one of those nights.'' After a
few drinks, he met a man he liked and invited him home.
</P>
<P>
   During sex, Phillip's partner offered him a few snorts of
ketamine, or ``K,'' an animal anesthetic that has become an
immensely popular party drug on the gay club scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely relaxed me,'' Phillip said, recalling that he
got so stoned he could not stand up. ``I know that it took away my
inhibitions because I did some things I would never do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those things, Phillip later realized in horror, was
sharing a condom with his partner, a practice that can facilitate
the transmission of HIV. And ever since then, Phillip has lived in
terror that he contracted the potentially deadly virus that causes
AIDS,
</P>
<P>
   Two HIV tests have come back negative, but given the virus'
approximate six-month incubation period he will not be out of the
woods for several more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just going to be one night of fun for me,'' Phillip
said, ``but it turned into a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS caseworkers, doctors and therapists say they are hearing
stories like Phillip's more and more frequently in Atlanta. And
their counterparts in other cities echo their growing concern about
the connections between HIV infection and the use of recreational
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The use of inhibition-relaxing drugs, they say, is compounding
another alarming trend noted by researchers and social workers in
the AIDS field. With new drug therapies showing remarkable success
in controlling HIV before it progresses into full-blown AIDS, some
gay men have grown disturbingly complacent about safe sex practices
in recent years, studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on Thursday, the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said complacency caused by medical
advances and improved HIV drugs were at least partly responsible
for an increase in risky sexual behavior among gay men, and
particularly among young gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the number of gay men in San Francisco who
reported having unprotected anal sex increased to 39 percent in
1997 from 30 percent in 1994. Those who said they had unprotected
sex with multiple partners grew to 33 percent from 24 percent, with
men 25 and under accounting for the largest increase.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are using recreational drugs, typically young men in
their 20s and 30s, often are also those most susceptible to
complacency, said Helene D. Gayle, director of the National Center
for HIV, STD and TB Prevention, an arm of the disease control
agency in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That age group tends to use alcohol and recreational drugs most
aggressively, often to escape the stigma and confusion associated
with their newly embraced homosexuality, Dr. Gayle said. Because
they have come of age at a time when the death and debilitation
caused by AIDS is less visible in the United States than it once
was, young gay men are also more likely to ignore warnings about
the perils of unsafe sex, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between recreational drug use and HIV has been
apparent for years, but has often gone unaddressed because of a
greater focus on the HIV risks associated with needle drugs.
Officials with some AIDS groups said there had also been resistance
by gay people to discussing the problem because of a fear of
creating the perception that gays use drugs disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to talk about things in the gay community that don't
make us look good,'' said Mark S. King, the director of education
and communication at AID Atlanta, this city's largest AIDS service
organization. ``We like being portrayed on TV as the doctor or
lawyer. We're into positive role models and we don't want to be
portrayed as drug users.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the topic has gained public exposure. In
New York late last month, the AIDS service group Gay Men's Health
Crisis canceled its second-largest fund-raising event, a Fire
Island social gathering known as the Morning Party, in response to
criticism that it encouraged illegal drug use and unsafe sex. In
Seattle, the Northwest AIDS Foundation recently distributed 10,000
pamphlets explaining the links between party drugs and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, AID Atlanta kicked off an aggressive new
educational campaign on the nexus between drug use and unsafe sex.
The group grew concerned after seeing a 50 percent increase last
year in HIV tests that yielded positive results, to 2.7 percent of
4,144 tests in 1998 from 1.8 percent of 4,290 tests in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the group has no statistical proof, its leaders said
anecdotal evidence suggested that much of the increase had been
among young gay men and that many had become careless about sex
while high on libido-enhancing drugs like ecstasy (``X''), gamma
hydroxybutyrate (``GHB''), ketamine and crystal methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear it over and over again from people testing positive,''
King said. ``They say, `Oh, that must have been the weekend I don't
remember.'''
</P>
<P>
   AID Atlanta has produced a series of seven advertisements that
will appear in gay publications and as posters in gay bars and
clubs. ``Taking risks with drugs or alcohol means your sex could be
risky too,'' one typical ad says.
</P>
<P>
   The group kicked off its educational effort last Wednesday night
with a forum called ``Buzzed: A Gay Men's Forum on Party Drugs,''
which was held in the auditorium of an Atlanta high school. Some 70
people attended, and the discussion clearly illuminated the
severity of the problem. All of the questions asked by audience
members concerned the pharmacology of various drugs. None concerned
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you take ecstasy and anti-depressants at the same time?''
one person asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible to have a chemical dependence on ketamine?''
another asked.
</P>
<P>
   Although the speakers at the forum made a point of not
moralizing about drug use, they said after the event that they were
disturbed by the cavalier attitudes of the questioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was thinking about what they could use to cause the
least amount of damage and get the best high,'' said Charles R.
Dickey, an Atlanta psychotherapist who served as a panelist.
</P>
<P>
   AID Atlanta does not maintain that drug use has necessarily
increased among gay men. But it does say that the use of
inhibition-relaxing drugs is feeding the complacency generated by
lower AIDS rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's young folks did not grow up in the trenches of
watching people die,'' said Dickey, whose clientele is
predominantly gay. ``They don't see Kaposi's sarcoma. They don't
see people wasting away. Back in the old days, when people were
dropping like flies, there was real fear. Now people think HIV is
no big deal, that it's like diabetes. You take some pills and it's
no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so what we're seeing is that people's guards have been let
down, and then the use of recreational drugs is an avenue that
lowers inhibitions even more. People do things they ordinarily
wouldn't do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Lee R. Anisman, an Atlanta physician who treats a large
number of gay patients, said he saw a significant correlation in
his practice between substance abuse, unsafe sexual behavior and an
increased prevalence of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it every single week,'' Anisman said. ``There are so
many people who come into my office and say, `I was out this
weekend, I got high on cocaine, I was high on GHB, I was high on
acid, I was at a sex party with tons of different guys, none of
them were using rubbers, and I have no idea what happened to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Because states are required to collect data on AIDS but not on
HIV, it is unknown whether HIV is on the rise among gay men. But
several recent studies, including a number that have found alarming
increases in cases of gonorrhea in gay men, suggest that both the
prevalence of HIV and of risky sexual behavior remain high among
young gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my travels around the country, I've encountered a number of
young gay men who are cavalier in their attitude about both
recreational drug use and HIV risk,'' said Daniel Zingale,
executive director of AIDS Action, a national advocacy group. ``We
saw one generation of gay men nearly decimated, and to see a new
generation complacent about it is just disheartening.''

 &HT;    Witnesses to be grilled on past words
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors prepared Thursday to
question a trio of witnesses in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton as a dispute raged over whether those witnesses would be
allowed to testify in the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Senators met behind closed doors to settle the growing discord
over whether the prosecutors should be allowed to call former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, presidential confidant Vernon Jordan
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats sternly oppose live testimony, while the
Republican conference appeared divided on whether live testimony
should be heard after the depositions are taken.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate is divided along partisan lines over whether to
allow the videotaped depositions to be shown on the floor.
Depositions begin Monday with Lewinsky. Jordan follows on Tuesday
and Blumenthal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say the difference between live testimony and a
videotape of a deposition is immeasurable. They have been lobbying
senators for permission to bring the witnesses to the floor to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   They are now focusing their attention on winning approval for
videotaped depositions to be played on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live testimony from the witness would make the case,'' said
Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R.-Ark.), one of the prosecutors in charge of
the deposition of Vernon Jordan, the presidential confidant and
golfing partner. ``It limits the interaction between the questioner
and the witness. It's a little frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson flew home to Arkansas on Thursday, planning to spend
the weekend with his family and preparing questions for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said he planned to ask Jordan about what he did to
help Lewinsky land a job in New York City after her affair with the
president had gradually come to a close in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most complex area in the obstruction charge,'' said
Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney. ``I am going through the
transcripts looking for new areas that will be assessed. I want to
present the facts in a way that will tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   That story will begin with Dec. 19, 1997, the day Lewinsky
received a subpoena to answer questions in a civil lawsuit filed by
Paula Corbin Jones, the former Arkansas state employee who alleged
that the president made an unwanted sexual advance toward her.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Lewinsky met Jordan and they rode to her attorney's
office. En route, she discussed the subpoena and her job search.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Lewinsky contacted Jordan to discuss the
subpoena. He put her in touch with a private attorney who prepared
her affidavit for the Jones lawsuit. In that affidavit, Lewinsky
denied having a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson will then go through the subsequent twists and turns
in her job search.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinksy will be questioned by Rep. Ed Bryant (R-Tenn.), a
former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also flew home Thursday. Before he could attend to his
questions for Lewinsky, he had to deal with the damage caused by a
tornado that ripped through Clarksville, Tenn., last week. Bryant
spent most the afternoon talking to federal officials about
assisting residents and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky testifies, Bryant is expected to ask her about the
affidavit that she filed in the Jones lawsuit. Specifically, Bryant
will try to use her testimony to rebut the White House lawyers'
defense of the president that he did not lie about never having
``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal will be questioned by Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.).
Rogan is expected to interview him about what the president said to
him in a private conversation on Jan. 21, 1998, the day the scandal
broke in the media.
</P>
<P>
   In that conversation, according to Blumenthal's earlier
testimony, the president denied having an affair with Lewinsky and
characterized her as a ``stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is expected to also question Blumenthal about what
Republicans describe as the White House conspiracy to defame
Lewinsky by planting spurious stories about her in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to the truth. The truth will come from the
witnesses, not the lawyers covering the case,'' said Rogan, a
former state prosecutor and judge.

REPUBLICANS APPROVE PLAN FOR FINISHING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a party line vote, Senate Republicans forced
through a plan on Thursday for finishing President Clinton's
impeachment trial that opens the door for Monica Lewinsky, or her
videotaped image, to appear before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan also keeps alive a proposal to vote on a
finding of facts that the president committed perjury and
obstructed justice, separate from the vote on whether to convict
him and remove him from office. Democrats have called the idea
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic proposal to move directly to a vote on the two
articles of impeachment themselves, was rejected 55-43, with a
single Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, opposing the
effort to halt the trial. A Democratic plan that would have barred
display in the Senate of videotaped testimony was also defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden series of showdown votes, which ran virtually along
party lines, came after two days of behind-the-scenes negotiations
failed to produce a bipartisan plan to depose Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal and bring the trial to an end by Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican trial plan was approved 54-44 after an
alternative Democratic plan was rejected by an identical vote. Two
senators _ Wayne Allard, R-Colo., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. _
were absent.
</P>
<P>
   The White House complained bitterly. ``This resolution is
written in a way that leaves the doors wide open to extend this
trial for an indefinite future and on any issues the majority
chooses,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said.
``The Republican majority had a chance today to test the case the
House managers and independent counsel had made and vote up or down
on the articles, and once again they chose to extend the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Threatening that the White House itself would now delay the
process, he said the president's lawyers would prepare for a
vigorous defense, including the possibility of extensive discovery
and defense witnesses. He said the White House would make no
concessions to accelerate the trial and reach a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, insisted,
however, that there was now the ``likelihood'' that the trial could
be finished on Feb. 12 unless ``various and sundry motions
intervene.'' He said, ``That's our goal, and we have set in motion
a process that very likely would get us there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for depositions to be taken on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial will reconvene on Thursday, when it can
take up a motion to receive the videotaped depositions in evidence.
While the Senate can still hear a motion for more witnesses or
evidence to be heard before the Senate, Democrats won the
concession that such a motion can only be made by Lott and Daschle
jointly. That in effect gives the Democrats veto power over any
push by House prosecutors for another round of witnesses. THe White
House is then granted up to 24 hours to decide whether it wants to
propose new evidence or witnesses for a Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The plan sets Feb. 12 at noon as the target for a final vote on
the articles of impeachment but leaves open the possibility that
the schedule could slip if witnesses are called.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate acted Thursday night only after it had convened and
recessed twice as Republicans and Democrats huddled in party
caucuses and Lott and Daschle handed proposals back and forth.
``We're making progress,'' Lott said at midday. He said the
disputes had narrowed to two or three points which he described
as``very esoteric, legalistic sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats called the areas of contention quite serious and
said they were determined to try to block the videotaped
depositions from public view and close off the possibility of
witnesses appearing in the Senate chamber. They were particularly
concerned about Ms. Lewinsky, whose testimony, with investigators
or before the grand jury, recounting the story of her affair with
the president, has never been seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about salacious material, material that has no
place on the Senate floor,'' Daschle said. ``We don't need to have
Monica Lewinsky or anyone else talking in the well of the Senate
about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said the votes of 44 Senate
Democrats in favor of ending the trial indicated that Clinton would
not be convicted. ``So it isn't a question of whether removal or
conviction is on the table any longer, it's whether we're going to
engage in the spectacle of moving this into the public domain and
trying to move public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the Democrats were trying to
pre-emptively block the Senate from making Ms. Lewinsky or her
videotaped image public, without even knowing whether she would say
anything that would add to the trial or should be aired. Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, called the stance ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``Videotaping is an additional tool in this modern
era that senators can use to review what the witnesses have to say.
We don't say that it will be used on the floor. We don't prejudge
that. We say that it would be up to the Senate to decide. The
Democrats don't want that to happen, and I don't understand their
alarm about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major point of division was over whether to bar the
Senate from considering ``findings of fact'' that Clinton had
committed perjury and obstruction of justice, separate from the
final vote on whether to convict him and remove him from office.
The findings could be approved by 51 senators and would not require
the 67 votes needed to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican left this possibility open while the Democrats
wanted to block it. ``We strongly believe that this notion,''
Daschle said, ``is just not one that may even be constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House spoke out even more strongly against it. ``It
would establish a terrible precdent for the future,'' said James E.
Kennedy, a White House spokesman, ``making it easier for future
congresses to contemplate punishing a president when they disagree
with him or her. In addition it's really a political vehicle to
exact as much punishment of the president without having to meet
the two-thirds requirement for conviction and removal set forth in
the Constitution.''

BIPARTISANSHIP SLIPS AWAY WITH WITNESS VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As party leaders squabbled, Senator Herbert Kohl
sat alone in the cafeteria late Thursday, sipping coffee and
staring at the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The day had been a complete waste: no bipartisan agreement, no
progress toward peacefully ending the president's impeachment
trial. As the afternoon slipped away, Kohl waited for a 6 p.m. vote
on how the trial would proceed, hoping Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott would compromise with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Then he considered the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public wants this over. The final vote is clear,'' said
Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. ``But they can do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Voting strictly along party lines, Republicans won a motion
proposed by Lott to proceed with the impeachment trial, laying down
their own rules for videotaping witness depositions and possibly
showing them on the Senate floor. The vote, which followed another
party-line defeat of a Democratic motion to end the trial, capped a
day of partisan haggling and increasingly bitter negotiations that
signaled what some had feared most: the end of bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the GOP has hit an iceberg and is sinking,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy after the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a Republican trial,'' agreed Senator Paul Wellstone,
a Democrat of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the differences seemed mostly procedural and
relatively insignificant. The Republicans wanted to videotape the
depositions, whereas the Democrats did not. The GOP wanted to leave
open the possibility of pursuing new evidence if it came along,
while Democrats wanted a fixed end date in place. Nothing in
question, everyone agreed, threatened to change the final outcome
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the votes came about _ at the end of a long day, in
an easy victory for the Republican majority _ left some Democrats
discouraged about their attempts at cooperation across the aisle.
Even as they admitted the votes had been stacked from the start,
some Democrats held them up as further proof of Republican
insistence that the trial continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of working together, and we got where we
got,'' Senator John F. Kerry said curtly after the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That did not preclude bipartisan camaraderie on a personal
level. Immediately after the votes, senators from both parties rode
the underground subway together, chatting, discussing the next
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry stepped into an elevator with Republican Senator John
McCain of Arizona, deep in conversation about running for
president. Republican Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa soon
joined them, as did Democratic Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember, if anybody ever says there's too much
partisanship, that's only within three feet of a camera,'' Grassley
joked. ``When we're together, we agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy made his own attempts at bipartisanship, riding the
underground trolley with Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
When the pair spotted Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah,
Kennedy slapped Gramm on the back and shouted, ``Orrin, look what
you've missed out on here!''
</P>
<P>
   But the conversations belied the rift that obviously had
developed during the afternoon, as leaders in both parties went
from predicting an eventual agreement to admitting failure with the
party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle
told the Democratic caucus about his ongoing negotiations with
Lott. Daschle made it clear that he would not budge on certain
points _ allowing the videotaped depositions to be made public or
proceeding without an absolute end date _ and heard support from
other Democrats, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   Most, including Kohl, left the meeting with the impression both
parties were working toward a bipartisan conclusion. Many Democrats
said they believed Republicans, fearing low approval ratings in the
polls because of the ongoing impeachment trial, wouldn't dare
steamroll the Democrats and lose further public esteem.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans stayed firmly committed to their position.
Throughout the afternoon, several senators said they believed
Democrats were being hypocritical _ insisting on keeping the
depositions secret, for example, after having voted to open
deliberations just days before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, what's partisan is their trying to get this
information out to the public,'' said Hatch. ``These are the same
people who voted for open proceedings. My gosh, it's very
inconsistent, and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Kennedy said he believed the bipartisan spirit
could be restored, particularly in the Senate, and particularly if
the power of the Republican managers from the House could be
removed. He said ``everyone is too committed'' to let the
atmosphere dissolve as it had in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want fairness. All of us want a conclusion of it,''
Kennedy said. ``Because, I think, the House managers have been
driving the process, we got the outcome we got today.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``It's like a bad movie. We know the ending, but
they insist that we continue running the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one person, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, seemed
comfortable reserving judgment on the motions. Responding to a
question from Hatch about Lott's motion, Rehnquist leaned over to
ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parliamentarian tells me it is never the function of the
chair to interpret a resolution,'' Rehnquist answered. No
objections were raised.

70.2 RISE ON NASDAQ LEADS GAINS ACROSS THE BOARD
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buoyed by Intel's fourth split since 1993 and other
evidence of prosperity for high-technology companies, the Nasdaq
stock market rocketed to a gain of nearly 3 percent Thursday,
pacing a broad market rally.
</P>
<P>
   Prices gathered strength throughout the session, exhibiting less
of their recent volatility as investors digested fresh news of a
strong, low-inflation economy, more upbeat earnings reports and
some big takeovers along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's latest remarks about valuations.
</P>
<P>
   In comments before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan did
not repeat warnings about irrational exuberance but did compare
investing in Internet stocks to playing the lottery. His remarks
did little to dampen enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, resuming its sharp
advance that now amounts to 13 percent so far this year, climbed
70.20 points, to 2,477.34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Techs are the sector,'' said John Snyder, executive vice
president of John Hancock/Sovereign Investors. ``The feeling among
many people is that if they're underweighted there, they've got to
get in.''
</P>
<P>
   But lesser strength was found across a broad front, reflected in
a hefty 1.53 percent advance for the Wilshire 5000 and a 1.79
percent advance for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which
rose 22.20 points, to 1,265.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain of 81.10
points, or nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent, though close to half of
the increase was the result of surges in two stocks: AT&AMP;T, up 4|,
to 89 15/16, and J.P. Morgan, up 4 5/16, to 104].
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good news out there today,'' said Peter
Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments. ``We're on
our way to Dow 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited among other things government reports of a
surprisingly big jump in orders for durable goods and of contained
employment costs, the latter likely to reassure Federal Reserve
policy-makers, who meet next week, that inflation remains well in
check.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which late Wednesday announced strong earnings
and a stock split, climbed 8 15/16, to 174 7/16, but many other
computer-oriented companies did even better. Yahoo, which said it
was buying Geocities , rose 31~, to 367}; Geocities soared 42\, to
117\. Infoseek rose 12{, to 83 15/16, and Lycos shot up 11|, to
123[. .
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose 4~, to 137 3/16, as the company announced a 2-for-1
split and a 50 percent dividend increase.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, however, slumped 10~, to 292|, as it responded to news
reports about possibly fraudulent items sold by other companies on
its auction site, and Amazon.com eased 2}, to 122~.
</P>
<P>
   The relative sluggishness of the Dow industrials, still only up
1.09 percent in 1999, and other traditional market favorites was
said to reflect their big run-ups over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors may still be around to buy the dips,'' said
Christine Callies, chief strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``But they're clearly having second thoughts about chasing high
valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer stood out in the drug group, rising 5|, to 127 9/16. It
said directors would vote on a 3-for-1 split.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 852.4 million shares changed
hands, with advancing issues holding only a small margin over
declining ones, 1,561 to 1,454. New 52-week lows outnumbered new
highs by 86 to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks rose 3.90 percent in Sao Paulo, 2.48 percent in
Paris and 0.8 percent in Frankfurt. Prices were 3.69 percent lower
in Hong Kong, 0.7 in Tokyo and almost 0.1 percent in London.

 &HT;    Value of accurate observation an ageless idea
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The biggest fear among the NFL's front-office suits in
this year of fractured officiating is that a blown call will
determine who wins and who loses Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIII at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Such a circumstance would be unfortunate in any of these
Roman-numeralized extravaganzas, of course, but it would be
especially calamitous after a season dotted by so many significant
mistakes made by the men wearing striped shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the blunders, however, Denver and Atlanta _ teams
with a combined 32-4 record that are, arguably, the league's two
best squads (Minnesota remains in the debate) _ have managed to
advance to the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the folks in charge of interpreting and enforcing the
rules can, for example, correctly determine what is or isn't a
fumble or what is or isn't a touchdown or what's in-bounds and
what's out-of-bounds . . . well, then maybe no one will have to
worry about second-guessing. Or would this be first-guessing?
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds a precious seeing to the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare wrote it, but he was probably dating Gwyneth
Paltrow at the time and it's for sure he had never watched an NFL
game. Even then, though, Bill the Bard was prescient enough to
understand the advantages of instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``To err is human, to forgive divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pope was, apparently, a compassionate sort. But let
him sell the idea to the poor saps who lose when somebody's head is
misidentified as a football. Hey, it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``War begun without good provision of money beforehand for going
through with it is but as a breathing of strength and blast that
will quickly pass away. Coin is the sinews of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Rabelais was absolutely correct, but only if someone
can call the toss in proper manner so as to begin the combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, again, who must never have understood the value of
a reliable zebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are men in the world who derive as stern an exaltation
from the proximity of disaster and ruin, as others from success.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Winston Churchill might as well have been talking about
flag-happy referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a decision was made, I did not worry about it
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Please meet Harry S. Truman, head linesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument needs no reason, nor a friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   So, circa 580 B.C., did Ibycus efficiently summarize the
relationship between those who play or coach the games and those
who judge them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We
are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the
song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts . . . are we
disposed to be the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and
having ears, hear not? . . . For my part, whatever anguish of
spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know
the worst, and to provide for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a concluding reminder, borrowing from Patrick Henry, that
for all their mistakes, officials do usually get things right.

PENTAGON CHANGES POLICY ON USE OF TROOPS IN DRUG WAR ON BORDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Banuelos) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Pentagon has all but ended the use of ground
troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, issuing new rules that require
special permission for armed anti-drug efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   Permission must come from the secretary of defense or his
deputy, said Lt. Col. Mike Milord, a Defense Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change comes more than a year after a high school
sophomore was shot and killed by Marines in the small town of
Redford, a hamlet that straddles the Mexican border just west of
Big Bend National Park.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, which claimed the life of 18-year-old Esequiel
Hernandez Jr., prompted Defense Secretary William Cohen to suspend
similar missions.
</P>
<P>
   Troops continue to carry out other anti-narcotics duties along
the border as part of a joint task force with federal authorities,
including civil engineering projects, air reconnaissance and
intelligence analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy change really gives the secretary of defense
oversight for these missions,'' Milord said. The decision was made
in October, Milord said, but never officially announced.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was killed May 20, 1997, while herding his family's
goats near the Rio Grande. He was armed with a vintage .22-caliber
rifle, which he carried for protection and fired twice in the
direction of four heavily camouflaged Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Cpl. Clemente Banuelos fired the fatal shot from about
200 yards away after he said Hernandez raised his rifle to fire a
third time.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Presidio County grand juries refused to indict Banuelos
and his fellow Marines. A civil rights probe by the Justice
Department also failed to bring charges against the troops, in part
because they had received permission to fire by radio.
</P>
<P>
   But a Marine Corps inquiry cited ``systemic failures at every
level'' during the mission. Lamar Smith, a congressman from San
Antonio, also issued a scathing report, saying the Justice and
Defense departments undermined criminal investigations into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's report concludes that the Justice and Defense
departments withheld information about the inadequate training of
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy will make the deployment of ground troops along
the border unlikely, said Timothy Dunn of El Paso, author of the
``Militarization of the U.S-Mexico Border.'' He said that neither
the defense secretary nor his deputy were likely to authorize such
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as significant a policy change as we're going to have
without changing the law,'' Dunn said. But, he added, ``It should
never have taken a boy's life to bring that about.''

 &HT;    Barr, facing long odds, brings battle to Georgia
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The roaring impeachment process is slowly grinding to
a conclusion, with it all but certain President Clinton will hang
on to his job. U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, perhaps the most ardent foe
Clinton has in Congress, knows this all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thursday, Barr, an obviously frustrated warrior, made the
media rounds in Atlanta, steadfastly telling all who would listen
that he will continue to fight until he has fired his last legal
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is making our job virtually impossible to do,''
complained Barr, referring to the Senate's vote Wednesday to limit
the witness list to three. ``It's really frustrating, the lack of
opportunity we're getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting to compare 1868 (when President Andrew
Johnson was impeached) with 1999,'' he said. ``Today's world is
`Let's hurry up. Let's get it done quickly.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barr jetted to Atlanta for a 36-hour respite from Washington
after Senate voting that made it clear the two-thirds vote needed
to remove Clinton is a virtual impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   His rounds Thursday in Atlanta were an attempt to get his gospel
out and practice a little damage control in the wake of the
prodigious spin cycle emanating from the White House. He went from
talk radio to an Internet chat room to CNN's ``Burden of Proof,''
and then finally to a Chamber of Commerce dinner in Cartersville.
He also took some time out to celebrate his wife Geri's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia congressman knows what he's up against. Clinton's
approval ratings hover above 70 percent, while Republicans' have
sunk. Barr was personally rocked when Hustler magazine publisher
Larry Flynt accused Barr of helping a former wife obtain an
abortion, a charge Barr calls ``scurrilous.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr claims his quest has never been to be liked: He's not the
warm-and-fuzzy lovable type, like his nemesis Clinton. Barr's
demeanor _ stern and focused _ rarely changes. His mantra Thursday
was: It's the Constitution, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to the polls. They are absolutely
meaningless,'' said Barr while heading to his Chevy truck with an
NRA sticker and congressional plates. ``The polls exist in sort of
a Never-Never Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr started his rounds with WSB radio talk-show host Neal
Boortz, like-minded in his antipathy toward Clinton. On the Boortz
show, Barr spent 45 minutes preaching to the conservative choir.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Barr was online for a 75-minute ``Internet town
hall meeting'' on AccessAtlanta, where he personally answered 66
questions. Barr for the past year has plugged in to the chat room
every month to answer questions. He spent the entire time Thursday
hunched over, in shirt-sleeves, pecking at the computer keyboard,
rarely looking up.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, monitors for AccessAtlanta _ which like The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution is owned by Cox Enterprises _ get a couple
hundred questions. On Thursday, they received more than 500 and had
to screen the queries to keep them decent, along a certain thread
and to prevent them from repeating.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't merely toss Barr softballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob, how can you criticize the president's personal life when
you yourself are on your third marriage?'' asked someone identified
as ``just me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the president has violated federal laws. ... It
has nothing to do with whether he or anyone else is single, married
or divorced. You may see the connection but I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of Clinton-bashers were online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriot'' commented: ``It appears to me that the Democratic
senators could easily qualify as jurors in the O.J. Simpson
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good point,'' responded Barr, with a fleeting grin, one of the
few he flashed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Barr admitted to a questioner that Clinton's
removal is ``pretty remote'' given that ``a number of senators have
apparently prejudged his acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   After posing for a photo with the AccessAtlanta staff, Barr
headed to his truck to make a Buckhead lunch with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   His image, repeatedly flashed on the news and talk shows, has
made him something of a celebrity. Several passers-by did
double-takes when they saw him.
</P>
<P>
   At a Wal-Mart in Cobb County on Wednesday night, Barr said, he
was constantly interrupted by fellow shoppers passing on
``attaboys.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was about to get into his truck, a middle-aged man walked
up, slapped Barr's shoulder and said: ``Thank you, keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' said Barr, with another rare smile. ``I will.

IT'S CONFUSING AS FOX CHASES HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Silver Charm runs Saturday at Gulfstream Park
near Miami in the Donn Handicap, the first leg of a national series
that marks horse racing's latest attempt to pull in fans through
the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The series has a lot going for it, including the participation
of the nation's leading active racehorse, the enthusiasm of the Fox
network and the industry support that past efforts missed.
</P>
<P>
   Its weakness is a contrived format that might only confirm the
public's belief that racing is too complicated for anybody without
the study habits of a nuclear engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the name, ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' _ a brand-name
stew that's hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the complex points system that will determine the
series champion.
</P>
<P>
   In most series, points are awarded for high finishes and the
competitor with the most points at the end of the season is the
champion. That's how it worked in the American Championship Racing
Series, which crowned Farma Way in 1991, Strike the Gold in '92 and
Devil His Due in '93 before self-interested tracks killed it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Thoroughbred Racing Association series is not that
simple. Pay attention; we're only going to say this once.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 races, for 3-year-olds and up, are divided into two
groups.
</P>
<P>
   There are five ``Super Series'' races, to be televised on the
Fox network (Channel 11 in Los Angeles): the Donn, the March 6
Santa Anita Handicap, the June 27 Hollywood Gold Cup, the Aug. 1
Whitney at Saratoga, and the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   The six other races are to be shown on Fox Sports Net cable: the
April 3 Oaklawn Handicap, the May 29 Metropolitan Mile at Belmont
Park and Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs, the June 12
Stephen Foster at Churchill Downs, and the July 5 Suburban at
Belmont and Iselin at Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some races are on the same days, but that's not a big
problem because horses aren't expected to run in all 11 anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Points will be 20 for a victory, 12 for second, 8 for third in
the ``Super Series'' races; 10-6-4 in the Oaklawn and Met Mile and
6-4-2 in the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Any horse who sweeps the five ``Super'' races will earn a $5
million bonus automatically.
</P>
<P>
   As for the points, each one is worth $5,000 _ but there's
nothing automatic about it.
</P>
<P>
   To earn any bonus money for his owners, a horse must finish in
the top five in the Pacific Classic. The Pacific Classic winner
will keep 100 percent of his cash, the runner-up 80 percent, the
third horse 60 percent and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Also _ still with us? _ a horse who wins three of the five
``Super'' races gets $500,000. But only if the Pacific Classic is
one of the victories.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a horse could win more than $5 million on top of the
individual race purses, he also could dominate the series and
squander the huge bonus by getting hurt or going off form before
the Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than that apparent inequity, the all-or-nothing emphasis
on the Del Mar race could tempt an owner to run an injured or
fatigued horse in the series finale, risking disaster that could
undermine the benefits of the TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The format demonstrates how far the NTRA, beginning its first
full year as the sport's ``league office,'' will go to win the
favor of TV. Without such draconian rules, there would be no
climactic race. Without a climactic race, there would be no Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The network should be happy with the first race. Silver Charm
and jockey Gary Stevens will face 11 horses in the Donn. He'll
start from the far outside in the 1[-mile race and carry 126
pounds, six more than Sir Bear (Jerry Bailey) and Puerto Madero
(Kent Desormeaux).
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Fox announcers will have time to
explain the rules and show the Donn in the same telecast (1 p.m.
PST). After all, it lasts only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Only 92 days to go: Contenders for the May 1 Kentucky Derby will
be in action on three fronts this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Anita: Sunday's Santa Catalina Stakes sends Bob
Baffert's 2-of-2 General Challenge against Bright Valour, Mr. Broad
Blade, Brave Gun, Buck Trout and Light Fingered at 1 1/16 miles.
First post time Sunday is 11 a.m. so the races will end before the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At Gulfstream Park: The swift Texas Glitter, 5-for-5 Bet Me Best
and D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief head the 7-furlong Hutcheson
Stakes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fair Grounds: Answer Lively, with Louisiana-based Robby
Albarado replacing Jerry Bailey in the saddle, makes Saturday's
1-mile Lecomte Handicap his first start since he won the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile. Bailey rides Sir Bear in the Donn that day.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita's Saturday stakes is the 6-furlong Palos Verdes
Handicap, another chance for 5{-furlong track record holder Kona
Gold to prove he's the fastest sprinter in America, as trainer
Bruce Headley boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie D. countdown: Eddie Delahoussaye won two races Wednesday
at Santa Anita to draw within six of 6,000. He'll be the 14th
jockey to reach that milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye, 47, plans to ride as long as his health holds up
but doesn't expect to get to 7,000. He has battled sinusitis the
past few years and always fought weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year, it's starting to get a little tough,'' he said
recently. ``Your body starts changin' and things start spreadin'.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis, 28
wins; David Flores, 19; Kent Desormeaux, Chris McCarron and Gary
Stevens, 17. Trainers: Bob Baffert and Bobby Frankel, 10; Ron
McAnally, 8; Richard Mandella, 7; Wally Dollase, 6. &QL; 
Handicapper's helper: Laffit Pincay, not normally known as a speed
jockey, has more wire-to-wire wins (6) than anybody else at Santa
Anita. Solis, once known for his front-running tactics, has rallied
from sixth or worse to win more races (7) than anybody else. &QL; 
On the stakes' schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $200,000 Palos
Verdes Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 6 furlongs; Sunday, $100,000
Santa Catalina, 3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles. At Gulfstream Park:
$500,000 Donn Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1[ miles; Sunday,
$150,000 Hutcheson, 3-year-olds, 7 furlongs. At the Fair Grounds:
Saturday, $100,000 Lecomte Handicap, 3-year-olds, 1 mile. &QL; 
Mileposts: Not to be outdone by the ``NTRA Champions on Fox''
series, an international committee announced plans for a series
linking races in seven countries. The series would start with the
Dubai World Cup, end with the Hong Kong International, and include
the Canadian International and the Breeders' Cup Classic and Turf.
Needed: a sponsor.... Oaklawn Park's 52-day season opens today. The
Hot Springs, Ark., track was barely touched by last week's storms.
The Oaklawn Handicap is April 3, the Apple Blossom April 9 and the
Arkansas Derby April 10.... Del Mar Futurity winner Worldly Manner,
who's been in Dubai since being purchased by Sheikh Mohammed, will
try to win the May 1 Kentucky Derby without a prep race, a
spokesman was quoted saying in the Daily Racing Form. The whole
thing would be a first.... Gulfstream Park executives vowed to find
out why the official timing system reported inaccurate fractional
times for races earlier in the season.... San Fernando winner Dixie
Dot Com had surgery, as scheduled, to speed healing of a hairline
fracture in his left foreleg.... Malibu winner Run Man Run, fourth
in the San Fernando, will run in the Feb. 6 Strub. A sprint had
been considered.... Classic Cat, the Ohio Derby winner, has
switched trainers, from David Cross to Bob Baffert.... Jockey Emile
Ramsammy broke with agent Vince DeGregory and hired Brian Beach....
Laffit Pincay's streak ended after he rode winners on seven
consecutive Santa Anita cards.... About 20 Japanese reporters were
at Santa Anita to cover Seeking the Pearl's fourth-place finish
behind Stop Traffic in the Santa Monica on Saturday. The filly is
going back to Japan.... Free House, named the state's 1998 champion
older male by the California Thoroughbred Breeders Association, is
scheduled for his 1999 debut in the Feb. 7 San Antonio.... SLM Big
Daddy was voted the quarterhorse world champion for '98, becoming
the breed's first repeat winner since Refrigerator in '93....
Walter Case Jr., 37, was named harness driver of the year for the
third time after winning a record 1,079 races.... Unlucky trainer
Marty Jones has one victory and 15 seconds since Sept. 1. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: the Constitution.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans did make one significant concession to the
Democrats, however. House prosecutors have tried to retain the
option of introducing new evidence or calling for a second round of
witnesses later in the trial. In negotiations Democrats have tried
to foreclose such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan leaves it up to Lott and Daschle to decide
jointly on whether to allow such a request by the House. That in
essence grants Daschle a veto. Lott said he thought that the
Democrats would not abuse this power and that if the depositions
produced some startling reason for new evidence or witnesses, ``he
or I would be very hard pressed to deny that option.''
</P>
<P>
   In a plea for good will and some trust between Republicans and
Democrats, he said, ``our colleagues have to have faith in us. We
have to have faith in him, and his conference has to have some
faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their votes were strictly along party lines, the
senators seemed amiable on the Senate floor, exchanging backslaps
with friends in the other party, joking and showing no signs of
rancor. The scene suggested that some of the day's statements had
as much to do with the political needs of the two parties as with
the real mood.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have already sunk in opinion polls because of
their handling of the impeachment trial, and Democrats have every
incentive to continue painting them as unfair and as the party of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seized the opportunity again Thursday night. ``I
think it's fair to say that Democrats first and foremost want this
matter ended,'' Daschle said after the vote, which was the second
Democratic effort in two days to halt the trial.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Senate Republicans are trying not to seem as
fiercely partisan as Republicans in the House. So Thursday night
they sought to minimize the extent of the partisan strife. ``The
two sides are still talking to each other,'' Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., insisted. ``I do not think we've damaged personal amity
across the aisle.''

A SUPER BOWL TV QUIZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think you know everything there is to know about television's
role in Super Bowl XXXIII? Then take this carefully presented
eight-question quiz.
</P>
<P>
   1. Name the network that by the end of business Sunday will have
aired 80 separate Super Bowl programs spanning 150 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pat Summerall and John Madden will do the play-by-play Sunday
for Fox's game telecast. What other Super Bowl showdown will they
broadcast this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   3. Name the recluse who will lend his voice to a special
post-Super Bowl episode of Fox's ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Who will Madden interview as part of his ``All-Madden
All-Millennium'' special during the pregame show?
</P>
<P>
   5. What network will try to steal away Fox viewers during
halftime?
</P>
<P>
   6. Fox has a promotional arrangement with an ice cream company
in Miami that has vendors giving away washable tattoos of a Fox
personality. Name him.
</P>
<P>
   7. With an estimated 150 million tuning in, and three-fourt5'q$G
</P>
<P>
   No tabular columns defined Y+d during the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   8. Name the number of sportscasters, within three, who will take
part in Fox's (set ital) seven-hour (end ital) pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring: 6-8, you cheated. 4-5, you know Stu Nahan. 2-3, you
want to meet Stu Nahan. 0-1, you are Stu Nahan.
</P>
<P>
   Answers: 1, ESPN. The Disneyites will even air a special edition
of ``Monday Night Countdown'' -- on Saturday. 2, Saturday's
Sylvester vs. Tweety showdown on Cartoon Network. Expect a lot of
bams and booms from Madden. 3, Top Fox Rupert Murdoch in a rare
speaking appearance. 4, Vince Lombardi, via special effects.
</P>
<P>
   5, USA will air a live, commercial free, 20-minute WWF title
match beginning as the first half ends. It will have a game clock
so you'll know when to switch back to the football game. 6, Keith
Olbermann. Was covering Monica Lewinsky as bad as having your face
tattooed on someone's rear? 7, Victoria's Secret first quarter ad
which will reveal its new web site. 8, 15 -- Ray Bentley, Terry
Bradshaw, James Brown, Cris Collinsworth, Jerry Glanville, Suzy
Kolber, Howie Long, Ronnie Lott, Bill Maas, John Madden, Matt
Millen, Keith Olbermann, Pam Oliver, Ron Pitts and Pat Summerall.
</P>
<P>
   The point of this is obvious. The Super Bowl has become the
poster child for America's culture of wretched excess, now
synonymous with retailers hanging Christmas decorations before
Thanksgiving dishes are cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for Fox to use the Super Bowl as a branding iron.
It paid for the game and has every right to sell-sell-sell until
the clock gongs. Fox will earn about $150 million in revenue from
the game telecast, and as much as $50 million on its (ital)
seven-hour (end ital) pregame show (beginning at 8 a.m.) Factor in
recognition profit for the network and its Fox Sports News cable
arm, and you have a day worth all of the work.
</P>
<P>
   It's the bandwagoning that is specious. Lacking the game itself,
other TV outlets go into hyperdrive to steal some of the glory,
leading to attempts that are generally more crass than creative.
But then crass is one of TV's founding principals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides letting ESPN and its cousins air 150 hours of Super Bowl
programming, the Disney Channel will air three sports-themed movies
before kickoff starring Christopher Lloyd and Tony Danza.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has set aside the whole weekend as a sports and game
festival, including NFL stars like Troy Aikman and Brett Favre
lending their voices to an episode of ``Kablam!'' The Golf Channel
will also air a special halftime episode of ``Golf Central.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comedy Channel has its own special tonight, and CBS has a
``Comedy Blitz'' prime time special Saturday featuring comedians,
NFL players and de rigeuer appearances by CBS prime time stars,
like Her Nasalness, Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial inventory during the Super Bowl has become as
much a party of the show as the game. Fox's 30-second spots sold
out at $1.6 million per, and there will be as many Monday morning
reviews for the ads as there will be for John Elway and Chris
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   American Express has signed on for one 60-second ad in the third
quarter, the finale of a two-month ad tease featuring Jerry
Seinfeld. Visa and Mastercard will also try to impress you. Four
different companies will try to sell you a car.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi's in and Coke's out, much to the consternation of the
Atlanta-based cola company. Budweiser signed on as the exclusive
beer of the Super Bowl and will nine-plus minutes of frogs and
lizards. There will also be a ``Star Wars'' prequel trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fox admits the seven-hour length of its pregame show is
excessive, but these shows will continue to grow as long as the ad
market shows an interest. It's profitable football muzak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can sell it, I'll produce it,'' said Ed Goren, the
executive producer of Fox Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect a huge part of the audience to watch all seven
hours,'' said Scott Ackerson, the show's producer. ``My mom and dad
might be the only ones who will. But I don't think anyone who does
will consider it a waste of time. I feel bad saying it, but we
actually could use an extra half hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as bad as we feel hearing it.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame highlights differ depending on what you're looking
for. A big 90-minute chunk will be the ``All-Madden, All-Millennium
Team,'' which will have Madden interacting with Lombardi and a
computer-generated game between his All-Millennium team and the
NFL's best current stars.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will also air anniversary retrospectives on Super Bowls
played 30, 20 and 10 years ago. The Super Bowl III piece will
include a Joe Namath interview and look at what that landmark game
did for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   For Super Bowl XIII, ex-Steeler Terry Bradshaw will reminisce
with ex-Cowboy Hollywood Henderson. It was Henderson who launched
Bradshaw's reputation with his infamous ``he couldn't spell cat is
you spotted him the C and the A.'' Foxies had to twist Bradshaw's
arm to do this piece.
</P>
<P>
   For Super Bowl XXIII, Cris Collinsworth will talk with his
former Bengal teammate Stanley Wilson about his shooting heroin and
being arrested the night before the Super Bowl. ``This is a story
the NFL probably isn't going to like,'' said Collinsworth, ``but
it's a big part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   For the more socially inclined, Fox will offer live music
performances by Ice Cube, Mack 10, the Black Crowes and KIIS in
half-hour chunks, and send ``Beverly Hills 90210'' alum Jason
Priestly on a tour of Miami nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the other end of the Super Bowl as a fan, and a
lot of people Super Bowl parties with the TV on,'' said Madden.
``Is someone going to sit down and watch the whole show? I don't
think so. But what else would you rather have on leading up to the
game?''
</P>
<P>
   The other networks will test that thought with other sporting
events. ESPN2 will air a stock car race, ABC has the last round of
the Senior Skins game and UCLA-Washington basketball. CBS will also
counter with golf (Phoenix Open) and college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   At kickoff, when 75 percent of the country is tuned in, local
outlets will switch to programs as different from football as
possible. KCBS will air ``Charade,'' a Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn
movie. KABC has a British mystery movie starring Michael Cai.NTLA
runs a ``Saved by the Bell' marathon and TBS has an Andy Griffith
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE SUPER NEWS: Fox is projecting a 45.0 Nielsen rating
for the game ... It will have 30 cameras at its disposal for game
coverage but will take a more-is-less approach to using them. ``The
key to a good broadcast is making those 30 cameras look like 12,''
said director Sandy Grossman ... Madden isn't projecting a winner,
but he does think it will be a high-scoring game. ``If I had to
pick the best team, I'd say the Vikings. That sounds stupid because
they're not here, but they looked like the best team before they
lost to Atlanta.'' ... Madden on the feud between Dan Reeves and
Mike Shanahan: ``It won't have an impact on the game. No one will
be running down the field saying `my coach hates their coach.' ''
... Fox and 68-year-old Pat Summerall blew off retirement
questions, with Summerall, who has two years left on his contract,
saying he plans to do the 2002 Super Bowl ... Howard David and Matt
Millen call Sunday's game for Westwood One/CBS Radio (KNX 1070 and
XTRA 690).

 &HT;    Tackle has family on his mind
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As he's prepared for Sunday's Super Bowl, Tony Jones has
found himself spending more time on the phone than the football
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver tackle has been nervously calling his wife Kammy back
in Denver at least four or five times a day. He's also made daily
long distance checks on his mom in Royston, Ga., and then, for much
needed respite, he's made the occasional call back to some of the
folks who have long embraced him in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I've got a lot on my mind and I'm not just talking
about the Falcons,'' the 290-pound lineman said of the Broncos'
Super Bowl XXXIII matchup with Atlanta. While his job is to open
holes for running back Terrell Davis and provide protection for
John Elway in what likely will be the quarterback's last game, he
said he feels no pressure: ``Actually, Sunday's game will be three
hours of peace for me. It's kind of an escape. It's after the game
that real life will begin again. The Super Bowl is simple compared
to what I'm facing off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kammy _ who has had nine previous miscarriages _ is pregnant
with twins and has been having another difficult pregnancy. She's
been bedridden nearly a month and wasn't able to make the trip to
Miami until late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I've been calling,'' Jones said Thursday morning.
``I think I should be there with her and our little boy (3-year-old
Tony Jr.) She tells me she's fine, but I'm not sure if she's lying
to me just so I don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she could use me back there. Until I came here with the
team, I was being mother, father, the maid and the cook . . . Well,
not really the cook 'less you count getting carry out. We've had
Pizza Hut, Subway and McDonald's. The old Happy Meal boxes been
stacking up. See, growing up, I learned plenty 'bout eating, but
nothing 'bout cookin. My mom took care of all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mom's ailing, too. Marlene Jones has heart and foot problems
due to diabetes. She had part of a toe removed and until recently
it looked as if she'd lose her foot. In a few weeks, Jones said,
his mother also must undergo open heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the November death of Jones' uncle, a man Tony
said was like an older brother. Although initial reports coming out
of Hartwell, Ga., labeled the death a suicide, Jones said an
investigation is ongoing: ``There are a lot of strange
circumstances. They say he died of a rifle wound at close range,
but people who were there are telling two different stories.
Something's wrong and I promised my mom I'd find out what happened
to her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why _ trying to get through all these storms _ I've
been glad to hear from some people in Ohio. All week, I've been
getting calls and cards and letters from Cleveland Browns fans.
They're telling me to hang in there. They're wishing me luck in the
Super Bowl and they're asking me to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bronco's Pro Bowl left tackle said he wants to end up a
Cleveland Brown again. He played in Cleveland the first eight years
of his career _ until Art Modell moved the team to Baltimore _ and
was a fan favorite. He does, though, have two years left on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to end my career in Cleveland where it all started,''
he said. ``I'd like to retire in front of the Dawg Pound. Taking
nothing away from Denver, but there's no better fans than those
people in the Pound. We could be getting beat to death and they'd
cheer us on. They're the wildest fans I've ever seen. They're
throwing dog biscuits _ and maybe a few D batteries at the other
team _ and they stand up there with no shirts on when it's minus
degrees. There's more fights in the stands than on the field. I'm
telling you, if you can't play football for fans like that, you
can't play anywhere. That's why I want to go back. That town was
good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field . . . and off.
</P>
<P>
   Denver might be giving him his chance at a second straight Super
Bowl ring, but Cleveland is where he found romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a bookstore and knocked a rack of books over on the
foot of Kammy's aunt,'' he said with a laugh. ``She said, `I got a
beautiful niece I'd like you to meet.' Well, I wasn't falling for
that one, but she eventually got her niece in touch with me and we
set up a blind date.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a pairing. Kammy was from East Cleveland, Jones
from tiny Royston, Ga., a town, he said, that has three stop
lights, a park and a street named after him and his family's
chickens picking through the dirt in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time Kammy saw that, she said, `Lord have mercy!
They're loose.' I said, `Don't be surprised This is the South.
You're liable to see anything in the front yard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though he came from humble beginnings, Jones, at the urging of
his wife _ they married on Valentines Day 1992 _ has made a
sartorial splash in the NFL. ``I'm a flashy dresser,'' he said.
``I've got every color suit. There's a pink one (jacket 56-long,
pants 44 waist) with pink shoes (size 14). I've got a lime green
suit and matching derby. There's a purple Barney suit, a bright red
one and even one with Denver colors . . . People thought I was the
door man in that one.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other extravagance he wears is a tattoo on his right
leg. ``It's my family tree,'' he said pointing to branches held
together with red ink hearts and blue padlocks. ``A couple of years
ago, I had four hearts put on here. One's got my wife's name in it,
the other, my son's and two are open. Now my wife's pregnant with
twins.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly quieted at the thought: ``I don't want to dwell on
it. You always worry about something bad happening. I'm so scared
right now. I worry about my wife. For a while I've even wrestled
with just quitting football. I don't want to be off at a game and
something happens at home or with my mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I just want to see everybody here. I want to be
able to see for myself that my wife's OK. Same with my mom (who is
flying in today). I want to hug 'em both.''
</P>
<P>
   As he thought about each embrace, he began to smile:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell you this before, but my wife and I almost didn't
meet. The first time her aunt had her call me, I asked her to
describe herself. She said she was not an attractive girl, so I
started thinking she was ugly and kept avoiding her. Then one day
we agreed to meet. I was gonna hide at first, but then I saw this
chick coming up the walk. I went `Ho-le-o!' She was beautiful. I
was supposed to go back to Georgia the next day, but I cancelled
everything and we just hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you now what? She thought I was the perfect guy. She
thought we made a good couple. She said, `Where you been all my
life, big boy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was grinning now. ``I told her not to worry, I'd never be
far away again.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why he held that small cell phone in his big,
battle-scarred hand

 &HT;    It's a tough call
 &HT;    By Ethan Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The most scrutinized team in Super Bowl XXXIII may not
be one coached by Dan Reeves or Mike Shanahan, but the one chiefed
by Bernie Kukar, a 15th-year referee whose regular job is selling
employee benefits plans.
</P>
<P>
   Few American employees could benefit from a sell job more than
the NFL's officials. Rarely did a game day pass this season without
an official's call _ or non-call _ drawing mockery and reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Calling pass interference on Buffalo. Mistaking Vinny
Testaverde's head for a football. Ruling Jerry Rice down on a
fumble. Botching the Pittsburgh-Detroit overtime coin flip, which
prompted Atlanta's Reeves to send linebacker Jessie Tuggle out the
next week with a sign that read ``heads'' and prompted the league
to require the visiting captain to call ``heads'' or ``tails''
before a flip, and three officials to watch.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, facing the scary possibility of a Super Bowl turning on
a gaffe, the NFL did nothing to alter its post-season officiating
plan, which includes assigning the top people to the biggest game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' replied George Young, the NFL's senior VP of
Football Operations, when asked if he was comfortable with the
officiating. ``In the playoffs, we've had 1,500 plays, and the
officials probably botched one. How much controversy have we really
had?''
</P>
<P>
   A hasty December motion to reinstate instant replay for the
playoffs failed in the NFL's competition committee, 7-1. ``People
recognized that in the post-season, (the officiating) is especially
good because we have the best people out there,'' Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said then.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos and Falcons were not represented on that
eight-person committee, which was chaired by then-Packers coach
Mike Holmgren and Buccaneers executive Rich McKay. Denver and
Atlanta were among the 21 teams that voted for replay last March,
when it failed by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked this week, the participating players and coaches were
clearer than a Thanksgiving coin flip: They understand the
officials have a difficult job. All the more reason to have replay
as a supplemental tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been for instant replay, and I think if the
commissioner is really sold on it, we can get it done,'' Reeves
said. ``In my opinion, he is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, like Miami Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson, favors replay in any form, even the one in
which coaches must decide whether to challenge a call at the
expense of a timeout. ``The game is too fast for the officials to
make all the right calls, and teams don't make the playoffs, and
coaches get fired,'' said Brooks, who was head coach in St. Louis
in 1995 and '96. ``Underline it, put it in bold print. It's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's irrelevant until the next owners' meetings in March.
Then teams must decide not only whether to implement a system, but
what kind. The one used from 1986 to 1991 (with an official in the
press box) had jurisdiction over out-of-bounds calls and
questionable fumbles and interceptions. That system did not review
pass interference calls, the source of many controversies this
season, and a future replay system likely will not review
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   So replay would not have averted the biggest officiating
controversy in Super Bowl history, when field judge Fred Swearingen
ruled that Cowboys cornerback Benny Barnes interfered with Steelers
receiver Lynn Swann, and awarded a 33-yard penalty. The Steelers
converted for a touchdown to go ahead 28-17, then withstood a
Dallas rally to win Super Bowl XIII by four. The Dallas Morning
News later published a letter Commissioner Pete Rozelle wrote to a
fan, admitting the call was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several times this season, Jerry Seeman, the league's director
of officiating, admitted publicly that his officials had goofed,
sometimes on plays that would have been reviewable under the old
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many bad calls this year,'' Tuggle said. ``Not
to blame the refs, because they're human and they're not perfect.
We've got the technology, why not use it?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Falcons quarterback coach Jack Burns: ``We can put men on
the moon, we have stations in space, surely we have enough
intelligence to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland back (a definite yes vote) in the league, replay
needs two more March votes. Last year's nine dissenters included
many of the old-guard owners: the Giants, Chiefs, Bears, Cardinals,
Raiders, Bills, Chargers, Bengals and Buccaneers. ``It's a few
people in the league who have their way,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   McKay has indicated the Buccaneers may change their vote. So
might the Bills. Owner Ralph Wilson was fined $50,000 for
criticizing the officials for two calls _ including the phantom
pass interference _ that cost Buffalo a Nov. 15 game against New
England. ``It was a key game,'' he said in December. ``It was a
terrible, terrible call, and I don't know how anybody in their mind
could make a call like that, in this league, in the midget league,
in any league.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was before Buffalo was damaged by a questionable ball
spot and ejection in its playoff loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Doug Flutie, replay proponents must wait until next
year, and hope that Kukar's crew _ which includes umpire Jim
Daopolous, head linesman Sanford Rivers, line judge Ron Baynes,
field judge Tim Millis, side judge Gary Lane and back judge Don
Hakes _ doesn't err. All have at least 10 years of NFL experience
(the minimum is five years), and four have been in at least one
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They were tabbed after an exhaustive process, through which the
league's 113 officials in 16 crews are graded weekly by Seeman, a
staff of full-time supervisors and retired game officials. Every
play is graded from 1 to 7, based on judgment and mechanics. Seeman
maintains the officials get more than 98 percent of the calls
right.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 officials at each of the seven officiating positions
qualified for the playoffs, only one of each for the Super Bowl.
Officials' take home between $1,431 and $4,330 per game depending
on their experience, but the Super Bowl pays close to $10,000.
That's the top reward for a process including background checks,
psychological and physical tests, a July clinic and a four-hour
training session.
</P>
<P>
   None of the NFL's officials is full-time _ Steelers owner Dan
Rooney recommends the league hire at least one full-time official
per crew, but Seeman has repeatedly said that more worked games,
not more practice days, is all that might help. Some officials are
executives, some teachers, some attorneys, some probation officers,
some dentists.
</P>
<P>
   Some salesmen. Like Kukar.
</P>
<P>
   May choosing him be a better call than many of his colleagues
made this season.

U.S.-RUSSIAN TEAM MAY HAVE CREATED ULTRA-HEAVY ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Collaborating Russian and American nuclear physicists believe
they have created a new ultra-heavy element that may open the door
to a host of new elements once considered impossible.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the achievement would mark the realization of
efforts over a half century to reach a major goal of nuclear
physics: to create an element far heavier than any in nature that
would survive for long enough to permit scientific study.
</P>
<P>
   Russian physicists announced the news over the last few weeks
through e-mail to international physics laboratories, and the
journal Science published a brief account of the work on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The work to create the element, which has not been named, was
conducted at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna,
Russia, under the leadership of Dr. Yuri Oganessian, a nuclear
physicist.
</P>
<P>
   The American participants in the experiment, from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, said in interviews
Thursday that they would have preferred to withhold the news until
they had completed some calculations, but that the evidence for the
creation of the element was very strong.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, they said, that during a four-month bombardment from
a big Russian cyclotron of a rare isotope, or form, of plutonium by
atoms of a rare isotope of calcium, a single atom of the new
element was created. The nucleus of a calcium projectile atom fused
with the nucleus of a target plutonium atom to form an element
containing 114 protons and about 184 neutrons in its nucleus. The
resulting atom of Element 114 survived for about 30 seconds, they
said, a long period compared with the decay rates of most other
heavy man-made elements.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of radiation and nuclear fragments from the decaying
atom matched the pattern predicted by theory for the decay of
Element 114, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Element 114, if confirmed, would place science
at the edge of the long-sought ``island of stability,''
theoretically a range of fairly stable ultra-heavy artificial
elements that physicists say may offer scientists a new palette of
chemical elements unknown in nature.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement, if confirmed by laboratories in Russia, the
United States and Germany, where similar research has been done,
would be a landmark in the course of nuclear discoveries that began
in World War II with the creation of plutonium, the element used to
destroy Nagasaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 92 elements in the basic periodic table from hydrogen,
the lightest, with only one proton in its nucleus, to uranium, the
heaviest, with 92 protons, all but two elements, technetium and
promethium, are found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny amounts of plutonium have also been found in nature. But
with that exception, all elements with proton numbers greater than
the 92 of uranium must be made in laboratories, and with Element
114, 21 artificial elements have been made. (Element 113 is missing
from the sequence.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the elements created since plutonium have found
important uses in medicine, chemistry and even smoke detectors,
which use the radioactive man-made element americium.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of creating a stable super-heavy element was
first predicted in the 1940s by theorists who hypothesized a shell
structure of protons and neutrons in large atomic nuclei, analogous
to the shells of electrons orbiting atomic nuclei. They believed
that nuclei with filled proton and neutron shells would be less
likely to disintegrate radioactively than nuclei with partly filled
shells.
</P>
<P>
   But despite intense efforts by scientists in the United States,
Russia and Europe in the intervening half century, the goal of
making a super-heavy element within the island of stability was not
achieved. A major problem was that when two atomic nuclei collide,
they often combine energies to such high levels that the new
composite nucleus instantly shakes itself apart.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member Dubna team, assisted by five American physicists,
created the putative atom of Element 114, using a large cyclotron
to hurl projectile atoms of calcium-48 at targets of plutonium-244.
Both of these radioactive isotopes were provided for the experiment
by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have not announced their results in any formal
publication, but the Russian contingent unveiled its data in e-mail
with foreign nuclear physicists, including Albert Ghiorso, a
leading nuclear experimentalist at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ghiorso is a longtime associate of Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, the
Nobel laureate who created plutonium. Ghiorso is credited as a
co-creator of 12 artificial elements beyond uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much I wish we at the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory had been the ones to get Element 114,'' he said. ``It's
one of the greatest achievements in physics. But I'm overjoyed that
someone has done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 88-inch Berkeley cyclotron will be used to try to repeat the
Dubna experiment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Lougheed and Dr. John N. Wild, two members of the
Livermore team, said they would continue to work on the Russian
cyclotron to confirm the discovery, but meanwhile were preparing a
formal paper reporting the results.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, who as secretary of energy is in charge of
Livermore and other national physics laboratories hailed the work.
``If confirmed, the synthesis of Element 114 will create an
important new opportunity to study the physics of extremely heavy
elements,'' he said.

INTERROGATORS AND WITNESSES PREPARE FOR FACEOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the Senate voted to summon three
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial, the inquisitors
honed questions they hoped would turn their case around, and their
targets prepared to say nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican prosecutors assigned to interview the
witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal _
met separately on Thursday morning with their aides and the lead
prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, to map strategy and
plan questions for depositions that are to begin on Monday with Ms.
Lewinsky. Jordan and Blumenthal will follow on Tuesday and
Wednesday, but as of Thursday night, the sequence had not been
decided.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team, even as it argued for a quick end to
the proceedings, continued to prepare for extensive discovery and
the possible calling of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After their meetings on Thursday, some of the House managers
jumped on airplanes to tend to business back home. Rep. Ed Bryant
of Tennessee, who will interrogate Ms. Lewinsky, surveyed tornado
damage in western Tennessee. And Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,
who will question Jordan, is scheduled to speak at a Chamber of
Commerce banquet in Booneville, Ark., on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On his flight home, Hutchinson said he was planning to re-read
Jordan's grand jury testimony. He wondered aloud how he would crack
the polished Washington insider and million-dollar superlawyer whom
House prosecutors have contended helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job to
buy her silence in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan is an experienced lawyer who is extraordinarily
poised,'' said Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor. ``It's
going to be difficult to handle in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hutchinson played down expectations of any new
bombshells exploding from the upcoming depositions, and said the
House managers' goal is to persuade the Senate to take the next
step in the trial: calling the three witnesses to testify on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting any grandiose revelations from these
depositions,'' Hutchinson said in an interview. ``There may be a
few new areas, but they won't be earth-shattering. We'll make a
case for live witnesses on other than new information. It has to
come out of the conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors prepared for the interviews of their professional
lives, they waited all day for word from the Senate on the
logistics for the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition ground rules adopted on Thursday night restrict
the scope of the questioning to the Senate record. Senate leaders
were still negotiating time limits on each deposition, with the
House managers and the White House counsels each receiving from two
to four hours per witness.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators, one from each party, will preside over the
depositions and rule on any questions. Objections raised by either
side would be noted and decided by the full Senate after all of the
witnesses were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As the House managers watched the roller-coaster day unfold in
the Senate, the witnesses themselves, not yet served with Senate
subpoenas, were also preparing to give yet more sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a 63-year-old Clinton confidant, was reportedly out of
town. His lawyer, William G. Hundley, did not return several phone
calls on Thursday. But an associate of Jordan said he would be back
in time to have lunch on Saturday with his mentor and law partner,
Robert S. Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For Blumenthal, Thursday was sort of a normal day. The
50-year-old presidential aide whom House prosecutors contend helped
plan a possible smear campaign against Ms. Lewinsky, spent the
morning at the White House and the afternoon with his lawyer in
Baltimore, and was planning to attend a dinner at the British
Embassy on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say the same thing he's already testified to,'' said
William A. McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer. ``If the managers ask him
something new, like about the smear campaign, his answer will be,
`No, I didn't do it.' They are just lost in a fog of fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's interrogator, Rep. James E. Rogan of California,
was busy on Thursday preparing the questions he would put to his
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, long reviled by Republicans as championing the
``right-wing conspiracy theory'' against the Clintons, told the
grand jury that the president first described Ms. Lewinsky as a
``stalker'' and said she ``threatened'' to tell people ``they'd had
an affair.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors have sought to use these descriptions to prove
that the White House engaged in a campaign to smear its opponents,
and have accused Clinton of lying to his aides because he suspected
that they would become witnesses and would relate his denials of
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In and out of meetings most of the day, Rogan popped up on CNN
early on Thursday evening, just as the Senate was preparing to vote
along party lines on rival ground rules for depositions, to made
another urgent plea to the Senate to allow live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had almost three weeks of lawyers bloviating about what
the facts in the case are,'' Rogan said. ``Wouldn't it be easier to
bring the witnesses? Those witnesses should be heard in the well of
the Senate. The truth comes from the witnesses, not from the
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Lewinsky, the witness who is central to the entire case,
was making arrangements to return here from Los Angeles, less than
a week after she flew in for a two-hour court-ordered meeting with
three of the House prosecutors. Her lawyers have insisted that she
has nothing new to add to the record.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who met with Ms. Lewinsky last Sunday and was impressed
with her as a potential witness, faces the task of reconciling what
the prosecutors said earlier this week was an ``almost complete
disconnect'' between the president's testimony and Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in pretty good shape to go ahead with the questioning,''
said Steve Susens, Bryant's spokesman. ``His main priority is that
the tornado cleanup effort goes ahead.''

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign that the assault on the gun industry is
gaining political momentum, mayors from around the country
announced Thursday that they were helping prepare federal
legislation to slow the circulation of handguns and were urging
additional cities to sue manufacturers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia, head of a U.S.
Conference of Mayors task force on gun violence, said he had been
working with several members of Congress on a measure that would
forbid anyone to buy more than one handgun a month, would crack
down on unlicensed sales at gun shows and would give the Consumer
Product Safety Commission the kind of authority over real guns that
it has over toy guns.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to several hundred mayors at their annual winter
meeting, Rendell said he had been persuaded to seek federal
legislation after the failure of his own talks with manufacturers
to solve gun-related problems in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With them,'' he said, ``it all boils down to the same refrain:
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell long ago became the first big-city mayor to suggest that
municipalities could recoup medical, law-enforcement and other
costs stemming from gun violence by suing the manufacturers. While
Philadelphia has not yet sued, four other municipalities have: New
Orleans and Chicago first, followed by Miami-Dade County and
Bridgeport, Conn., which filed their suits on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the suits charge that the industry is liable either
for failing to provide sufficient safety devices on its products or
for stimulating an illicit trade by flooding given areas with more
weapons than a legitimate, lawful market could ever accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mayors who have already sued encouraged other
cities to follow their lead. ``All of us should consider filing
lawsuits,'' said Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County, whose
suit, against 24 gun makers and 3 trade organizations, seeks
unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade organization that represents many gun
makers and is a defendant in the suits, said in a telephone
interview that the mayors' initiatives were largely misguided. The
mayors ``point fingers,'' Feldman said, because their own efforts
at fighting crime have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said the industry opposed purchase limits
because they were no solution: if only one gun is sold, it can
always get into the wrong hands in the absence of reasonable
safeguards. But he said the industry would support safety
oversight, although not by the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
which, he said, lacks expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be opposed to ATF having that authority,'' he
said of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said the one-handgun-a-month purchase limit in the
federal legislation he was proposing would dramatically reduce the
number of guns that end up in the hands of criminals through
so-called ``straw man'' purchases: In many places, buyers can
purchase from licensed dealers any number of handguns, which are
then often quickly resold illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also close what the mayors call ``the gun-show
loophole,'' by requiring gun sellers working at state fairs, at
flea markets and in other temporary quarters to have a license.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it would create federal safety oversight by an agency
specifically charged with consumer protection. ``It's ludicrous,''
Rendell said, ``that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has
authority over the Mattel toy company but not gun manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the legislation would make money available
to develop palm-print, fingerprint or other identification
technology allowing only the owner of a gun to fire it.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said several senators had expressed interest in
co-sponsoring the legislation. But he mentioned only Democrats,
which suggested that the bill might not have bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., a Republican, conceded
that Rendell's initiative would be a hard sell to many Republican
lawmakers, especially those from states with large numbers of gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``All mayors want to end gun violence,'' Helmke said. ``The
question is, Can he support the Second Amendment'' _ on the right
to bear arms _ ``and still find a way to make restrictions on small
guns?''

 &HT;    Tough to shine in the LPGA
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The youngest player on the LPGA Tour told the oldest story in
golf Thursday, the one about a couple of tough breaks costing her a
great score instead of a 71, and somehow she managed to smile about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm only 21,'' said Miami's Cristie Kerr, already in her
third season on tour. ``I've got the rest of my life to play this
game as a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be long enough, unfortunately, to master a field
like the one at the Office Depot, an invitational LPGA tournament
that's making noise at Ibis Golf &AMP; Country Club for a few more
days.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against Kerr's skills, mind you. She thoroughly
dominated junior competition in Florida, where golf courses
outnumber public beaches by a sizable margin, and made the cut at a
couple of LPGA events while still an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Immaturity isn't holding Kerr back, either. Korean sensation Se
Ri Pak won two majors as a rookie last year and she's just 20 days
older than Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is commitment a problem. Kerr changed her entire outlook
on life for golf, learning to play the game right-handed even
though does everything else from the left.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, what prevents American prodigies like Kerr
from achieving instant success is the absolute saturation of the
LPGA Tour by international players. The pool of potential winners
is swimming with Swedes and Brits and Aussies and Japanese and
representatives of 16 other foreign lands. Every week out here it's
the Olympics of golf, but without the free money.
</P>
<P>
   Everything a player gets at an LPGA tournament, she earns. And
most of what she earns gets converted at some point to a different
currency. Six of the past seven LPGA Rookies of the Year have been
international players, including defending Office Depot champion
Helen Alfredsson, two-time U.S. Open champion Annika Sorenstam and,
of course, Pak.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has gone from interesting to absolutely overwhelming.
Of the 26 rookies who begin their LPGA careers this season, only
seven are American. These are the demographics that keep the Disney
World turnstile spinning all year long, but for an ambitious U.S.
star all this waiting in line can be trying.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr takes it all in stride, like the approach shot she dropped
into the water on No. 17 Thursday when the leaders were only a few
shots away. Five birdies to the good, but not good enough. The
field is too deep out here, the pace too swift. Kerr, who averaged
72 strokes per round last year and finished 74th on the money list,
is playing well this week but still stands eight strokes off the
lead of Karrie Webb, an awesome Australian, and LPGA Hall of Famer
Betsy King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fierce out here,'' said Kerr, who skipped college golf
because she believed herself ready for the LPGA. ``It's a lot
tougher than people think. Every day, when you tee it up on the
first hole, you know that somebody is going to shoot a low
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Island's Michelle McGann, a former U.S. Junior Girls
champion, got the same education. A seven-time winner on the LPGA
Tour, she turned pro at 18 in 1988 but needed seven grueling
seasons to get her first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez, winner of nine LPGA events in her second
professional season, might not have smiled as much if she were
starting out today. It's a whole new world in women's golf, with
trouble coming from two dozen time zones and not just 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy came on tour in 1977,'' Kerr said. ``That's the year I
was born. I'll bet she was just trying to win one tournament, not
thinking beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anymore, one tournament is more than most top U.S. newcomers can
manage at the start of their careers. Pat Hurst, the last American
LPGA Rookie of the Year in 1995, didn't break the ice until her
third season. Meg Mallon, winner of two major championships in
1991, needed four seasons to get her LPGA cleats under her.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA's foreign legion, meanwhile, marches faster and harder.
England's Laura Davies won the 1987 U.S. Open while still an
amateur. Sorenstam won six LPGA events in her first three seasons.
Pak won four as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's great that the international players do so well,''
Kerr said. ``We're all females, after all, so why should it
matter?''
</P>
<P>
   At 21, very little matters enough to set one's jaw against it.
Plenty of money to go around, plenty of time to collect it.
</P>
<P>
   However, the odds against the arrival of a genuine American
phenomenon, something along the order of Tiger Woods, lessens with
the induction of each new LPGA rookie class.
</P>
<P>
   Please, in the name of international goodwill, won't anyone let
our kids play through?
</P>

IN DISPUTED MOVE, NETANYAHU CREATES A NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Thursday
the creation of an American-style national security council to
coordinate military and intelligence strategy, a change long urged
by defense analysts here but criticized now as a last-minute
political maneuver by a government entering its final months in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said the new council could represent a
significant structural change for the government, with potentially
serious policy ramifications, including the subordination of
military arguments to broader diplomatic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The council, Netanyahu said at a news conference Thursday,
``will increase and tighten coordination and cooperation between
government offices in national security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing the substantive implications of the move, however,
is Netanyahu's electoral battle against his former defense
minister, Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he would have set up the council sooner had it
not been for the opposition of Mordechai, who retorted Thursday
that the plan was ``a charade that will cost a fortune'' but
accomplish little.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed last week for disloyalty and insubordination,
Mordechai promptly announced his own candidacy for prime minister.
He was replaced by Moshe Arens, who twice before has served as
defense minister and who is known for his consistently hawkish
views.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli military analysts have long advocated a
coordinating body of senior military officers, intelligence
specialists and civilian geopolitical advisers, contending that
dispassionate, long-range strategic analysis is often
short-circuited by crisis management and short-term military
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national security council could be an important correction
of a serious flaw in Israel,'' said Yehuda Ben-Meir, a former
defense official who has published two books advocating a more
coordinated approach to defense and foreign policy. ``But this is
something that should be done by an incoming government, not an
outgoing government.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first day in office, in 1996, Netanyahu announced plans
to create a national security council, under the leadership of
David Ivry, a defense ministry official and former air force
general. The proposal died a quick death at the hands of Mordechai,
his newly appointed defense minister, who led fierce army
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mordechai felt that the council would be in competition with
the defense ministry, and he wasn't the first defense minister to
feel that way,'' David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's chief spokesman, said
Thursday. ``The prime minister didn't want to have a confrontation
with his defense minister in his first weeks in office, so he
withdrew the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Mordechai gone, Netanyahu has suddenly revived his
proposal, including the appointment of Ivry, but this time with the
public support of a hard-line defense minister. Support for a
national security council approach cuts across the usual
hawk-vs.-dove divisions in the Israeli military establishment, as
does opposition, noted Joseph Alpher, an Israel-based
representative of the American Jewish Committee. ``This is not a
left-right issue, but an issue of national security concepts, and
of turf battles,'' Alpher said.

DIGITAL GENERATION PRESENTS FRESH MARKETING CHALLENGES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To effectively reach the youngest generation of Americans, whose
lives are being shaped by digital media, marketers must deliver
smarter, more sophisticated messages and build brands with them
rather than for them, a new study by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, based its
study on interviews by child psychologists with 84 people ages 6 to
20 across the United States. They were asked what they thought
about digital media like personal computers, the Internet, CD-ROMs,
video games and cellular phones and other communication devices,
and how these media affected their lives. Cultural anthropologists
also observed 10 families at home for 50 hours each.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agency, the digital media serve several
functions for the 80 million Americans born since 1977, the largest
generation in the nation's history. The media serve as toys for
these young people but also provide developmental challenges.
Digital media also function as a virtual hearth at home, the study
said. It found that ``most families have their digital media set up
in a public room of the house; consequently, a lot of digital
activities are shared by the family, making these media a center of
family life.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study found that the new media could function
as a ``cool library'' for the new generation, known as Generation
Y. ``Generation Y uses digital media as an extension of self
socially, intellectually and emotionally,'' the study said. ``By
extending the self in these ways, the new media help young people
find their identity.'' It concluded that digital media act as
``power tools'' for Generation Y, giving them tremendous access to
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   According to Saatchi, digital media have collectively made
Generation Y members more positive and optimistic than Generation
X, instilling in the former greater confidence in mastering their
destiny. The agency thinks digital media also enhance Generation
Y's intellectual and social sophistication by increasing its access
to information.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the study found that Generation Y's values include
``connexity,'' which Saatchi defines as the importance of staying
connected to the outside world in order to grow; ``coolness'' of
knowledge, and the importance of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the death of the nerd,'' said Myra Stark, senior vice
president at Saatchi. ``Knowledge is power for Generation Y, who
know that people like Bill Gates rule the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that ``kids are still kids and fun is still
what matters most,'' said Anne Adriance, executive vice president
at Saatchi. ``Being a kid is still about fun, even if it's an
edgier fun today.''
</P>
<P>
   To respond to this new sense of fun, Saatchi recommends that
marketers ``advertise up,'' by pitching Generation Y more adult
messages. ``If advertising sounds too young, they will tune out,''
Ms. Adriance said. One campaign that effectively delivers such a
message to children and teen-agers, the Saatchi executives said, is
the television campaign by Arnell Group Brand Consulting last fall
for Tommy Jeans, a division of the Tommy Hilgifer Corp. ``The
advertising speaks to kids in an adult fashion, and Usher, the
rapper who appears in it, is a teen icon,'' said Johann Wachs, a
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Successful marketing to Generation Y will also challenge their
intellectual abilities, the study said. Good examples of this,
according to agency executives, include Home Depot Inc.'s ``Homer's
Workshop,'' a syndicated how-to television program for children,
and its in-store children's workshops, as well as the public
television program ``Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Saatchi also recommends that advertisers
create campaigns that speak Generation Y's language, which is
visually and verbally sophisticated. One example they cited was a
1998 television spot by Thomas &AMP; Perkins for the Denver Zoo. The ad
featured a ``gigapet,'' a portable computer some children treat
like a digital pet, footage of live zoo animals, and the tag line
``Denver Zoo, interactive by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the agency urges marketers to build connexity brands.
``These brands go well beyond a simple product, they facilitate who
the child wants to be,'' Ms. Adriance said. ``Nickelodeon's `Big
Help' volunteer program and `Kids' Choice' awards envelop and
empower children. These validate them and give them tools to be
what they want to be. Nickelodeon doesn't speak down to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides stimulating what many consider positive social changes,
Saatchi said digital media had also created a potential ``digital
divide,'' a division between families and schools that can provide
high technology and those that cannot.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mediamark Research Inc., in 1993, 18.6 percent of
United States households had computers, while 24.3 percent of
households with children younger than 18 had this equipment. In
1998, 35.3 percent of households had computers, including 46.4
percent of households with children younger than 18. However, as of
last year, more than one-half of all households with children did
not have a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Saatchi study raises the possibility of two-tier
marketing to children _ one set of messages for children with
access to computers and a second for those without _ agency
executives declined to make any definitive conclusions about the
need for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a wait-and-see mode,'' Ms. Adriance said. ``Part of
it depends on the economics of technology and what technology
manufacturers can do to drive their prices down.''

 &HT;    Martin's not so super journey
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Three days before Super Bowl XXXIII, and Tony Martin has
everything under control.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the former Miami Dolphin is home. He is surrounded by
the family and friends who watched his star rise from the mean
streets of Liberty City to the game-winning catch against the
Steelers that put the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Martin is back for another NFL championship,
this one as a starting wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin was greeted at the Hilton Miami Airport and
Towers hotel with a kiss and an ``I-miss-you-so-much'' from his
fiancee, an actress freshly arrived from her latest film project in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then a cavalry of media arrived for the Falcons' daily press
conference. Questions, answers, sound bites, then off to the
University of Miami for practice, then to South Beach to tape an
interview with Johnnie Cochrane for today's Johnnie Cochrane
Tonight Super Bowl Special on Court TV.
</P>
<P>
   Distractions? ``He's totally focused on the Super Bowl,'' said
LisaRaye, Martin's girlfriend who won warm reviews earlier this
year for her debut as a stripper in The Players Club.
</P>
<P>
   Distractions. Does Tony Martin even know the word?
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a guy who found himself answering questions
last fall, when Falcons started turning heads in the football
world, about a childhood friend whom the FBI suspects of having
ties to Central and South American drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Rickey Brownlee, is in a lockup a few miles across
town at the Federal Detention Center, awaiting trial on seven
counts of cocaine and heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey Brownlee is the kind of guy who casts a lot of
shadows,'' said Milton Hirsch, Brownlee's former attorney. ``Some
people will tell you he's the Robin Hood of Opa-locka.''
</P>
<P>
   Also known as the ``Mayor of Opa-locka,'' Brownlee owns a car
wash, several buidlings and the popular Brownlee's Home Style
Restaurant in the south Dade County town. He has helped hundreds of
people in the community through his businesses, barbecues and
Christmas turkey giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, 41, also is a twice-convicted drug dealer who
reportedly moved 80 to 100 kilos a week. Authorities have struggled
to trace the profits.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities caught up to Brownlee again in January 1998, he
was driving a black Mercedes SL 500 that was leased in Martin's
name. In need of money for quality legal help, Brownlee turned to
his old friend Touchdown Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a student at Miami Northwestern High School when he
met Brownlee, who was dating Martin's aunt. Despite the eight-year
age difference, the two forged a friendship. When Martin worked the
night shift pumping gas at a Miami fill-up, Brownlee helped him
make ends meet, supplying small handouts for football equipment and
helping put him through college.
</P>
<P>
   So on Feb. 10, a few weeks after Brownlee's arrest, Martin
signed a retainer agreeing to pay $175,000 for Brownlee's legal
fees. A few days later, however, authorities subpoenaed Martin's
financial records and Martin stopped payment on the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to help (Brownlee),'' Martin told the Atlanta Journal
and Constitution in October, ``but my lawyer said that wouldn't be
the smart thing to do because it would get me into the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, Brownlee's lawyer at the time, sued Martin for breach of
contract. Although he dropped the lawsuit when authorities removed
Hirsch from Brownlee's case, it only drew more attention to
Martin's involvement with Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Martin is being investigated by at least two federal
agencies, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami and the Drug
Enforcement Administration. His name also is in a FBI file on
Brownlee and the Mercedes is part of the federal probe, according
to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are looking into whether Martin may have helped his
old friend launder any drug money. The Mercedes is believed to be
one element of that investigation. Martin has not been charged with
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy to launder carries a prison term of 10 years. If
Martin is charged with a crime, it could jeopardize his NFL
standing. The NFL is aware of the investigations but is not
commenting, although spokesman Greg Aiello has noted that
``improper associations'' by any player would be ``a cause for
concern'' that could spur action by the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee ``helped me when I was younger,'' Martin said. ``I was
trying to help him. I don't know how all this mess occurred
really.''
</P>
<P>
   The mess certainly hasn't affected his performance on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was traded from San Diego last June, had 66
receptions during the regular season for 1,181 yards, 24 yards
short of a career best. He averaged just under 18 yards per catch
and scored six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Randy Moss and Cris Carter of Minnesota, the 33-year-old
Martin and 31-year-old Terance Mathis were the NFL's most
productive pair of receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about being the best tandem in the league,''
Mathis said. ``We just talk about being the best old guys at our
position.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, it is a bittersweet payback. He was cut by the New
York Jets after being drafted in the fifth round in 1989, then
waited another year before playing his first NFL game for the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He spent five seasons in Miami before being traded in 1994 to
San Diego for a fourth-round draft choice. (The Dolphins used that
choice in a deal with the Arizona Cardinals that ultimately allowed
Miami to draft starting center Tim Ruddy).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they gave up on me,'' Martin said of the
Dolphins. ``When I was there they brought in O.J. McDuffie in the
first round of the draft and they had Irving Fryar and Mark
Ingram.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 30, Martin finally became a full-time starter with
the Chargers. But when he and then-coach Kevin Gilbride ``didn't
see eye to eye,'' Martin said, he wound up in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad it happened because it gave me a chance to start
fresh,'' said Martin, whose contract pays him $1.45 million this
year. ``It's a place I want to end my career, here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's next big move is to plan a wedding with LisaRaye, who
believes her fiance is concentrating on Sunday's game, not legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doesn't even think about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's mother and father declined requests to be interviewd
for this story. Martin's attorney, Kieran Fallon, said his client
hasn't been questioned about Brownlee since October. Asked if he
thought the investigation was on Martin's mind, Fallon laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather just say no comment,'' he said.

<P>
   A handful of leading companies will come to dominate cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That snippet of rhetoric has become all the analytical
underpinning there is to justify the unprecedented stock market
values of the prominent Internet companies like Yahoo, America
Online and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, that well could be true. On the other hand,
the Internet may make it easier for new competitors to constantly
challenge the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the byproducts of the irrational exuberance in
Internet stock prices is that the prophesied greatness of certain
companies becomes self-fulfilling. Their huge market values allow
them to grow by acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the $3.6 billion purchase announced Thursday by the
investors' darling Internet site, Yahoo, of Geocities, the leading
creator of electronic communities organized around people's
hobbies, passions and peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities is, in fact, an extreme example of the sort of
tantalizing potential implicit in many Internet companies. It is
the fifth most trafficked Web site, on which 3.5 million people
have created home pages that were viewed 53 million times a day in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities has the right to put advertising on or next to all of
those pages, but in all of 1998, its revenues totaled a meager
$18.4 million. (Profits? Nah. It lost $19.8 million last year,
double the loss of a year before.)
</P>
<P>
   Those modest (to be generous) fundamentals did not stop
investors from valuing Geocities at $2.2 billion on Wednesday,
before the acquisition was announced. With that price tag,
Geocities was essentially too expensive for any company, no matter
how big, for whom traditional rules of finance applied.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo, which has a market value of $38 billion, an infinite
multiple of its just more than break-even earnings, was easily able
to exchange its shares for those of Geocities without breaking a
sweat. Indeed, Yahoo's offer of stock worth $113.66 for each
Geocities share, was a 52 percent premium over the company's share
price Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, because Yahoo's value is so high _ and the price it
paid represents only about 10 percent of its shares _ Yahoo is
telling investors that the deal will have no effect on its
per-share earnings after it closes in the second quarter. Indeed
Yahoo is promising that it can turn around Geocities and make it
add to earnings next year.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual with Internet stocks, investors leapt at any sign of
motion. Yahoo's stock surged by $31.875, to $367.75. Normally,
companies' stocks fall when they announce expensive acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the market is in many ways encouraging the big companies
like Yahoo to buy up other Internet companies. The same economics
has been behind the other Net deals recently, including the
purchase of Excite by At Home and of Netscape by America Online.
And many analysts expect Amazon to make some big acquisitions, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But while the mystical multiplication of the stock market limits
Yahoo's risk from buying Geocities, the potential rewards from
turning the site's huge audience into profits will come much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo's plans to seek incremental revenue from Geocities are
difficult to see,'' said Brian C. Oakes, an analyst at Lehman
Brothers. ``If I have a Web page that says I love the New York
Jets, who will want to advertise there if they don't control the
content?''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo does have a bigger advertising sales staff than Geocities
does and has technical resources that can cut that company's costs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jeff Mallett, Yahoo's president, says the company sees
two areas beyond advertising on the home pages for growth at
Geocities. First, it hopes that people who publish home pages will
include links to related stores on their pages. For example, a page
on cooking would have a link to a kitchen supply site, which in
turn would pay a commission on any sales that would be split by
Yahoo and the creator of the site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yahoo sees Geocities as a great source of
information about the interests of both the creators of the home
pages and the people who look at them. It hopes to use this
information to expand the profiles it is creating about people's
interests _ profiles it uses to send people electronic mail with
advertising customized to their particular interests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whether or not Geocities ever produces much in incremental
profits for Yahoo, the acquisition may well pay for itself simply
by bolstering Yahoo's perceived ``leadership'' in the market. Most
important, Geocities will substantially strengthen Yahoo's position
in the highly watched Media Metrix rating of how many people visit
a Web site at least once in a month, a measure they call reach.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's sites now rank third, reaching 48.2 percent of the
Internet audience. All of America Online's properties combined
reach 54.5 percent of the audience, while Microsoft's sites reach
48.4 percent. Geocities, by itself, reaches 33.4 percent of Web
users.
</P>
<P>
   Though Yahoo's reach has mostly been flat, Lycos, another
Internet service known as a portal because it is a gateway to other
online services, has been climbing the rating charts. The main
reason is that it has been buying up other sites including many of
the community sites that compete with Geocities. All of the Lycos
sites in December had a reach of 46.5 percent of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid constant speculation that Lycos will soon be acquired,
it is worth $5.3 billion, a huge number but a small fraction of the
value of Yahoo. Many Lycos investors, as well as its management,
were hoping that if it were able to surge past Yahoo, it might well
gain some of the market value accorded to leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have too much cash or too much reach,'' said
Chris A. Kitze, the chairman of Xoom.com, a community site that
competes with Geocities. No such luck, Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   With Geocities, Yahoo says its reach will increase to 58 percent
of the Web audience, an undisputed top position, for now. And that
will allow the magic multiplication of Internet stock values to
keep working and let the company make even more acquisitions, just
maybe allowing it to fulfill the prophecies of its cyber-dominance.

 State Labor Unions Gain 87,000 Members  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Labor unions gained 87,000 new members in California in 1998 _ the
first time in nearly a decade that the unionized share of the
state's workforce expanded.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO officials said yesterday that 16.1 percent of
California's approximately 14 million workers were union members
last year, up slightly from 16 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said the slight increase is a sign that their
movement is on the rise after years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step on a long staircase,'' said Sharon
Cornu, spokeswoman for the California Labor Federation. ``The labor
movement is reorganizing and restructuring to be a lean, mean
organizing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of organized labor downplayed the significance of
the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any evidence of a trend that unions' efforts at
revitalization have been successful on a large scale,'' said David
Durham, managing partner of the San Francisco office of Littler
Mendelson, a law firm representing employers in labor disputes.
``It's too early to tell if this is a trend or an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Union membership has been on a steady decline both in California
and nationally for about two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, union membership has fallen from 20.1
percent of the workforce in 1983 to 13.9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, union membership dropped from 21.9 percent of
the workforce in 1983 to 16 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While the actual number of union members rose during some of
those years, California's population grew by an even larger margin
_ leading to continued declines in the unionized portion of the
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1995, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney has
pledged to reverse this decline by promoting an aggressive focus on
organizing new members.
</P>
<P>
   With 87,000 new recruits last year, California unions added far
more members than those in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said the increase in California union membership
had the same roots as labor's successful political fight last year
against Proposition 226.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 226 _ which was voted down by voters last June _
would have placed limits on labor's ability to use members' dues
for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unmistakable renewal in the California labor
movement, which we saw very visibly in the turnaround on 226,''
said University of California at Berkeley professor Harley Shaiken,
who studies labor issues. ``We're seeing grassroots organizing and
a real revitalization.''

 Trading Surge Has Schwab Beefing Up Staff  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
They call it ``Market Storm 1999.'' And it's Charles Schwab's
version of sending in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly swamped by an unprecedented surge in stock trading, the
world's largest discount and online broker is taking emergency
measures to keep customer service from breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, the San Francisco company has
beefed up its 5,500-person customer service staff by shifting some
700 marketing, finance and administrative employees to the front
lines to handle clamoring clients. The program is dubbed ``Market
Storm 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is offering overtime pay to keep those employees at a
high pitch. Earlier in the month, it announced a special $500 cash
bonus to rank-and-file staff members. And it's thrown away price
tags at company cafeterias, giving away meals for free.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is commandeering office space to serve as impromptu
phone banks. In one case, 40 or 50 employees are being bussed
regularly at dawn from San Francisco to a back-up call center San
Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the mobilization is to shore up service strained to
the breaking point by trading demand greater than anything the
company has seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the month, service quality slipped to unacceptable
levels, Schwab officials admitted, though they said the company has
done better than most of its rivals which were also plagued by
breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``January has been difficult,'' said Steven Scheid, Schwab's
chief financial officer. ``Our service is not as good as it needs
to be and our employees are working like crazy.`'
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Nick Kouvis, a San Francisco engineer who likes
to buy stocks on dips and sell them a few hours later when prices
bounce back. Kouvis said his trading strategy was stymied because
he couldn't log on to Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   On January 12, he woke up at 6:30 to sell 700 shares of a stock
he bought the day before. He said it took him 40 minutes to get
through. By the time, he placed his sell order, the stock had
fallen about $2, wiping out his profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere on the account agreement does it say you won't be able
to get online,'' Kouvis fumed.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials said that reinforcements have significantly
improved service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our service levels are higher, our backlogs are smaller, and
customers are increasingly receiving the kind of service they
expect,'' co-chief executive David Pottruck said in an e-mail to
employees earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Schwab has declared a ``Market
Storm'' emergency. The company took similar measures on several
occasions, for example, when the stock market went through a
mini-crash in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But, fueled by the galloping mania for Internet and other
technology stocks, the latest surge outstrips previous periods of
heavy volume, company officials said. ``Volumes that seemed
extraordinary only a short time ago have suddenly become
ordinary,'' Pottruck noted in a previous message.
</P>
<P>
   One week earlier this month, Schwab received 150,000 telephone
calls per day, about 50 percent higher than normal, the company
said. And Internet activity soared even more, with as many 55
million hits a day on Schwab's Web site compared to around 7
million a day at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's telephone service has been hit especially hard.
Officials said waits of five to 10 minutes to get through to a
broker were common for customers who don't qualify for premium
services. Some clients got busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the firm keeps shoveling new computer capacity into
its network, its online system, which now handles nearly two out of
every three stock transactions, has buckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet side, it's mostly a question of slowness,''
said Susanne Lyons, the executive who runs retail client services.
Still, on at least one day, customers were thrown off Schwab's Web
site before they could past the home page, Lyons said. ``Normally,
we try to keep three-to-four times the capacity we need,'' Lyons
said. ``That's all been eaten up.''

ANALYSIS: SENATE TRIAL BECOMES OPENLY PARTISAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mich., Pa., Minn., Nev.)  (EDS: This is a late add to page 1.)  
 (bl) 
By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not us, senators of both parties have been saying
since impeachment proceedings against President Clinton began in
December; we will never descend to the kind of lockstep
partisanship you saw in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday they did, despite all their protestations about the
dignity of the Senate and the importance of careful, dispassionate
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   On the two decisive votes, no Republican, moderate or
conservative, and no Democrat, liberal or centrist _ no Easterner
and no Westerner, no Northerner and no Southerner _ broke with
party colleagues Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Tom Daschle spoke of the courtesy with which his
ideas had been received by the majority. Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., emphasized a ``lack of enmity.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the courtly manners and all the honeyed phrases, the
partisan gulf in the Senate proved every bit as unbridgeable as the
House's.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the Republican majority is fighting to oust the
president from office, and the Democratic minority is fighting to
keep him there. Any infinitesimal doubt about whether the Senate
could muster the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton evaporated
Wednesday, when only 56 votes were cast against a motion to dismiss
the charges, a significant test of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any senators of either party believe that anything the
House impeachment managers can do will change that reality,
although some managers seem to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But the dynamic of the trial has changed. It is no longer really
about guilt and innocence; it is about how the parties will look
when it is over. It is about the future, not about the past. It is
about political power.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the collapse of bipartisanship should have come as
no surprise. All along, that has been maintained at the price of
punting the tough decisions downfield. No agreement would have been
possible Jan. 8, when the Senate approved a procedural outline by
100-0, if questions of witnesses and duration had been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll figure it out as we go along,'' Majority Leader Trent
Lott kept saying. But this time he could not bring it off, even
though in the plan he rammed through the Senate Thursday night he
punted some decisions further downfield, like whether the
videotapes of forthcoming depositions would be shown to the Senate
and the public.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, working hand in glove with the White House,
one major goal was to bring the trial to a conclusion as soon as
possible, so they pressed, unsuccessfully, for a firm deadline of
Feb. 12. The longer the trial goes on, the fewer days remain for
the president to focus political attention on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which was approved, also mentioned Feb. 12,
but as a target rather than a cutoff date. The plan also left the
door open to a ``finding of facts'' _ a judgment that the president
was guilty of one or more crimes, which could be approved by a
simple majority _ before the final vote on conviction, requiring a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, he'll say he has been vindicated when we fall short
of two-thirds,'' one Republican conservative said. ``That's
intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Democrats, the Republican plan was unacceptable.
They wanted to slam the door now on any finding of fact, which some
said would represent an extraconstitutional bill of attainder. In
fact, it would achieve what many Republicans have wanted from the
start: some means of vividly recording their deep-set conviction
that the president is guilty, even though they lack the votes to
find him guilty under the impeachment process itself.
</P>
<P>
   And that was exactly the point, said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
The Republicans, he said, ``should not be able to do by majority
vote what the Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the depositions being shown to the Senate, and by
television to the country, is an even worse nightmare for the
Democrats, especially the president. Ms. Lewinsky has never spoken
at any length in public since the scandal broke; hearing her own
account from her own lips would cause a sensation. ``A spectacle,''
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the Democrats were keen to preserve Ms. Lewinsky's
dignity. He left unsaid their larger concerns: the dignity of
Clinton and the presidency, to say nothing of their party's image
for the future. Vice President Al Gore, or whoever may be the
Democratic presidential nominee in 2000, would rather not have
those videotapes available for use then by the news media, to say
nothing of the Republican candidates, in that campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are running a larger risk. True, there are
certain forces driving them towards letting the trial play out to a
natural conclusion, quite apart from the senators' own antipathy
towards Clinton. Most important of those is their own deeply
conservative core constituency, strongly represented among the
House impeachment managers, which does not wish them to fold their
hand quite yet. Some leaders in that group are already arguing that
the Senate Republicans have unfairly hamstrung the managers.
</P>
<P>
   But neither presidents nor senators are elected by core
constituencies alone. For electoral success, both parties need to
tap into the great reservoir of middle-of-the-road voters, and
those voters, every poll shows, are sick to death of the trial. The
same polls show the Republicans losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   The general public will have forgotten all this long before
2000, several Republican senators have said in recent days. Not
among them have been Gorton, Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Sen.
Rod Grams of Minnesota and Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania,
Republicans who face re-election next year in competitive states
that Clinton carried with ease in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, a leading Washington political operative tried and
failed to stir interest in a compromise that would have led to some
sort of censure resolution. It's not time yet, he was told. Try a
little later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never time,'' he said. ``Once the process starts, it's
hard for anyone to jump off. It takes on a ferocious momentum of
its own.''

 PeopleSoft to Cut 430 Jobs  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
PeopleSoft Inc. said yesterday it will cut 430 jobs, or 6 percent
of its workforce, with the firm expecting the Year 2000 problem to
further crimp already slowing demand for its business software.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs were the first in the history of the Pleasanton
firm, which had been growing so rapidly that it hired about 2,500
new employees since September 1.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest business management software-maker
also reported yesterday that fourth-quarter revenue was $364.2
million, up 39 percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the fourth quarter, after a onetime charge of
$13.9 million for the purchase of Intrepid Systems Inc., was $26.1
million (10 cents a share) compared with $39.5 million (16 cents) a
year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected
earnings of 17 cents per share for the past quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Austrian, managing director at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities, said PeopleSoft and other business software-makers have
benefited from an increase in technology spending as corporations
prepared for the Year 2000 problem. But now those same customers
will wait for the Y2K problem to play out before buying new
applications or starting new projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company obviously is facing a very difficult demand
environment,'' Austrian said. ``They're probably doing all the
right things, but it won't be easy for shareholders in the near
term.''
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft issued layoff notices yesterday to administrative,
sales support and marketing employees whose jobs were deemed
``redundant and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the layoffs will occur in North America,
with about half of them in the Bay Area. About 2,500 employees work
in PeopleSoft's new headquarters at the Hacienda Business Park in
Pleasanton.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will be completed by the end of the first quarter.
In addition, another 100 employees will be reassigned to divisions
developing new products for the Internet and for electronic
commerce ``that make the most sense for customers and future
customers,'' said company spokesman Andrew McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from software-licensing fees was $576.5 million for
1998, a 33 percent increase from 1997. But the growth rate for
revenue from software-licensing fees slowed to only 3 percent in
the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft makes finance, personnel and inventory management
software for corporations. The company has overtaken Oracle Corp.
as the second leading business software-maker, behind SAP AG of
Germany. However in a November interview, PeopleSoft CEO David
Duffield warned the days of the company's 60 percent annual growth
rate may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, PeopleSoft said it expects 1999 revenue to increase
20 percent to 30 percent from 1998, and first-quarter revenue to
increase 20 percent to 25 percent from the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Saturation in the entire $14.4 billion enterprise software
market has slowed revenue growth for leader SAP, which earlier this
month reported pretax income increased by only 15 percent to $1.15
billion on sales of $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft shares have fallen about 39 percent in the last year.
Earnings were announced after the market closed. PeopleSoft shares
closed yesterday at $22.50, down 19 cents for the day.

 Yahoo Buying GeoCities  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Yahoo, in a bid to solidify its lead in the frenzied Internet
market, agreed yesterday to buy GeoCities Inc. for $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The stock deal _ the latest in a rapid series of mergers that
resemble an online version of leapfrog _ pairs the leading Internet
guide with one of the most popular Web destinations for consumers
to create their own home pages. The combination could threaten
America Online's status as the No.1 site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is about critical mass and extending our reach,''
Yahoo President Jeff Mallett said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies _ hell-bent on capturing the ``eyeballs'' of
cybersurfers to cash in on lucrative e-commerce and advertising
sales _ are in a mad dash to consolidate. In the process, most are
using their high-flying stock as currency to snap up competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Net company is talking to one another about doing a
deal,'' said Milo Medin, founder of AtHome, which was acquired by
Yahoo rival Excite for $6.7 billion last week. ``More will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said the Yahoo-GeoCities merger creates a media giant
that will reach almost 60 percent of the Web's 100 million users _
rivaling AOL's anticipated audience once it completes its buyout of
Netscape. Yahoo, which boasts more than 35 million subscribers,
hopes to entice even more consumers _ and subsequently advertisers
_ by offering GeoCities' technology. The home-page-making software
is used by 3.5 million people. In December, GeoCities was the third
most-popular Web site, with almost 19 million visitors, according
to rating firm MediaMetrix.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo expects to offer integrated services by June.
</P>
<P>
   But the steep price that Yahoo paid for the money-losing
GeoCities underscores the stratospheric valuations of tiny
companies, many of which didn't exist a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 290-person GeoCities lost $8.4 million on sales of $7.5
million in the last three months of 1998, according to financial
results released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo is buying reach. They're paying too much, sure, but so
is everyone else in the Internet market,'' said analyst Nicole
Vanderbilt of Jupiter Communications in New York. ``There is
tremendous pressure for Yahoo and its rivals to compete for
consumers online.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL kicked off the current Web wheeling-and-dealing when it
agreed last fall to purchase Netscape Communications Corp. for $4.2
billion. That deal begat the Excite-AtHome merger and Compaq
Computer Corp.'s decision this week &UR;  &LR; to spin off its Alta Vista
search-engine division, which in turn pressured Yahoo into making a
move, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, in 1997, Disney bought a 43-percent stake in
Infoseek Corp. _ the third most-visited search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yahoo-GeoCities might force the hand of Lycos Inc. _ the
fourth most-visited Internet search engine and the only one still
independent _ to find a news or media partner to compete. The
Waltham, Mass., company has talked with a dozen companies,
including CBS, Time and Microsoft, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think the pace of consolidation is fast? Just wait,'' said
analyst Andrea Williams of Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco.
``There are lots of conversations. Lycos, Alta Vista, (Web
community sites) Xoom and Theglobe.com are all up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Xoom, a San Francisco company that recently went public, is not
for sale ``but if someone comes knocking on your door and offers a
bunch of money, you have to consider it,'' company Chairman Chris
Kitze said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Frasca, vice president and general manager of Lycos,
declined to comment on whether the company is for sale. ``We're the
only real hub on the Net to really embrace communities,'' he said.
Yahoo ``is reacting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of yesterday's deal, Yahoo will exchange about 10.6
million shares of its stock for the 31.4 million shares of
GeoCities common stock. The deal is scheduled to close in mid-May.
Yahoo CEO Tim Koogle will head the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo of Santa Clara, which already owns 2.5 percent of
GeoCities, said negotiations with the Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles
County) company heated up in the past two weeks. Mallett
acknowledged that Yahoo had discussed deals with other companies
but declined to name them.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities shares jumped $42.25 to $117.25. Yahoo's stock rose
$31.88 to $367.75.

 Proposed laws to let disabled people work without
risking  benefits  By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
After three years on disability because of HIV, Bobby Tharp was
yearning to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   His health had bounced back due to the new generation of AIDS
drugs. His Social Security benefits were barely covering his rent
and food. And Tharp, a self-described workaholic, knew that getting
back into the job market would boost his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   But Tharp had one big fear _ losing his MediCal health coverage
if he started earning more income than the program allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst fear was losing my doctor and my medications, since
without that, where would I be?'' said Tharp, who nonetheless took
a new job last month as an administrative assistant at Zephyr Real
Estate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of disabled Americans share Tharp's fears of
being left without health coverage if they venture back into the
job market.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is especially acute for the Bay Area's large
population of people with HIV, many of whom have made amazing
progress in their health due to new drugs but face continuing
medication costs of $2,000 a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 1999 might be the year that public officials come to grips
with their dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Both in California and Washington, D.C., government officials
are proposing laws that would make it less risky for disabled
people to return to work _ letting them maintain their
government-subsidized health insurance until they can secure
permanent coverage through their employer or the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   On the state level, Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, is carrying a bill that would allow disabled people who
return to work to maintain their MediCal coverage by paying
premiums of $10 to $200 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would allow people who are disabled to return to work if
they feel able to do so, and not lose their health insurance,''
Migden said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Senators Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and James Jeffords,
R-Vt., are &LR;   &LR; backing a bill that would give states more leeway and
financial incentive to experiment with back-to-work proposals like
Migden's.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DISABLED (83195 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  President Clinton endorsed the Kennedy-Jeffords bill last week in
his State of the Union address, along with other ideas such as a
$1,000 tax credit to help disabled people pay for equipment or
services that allow them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have to choose between keeping health care and
taking a job,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The state and federal proposals would affect disabled people
who receive subsidized health care through the federal Medicare and
state MediCal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare usually covers most of the cost of hospital and doctor
visits, while MediCal covers other costs such as prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled people who return to work can keep receiving Medicare
coverage for up to 36 months, to ease their transition back into
the job market.
</P>
<P>
   But they lose their MediCal coverage entirely if they build up
more than $2,000 in assets such as savings and retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And once they earn more than about $600 per month, MediCal
requires them to funnel a significant portion of their income into
paying for their health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   The result? There's little financial incentive for disabled
people with significant medical bills to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``With HIV, the prescriptions alone can cost thousands of
dollars a month,'' said Irwin Keller, executive director of the
AIDS Legal Referral Panel in San Francisco. ``So people's salaries
would go just to pay for the cost of their drugs. Their quality of
life wouldn't improve at all from going back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill, AB155, would cover disabled people who return to
work and earn up to about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would let them buy continuing MediCal coverage for
relatively modest premiums of $10 to $200 per month, until they are
able to find comparable coverage through their employer or the
private insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative analysts estimate that the bill would affect 2,000
to 4,000 Californians. They say it would cost the state an
estimated $12.3 million each year, of which $4 million would be
offset by recipients' premium payments.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DISABLED (83195 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Former Governor Wilson vetoed a similar measure by Migden last
year, warning that it potentially could be interpreted to include
tens of thousands more people who currently don't receive MediCal,
but might be eligible for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The potential price tag of the program is staggering,'' he
said in his veto statement.
</P>
<P>
   Migden is hoping for better luck this year with California's
newly elected Democratic governor, Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In Bobby Tharp's case, he couldn't afford to wait for passage of
either the state or federal back-to-work laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to work became a financial necessity,'' Tharp said.
``Either I went back to work, or my partner had to find a second
job to support both of us, or we'd be out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Tharp found a welcoming workplace at Zephyr, where he's now
putting in solid 40-hour weeks. But the issue of health coverage
continues to worry him.
</P>
<P>
   If his new earnings end up disqualifying him from MediCal
coverage, Tharp still will be eligible for help from a separate
state program that provides AIDS drug subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran, he also can turn to the Veterans Administration
for medical care. And in six months, he will be eligible for
Zephyr's group health plan.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't mean an end to Tharp's insurance worries.
Zephyr's plan would require him to change doctors _ a frightening
prospect for someone with a life-threatening medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I started back to work, I was afraid of not being able
to afford rent or food,'' Tharp said. ``Now, I have only one fear _
losing my medical care. You can't just go out and find insurance on
your own when you have this kind of preexisting condition.''

GREENSPAN WARNS THAT SOCIAL SECURITY'S FUTURE MAY STILL BE IN
JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>

 (lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
warned Congress on Thursday not to count on projected government
budget surpluses to solve Social Security's problems, and he
suggested that Republicans and Democrats would still have to cut
benefits or raise taxes to insure the retirement system's future.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan was
clearly trying to interject a dose of hard reality into the debate
over Social Security, which for the last week has centered on
President Clinton's proposal to shore up the system with $2.7
trillion out of the $4.4 trillion in surpluses the White House
anticipates in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the surplus reduces the sacrifices that would be
necessary from today's workers and tomorrow's retirees, and for
that reason Republicans too have generally endorsed allocating a
big portion of the surplus to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has alluded in general terms to the need for measures in
addition to using the surplus but has avoided specifics, while
Republicans have been silent or called for solutions that require
neither tax increases nor benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week and again on Thursday, Greenspan criticized one
element of the White House's Social Security proposal, saying that
its call for the government to invest $700 billion in the stock
market would result in political meddling in the free enterprise
system. But Greenspan was supportive again of Clinton's call for a
large portion of the surplus to be used to bolster Social Security
by paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's message on Thursday was that budget forecasts have
been notoriously unreliable in the past and are likely to remain so
in the future, making 15-year surplus projections a rickety
structure on which to base a solution to Social Security's
long-term financial gap.
</P>
<P>
   The country should be wary of assuming ``extraordinarily large
projected surpluses as far as the eye can see,'' Greenspan said.
``I use that term advisedly, because it was originally used on the
deficit side, and it was obvious that as far as the eye could see
wasn't all that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that the Congressional Budget Office had
predicted in February 1997 that the government would run a deficit
in 1998 of $121 billion. The actual outcome was a surplus of $70
billion, an error of $191 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, though, how receptive Congress will be to
Greenspan's message. Just hours after Greenspan spoke, the
Congressional Budget Office distributed a new budget forecast to
congressional leaders showing a total surplus over the next 11
years of nearly $2.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office's projections, which appeared to be roughly in
line with the $4.4 trillion, 15-year surplus projected by the White
House, show the overall surpluses mounting rapidly, from $107
billion in the current fiscal year to $381 billion in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   They also include $794 billion in surpluses over the eight years
starting in 2001 that would not rely on excess payroll taxes that
are nominally earmarked for Social Security _ in other words a true
surplus derived from annual spending being lower than annual
revenues from general tax collections. Republicans have been
counting on the emergence of a true surplus to finance their plans
for an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the overall surpluses materialize and are not used
for new spending programs, Greenspan said, Clinton's strategy of
using the surplus to bolster Social Security by paying down the
national debt is the soundest policy option available.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the debt held by the public would be the best way to
strengthen the economy in the long run, Greenspan said &UR; .  &LR;  But
given the risk that a downturn in the economy or the stock market
could cause the surpluses to evaporate, Greenspan said, Congress
and the administration need to keep looking for ways to increase
the amount of money available for Social Security or to decrease
benefit payments. Greenspan led a commission in the early 1980s
that pushed through both tax increases and benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Raising taxes now or altering the Social Security system to
require increased savings and investment through private accounts
might prove too politically ``burdensome,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, the country would have to examine a long
menu of potential benefit cuts. These might take the form of
increasing the age for retirement, reducing cost-of-living
increases or making less generous the formula used to calculate
lifetime earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considerations such as these should not be taken off the
table,'' Greenspan said.

</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address last week, Clinton said his
plan, which also called for the government to invest a portion of
Social Security's reserves in the stock market, would keep the
system afloat until 2055, compared with 2032 if no changes are
made.
</P>
<P>
   But the benchmark for financial health in Social Security is
solvency for 75 years, and Clinton acknowledged that the two
parties would have to ``to make hard-headed but sensible and
achievable choices'' to meet that goal.
</P>
<P>
   He did not lay out the possibilities, much less endorse any of
them, and most Republicans have avoided the subject altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Greenspan's comments, Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary, said the administration ``could not agree with him
more'' about the need for further bipartisan steps to insure the
system's solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to reserving the surplus and paying down the debt,
we need to do more to reform the system,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior House Republican aide said the issue was a ``crucial
question'' facing both parties and was part of a broader debate
over whether Congress and the administration should settle for a
partial solution on Social Security and defer the hard choices for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   Before it became apparent that the budget surplus could ease
much of the pain of addressing Social Security's woes, the two
parties had been circling warily around a variety of options.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had ruled out increasing the 12.4 percent payroll tax
rate _ split equally between workers and their employers _ that
finances Social Security. But liberal Democrats were advocating
other ways of increasing revenues, including an increase in the
wage level subject to the payroll tax, currently $72,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, have been adamant that they will not
accept any kind of tax increase. They have been more open to other
options, including an increase in the retirement age, which is
already scheduled to rise gradually to 67 over the next several
decades. But organized labor has promised a ferocious effort to
block any further increase in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony on Thursday came as Republicans continued
to question whether Clinton's plan to use the surplus for Social
Security was anything more than an accounting gimmick. And it came
as members of both parties are increasingly pessimistic that there
will be enough bipartisan trust in the aftermath of the impeachment
trial for Congress and the administration to reach a deal on Social
Security.

<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ The Andalucia Apartments collapsed when the
first powerful tremor hit here on Monday afternoon. But under tons
of rubble where the five-story building once stood, someone was
still alive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rescue dogs smelled somebody there, and when we banged on
the concrete that's in the way, whoever it is tapped back,'' said
Nelson Bravo, a fireman who was part of a 30-member team searching
for survivors of the earthquake that killed at least 883 people in
western Colombia and left more than 3,000 injured. ``We can't tell
if it's a man or a woman, but now we have to get this person out
before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Spanish and Colombian rescue workers struggled Thursday
morning to remove debris without causing further collapses,
relatives of residents of the building pawed through piles of
photographs, books and clothes, looking for memories of loved ones
who died in the quake. A crowd of onlookers, many made homeless by
the earthquake, also watched.
</P>
<P>
   Reynaldo Carvajal, however, had a more compelling reason to be
there. He was standing vigil for his aunt, Nellie Munoz Lopez, 38,
a resident of the building who is still not accounted for. Carvajal
said he had come all the way from Cali at the request of his family
with the faint hope that the trapped person just might turn out to
be his aunt. ``I'm staying until I know, one way or another,'' he
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a happy person who lives for her daughter, and always
enlivens our family gatherings,'' he said. ``So we owe her this
much.'' His aunt's daughter was rescued in the first hours after
the quake.
</P>
<P>
   There were reasonable grounds for Carvajal to cling to his
hopes, rescue workers said. Most of those who have been removed
from the rubble around this city of some 225,000 people _ the
hardest hit by the quake _ were already dead. But on Wednesday,
Andres Acevedo, 16, was rescued alive from the ruins of his
family's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lost hope, I really had,'' the youth said Thursday.
``I've been brought back to life to be able to make amends for my
past errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to aid tens of thousands of other survivors, however,
continued to encounter problems. Outside a Red Cross office where
several hundred people stood in line waiting for food to be
distributed, there were bitter complaints that the government was
doing much less to help than private relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth day now, and still no one from any
government organization has come by to help us or ask what we
need,'' said Robinson Angulo, whose family of four has been living
in the streets since their house was destroyed. ``They keep telling
us over the radio to wait, to be calm, but we have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger and alarm at a lack of food led to the looting of dozens
of supermarkets here on Wednesday. ``But there are a lot of us who
don't have the heart to be robbers, and so we just stand in line,''
said Julio Cardona Muriel, head of a household with seven children.
</P>
<P>
   On the chance that she might be able to get some food, Gloria
Ines Narvaez walked halfway across this destroyed city Thursday to
stand in the same Red Cross line. ``The radio didn't say what they
were handing out, but since I have nothing, I decided to come,''
she said as she munched a cracker that relief workers had
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the growing discontent at the inefficiency of
official relief efforts, President Andres Pastrana flew here
Wednesday night to supervise the government's response personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of this tragedy exceeds all initial
calculations,'' Pastrana said in a nationally televised address.
The National Security Council, he said, will formally declare a
``state of economic and social emergency'' as early as Friday to
enable the government to deal more flexibly with the food problem
and with security.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that nearly 100 tons of supplies had
been flown here on Wednesday and that more were expected to arrive
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then where is everything?'' asked Luis Fernando Fuertes, 38, a
television repairman who has been sleeping in a park with his wife
and three daughters since their home was destroyed. ``Where is all
the milk and water and rice and beans they say has been sent? It's
not getting to those of us who need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most widely requested item, however, is not food but plastic
sheeting. With so many people now homeless and living in the
streets, families use the material, when they can find it, to erect
makeshift tents.
</P>
<P>
   When it is not available, families are forced to turn to sheets,
tablecloths, towels and blankets to offer some protection from the
elements. But it has rained here every day since the quake, and
many of those tents are now soggy and smelly.

   Outside the temporary settlements that have sprung up, the
homeless have put up signs to call the government's attention to
their plight. ``We need help'' and ``Don't forget us,'' they plead.
</P>
<P>
   Leticia Zevallos, for example, had to move out of her house
after the back walls caved in. For the moment, she is living in
homemade quarters down the block, sharing an area no bigger than a
Boy Scout pup tent with her daughter, Diana Patricia, and
son-in-law, Victor Daniel Roman, and the couple's two children.
</P>
<P>
   Roman, 20, operates a food stall that was destroyed in the
quake. ``I couldn't make any money anyway,'' he said, ``because
nobody is selling food through normal channels to small fry like
me. It's all going to the speculators.''
</P>
<P>
   Security also continued to be a problem. Military reinforcements
poured into Armenia after Wednesday's spasms of looting, but many
areas were nonetheless left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   Rosso Jose Serano, chief of the national police, said
restrictions on the movement of outsiders into Armenia would also
be put in place to reduce crime. A curfew and a prohibition on
liquor sales remain in effect here and in other cities in the five
provinces affected by the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood called Galan, residents responded to the lack
of police protection by forming their own security force. Armed
with machetes, sticks, pipes and an occasional rifle, some 500 men
erected barricades Wednesday night and patrolled their neighborhood
until dawn, stopping and questioning strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police said to us, `You have to organize yourselves
against the vandals,''' said Fernando Zuluaga, 45, a food salesman.
``They told us if we have to kill somebody, go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, there were new outbreaks of looting at
supermarkets and other stores here. But military policemen quickly
quelled the disturbances by launching tear gas, whose smell
lingered over downtown for hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the generalized confusion, residents of
several areas said, groups of armed men wearing the uniforms of
civil defense workers ordered residents of some buildings to leave
their homes on the ground they might collapse. The false relief
workers then returned to the buildings to loot them, these people
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the growing scarcities, prices of necessities are rising
daily. The price of a simple wooden coffin has soared from $70 to
$350 since Monday, residents said. Batteries and gas for cooking
have more than doubled in price, and the cost of a pound of rice or
a liter of milk has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of one neighborhood said a local official had received
a shipment of milk for distribution in the area, but had turned
around and sold it elsewhere. There have also been reports of
people unaffected by the quake passing themselves off as victims so
they can then sell the milk and water they received free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are getting worse, not better,'' said Steven Ceballos,
a resident of Queens, N.Y., who has been here since Dec. 16
visiting his father. The solidarity of the first couple of days is
breaking down, he said, and ``people are behaving with no heart,
and think only of themselves now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co., by agreeing on Thursday to buy the car
operations of Volvo AB of Sweden for $6.45 billion, has taken its
biggest step yet toward becoming a large-scale seller of
high-profit luxury cars as well as more humble vehicles like the
Escort and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   There is more money to be made on luxury cars, whose sales are
rising in the United States and Europe. Automakers' profits on less
expensive cars have evaporated as low-cost manufacturers in places
like South Korea flood markets in the United States and elsewhere
with ever-cheaper cars. Ford has already bought Jaguar and
Aston-Martin in recent years, but the acquisition of Volvo, a
favorite of affluent families in the northeastern United States and
northern Europe, represents a far greater bet on the luxury market.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that the
automaker sold 200,000 luxury cars last year but wanted to sell a
million annually within several years. Volvo sold 399,700 cars
worldwide last year while Ford sold 6.8 million cars, sport utility
vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser and William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman, said that they
liked Volvo's current lineup of cars and were not planning
immediate changes. Both men also said that they admired Volvo's
tradition of paying attention to safety and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important because it fits very nicely with the
social values at Ford,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor has increasingly emphasized the same issues as Volvo
in recent months, making its sport utility vehicles pollute as
little as cars and announcing plans to offer side air bags on all
cars. The shift has come as Ford has reasserted family control over
the automaker in recent months and begun re-emphasizing the Ford
family's longtime tradition of public service, best shown by the
creation of the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's purchase of Volvo, while costlier than many auto analysts
had predicted, was well received on Thursday on Wall Street. Ford's
stock rose $2.1875 a share, to $62.50, while Volvo's American
depository receipts fell 81.75 cents each, to $26.5625.
</P>
<P>
   While Volvo's popularity among affluent baby boomers may be
useful to Ford now, some auto industry experts questioned whether
Ford's long-term strategy truly required Volvo. Susan Jacobs, a
consultant in Rutherford, N.J., noted that Lincoln recently
introduced its LS cars to appeal to the same market _ vehicles
costing $30,000 to $45,000 _ while Jaguar will soon start selling
its new S-type cars in the same market segment of luxury family
vehicles costing less than $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln and Jaguar are both evolving toward the market of
Volvo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said that Volvo's car business was attractive because it
filled gaps in Ford's current lineup. Volvo has a much higher
proportion of women buyers than Ford has for its existing luxury
brands: Lincoln and Jaguar. Volvo sells 60 percent of its cars in
Europe, while Ford sells only 24 percent of its cars there. And
Ford has an extensive distribution network that can be used to sell
Volvo cars more widely, Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that the automaker also thought it could learn from
Volvo's techniques for assembling the main metal structural
components of cars and for achieving high customer loyalty and
customer satisfaction ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Leif Johansson, Volvo's president, said that Volvo would use the
50 billion Swedish kronor from the sale of its car division to
strengthen the company's huge and more profitable commercial truck
and bus division. Volvo took a 12.8 percent stake earlier this
month in Scania, its Swedish archrival in the commercial truck
industry and has expressed an interest in taking control of it.
Thursday's agreement must be approved by Volvo shareholders.

</P>
<P>
   International auto mergers have a history of producing ruinous
culture clashes. So Ford executives took great pains on Thursday to
try to reassure Swedish workers and managers that the change in
corporate control would not mean an immediate imposition of
American managers and production techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in Sweden since 1924 _ they know us, and they know
how we operate,'' Ford said. ``I don't think we've ever been viewed
as a parochial company.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo tried to merge with France's Renault in 1993, but the deal
collapsed when midlevel Volvo managers complained publicly that
their French counterparts were too bossy. After Renault took
control of American Motors Corp. in the early 1980s through a
series of stock purchases, cultural differences produced managerial
chaos, and American Motors was eventually sold to the Chrysler
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When Daimler-Benz AG acquired Chrysler last autumn, it tried to
avoid cultural differences by leaving virtually all of Chrysler's
senior management in place, although Germans still outnumber
Americans by 9-2 in the top tier of management at the new
DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been unusually successful at international mergers,
having bought Jaguar a decade ago and made it profitable while
fixing the chronic quality problems that long tarnished Jaguar's
reputation. Probably not by coincidence, Ford has also been more
aggressive in promoting foreign-born executives to top jobs: Nasser
was born in rural Lebanon and grew up in Australia, while his
predecessor, Alexander Trotman, was British.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, all of the top 16 executives at General Motors
Corp. are American men. GM owns half of Volvo's main rival, Saab,
and has an agreement to buy the other half, but Saab is still
struggling and its brand image remains murky despite GM's efforts
to clarify it.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's success at Jaguar and its international staff were the
main reasons that Volvo chose Ford's bid over a slightly higher
offer from Fiat SpA of Italy, people close to the negotiations
said. Fiat said on Thursday that in any case, it had been
interested in buying all of Volvo, including its business in heavy
trucks and buses.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser said at a news conference in Volvo's hometown of
Goteburg, Sweden, that Ford would use its experience with Jaguar as
a model for its management of Volvo's car operations. Ford has
begun replacing inconspicuous Jaguar parts like suspensions and
electrical systems, which it can buy at much lower prices because
of the economies of scale available to it as the world's
second-largest auto maker. Ford has also started encouraging
dealers to own both Ford and Jaguar dealerships, although they
seldom sell both kinds of vehicles side by side so as to avoid
blurring distinctions between the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But even 10 years after Ford's purchase of Jaguar, the biggest
savings are still several years away. Ford plans to build the next
Ford Thunderbird and Jaguar S-type car on the same underbody it
already uses for the Lincoln LS cars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jaguar, Volvo is profitable and has a fairly wide
selection of modern car designs. As a result, Ford will move only
gradually toward using common parts and building Ford and Volvo
cars on virtually identical underbodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term that will not be needed; in the long term I
certainly hope so,'' Nasser said. ``More integration and more
cross-fertilization will certainly be part of the business
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford will pay the $6.45 billion entirely in cash, which will be
easy for a company with $23.8 billion in cash reserves. Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp., the credit rating agency, reaffirmed Ford's and
Volvo's strong ratings on Thursday.

BRYANT COOL ABOUT CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ All those zeroes and commas, accented by
that big, fat dollar sign, stare Kobe Bryant in the face, but the
newly anointed $70.9 million man isn't sure how to react yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I'm trying not to think about it. I'm trying to
hold it back,'' a smiling Bryant said Thursday, calmly soaking in
the glory of a six-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers that
averages $11.8 million a season through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 20-year-old Bryant prepared to sign the deal _ a
formality he'll take care of this morning at the Forum _ his
friends and family already had plans for the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and my sister were going crazy, especially my sister
Shaya,'' Bryant said. ``She's like, `Oh yeah, Rodeo Driiiiive.'
She's really pumped up about it. She jokes around a lot, but I like
to spoil my sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the predictable loan requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant coach Bill) Bertka asked for 50 dollars,'' Bryant
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But he has no plans for his first major NBA payday, other than
to say, ``It's gonna go right to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the deal done didn't take much thought either. Bryant
and agent Arn Tellem knew they would seek the maximum allowed under
the NBA's new labor deal. The Lakers knew what Bryant could command
as a free agent this summer and were ready to lock him up as soon
as possible, preferably before the season began.
</P>
<P>
   There was hardly anything resembling a negotiation. ``Just a
couple conversations, certainly no sit-down meetings,'' general
manager Mitch Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evaluated the market for a player like him and we rather
quickly got to the point where we said, `Hey, this is a good deal
for us,''' he said. ``When it's a clear-cut decision, something
like this, there's really not a whole lot of thought required.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our mind, it was easy to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bryant, a budding superstar, but not yet a starter, is now
the Lakers' second-highest-paid player behind Shaquille O'Neal, who
he'll team with well into the next millennium as the franchise's
new core. Bryant's deal includes an opt-out clause in 2004, but he
plans to spend his career here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically told them, L.A. is a good spot for me,'' Bryant
said. ``I feel comfortable here. I love (Lakers executive) Jerry
West. I love the situation I'm in. So it's a good place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris, who's mulling a three-man rotation of Bryant,
Eddie Jones and Rick Fox in order to get starting time for the
young phenom, said the contract won't influence coaching decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches don't pay any attention to contracts,'' he said.
``Kobe's going to play a big role. He's played a big role the last
two years. He's not likely to play a lesser role than he's been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   With big money comes big expectations, but Bryant said he's
comfortable in his sixth-man role _ for now, anyway _ and that the
money won't change his approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to think about (fan expectations),'' he
said. ``I have to think about what I have to do as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as living up to that $70 million price tag?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna be worth the $70 million,'' he said. ``Don't even
worry about it, I'll be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   About that rotation: While Harris ponders how to get playing
time for all his stars, he's sticking to an established trend for
tonight's exhibition game against the Clippers. The Lakers will
start the group that finished last season _ O'Neal, Robert Horry,
Fox, Jones and Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any reason to alter it,'' Harris said. ``You
can't change the lineup because there's a draw, it has to be a
knockout. Somebody has to knock somebody out before you change
something that's successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rookie guard Sam Jacobson (strained left hip
flexor) did not practice Thursday and will not play tonight. Fisher
(sprained right ankle, right knee tendinitis) practiced for only an
hour but should play tonight.

   &UR; !text! &LR; AMHERST, Mass. _ With Massachusetts winning its first
national championship, pressure is building to lift football to the
big time of Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``While everyone's attention is focused on it and they see how
much joy it brought to the campus, it really makes sense to do
that,'' said Dave Robinson, a former board member of the university
Alumni Association.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade project, which has stayed mostly in the background
since a burst of publicity in 1995, is getting a shove from the
team's 55-43 upset of No. 1 Georgia Southern last month in the
Division I-AA championship. With the victory, the Minutemen (12-3)
capped a remarkable turnaround from a 2-9 record the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
   The push to move to I-A by campus sports administrators also
picked up a nudge earlier this month when Connecticut applied to
join the Big East Conference. That Huskies intend to boost its
football program to I-A.
</P>
<P>
   UMass coach Mark Whipple calls the Big East a ``natural''
destination for his program, too.
</P>
<P>
   He said his team's surprise national championship has expanded
interest in the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have asked me about it, and more recruits have
asked me about it than ever before,'' Whipple said. ``We would
certainly like to head that way,'' he said Thursday. ``Now it's
much more in my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the faculty Senate went on record with a vote against
moving to I-A in football, largely out of worry about the cost of a
new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   John Bracey, the Senate leader, said he agreed with its vote at
the time. He said many I-A programs lose money. But he said the
team's championship and the Connecticut plans may supply a new
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If UMass is going to move up to I-A, this might be a good time
to look at it,'' he said. ``As an aspiration of the athletic
department, I think they ought to pursue it.''!end!

   (NYT32) MIAMI -- Jan. 28, 1999 -- FBN-BRONCOS-ROBINSON, 1-28 --
Greg Robinson, the Denver Broncos' defensive coordinator. His
defense allowed an American Conference low of 80.4 rushing yards a
game, second in the league to Atlanta's 75.2. The nonbelievers can
argue that the figure does not necessarily indicate a great
defense, merely a great offense. With the Broncos outscoring the
opposition by almost 2- to 1 by halftime, opponents abandoned the
run, started to pass, and the rushing average plummeted. (Barton

ALBRIGHT TALKS TO MODERATE ARABS ABOUT `REGIME CHANGE' FOR IRAQ  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On every stop on her quick trip to moderate Arab
states, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright explained the
administration's new goal for Iraq: ``regime change.''
</P>
<P>
   The term, jargon for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, has been
used since President Clinton announced last November that the
containment of the Iraqi president was no longer sufficient. The
aim, he said, was a change of leadership in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   During her talks in Egypt and Saudi Arabia and more briefly on
Thursday in Jordan, Albright was seeking the support of these
governments for the long-term policy of seeing Saddam toppled,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, said that the secretary had
found general agreement on the goal of the policy but that these
countries wanted to see the overthrow come from within Iraq rather
than from outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have
expressed serious doubts about the administration's plans to
finance Iraqi opposition groups that operate outside Iraq and that
have failed in previous efforts to penetrate Iraq and bring down
the government.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win support from these moderate Arab states for
the policy, Albright appeared to downplay the importance of seven
Iraqi opposition groups that became eligible last November for $97
million after Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said no decision had been made yet on
how to assist these groups or whether to give them lethal or
non-lethal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress focused on a particular approach _ to arm opposition
groups and inject them into Iraq to achieve an overthrow,'' said an
administration official. ``We've scrubbed that and developed a
broader, more integrated approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials said they would not talk about the
details of the Egyptian and Saudi responses to how they would
actually help the administration's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments in the region prefer to do rather than talk,''
said one official who insisted on anonymity. ``That's especially
the case when you're dealing with a fellow Arab country even when
there is complete disdain'' for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of showing that the administration is in tune with the
desire of the moderate Arab states to see Saddam toppled from
within Iraq, Albright brought along with her Francis Ricciardone,
who was appointed earlier this month as the State Department's
special representative for transition in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ricciardone, who was the political adviser to Turkish and
American commanders of the relief operation in northern Iraq that
began in 1991, is to oversee efforts to ``create the environment
and pressures inside Iraq'' that it is hoped will lead to the
overthrow of Saddam, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were vague about how these conditions would be
created beyond broadcasts of Radio Free Iraq, which is paid for by
Washington, and mobilizing Iraqis outside Iraq as a lobbying group
on behalf of opposition groups inside the country.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright traveled in the Middle East, Gen. Anthony Zinni,
who commands U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, testifying before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned the policy of
supporting opposition groups in the hope of deposing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived in Egypt and Saudi Arabia just as those
governments have taken a much tougher line against Saddam. Earlier
this month, the Iraqi leader called on the people of Egypt and
Saudi Arabia to rise up against their governments, a move that
helped intensify the desire by the leadership in these two
countries to see him deposed.
</P>
<P>
   At an Arab League meeting in Cairo, Egypt, last weekend, a
senior Iraqi minister stalked out of the gathering in a
demonstration of the increasing isolation of Saddam in the Arab
world, administration officials said.

   Clean your fingernails. Make sure no food is stuck between your

</P>
<P>
   For years, self-help books have been preaching these basic rules
for job interviews. Getting in the door is a good start, of course.
It's your chance to separate yourself from that stack of
applications, to impress the prospective boss with all your
personal charm. The goal isn't just getting in the door, though.
It's leaving with a job.
</P>
<P>
   But some sad sacks never get the word. A survey of personnel
executives at 200 of the Fortune 1000 companies turned up a wide
range of strange and self-defeating behavior by some applicants
about a year ago. The results are a primer on what not to do on a
job interview.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted for Commemorative Brands, a
manufacturer of high-school and college class rings, by the New
York research firm Schulman, Ronca and Bucuvalas. Here is a
sampling of comments from the interviewers:
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The reason the candidate was taking so long to respond to a
question became apparent when he began to snore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``During the entire interview, the applicant wore a baseball
cap. . . . A few days later, another college graduate showed up for
a management trainee position wearing overalls and sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I asked the candidate to give a good example of the
organizational skills she was boasting about, she said she was
proud of her ability to pack her suitcase `real neat' for her
vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wanted to know if employee perks included a swimming pool,
paid lunches at the company cafeteria or a free computer to use at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why did he go to college? His ill-conceived answer: `To
party and socialize.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He couldn't answer any of my questions because he had just
had major dental work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I gave him my business card at the beginning of the
interview, he immediately crumpled it and tossed it in the
wastebasket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I received a resume and a note that said the recent high
school graduate wanted to earn $25 an hour _ `and not a nickel
less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He had arranged for a pizza to be delivered to my office
during a lunch-hour interview. I asked him not to eat it until
later.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Said she had just graduated cum laude, but had no idea what
cum laude meant. However, she was proud of her grade point average.
It was 2.1.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Insisted on telling me that he wasn't afraid of hard work.
But insisted on adding that he was afraid of horses and didn't like
jazz, modern art or seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The candidate never looked directly at me once during the
entire interview. Just stared at the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An otherwise qualified candidate took herself out of the
running when she opened her mouth. She had her tongue pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She actually showed up for an interview during the summer
wearing a bathing suit. Said she didn't think I'd mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He sat down opposite me, made himself comfortable and
proceeded to put his foot up on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The interview had gone well, until he told me that he and
his friends wore my company's clothing whenever they could. At
which point, I had to tell him that we manufactured office
products, not sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Applied for a customer service position although, as he
confided, he really wasn't a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When I mentioned that we had gone to the same college, he
stood up and began to belt out the school football fight song.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Without asking if I minded, he casually lit a cigar and then
tossed the match onto my carpet _ and couldn't understand why I was
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``On the phone I had asked the candidate to bring his resume
and a couple of references. He arrived with the resume _ and two
people.''

</P>
<P>
   The Senate has met in secret a lot lately. Our hunch is that if
anyone knows what they're up to in there it's Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's votes not to dismiss the Clinton case but call
witnesses were both 56-44, with only Senator Feingold crossing
party lines. Yes, but only Feingold's state has ``sin'' in its
name.
</P>
<P>
   After videotaped depositions of witnesses, the Senate will vote
on whether to have them testify live. In Congress ``Enough!'' must
mean ``More!''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want Mr. Clinton to testify at his trial. Why?
That's what the State of the Union speech amounted to.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans promise not to ask Monica Lewinsky any graphic
questions about her sexual relations with Mr. Clinton. Are they
afraid they'd have to ask Democrats to explain her answers?
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was the proposed GOP witness list. The way this
is going we guessed it would contain Bill, Buddy and Socks.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the International Olympic Committee has quit.
The whole Olympic movement seems to be in some kind of downhill
event.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope celebrated Mass in the presence of the
largest crowd ever assembled indoors in the U.S. That's if you
don't count the day Dom Deluise and Marlon Brando ran into each
other in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told young people to avoid a world ``filled with
darkness.'' He's right. Impressionable youth should stay out of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the newspaper company board from which Dan
Quayle just resigned to run for president says his position will be
filled later. By Quayle as soon as he loses?
</P>
<P>
   In the way you can send a ``Wine of the Month'' gift, for
instance, maybe someone should arrange for a ``Get Well Card of the
Week'' for Boris Yeltsin.

witnesses were both 56-44, with only Senator Feingold crossing
party lines. Yes, but only Feingold's state has ``sin'' in its
name.
</P>
<P>
   After videotaped depositions of witnesses, the Senate will vote
on whether to have them testify live. In Congress ``Enough!'' must
mean ``More!''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want Mr. Clinton to testify at his trial. Why?
That's what the State of the Union speech amounted to.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans promise not to ask Monica Lewinsky any graphic
questions about her sexual relations with Mr. Clinton. Are they
afraid they'd have to ask Democrats to explain her answers?
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was the proposed GOP witness list. The way this
is going we guessed it would contain Bill, Buddy and Socks.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the International Olympic Committee has quit.
The whole Olympic movement seems to be in some kind of downhill
event.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the pope celebrated Mass in the presence of the
largest crowd ever assembled indoors in the U.S. That's if you
don't count the day Dom Deluise and Marlon Brando ran into each
other in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told young people to avoid a world ``filled with
darkness.'' He's right. Impressionable youth should stay out of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the newspaper company board from which Dan
Quayle just resigned to run for president says his position will be
filled later. By Quayle as soon as he loses?
</P>
<P>
   In the way you can send a ``Wine of the Month'' gift, for
instance, maybe someone should arrange for a ``Get Well Card of the
Week'' for Boris Yeltsin.

SOME FRIENDLY MINGLING IN THE CHAMBER DESPITE A DAY OF HARD PARTY
DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Strom Thurmond slowly came down the aisle
Thursday with a wide smile and two pieces of candy sweets for
Cheryl Mills and Nicole Seligman, lawyers at President Clinton's
defense table. The 96-year-old senator regularly finds courtly
delight in chatting with the women when he is not sitting mutely in
judgment of the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the president's personal counsel, David Kendall, was
working on a Sunday crossword puzzle, in ink, with a backup puzzle
waiting in his briefing folder. It was 1 p.m. sharp, time for a
court session in the impeachment of Clinton, but nothing was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, an uncharted region of impeachment doldrums had been
entered. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi,
said nothing about the increasingly embarrassing delay when,
smiling confidently, he rose and told the mostly empty Senate that,
yes, more time was needed for the party caucuses that were under
way elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With the chamber forced to drift in recess, the most contentious
thing uttered on the trial record Thursday, as most senators
remained in heated dispute off the floor, was the insistence in the
opening prayer that ``at no time are we hapless or helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the party meetings, positions were hardening, and four hours
later Lott decided not to let another day pass with the Senate in a
standoff before the eyes of the watching nation.
</P>
<P>
   After a largely futile search for common ground, Lott called for
a round of voting on rival plans for ending the trial. The stark
vote tallies laid out the deep party divide as the court moved into
a controversial process for ending the trial that left Democrats
complaining that it would allow for a videotaped deposition
appearance by Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some feeling she ought not be on the same floor where
Webster and John Kennedy were,'' said Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in
criticizing the Democratic wariness and preferring Ms. Lewinsky to
appear in person, and President Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol grounds, the president was attending a
memorial service for Lawton Chiles, the former senator and governor
from Florida, even as his fellow Democrats scrapped in his behalf
to bar any Lewinsky videotape on the Senate floor and to fix a firm
trial closing date of Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually failed, even as Republicans insisted there would
be no Lewinsky spectacle nor fresh leeway allowed the House
Republican prosecutors to push the trial in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear the new party-line trial procedure will allow the
prosecutors to sensationalize and destabilize the proceeding,
whether new facts are discovered or not. The president, with his
political fate once more moving toward judgment, made no mention of
any of this as he mourned his old friend, Chiles, as a great
politician and quoted some lines of poetry:
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make our lives sublime,
</P>
<P>
   And, departing, leave behind us
</P>
<P>
   Footprints on the sands of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton incorrectly attributed the lines to Wordsworth rather
than Longfellow, and he omitted the opening stanza line: ``Lives of
great men all remind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Democratic caucus, Charles Schumer, the freshman
senator from New York, warily recited a scrap of Bob Dylan lyrics:
``What do I have to do to prevent from going through all these
things twice?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for me it's thrice,'' Schumer said, referring to his
final two votes last year as a member of the House and of the
judiciary committee. He was part of the Democratic minority that,
in a rancorously partisan struggle, failed to block the impeachment
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the House, the far right kept moving the goal posts back,''
contended Schumer, now a member of the Senate court whose old House
instincts about cut-and-thrust political trouble have hardly seemed
to fade. ``Until today I thought that would not happen here. Now,
I'm worried it could.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lott made his move Thursday evening to end the standoff in
the trial, the public mood within the Senate, despite the day of
hard party division, was remarkably amiable. Jokes, bipartisan
mingling, friendly back slaps, waves and nods suggested a workable
deal had been struck even as three separate votes laid out the
partisan divide as the trial moved into a potential muddy
homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the Senate's odd spirit of public bonhomie Thursday
evening suggested that only the deposition results _ whether the
Republicans vote to put some fresh Lewinsky videotape before the
nation _ will settle the question of just how combative the trial
might become.
</P>
<P>
   As the votes approached, Thurmond came slowly down the aisle to
take his place in judgment of the president, grinning once more as
he paid court to the defense counsels for the impeached president.

TEACHERS FEEL UNQUALIFIED FOR MODERN CLASSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report that U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley says
shows ``a cry for help from the teachers themselves,'' only one in
five full-time, public school teachers said they felt well
qualified to teach in a modern classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Teacher Quality: A Report on the Preparation and
Qualifications of Public School Teachers,'' said only about 20
percent of more than 4,000 teachers surveyed nationwide said they
were confident in using modern technology or in working with
students with disabilities or from diverse backgrounds. Less than
half reported feeling very well prepared for the challenges facing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only 28 percent said they felt very qualified to use student
performance assessment techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``These data confirm our dramatic need to get serious about
better preparing for and supporting teachers in our classrooms,''
Riley said at a news conference in Washington Thursday at which the
report was released.
</P>
<P>
   Celia Lose, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of
Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers union, said that
more is being demanded of teachers because of rising academic
standards, the importance of technology and the desire to integrate
in the classroom increasing numbers of students with physical or
learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lose said the survey is ``absolutely not'' an indictment of
teachers. ``Teachers are professionals and want to do their jobs
well. No one starts a job with the skills of a veteran. Teachers
need the sort of help and mentoring that doctors, for example, give
their peers. The schools are not supportive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the news conference, Riley said that
although he was using his office mainly to call attention to a key
deficiency in the nation's classrooms, and that he expected state
and local governments to come up with remedies, the federal
government can help by attracting ``more bright and enthusiastic
people into teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Columbia Teachers College in New
York, said teacher quality is ``a huge issue,'' exacerbated by the
fact that many teachers, especially teachers of math, science and
English as a second language, have not been trained in the subjects
they are required to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of difficulty, Levine said, is that in the past
the field of education took advantage of very bright women and
minorities whose only career options were teaching and nursing, but
now that many of these people have been able to get higher-paying
jobs in business, ``the field of education has lost a captive pool
of potential teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report arises from a 1998 survey of 4,049 full-time public
school teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

EDITORIAL: WINDFALL CITY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 29:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even at this moment of prosperity, New York City faces mounting
budget deficits and municipal debt in the years ahead. Thursday
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed some clever fiscal acrobatics to
address these problems and still meet the city's needs. He wants to
roll over a $1.6 billion budget surplus into next year to pay for
operating expenses. He also wants to use money expected from the
tobacco lawsuit settlement as collateral for $2.5 billion in loans
to build schools. Both steps raise questions that need to be
analyzed thoroughly before the City Council approves them.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposals came in his financial outline for the
fiscal year that begins July 1. Unfortunately, the day before, Gov.
George Pataki blew a $300 million hole in the mayor's plans by
proposing school aid cuts in programs the city was counting on and
that Pataki had promised to support. Giuliani was scathing in his
comments about the governor's reversed course, as he should have
been, setting up a battle over school aid that will pit a governor
with national ambitions against a mayor with statewide ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the mayor's financial plan keeps spending under
control for another year, but with questionable tactics. Giuliani
argues that 1,500 more police officers are needed to bring crime
down still further. He would have a stronger case if the city had
not failed to turn many Police Department tasks over to civilians
so as to move officers from desk jobs to crime-fighting. The mayor
also has set aside nearly $1 billion in receipts from the
commercial rent tax over the next five years to pay for sports
stadiums whose value has yet to be demonstrated, including a
possible new football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he engages once again in the cynical exercise of
proposing cuts in vital arts and youth services programs, knowing
that the Council will restore them in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has only three years left in office. But he has
figured out a way to spend nearly all the money the city expects
over the next 20 years from tobacco companies. He wants to issue
$2.5 billion in new 20-year ``tobacco bonds'' and pay them off over
20 years, using up most of the $6.7 billion the city expects in the
settlement. One problem is that the federal government might sue to
get a portion of the money unless the city sets aside more of it
for health purposes. It would be more prudent to use the tobacco
windfall as it comes in each year, and not borrow against it in
advance, as Council Speaker Peter Vallone has suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dubious is the mayor's plan to use the current year's
surplus to support spending in the next year. Again, it would be
more sensible to use any budget surplus for capital needs or to pay
down the city's debt, and to find other ways to save money in the
next year. The mayor has a very poor record in achieving savings
through labor productivity improvements. It is also unacceptable
for him to sell the New York Coliseum and use the proceeds to pay
for ongoing budget expenses. Giuliani has done an effective job in
holding down expenses over the years. Tapping windfalls can get the
city from one year to the next, but more needs to be done to
address the underlying problems creating deficits year after year. &QL;

 Daughter Faces Status Question  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My daughter works as the personal assistant to a woman
who is wildly successful in the multimedia world. She works
exclusively for this woman, at this woman's office. Her employer
pays her by the hour as an independent contractor, so she receives
no benefits, no vacation and must pay self-employment tax on her
earnings. Is this proper and legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The facts are pretty sketchy but, off the bat, I'd say
that your daughter is very likely being illegally misclassified as
a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Confusion over employee/contractor status is a
growing problem nowadays, from small startups to Fortune 500
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of years, we've been dealing with questions
like this a great deal,'' said Conley Baker of the Employers Group,
a California nonprofit that provides human resources help to its
member firms. ``I think it has to do with downsizing. Companies
need work to be done but don't want to hire people as regular
employees to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service used to have a checklist of 20
different criteria for telling whether someone is an employee or
independent contractor. Recently, they've boiled these down to
three major categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Behavioral control &LR; . &LR;   &LR; Contractors generally have great
freedom to do the work any way they want _ any time, any place, as
long as the job gets done. Employees, on the other hand, follow
directions from their employers about how, where and when to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Financial control &LR; . Contractors are usually paid a flat fee
for an entire project and risk losing money if the job takes longer
than expected, while employees are paid a weekly, monthly or hourly
wage and incur little personal financial risk. Contractors also
tend to invest in their own tools and business materials, while
employees use equipment and materials supplied by the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Type of relationship. &LR;   &LR; Contractors tend to be hired for
limited amounts of time, while employees are hired on an open-ended
basis. And contractors tend to perform work that is not a key
aspect of the company's business: An accountant who is hired to do
a once-a-year audit is probably a contractor, while the bookkeeper
who handles day-to-day office finances is probably an employee.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that your daughter is an employee for a variety of
reasons. She's paid hourly on an open-ended basis, she's working
solely for this one woman, and I bet the boss directs her work and
sets her hours.
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter should approach her employer and politely explain
that she doesn't want the company to run afoul of the IRS or other
agencies by misclassifying her.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  And in fact, there are big financial risks to an employer who
messes up here _ such as liability for back payroll taxes,
unemployment taxes, disability insurance and other benefits, and
workers compensation payments.
</P>
<P>
   Want more information on how to determine if someone is an
employee or an independent contractor? See IRS Publication 15A, the
Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide. You can get it by calling (800)
TAX-FORM or visiting the IRS Web site at  &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov &LR; . You
may also want to read the excellent guidebook, ``Hiring Independent
Contractors: The Employer's Legal Guide,'' by Stephen Fishman (Nolo
Press).
</P>
<P>
   Burning Bridges
</P>
<P>
   Q: About seven months ago, I quit a job that I'd held very
successfully for five years. Now I'd like to return to the company,
but the human resources department isn't returning my calls. I
think that I'm being blacklisted because of critical things I said
about my old manager during my exit interview. At the time, I was
told the exit interview would be confidential. Is it fair to hold
my honest comments against me this way? Can they refuse to hire me
back because of things I said in a supposedly-confidential
interview?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Like much in the working world, this company's refusal to
hire you back may not be fair _ but it's completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have the right to hire or reject whomever they want,
as long as they're not discriminating on a basis such as race or
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies even have formal policies against rehiring anyone
who's quit _ no matter how good their performance was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I hired back a woman who had left for four months and I
had a number of human resources people say to me, `I'm surprised
you had her come back,''' said Patricia Stansbury, CEO of Stansbury
Staffing Consultants and president of the Northern California Human
Resources Association.
</P>
<P>
   This company should, of course, have the basic civility to
return your calls and tell you what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hold your breath waiting for that. Write them off your
job-hunt list and move on to other employers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the meantime, try to draw some lessons from this episode.
</P>
<P>
   One is to avoid burning bridges when leaving jobs. It can be
tempting to say ``Whee-hoo! Take this job and shove it!'' the
minute you get an offer from a new employer.
</P>
<P>
   But six months or two years from now, the company you're leaving
may look awfully good again. So make sure you end your stay at any
job in a professional fashion _ giving plenty of notice, staying
engaged in your work through the end and offering to help train
your replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is to remain equally professional during exit
interviews. Perhaps you did this, and the company just didn't want
to hear any criticism at all. But perhaps you let off steam in a
way that alienated them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``It's good to tell the truth,'' Stansbury said. ``But be
circumspect. Keep your comments on very specific behaviors and
situations. If you talk about how a manager always came in late
while he was asking his employees to be on time, they shouldn't
hold that against you. But never get into character assassination.
If you bad-mouth a manager's personality, it will just be
considered gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MORE ON MATERNITY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Last week's column included a question about maternity leave
rights from a woman who had been laid off from her job, became
pregnant and is now about to be called back to work. Attorney
Judith Kurtz of San Francisco points out that California's
pregnancy disability leave law applies to all pregnant employees,
regardless of how long they've been on the job. So if this woman
returned to work for even one day, California law would make her
eligible for up to four months of pregnancy disability leave,
including about six weeks off after childbirth.

</HEADLINE>
 - NYT  
 (Attn: N.J., Ill.)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Since the defendant's name is Timothy Boomer, it is difficult to
resist a certain lightness of tone about the freedom of speech case
now being considered by a Michigan judge. After Boomer's canoe
bellied up in the Rifle River north of Detroit, he began yelling
several crude words _ OK, maybe a whole carload of crude words,
some of which could be heard a quarter of a mile away. His
vocalizing offended a family canoeing nearby, provoking the mother
to put her hands over her child's ears. Then a sheriff's deputy, on
what must have been a fairly crowded stretch of river, issued
Boomer a ticket under an 1897 state law prohibiting cursing in
front of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer's ticket should be an easy call for the courts; this
antique law clearly treads on constitutional protections of free
speech. Still, the intensity of the battle offers a clue about how
some people feel about dirty talking.
</P>
<P>
   In Raritan, N.J., for example, the borough's elders decided four
years ago to ban ``profane, vulgar or indecent language'' in
streets, businesses, houses, churches or any ``private or public
place.'' So far, no one has been cited. The worst Raritan residents
have had to suffer is labels like ``Village of the Darned.''
</P>
<P>
   For those needing to break the expletive habit, James O'Connor
has created the Cuss Control Academy, a kind of bleepers anonymous,
outside Chicago. He advises high schoolers that cursing ruins your
image and no longer shocks anybody, except maybe in Michigan and
Raritan. He offers substitutes like, ``I'm up the creek without a
paddle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan judge should dismiss this case quickly. Boomer
doesn't belong in a courtroom. He might not even need O'Connor.
Mobbed by the media earlier this week, the 24-year-old looked like
somebody who had already been punished or at least shamed by his
new international status as ``the super-cusser,'' as he put it,
adding sheepishly: ``My parents didn't raise me this way.''

 Virtual Retailer Amazon.com Plans to Expand Its Real
Estate  Holdings  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's a good thing that Amazon.com isn't burdened by all that brick
and mortar. Because if one didn't know better, it would appear that
the online bookseller is poised to take on Walter Shorenstein.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key advantages that Amazon fans like to incessantly
recite is that the online bookseller doesn't own stores; therefore,
it isn't weighed down by real estate liabilities like rivals
Borders Books and Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to federal documents filed earlier this week, the
virtual retailer is preparing to employ some masons of its own. In
the company's 8-K financial filing, chief executive Jeff Bezos
noted that Amazon's holiday performance ``was so strong, the
company has committed to a major expansion plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, we intend to build out a significant distribution
infrastructure. We must ensure that we can support all the sales
that customers demand, with speedy access to a deep product
inventory,'' he stated.
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the wheel-loaders. It sounds like Amazon is going to
prime the economy with construction jobs. In addition to announcing
plans to expand warehouse and shipping capacity, Bezos hinted that
Amazon will join its portal compatriots in their current
acquisition binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, we expect to invest even more aggressively than in
the past,'' Bezos stated in the filing. (Read: We're shopping for
buyouts.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Amazon needs to expand its distribution capability in
order to keep pace with its growth. Thus far, its business model
depends on high-volume sales of commodity merchandise at relatively
slim profit margins, which means that the company needs the
wherewithal to fill orders and ship merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The filing doesn't imply that Amazon is getting into storefront
retailing, which is where its traditional competitors rack up
costly real estate expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with expansion comes considerable risk _ for both the
company and its shareholders. Naturally, Amazon should be able to
leverage its rich market capitalization of $19.45 billion to help
pay for its building spree.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET29 (88281 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In fact, Amazon announced yesterday that it has raised $1.25
billion via a convertible debt offering lead-managed by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. It isn't clear whether money from the offering
_ which is being called the biggest convertible deal in U.S.
history _ will be used, at least in part, for real estate.
Telephone calls to Amazon were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being flush with cash, Amazon's decision to borrow more
than a billion bucks suggests that it is making no small plans. In
addition to CEO Bezo's statement in the filing, there are other
signs that Amazon soon may be on the hook for more real estate
expense than most any other Internet portal in cyberspace _ an
intriguing prospect, given that Amazon last year lost four times as
much money as it did during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's real estate needs are industrial and, perhaps, office
in nature. Yet judging by the company's ambitious plans to build an
internal real estate department, we're not talking about simply a
single warehouse shed situated in fly-over country. (The company
revealed in the filing that it already has begun leasing a new
distribution center in Fernley, Nev.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Amazon's employment notice posted on its Web site,
the e-tailer is looking to fill at least three key real estate
positions. The site states that Amazon's real estate department is
looking for a project manager for ``the planning, design,
construction, and engineering of new and existing office facilities
and distribution and data centers.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also is looking for a real estate broker or
developer, who will report to the manager of ``global real
estate.'' The candidate would be expected to ``drive delivery of
new facilities through the development process.'' And the third job
posting is for a real estate analyst who would guide the company's
``rapidly expanding facilities needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, ``global real estate''? That sounds more like an
empire-building arm of General Motors than a nimble division of a
lean-and-mean e-commerce concern.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; MONTGOMERY WHO? &LR; : Hugh McColl, eat your heart out; Thom Weisel is
gearing up fast.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Securities founder Weisel is nothing if not
aggressive. Thus, it should come as no surprise that the San
Francisco investment banker has wasted little time in landing a
high-profile deal for his nascent firm, Thomas Weisel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his new firm's first assignments, Weisel Partners
advised Yahoo in its blockbuster acquisition yesterday of fellow
Internet concern GeoCities. It has been only 10 days since Weisel
publicly unveiled his new firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on the strength of our own institutional relationship
that we were chosen to represent (Yahoo),'' Weisel said in an
interview. ``(Former Montgomery Internet analyst) Dave Readerman
and I were the original pitch team (for Montgomery) when Yahoo
chose to do their IPO,'' Weisel noted. Montgomery Securities was a
co-manager of Yahoo's initial offering, which was lead-managed by
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET29 (88281 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  As it turns out, Goldman usually is Yahoo's
merger-and-acquisitions adviser, but it also happened to be
GeoCities' banker on this particular deal.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflict after buyout talks began to take shape, Yahoo
called in Weisel to provide a fairness opinion and help reel in the
deal. ``We chose Thom Weisel Partners because of our long-standing
relationship, (and) we wanted to make sure we had the kind of
representation that would move quickly and with precision,'' said
Yahoo Chief Financial Officer Gary Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call at the end of last week from (Yahoo CEO) Tim
Koogle, and literally within a half hour, we were meeting in his
office,'' Weisel said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of about six Weisel Partners bankers and analysts worked
around the clock for three days to crunch numbers for Yahoo, Weisel
noted. They will be handsomely rewarded, but neither Weisel,
Goldman nor Yahoo would reveal the transaction fees for the
respective banks.
</P>
<P>
   And you can be assured that Weisel has little intention of
slowing down. The entrepreneurial banker already has about 164
employees on board and plans to have 250 by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his firm is expected to announce today or Monday
that it is underwriting a $400 million secondary stock offering for
a technology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a phenomenal start to what I think is going to
be a great year for us,'' Weisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the annual technology stock conference that
Weisel used to put Montgomery Securities on the map starts Monday.

FCC OFFERS LOW-POWER FM STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Fla., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government proposed new rules Thursday
to permit hundreds, if not thousands, of small broadcasters to run
inexpensive, low-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts and Washington officials said that the proposal
would provide new platforms for unheralded voices _ everything from
educational institutions and churches to municipalities,
independent musicians and dissident political groups that in recent
months have joined forces to petition the government for access to
the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, placed for public comment Thursday by the
Federal Communications Commission, contemplate relaxing the
regulations to enable new broadcasters to transmit in areas from
two miles to 18 miles in diameter, far smaller than the territory
reached by most commercial radio stations but roughly the same
range as many college stations.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as consolidation in broadcasting, a byproduct of the
deregulation of the telecommunications industry in 1996, has
sharply reduced the diversity available to listeners, according to
government officials. Moreover, the number of minority-owned FM
stations has dropped significantly in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of commissioners expressed support for the idea. But
the proposed opening of the FM band came under heavy criticism from
the National Association of Broadcasters, one of Washington's most
powerful lobbying groups. The organization raised concerns that the
new stations would interfere with the signals of existing stations
and also make the transition to digital radio, now underway, more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the First Amendment,'' Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for
the association, said. ``But if everyone owns a radio station, then
nobody can hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward O. Fritts, the president of the association, said that
the proposal could add as many as 4,000 low-power stations to an
already congested radio band. That, he said, would ``likely cause
devastating interference to existing broadcasters and will
challenge the FCC as guardian of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Thursday afternoon, William E. Kennard, the
FCC chairman, warned the industry not to ``use interference
concerns as a smokescreen for other matters,'' that is, a fear of
increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials at the FCC said that it was not clear how many
new stations the changes would result in, even though the agency
received 13,000 inquiries last year from individuals and groups
expressing an interest in starting such stations.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that extensive study had demonstrated that
low power signals can be broadcast in most places without
significant interference to the larger broadcasters. Still, some
officials said it remained unclear whether the proposal would
require the weakening of current rules that offer stringent
protection to existing signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot deny opportunities to those who want to use the
airwaves to speak to their communities simply because it might be
inconvenient for those who already have these opportunities,''
Kennard said in a statement with another commissioner, Gloria
Tristani.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the commission has faced incumbents raising
obstacles that might impede the development of new technology. We
saw this with the development of cable television service, low
power television, direct broadcast satellites and the digital audio
radio service. In each instance, the commission was able to
overcome these obstacles and bring new technologies to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the new rules would legalize a practice of ``pirate
broadcasting'' that has spawned a counter-culture of broadcasters
who openly defy the regulators by going on the airwaves without
licenses. It would also let others who have recently petitioned the
government for a change in the rules to seek broadcast licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The petitioners include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The city of Atlanta, which proposes to broadcast traffic and
weather reports and city counsel meetings;
</P>
<P>
   _ a church in Florida that says broadcasting on a low power
frequency will allow sermons to be heard in senior citizen
complexes by people unable to attend services;
</P>
<P>
   _ a blind man in Nashville, Tenn., who proposes to offer a
variety of programming for the vision-impaired;
</P>
<P>
   _ several Indian reservations that say they do not otherwise
have local radio programming available;
</P>
<P>
   _ high schools and colleges throughout the nation, and
</P>
<P>
   _ a group of independent musicians who now have limited access
to the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action begins the rulemaking process, which agency
officials said could conclude sometime this summer or later in the
year with new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule was approved by a vote of 4-to-1, with the
dissenting vote cast by the group's most conservative member,
Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, who said through an aide that he was
concerned about possible interference problems.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in technology have made it relatively inexpensive to
broadcast low power signals, although federal regulations now bar
such broadcasting without a license. For a few hundred dollars,
equipment is available that enables broadcasting at as low a level
as one watt, which under normal circumstances would cover an area
two miles. A 100-watt signal would cover an area of 7 miles; 1,000
watts would cover 18 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Many details remain to be worked out, including how to
distribute the limited spectrum in congested areas. The commission
is considering holding an auction for new broadcasters and
exempting non-commercial ventures like high schools and colleges
from such auctions.

EDITORIAL: ULTIMATUM ON KOSOVO  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum that NATO is due to hand both sides in the Kosovo
conflict this week could be the last chance to prevent a full-scale
war. On Friday, NATO is likely to endorse a plan to bomb Serbian
targets if the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, does not cease
hostilities in Kosovo and agree to an interim peace plan in two
weeks. If the ethnic Albanian guerrillas do not sign the plan, NATO
will impose an arms blockade. Peace still remains agonizingly
distant, but it may be closer now that the West, with some support
from Russia, has come up with the right balance of diplomacy and
force.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat of NATO bombs, Milosevic reached an agreement with
the American envoy Richard Holbrooke last October to stop the
killing of civilians, allow war crimes investigators into Kosovo,
pull back his troops and cooperate with international monitors and
humanitarian groups. He has violated all these promises.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the ethnic Albanian guerrillas rearmed and peace
negotiations went nowhere. The West's welcome new determination is
partly a response to the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians two weeks
ago, and Serbia's subsequent moves to block investigators of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they have won Russian approval for the
NATO plan's objectives, but not for the use of force. The plan
would give Kosovo autonomy, with all Serbian police and virtually
all members of the Yugoslav army ordered out. The question of
Kosovo's total independence would be put off for three years, and
could only happen if Kosovo's leaders respect democracy and human
rights. This will help protect the region's ethnic Serbian
minority.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a good one, but it would have a better chance of
acceptance by ethnic Albanians if it made Kosovo a republic within
Yugoslavia, equal to Serbia and Montenegro. They are afraid that
Milosevic could revoke autonomy within Serbia, as he has done
before. Milosevic, for his part, will not comply without heavy
pressure. NATO must be prepared to keep up a bombing campaign until
he relents, and resume it if he backs out even slightly.
</P>
<P>
   As with Bosnia, keeping the peace in Kosovo may require NATO
ground troops, an idea endorsed by France and Britain, and rightly
receiving serious consideration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ground forces should be used only if the two sides have agreed
to a cease-fire and a peace plan. With NATO determination, those
objectives may now be achieved.  &QL;

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO allies warned on Thursday that they
are fully ready to take military action to stop further violence by
both sides in Serbia's ravaged Kosovo province, and Britain and
France said they are willing to send in ground forces if needed to
reinforce a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The allies acted after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told
them on Thursday that the threat of force was essential to enable
diplomacy to bring peace to Kosovo, where Serbian security forces
and armed rebels from the province's ethnic Albanian majority have
been battling with varying degrees of intensity for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Allied governments expect an international political ultimatum
to be issued on Friday in London by foreign ministers of the United
States, Russia, Germany, Italy, Great Britain and France, urging
both the Kosovo Albanians and President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia to begin negotiations swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration's top national
security officials will meet on Friday morning to decide whether
the United States will commit troops to Kosovo after a settlement.
With the public commitment of France and Britain on Thursday, the
administration is feeling strong pressure to agree to be part of a
NATO peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its European allies have all agreed that
the two warring parties must be forced to accept a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Albanian rebels and Milosevic accept a solution
peacefully or after force is used, the Europeans are adamant that
American and European ground troops go together into Kosovo to
monitor the settlement. Administration officials say they
understand that the situation is moving quickly and hope a decision
can be reached on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No country has said exactly how many troops might be needed to
enforce an eventual agreement in Kosovo, but both European and
American diplomats said that the allies were willing to contemplate
sending tens of thousands of troops into Kosovo as peacekeepers.
Allied and associated soldiers, including Russians, have been
keeping the peace in Bosnia since the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that the six countries meeting on Friday
in London, members of the ``contact group'' coordinating
international policy in the Balkans, would give both the leaders of
Yugoslavia and the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's
independence a short deadline to negotiate ways to restore autonomy
to the southern province and stop the violence and a longer
deadline to reach a long-term political solution.
</P>
<P>
   The allies warned, ``The appropriate authorities in Belgrade and
representatives of the Kosovo Albanian leadership must agree to the
proposals to be issued by the Contact Group for completing an
interim political settlement within the time frame to be
established.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday evening, after President Jacques Chirac of France
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain had met in London,
Chirac's office in Paris issued a statement saying that France and
Britain were ``ready to consider any military action, with their
partners and in the framework of the Atlantic Alliance, including
sending ground troops required to accompany a negotiated
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said in
Bonn that talks would be held in France within a week, but French
diplomats here said the talks could take place in Vienna or in
Italy. The parties would be given two weeks, Fischer said, to agree
on a transitional solution.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said that the allies would meet again this
weekend to back up that ultimatum with a credible threat to use
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are at a very important turning point,'' the
alliance's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said after reading out
a 10 point warning he said he had also sent personally to Milosevic
and to an ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova. In 1989, when he
was the Serbian president, Milosevic rescinded autonomy in Kosovo,
which is 90 percent populated by Albanians, although it is part of
Serbia and formed the heart of the Serbs' medieval empire.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's statement was part of a complex international
choreography insisted on by France and other European allies to
give diplomacy a chance to enlist the support of Russia in putting
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their warning, the allies demanded that Milosevic live up to
promises he made last fall to withdraw Serbian special police and
military units and heavy weapons used in attacks against Albanian
villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those promises, which diplomats said had never been kept, were
made after NATO authorized wide bombing unless Yugoslavia agreed to
negotiate peace with the rebels. The Albania rebels, too, kept
fighting and thus talks never got off the ground _ despite a
framework negotiated by the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of 45 civilians in the village of Racak two weeks
ago, French diplomats said, made the allies realize they had to
make a fresh attempt to halt the violence or risk seeing more
massacres weaken their own credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, visiting NATO allies at their headquarters here on
Thursday, noted that the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia carried
some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bloody wars of the last decade have left us with no
illusions about the difficulty of halting internal conflicts _ by
reason or by force _ particularly against the wishes of the
government of a sovereign state,'' Annan said. ``Nor have they left
us with any illusions about the need to use force, when all other
means have failed. We may be reaching that limit, once again, in
the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance warned, ``NATO stands ready to act and rules out no
option to insure full respect by both sides of the demands of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana, NATO's secretary-general, said later, ``The next few
days will be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had had its way, according to some
diplomats, NATO could have issued an ultimatum of its own on
Thursday, authorizing the alliance's military commander, Gen.
Wesley K. Clark of the United States, or Solana to initiate
military action if the Serbs or the Albanians refused to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats said the French prevailed with the view that with
Russia opposed to the use of military force against fellow Orthodox
Serbs, it was better to wait until after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and other foreign ministers had met on Friday
with Russia in London.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Western European allies, diplomats said, are now
insisting on getting explicit authority for military action from
the U.N. Security Council, as France urged last year before the
United States and Britain bombed Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, however, Russian officials said on Thursday that they
opposed NATO's move to step up military preparations. They said no
NATO airstrikes should be carried out without the explicit
authorization of the Security Council, where Russia holds a veto.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said military strikes would be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   French diplomats noted that the major question is how to
exercise military pressure on both the Serbian and the Albanian
side. While NATO has had plans for attacking Serbian military
targets in Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia since last fall, it has
had more trouble coming up with ways to use force to get the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats said that NATO could impose naval blockades
around Albania, which the rebels use as a staging area, and deploy
forces along Albania's border with Kosovo to stop rebel
infiltration.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans acted unwisely Thursday by exercising their
majority power to impose an open-ended and ill-defined set of
procedures for the remainder of the impeachment trial. They are now
perilously close to turning the trial into a purely Republican
spectacle that poorly serves the nation and demeans the Senate
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial was essentially sealed on Wednesday
when 44 Democrats voted to dismiss the charges, leaving the Senate
11 votes shy of the 67 required to remove President Clinton. Since
the evidence is well known, there need be no further presentations
before the Senate hears closing arguments by the House prosecutors
and White House lawyers and votes on the two articles of
impeachment. But instead of following that sensible course, the
Senate Republicans first insisted on calling three witnesses, then
compounded the error by leaving latitude for all manner of future
digressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans rejected several legitimate concerns raised by
Tom Daschle and his fellow Democrats in the Senate in a day of
intense but ultimately unsuccessful bargaining. The Democrats
wanted to set Feb. 12 as a firm deadline for ending the trial, and
hoped to keep the witness list limited to Monica Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal, unless the White House concludes that
it needs to call other people.
</P>
<P>
   The trial record is voluminous, and needs no amplification. The
House managers offer no prospect of producing new evidence that
would nail down a constitutional case for removal. The nation long
ago reached the sound judgment that Clinton's conduct was repugnant
and that he should be rebuked but allowed to remain in office. All
that remains at this point is the finality of a Senate verdict. The
longer the Republicans stretch out the trial, the more they appear
to be indulging in a partisan exercise. &QL;

JUDGE ORDERS MICROSOFT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENT ON ITS BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge in the Microsoft antitrust case
Thursday ordered the company to turn over an internal document to
the Justice Department that government lawyers said could undermine
one of the software giant's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The government lawyers said the document supported their
contention that Microsoft's Internet browser could be identified as
a distinct product from its Windows operating system. Microsoft
officials have maintained that the browser and the operating system
cannot be separated.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states have accused Microsoft of
illegally using its monopoly in the Windows operating system to
preserve its market dominance and gain advantages in other business
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The document at issue is a spreadsheet that apparently breaks
down a key file in Windows 98 into three categories: functions only
for the browser, functions only for Windows and functions for both.
</P>
<P>
   The spreadsheet was generated as part of a test performed by
David D'Souza, a Microsoft engineer, at the behest of James E.
Allchin, a senior vice president in charge of the technical
development of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   According to e-mail records provided to the Justice Department
by Microsoft, Allchin was trying to refute the testimony of Dr.
Edward Felten, a Princeton University computer science expert who
wrote a program to remove the browser from Windows and argued that
including the browser in the operating system was ``inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said Thursday that the document would serve
to support their contention that the majority of the functions were
shared. But the company sought to withhold the spreadsheet and
retract the e-mail between Allchin and D'Souza on the grounds that
neither fell within the scope of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
original order, which compelled the company to turn over documents
related to Microsoft's testing of Felten's program.
</P>
<P>
   When D'Souza performed the test, Felten's program was not
installed on his computer, Microsoft officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail to Allchin detailing the results, D'Souza noted
that they could be used to distinguish between the code that is
shared and that which is used solely for browsing functions.
Therefore, he wrote, it ``may not be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft officials argue that how much code is actually
shared is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether a piece of software or some functionality can be
removed from a software product does not mean it was not a useful,
integrated part of the product in the first place,'' Allchin said
in his testimony this week. ``My hand can be surgically removed
from my body, but it was certainly a well-integrated part of my
body before that surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's position on the specific issue of tying the
browser to the operating system is constrained by a federal appeals
court ruling last June that Microsoft had the right to bundle its
browser with Windows. So the tussle over the spreadsheet is more
about tarnishing Microsoft's credibility than proving the browser
can be separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something Microsoft said it couldn't do,'' said David
Boies, the Justice Department's lead attorney. ``And it turns out
they have done it. It underscores the point we've been making that
Microsoft had no plausible reason to weld the whole Internet
Explorer into the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies is expected to ask Allchin about the spreadsheet on
Monday, when the executive takes the stand for cross-examination.

NFL'S SILENT MAJORITY AFRAID TO FORCE CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As the National Football League prepares for its final
championship game of the 1900s, the league celebrates a boom that
has transformed pro football from a game played on muddy fields
before sparse crowds into the national signature. As it prepares
for the next millennium, the NFL is entangled by the same nagging
issue that has plagued the nation for the last 100 years: race,
racism and an African-American presence in a white power structure.
</P>
<P>
   Today the NFL offers a striking example of uncontested merit.
While ownership has remained overwhelmingly white, 72 percent of
the NFL's players are African-American. Black athletes have played
a significant role in making the league a billion-dollar enterprise
and the Super Bowl the highest-rated televised sporting event of
the year, a billion-dollar bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Among an increasing number of black players, however, there is
growing resentment and anger over a granite ceiling that has
effectively prevented the NFL's black presence on the field from
becoming equally pronounced in head coaching and front-office
positions. The NFL has come under increased criticism over the
haphazard manner in which teams select head coaches and
front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
   How can someone with impeccable credentials be passed over in
favor of a candidate with a questionable track record but strong
front-office ties? African-Americans have been the most prominent
casualties of a process that often combines the most exclusionary
elements of the old boy network, a plantation and the country club.
</P>
<P>
   But while the debate over hiring black head coaches escalates,
the league's black players have remained the silent majority. In an
industry without guaranteed contracts, where one misspoken word can
result in removal without explanation, players think long and hard
before saying something management may construe as impudent.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan, the Falcons' highly regarded cornerback, showed up
at Super Bowl media day wearing a dog collar, signifying Atlanta's
status as an underdog. Buchanan quickly became a favorite of the
news media and predicted a Falcons victory.
</P>
<P>
   One evening I reached Buchanan in his hotel, and when the
subject about the absence of black head coaches came up, the
outspoken Buchanan was not so quotable. ``I don't want to talk
about that now,'' he said. ``It's too controversial. I don't need
that right now. Talk after the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears a spiked dog collar to media day, predicts an Atlanta
victory and yet says discussing blacks and coaching is too
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Art Shell, the Falcons' offensive line coach and a former head
coach of the Raiders, said high-profile players like Buchanan must
help raise the issue or there will be no progress. ``The voice that
has to be heard in the NFL is the voice of the players,'' Shell
said Thursday. ``The players have to stand up and let it be known
that they are dissatisfied with what is going on. Until they start
getting involved in this thing, things just might remain the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mobley, a Broncos starting linebacker, said the silence is
a combination of apathy, selfishness and intimidation. ``No one
wants to stir up something that really isn't affecting them
directly,'' he said. ``It's a shame, but at the same time, what can
you do about it if you don't have the forces behind you?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what might happen if he called a meeting to discuss the
subject and invited Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe, the team's
high-profile stars, Mobley said: ``They probably wouldn't even want
to sit down and discuss it if they knew what the topic was about.
They'd think it was really something silly. It probably wouldn't
even get touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Crockett, the Broncos' all-Pro defensive back, said there
were two issues _ the problem of African-Americans becoming head
coaches and black athletes bringing the issue before the public.
``A lot of the players don't want to upset the coaches _ or the
owners _ because they are playing for them,'' Crockett said. ``And
there's not enough representation of black coaches to defend them.
If we put ourselves out there, our names on the line, and there's
still a bunch of white coaches out there, of course you're
intimidated. Our job is to get paid first. It's like you work at
IBM, you can't go up and talk about the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will say that if you're good enough to play this game,
why can't we be good enough to coach it?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Williams, a Denver defensive lineman with eight years of
NFL experience, explained that the NFL's black majority is
neutralized and held hostage. ``Privately, we talk about it a
little; it's never something we've met as a group about,'' Williams
said. ``In this league you can't just speak your mind and feel like
it's going to go unnoticed. We play in a league with no guaranteed
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly about controversial issues is one thing, doing
something about it is another. Davis, the Broncos' all-Pro running
back, said he was aware of the situation but was not sure about a
solution. ``Obviously, you can look around and see not that many
head coaches, not that many offensive coordinators,'' he said. ``Is
it because people haven't applied, or is it because people just
didn't hire them? I don't know. So what should I do _ in the
interview room say `where are the black coaches?' without having
any earthly idea about what I'm talking about, just because I don't
see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Bennett, a Falcons linebacker, sees it. But ``we can't
do anything about it as players,'' he said. ``We try to keep our
comments to a minimum because _ not that we're scared _ there's
nothing we can do. We can't go to them and demand _ they're going
to do what they have to do. You pay $300 million for a team; that
pretty much gives you the right to do whatever you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why players haven't been more vocal, Bob Whitfield, a
Falcons offensive lineman, said: ``You're the first one to ask me.
I've never seen the process and how it worked out. But I definitely
think there's something wrong when you have all these black players
and none of them moves up to the ranks of head coach. I'm thinking,
`What's the qualification for becoming a coach?''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The racial issue leads to the more fundamental problem of
devising performance standards for what it takes to become a head
coach in the NFL
</P>
<P>
   The anger and resentment directed at the league's owners are the
imbalances in a system that painstakingly selects the best athletes
while too often randomly hires coaches with questionable
credentials. The NFL's challenge in the future will be to construct
a new system that selects thoroughbred coaches as efficiently as it
selects thoroughbred athletes. The competitive balance is at an
all-time high: the distance between great teams, good teams and
poor teams is razor thin.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between great players and good players is
marginal. The most glaring gap too often involves the head coaches
whom owners hire to drive their Ferraris. Some are too
inexperienced to drive, some are too old to drive. Some simply
don't know how to drive a car with 72 percent super octane.
</P>
<P>
   Without a better system, the NFL is creating an environment in
which every white coach who is hired is seen as a crony, or an
overseer to be field boss of the black majority. Every black hiring
is an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between fair play and equality lies objective
standards. Find the best person and let's get on with it.

GIULIANI SETS STAGE FOR CLASH WITH PATAKI AS HE OFFERS BUDGET PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped up his criticism of
Gov. George Pataki's spending practices Thursday as he proposed a
$35.4 billion budget for New York City, setting the stage for a
battle over school aid that could complicate the mayor's political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Giuliani's spending plan was a proposal to
build new schools using $2.5 billion of the city's anticipated
share of the settlement with the tobacco industry. The city is to
receive $6.7 billion from the settlement, in installments over two
decades. Giuliani said the city would borrow the money to build the
schools over the next three years, then pay off the debt with its
annual payments from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also proposed using hundreds of millions of dollars to
expand art and reading programs, put computers in every middle
school and start an experimental tuition voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Pataki, a fellow Republican, of providing
insufficient state aid for such initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was angered last week when the governor ordered a
state investigation into the city's school construction practices.
And Giuliani used the opportunity of his budget address to amplify
a complaint that he has raised daily since Pataki announced the
investigation: that Albany repeatedly sends New York City less
school aid than it is entitled to get.
</P>
<P>
   The city has about 37 percent of the state's schoolchildren,
according to the mayor, yet it receives about 34 percent of total
state aid to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the budget that the governor released,'' Giuliani said,
``that disparity would grow _ particularly with new dollars _ very,
very substantially. That doesn't make much sense if you're really
interested in children being educated more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   As with previous budget plans, the mayor was generally
conservative in his proposals for new spending Thursday despite a
strong local economy that enabled the city to build a $1.6 billion
surplus this fiscal year. He wants to use the surplus to reduce
budget shortfalls, which are expected to increase in the coming
years because of tax cuts and labor settlements already approved.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called for $591 million in program cuts, including $37
million from the budget for public libraries, $23 million from
museums and other cultural organizations, and $19 million from
youth programs. Among the affected youth programs is an
after-school program that the city started last year with help from
financier George Soros. The mayor recommended cutting all city
funds for that program, a move that City Council officials vowed to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also proposed $338 million in new tax cuts, including
$51 million from eliminating the sales tax on all clothing and
footwear, which would require approval from Albany, and $166
million from extending a tax relief program for owners of co-ops
and condominiums. He also called for setting aside $100 million for
future tax cuts while a newly formed commission comes up with
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said during his address that the city had every reason
to be optimistic about his proposals, which he said held spending
below the rate of inflation. ``We are proposing a budget next year
that in essence, in terms of city funds, will be a no-growth
budget,'' Giuliani said. ``New York City is now setting the way for
fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the mayor boasted that his spending plan was smaller
than the previous one, independent budget monitors said it was
actually 2 to 3 percent larger. The city is not projecting a
spending increase because under its own accounting rules, and the
surplus is counted as being spent in the current fiscal year, even
though the mayor is using it to cover next year's anticipated
shortfall.

CLINTON WANTS TO SPEND $1 BILLION MORE ON JOB TRAINING, ADULT
EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKTON, Va. _ To rare Republican praise, President Clinton on
Thursday proposed to narrow what he called a ``skills gap'' by
spending nearly $1 billion more next year on job training and adult
education, as well as programs to cut dropout rates and to prepare
poor children for college.
</P>
<P>
   The increased spending, which appeals not only to Republican
congressmen but also to core Democratic constituencies, is in the
budget Clinton plans to present Monday. He did not describe where
the money would come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to create a situation in America where people can keep
on learning for a lifetime, without regard to where they live, what
their job is, what their income is,'' Clinton said after touring a
job training center here for workers at AT&AMP;T and Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spending proposals were immediately hailed by Rep.
Bill Goodling, R-Pa., who is chairman of the House Committee on
Education and the Work Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will spar on a variety of education issues this year, but
not these,'' Goodling said in a statement. ``What the president is
talking about today should enjoy broad bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the White House and the Republican-led Congress
consolidated a raft of overlapping and sometimes outdated federal
job training programs, arriving at what both sides regarded as a
much-improved approach that would better match training to
employers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the results, Goodling and other Republicans are
now as willing as the president to invest more money in training.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance here was one in a series to promote his
initiatives in advance of his budget presentation on Monday.
Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced administration plans to
spend more than $100 million helping children's hospitals and
fighting childhood asthma.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a speech before an annual gathering of mayors in
Washington, Clinton plans to announce that he will ask Congress to
approve a $2.5 billion increase, to $28 billion, in the budget of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Of the increase, the largest chunk _ $580 million _ would go to
pay for 100,000 vouchers for housing for the poorest renters,
including homeless people, according to administration officials.
In addition, Clinton hopes to spend $50 million on an initiative to
provide grants for the demolition of abandoned buildings to make
room for businesses or homes.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Thursday, Clinton repeatedly warned of a widening
``skills gap,'' a phrase from his State of the Union message last
week. His grandfather, Clinton said, had a grade-school education,
while his stepfather did not finish high school. ``They all did
just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he continued, ``high school graduates are likely to get
jobs where their incomes drop over time,'' rather than increase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has set a five-year goal of expanding federal services
for job training and searching until they are available for all
Americans who become unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   As a step toward that goal, he is seeking an increase in such
spending next year of $368 million, to $2.6 billion. Under the
system established last year, much of that money is made available
to workers in what Clinton calls a ``skills grant,'' which they can
then use to pay for the training they think they need.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced Thursday that he wanted to spend an
additional $405 million next year, or a total of $2.7 billion, on a
basket of programs intended to help low-income children. Most of
the money would go to existing programs, like one to find jobs for
young people, but the president is also proposing to spend $100
million on a plan to encourage schools to work with businesses and
other organizations to cut dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   The third component of Thursday's proposal is an increase of
$190 million, to $563 million, in spending on adult literacy
programs, including grants to pay for more teachers and computers
in adult education centers. In announcing the program, Clinton
played on a previous speaker's joke that striking oil was a key to
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil today is in your noggin, not in the ground,'' he said.
``And everybody can strike oil today. But they have to have the
means to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling, a proponent of literacy programs, said that Clinton
tended to design his adult literacy efforts too narrowly, rather
than taking into account an entire family's needs. ``Illiteracy in
almost all cases is a family issue, where both adults and their
children can't read,'' he said. ``Federal literacy programs must be
linked so that they work together to serve the entire family.''

VANDALS ROB SUPERMARKETS, COLOMBIA QUAKE VICTIM'S HOMES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Bracing himself for the loss of 40 years of
hard work, Jose Mejia watched from behind a chain-link fence on
Thursday as a frenzied crowd broke down the door of his grocery
store in this earthquake-damaged city.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, army troops poured into the street and secured the
supermarket. But the would-be vandals, who carried burlap bags,
refused to immediately budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one gives us anything, we'll just have to break in,''
said one young man in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   To Mejia and other business owners here and in nearby cities, a
bitter aftershock to the killer earthquake that rocked western
Colombia on Monday has come in the form of looting. Cold, hungry
and still grieving from their losses, earthquake victims are
growing increasingly angry at delays in the delivery of emergency
aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they began breaking into Armenia's supermarkets _
many of which were closed because of damage suffered in the quake _
and carting off cooking oil, rice, bananas and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looters, authorities said Thursday, were delinquents
and gang members from other regions who descended on Armenia, the
city hardest hit by the temblor, to take advantage of the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Red Cross, the magnitude-6.0 quake killed 881
people in the region around Armenia, injured about 3,500 and left
about 200,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Besides grocery stories, looters targeted banks, instant-cash
machines, designer-clothing outlets, compact disk stores, jewelry
shops and even lingerie boutiques. One looter was so eager to turn
a quick profit that he offered a cut-rate price on a package of
Huggies diapers to reporters covering the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations reported that con artists posing as building
inspectors ordered residents out of their quake-damaged buildings,
then made off with television sets, stereos and silverware.
Following shootouts with police, 10 people were treated for bullet
wounds at an Armenia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a disgrace,'' said National Police Chief Rosso
Jose Serrano. ``I can't understand how people can take advantage of
such pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana on Thursday banned
out-of-town vehicles from entering Armenia, a city of 250,000, and
sent in about 4,000 police officers and army troops to patrol the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the reinforcements had no place to put arrested looters,
because the city jail had collapsed in the earthquake. Authorities
took pictures of suspects, issued stern warnings and then let them
go. Looters outnumbered police, and the break-ins continued.
</P>
<P>
   At the Armenia Grain Market on Thursday, angry crowds knocked
down warehouse doors and began carting off bags of rice until riot
police lobbed tear gas canisters at them.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Andres Serna inspected the ransacked supermarket owned
by his mother. The food, the paper products, even the cash
registers were gone. All that was left were a few bags of plastic
cups and packets of margarine melting on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have taken the walls if they could have,'' Serna
said. ``This is even worse than the earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people tried to justify the stealing.
</P>
<P>
   The sacking of one supermarket, for example, began after people
complained of price gouging. A package of rice, which normally
sells for 50 cents, was marked up to $2.50, said Licceth Almonacid,
as she kneeled on a sidewalk scooping up pills left behind by
someone who had looted a drug store.
</P>
<P>
   Like other earthquake victims, Almonacid said she has not yet
received any government help _ except for three buckets of water.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, whose supermarket has been closed since the quake, got
into a shouting match with one tearful woman who claimed that he
should open his business or give away his merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would just give us something, then the people would
leave peacefully,'' said Sandra Patricia Gomez. ``You people have
no conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mejia and others business owners argued that thieves were
piggybacking on the discontent of hungry earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat tennis shoes,'' said Paula Londono, as she
surveyed a looted shoe store.
</P>
<P>
   President Pastrana toured Armenia on Thursday and promised that
help is on the way. He decreed an economic emergency to facilitate
budget appropriations for the disaster zone and announced that
price gougers would be ``severely punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge lines formed at the Red Cross distribution center, where
volunteers handed out foam mattresses, blankets, clothes and bags
of food.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looting victimized earthquake victims themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Perez Salazar, a nightwatchman at a bank, got into a
shootout Thursday morning with 40 gang members. He finally dove for
cover under a city bus, and the thieves stormed into the building
and hauled away everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I could,'' said a sobbing Salazar, adding that his
apartment collapsed in the earthquake three days earlier. ``This
has been a bad week.''

STUDY BLAMES BANKS FOR NOT OVERSEEING TROUBLED HEDGE FUND 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A handful of the world's largest commercial and
investment banks failed to adequately oversee lending and trading
activities with hedge-fund giant Long-Term Capital Management, a
regulatory study has found.
</P>
<P>
   William McDonough, the president of the New York Federal
Reserve, oversaw the study and said that the banks had been blinded
by what he called the ``magic'' of the once high-flying firm's
vaunted reputation, a situation he suggested could recur if banks
do not tighten their monitoring of such funds.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough's comments accompanied the release Thursday of a
lengthy international review on the near-collapse of Long-Term
Capital in September, which McDonough said would have posed a
threat to the stability of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailed many lapses in judgment by banks in their
dealings with Long-Term Capital and similar hedge funds, but it
noted that such funds are still very difficult to regulate and that
the most effective way of preventing potential disasters is for
lenders to be far more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that banks had become better attuned to the
dangers posed by lax supervision of their dealings with hedge funds
since the Long-Term Capital debacle.
</P>
<P>
   But denizens of Wall Street, even the very largest and
brightest, never have been known to possess good memories, a fact
McDonough was quick to note again Thursday. ``Financial
institutions can learn lessons well, but the question is how long
they continue to remember them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan; Citigroup; J.P. Morgan; Merrill Lynch; Morgan
Stanley; Goldman, Sachs; Bear, Stearns and Lehman Brothers were the
nation's financial services firms with the closest lending or
trading relationships with Long-Term Capital. Foreign firms close
to the hedge fund included UBS, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and
Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are largely unregulated, private investment pools
typically open to wealthy individuals and large institutional
investors. The most free-wheeling hedge funds borrow huge sums of
money to make complex trades in stocks, bonds, currencies and more
exotic financial products known as derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report was issued under the auspices of the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision, which consists of senior
representatives of the world's leading central banks. McDonough is
the committee's current chairman. The report was compiled with the
help of other American banking regulators, including the
comptroller of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the problem arose because banks failed to review
Long-Term Capital's borrowing and trading enough or because the
hedge fund failed to disclose sufficient information when queried
by lenders, McDonough said ``some of both.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive pressure kept banks from asking basic
questions and getting fundamental information in some cases,'' said
Michael L. Brosnan, head of risk evaluation for the comptroller's
office. ``That should never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also noted that commercial and investment banks
relied too much on the day-to-day value of Long-Term Capital's
assets when deciding if they had enough collateral to cover any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In extremely volatile financial markets, such as the panic that
followed Russia's decision in August to devalue its currency and
declare a debt moratorium, the value of assets, and thus
collateral, can plunge. Because of that, banks had less secure
collateral at Long-Term Capital than they believed. The report said
that banks need to ``stress test'' their exposure to hedge funds
more regularly, taking into account the likelihood of financial
meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The report said more stringent public regulation of hedge funds
may be required, but it noted the challenges of carrying out such a
task in a world of computerized, nearly borderless financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Because most hedge funds ``are registered in offshore centers,
any direct regulation would therefore have to extend to those
jurisdictions in order to be effective,'' the report said. ``Such
an extension would require a high level of political initiative and
would involve consideration by political, legislative and judiciary
bodies.''

STOCK MUTUAL FUND DEPOSITS REMAINED LIGHT LAST MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Mass.)   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. APPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors remained relatively unimpressed last month
with the stock market's sharp rebound, pouring just $3.4 billion
into stock funds in December even as the market continued a steady
climb back from its late-summer sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials say that January _ traditionally a strong
time for mutual fund sales _ is shaping up much better.
</P>
<P>
   Capital-gains distributions typically keep many investors from
buying stock funds at the end of the year, but last month was still
the weakest December for net sales of stock funds since 1990,
according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   It capped a particularly slow five-month period that began in
August, when the market was tumbling, that saw new net investments
in United States stock funds of just $13.3 billion, compared with
$145.5 billion during the first seven months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock market's rebound is making for a good January,
with strong flows of money to index funds and other funds that
invest in large-capitalization stocks, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flows have been markedly directed toward large-cap equity
index funds and large-cap growth funds,'' said Robert Adler,
president of AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif., that
tracks trends in mutual fund sales. ``It appears more people are
jumping on that bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Group, the index fund leader, estimates it will have
record net sales of $4.5 billion for its stock funds this month,
beating the previous high of $4.2 billion that was set last April,
with most of the new money put into index funds.
</P>
<P>
   January fund sales often taper off toward the end of the month,
but this time they have not, ``which suggests February should look
very good as well,'' Brian Mattes, a spokesman for Vanguard, based
in Valley Forge, Pa., said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong recent performances by the big funds at Fidelity
Investments, a unit of the FMR Corp., helped the No. 1 fund company
post strong net stock-fund sales this month; $2 billion flowed into
Fidelity equity mutual funds through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, net stock-fund sales at Fidelity, which is based
in Boston, were flat in December and about $1.3 billion in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Trimtabs.com Investment Research, a company in Santa Rosa,
Calif., that tracks mutual fund sales, estimates that net
stock-fund sales will be about $16.2 billion for all of January,
the strongest month since July and slightly more than the $14.7
billion in net sales reported by the Investment Company Institute
last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the public is regaining confidence in the
market,'' said Carl Wittnebert, the director of research at
Trimtabs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Charles Schwab Corp., which held $143 billion in mutual
fund assets at the end of the year, investors have made $1.3
billion in new net investments in stock mutual funds this month
through Tuesday, including about $460 million in index funds. The
flows are ``a little bit higher than last January,'' said Greg
Gable, a spokesman for Schwab, based in San Francisco. ``January is
often a reflection of pent-up demand, with people waiting out their
investments in December, when capital gains are being
distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, the Investment Company Institute reported that
stock mutual funds had net sales of $158.8 billion, down from the
record $227.1 billion set in 1997 and the lowest annual total since
1995. Stock funds now account for $2.98 trillion of the $5.53
trillion in mutual fund assets, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, bond-fund sales soared last year. Taxable-bond
mutual funds, which registered $2.4 billion in net sales in
December, took in $59.2 billion for the full year, raising total
taxable-bond-fund assets to $532 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal-bond mutual funds, which saw $1.2 billion in net sales
last month, posted $15.2 billion in net sales for the full year,
bringing total assets to $298.6 billion.

KEY TO VICTORY: KEEP OFFENSE ON THE FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It remains a piercing thought for Cornelius Bennett, now
an Atlanta Falcon, once a Buffalo Bill. Actually, any choice among
his Super Bowl memories is painful. Bennett and the Bills lost four
straight Super Bowls in this decade, but we are talking about the
first one. Super Bowl XXV, January 1991. Giants 20, Bills 19. The
last-second 47-yard field-goal attempt by the Bills that missed
wide right into a dark Tampa, Fla., night eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that attempt, the Bills had watched the Giants
offense control the ball so well that the Giants would emerge with
40 minutes 33 seconds of possession time. That left Buffalo's
offense holding the ball for 19:27. A gigantic difference. And yet,
the Bills were so good that they still lost by only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these teams have the kind of offense, and especially
the kind of running backs, to keep the ball in this game,'' Bennett
said of the Denver-Atlanta matchup in Super Bowl XXXIII here on
Sunday. ``I don't think its going to happen because the defenses
here are very good. But, man, whatever you can do to keep it like
the Giants did in that game almost makes it certain you win. I
remember a play where Mark Ingram broke five or six tackles against
us that helped turn the game around. That's crazy. But that's what
happens when your defense is tired. We're human beings. Every
defense wants to stay as fresh as it can to perform at its highest
level. But when you're on the field all of the time on defense, the
mind says yes but the body says no.''
</P>
<P>
   So, which team is best suited to grab the football and keep it
in Super Bowl XXXIII?
</P>
<P>
   Solid field position, turnovers and the running game are factors
that help an offense establish possession time.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD POSITION: At what part of the field a team runs its
offense often dictates whether its entire package of plays is a
threat. At its own 5, it is often limited to a short run or pass.
At midfield, however, a defense can seldom overload expecting short
stuff. Thus, field position greatly affects play-calling and
whether a team can play ball control.
</P>
<P>
   Solid field position comes primarily via special teams, big
plays and turnovers. Denver's average drive start is at its 33. Tim
Dwight has averaged nearly that for the Falcons with his 27-yard
kickoff return average.
</P>
<P>
   Big pass plays also help. The average yards per pass attempt
including yardage lost to sacks is the strongest indicator of a
team's passing efficiency. It speaks of its big-strike capability.
Big strikes dramatically change field position. Here the Falcons
(7.99 yard average) edge the Broncos (7.38 yard average).
</P>
<P>
   TURNOVERS: Atlanta gains the edge in comparison with Denver in
turnover production. It has forced 44 turnovers, 14 more than
Denver; thus, Atlanta's total of 44 is first in the league while
Denver ranks 13th. That plus-14 differential for Atlanta derives
solely from an edge in fumble recoveries (Atlanta has 25, Denver
11). The Falcons on their tackles often look first to force the
ball free more than to make the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Both Atlanta and Denver excel at making a big return once they
have gained a fumble or an interception. This forcibly increases
field position. For both teams, it is not enough to recover a
fumble or gain an interception and simply fall on the ground. Both
understand the big dividends of the return. And though Atlanta has
more turnovers than Denver, Denver is better at returning its
thefts for more yards. Atlanta. on its 44 turnovers, gained 347
yards on fumble and interception returns. But Denver, on its 30
turnovers, gained 438 yards.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING GAME: Running the football effectively is the best way
to control the clock. It tires a defense. It keeps the game
physical. An offensive line feels like it is dictating the action
when it can run effectively. Denver this season has run the ball 34
more times than it has passed it. But Atlanta has run it 92 more
times than it has passed it.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Brooks, the Atlanta defensive coordinator, said that he
looks at teams' average yards per rush attempt to learn ``just how
serious is its commitment the run or if the run is just window
dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta averages 4.1 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver averages 4.7 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and Denver are close in nearly every area of field
position, turnovers and the running game. Both simply flip-flop in
taking the lead among the categories.
</P>
<P>
   Which team is best suited to possess the ball the longest in
Super Bowl XXXIII?
</P>
<P>
   How about the team that led in possession time this season.
Atlanta led the entire league in possession time with an average of
33 minutes 10 seconds per game. But Denver ranked fifth at 32:08.
</P>
<P>
   Another close call.

GOP MEASURE COULD PERMIT SHOWING OF LEWINSKY DEPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fractured Senate abruptly abandoned any
bipartisan approach to President Clinton's impeachment trial
Thursday night as the Republican majority pushed through rules that
could permit Clinton's accusers to show Monica S. Lewinsky's
videotaped deposition on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling the solemn proceedings to the brink of partisan
acrimony, the GOP plan, approved on a strict party-line vote,
54-44, creates a blueprint for the remainder of the trial that
could extend the proceedings beyond a projected end date of Feb.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Over objections from the White House and Senate Democrats, the
Republican road map also could permit the Senate to conclude the
trial with a finding that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed
justice, without removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic alternative, which would have prohibited videotaped
depositions mandated the trial's completion by Feb. 12 and barred a
separate finding of Clinton's guilt, was defeated, also along party
lines, 54-44.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic motion to call for immediate votes on the two
articles of impeachment also failed, 55-43, with only one senator
breaking party ranks: Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators were absent for each vote: Wayne Allard, a Colorodo
Republican, who was home with his ailing father, and Barbara A.
Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, who was suffering from an inflamed
gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
   The developments, which followed a failed attempt to strike a
bipartisan agreement to continue the trial, immediately triggered a
political melee, as Democrats accused the GOP majority of
jeopardizing Senate decorum and flouting public opposition to
prolonging the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good ship GOP has hit an iceberg and it's sinking,'' said
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who proposed the motion to vote on the
impeachment articles. ``Each day we continue this trial is really
an impeachment of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said Democrats were
``overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ranting and raving and questioning any of their
motives or blasting them for this and that,'' Lott said, although
he did suggest that the Democrats had blocked a bipartisan
agreement by making too many demands on how to conduct the
remainder of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would nitpick a gnat to death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, the House Republicans who are managing the
impeachment case will take videotaped depositions next week from
Lewinsky and two of Clinton's allies: his friend, Vernon E. Jordan
Jr., and senior adviser, Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Lewinsky's deposition is scheduled for Monday. On
Tuesday and Wednesday, Jordan and Blumenthal would give
depositions. One senator from each party will preside over the
depositions, as the witnesses are questioned by House managers and
White House lawyers, who will split the time equally.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they want to videotape the depositions
so they could show them on the Senate floor if they are blocked
from summoning the witnesses to testify in person, as several GOP
senators said they could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fair amount of sentiment against having Miss
Lewinsky testify as a live witness,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Although Specter said he would not oppose Lewinsky testifying
before the Senate, he said a substantial bloc of GOP senators ``are
saying that she ought not be on the same floor where Daniel Webster
and John Kennedy were.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with trying to conceal his sexual affair in
the White House with Lewinsky, who was a 22-year-old intern when
the relationship began in 1995. If he is convicted of the charges,
he would be the first president to be removed from office after an
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Senate Democrats, arguing that no witnesses
are needed to resolve the case, fought to block the videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the spectacle of Monica Lewinsky or anyone else
brought into the forum that is anticipated in this resolution,''
said the Senate Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle. ``What little
dignity that Monica Lewinsky has left, we hope we can protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said Democrats were trying to deprive the
House managers of presenting a thorough case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want the depositions to begin with,'' said Senator
Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. ``Then they wanted the depositions closed.
Then they wanted them only in transcript form. Then they didn't
want the videotapes shown on the floor . . . Gee whiz, it seems to
me something that important ought to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, the House managers have an 18-hour deadline
before each deposition to provide Clinton's lawyers copies of all
the material that they will enter into the record during the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts will be made of the depositions, as well as
videotape recordings. But the material will remain confidential
unless the Senate votes to make it public.
</P>
<P>
   In some measure, Senate Democrats succeeded in blocking an
effort by the House managers to leave open the possibility of
calling additional witnesses, such as the so-called Jane Does who
have made claims about Clinton. The final agreement permits the
House managers to call additional witnesses only if Lott and
Daschle agree.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the managers will not be permitted to question the
witnesses about any women who have made claims about Clinton except
Lewinsky and Paula Corbin Jones, who sued the president for sexual
harassment and settled the case last year for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be recessed until Thursday, when the Senate is
expected to take up a motion by the House managers to permit the
witnesses to testify in person. The videotaped depositions will be
made available to senators to view privately Tuesday and Wednesday,
as they prepare to vote on the witness motion and any objections
that might arise in the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who lashed out at Senate Republicans a
day earlier for refusing to yield in the negotiations, said
Thursday night: ``We believe this could be over with now. We
believe it could be over immediately after the depositions, and
they wanted to leave the window open for other possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the spirit of bipartisanship evaporated today, and
that this has become a Republican impeachment trial,'' said James
Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office. ``The plan
that was adopted is vague and it has no certain end. It appears to
contain trap doors that could significantly extend this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans countered the attack. ``This is not a deep,
dark plot on the part of Republicans to slip anything over,'' said
Senator Robert Bennett of Utah. ``It is not part of a preordained
railroad job in any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   After the House managers complete the witness phase of their
presentation, Clinton's lawyers will have 24 hours to ask for
permission to call their own witnesses and to make any motions
dealing with testimony or evidence presented by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan calls for a final vote on the articles of
impeachment by noon on Feb. 12, unless the Senate approves motions
that could prolong the process. The Democratic plan would have set
Feb. 12 as an unequivocal deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the trial ends, the House managers and White House
lawyers each will have three hours for closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Looming as a potential flashpoint is the possibility that
Republicans will move near the end of the trial for a separate vote
on whether Clinton committed the perjury and obstruction charges.
The vote would be intended to cite Clinton for wrongdoing without
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   James Kennedy, the White House spokesman, described the proposal
as ``a political tool to try to damage the president in some kind
of end-run around the constitutional process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Democrats were ``overly nervous and jumping to
conclusions'' that the proposal will be made.

   WASHINGTON _ Closing ranks along party lines, Senate Republicans
forced through a plan Thursday night for the remainder of President
Clinton's impeachment trial that opens the door for Monica
Lewinsky, or her videotaped image, to appear before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The trial blueprint also keeps alive the possibility that the
Senate could vote on a ``finding of facts,'' stating that the
president committed perjury and obstructed justice and then take a
separate vote on whether to convict him and remove him from office.
Democrats have called the idea unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was pushed through the Senate as part of a rapid
and unexpected series of showdown partisan votes that came after
two days of behind-the scenes negotiations, offers and
counteroffers failed to produce a bipartisan plan on how to depose
Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal and wrap up the
trial by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions are to begin next week, and individual senators
would be able to review the material, including the videotapes,
privately. The Senate then would have to vote on whether to admit
the depositions, either transcribed or on videotape, into the
public record. That vote could allow for the videotapes to be
played in public in the Senate chamber at a later point in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats offered their own proposals Thursday night. A
Democratic move to end the trial and go directly to a vote on the
two articles of impeachment, was rejected 55-43, with a single
Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, opposing the effort
to halt the trial. And an alternative Democratic proposal for the
trial, which would have barred display in the Senate of videotaped
testimony, was also defeated, 54-44.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan was then approved, also by a vote of 54-44.
Two senators were absent: Wayne Allard, R-Colo., who flew home
because his father was seriously ill, and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
who is scheduled for gallbladder surgery on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans set Feb. 12 as a target date to
complete the trial, the White House complained bitterly. ``This
resolution is written in a way that leaves the doors wide open to
extend this trial for an indefinite future and on any issues the
majority chooses, '' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary. ``The Republican majority had a chance today to test the
case the House managers and independent counsel had made and vote
up or down on the articles, and once again they chose to extent the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Threatening that the White House itself would now delay the
process, he said the president's lawyers would prepare for a
vigorous defense, including the possibility of extensive discovery
and defense witnesses. He said the White House would make no
concessions to accelerate the trial and reach a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, insisted,
however, that there was now the ``likelihood'' that the trial could
be finished on Feb. 12 unless ``various and sundry motions
intervene.'' He said, ``That's our goal, and we have set in motion
a process that very likely would get us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said that the depositions of the three witnesses approved
by the Senate would begin on Monday with Ms. Lewinsky. Blumenthal,
a White House communications aide, and Jordan, an outside adviser
to Clinton, are to be questioned over the two following days.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial will reconvene on Thursday, when it can
take up a motion to receive the videotaped depositions in evidence.
While the Senate can still hear a motion for more witnesses or
evidence to be heard before the Senate, Democrats won the
concession that such a motion can only be made by Lott and Daschle
jointly. That in effect gives the Democrats veto power over any
push by House prosecutors for another round of witnesses. THe White
House is then granted up to 24 hours to decide whether it wants to
propose new evidence or witnesses for a Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The plan sets Feb. 12 at noon as the target for a final vote on
the articles of impeachment but leaves open the possibility that
the schedule could slip if witnesses are called.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate acted Thursday night only after it had convened and
recessed twice as Republicans and Democrats huddled in party
caucuses and Lott and Daschle handed proposals back and forth.
``We're making progress,'' Lott said at midday. He said the
disputes had narrowed to two or three points which he described
as``very esoteric, legalistic sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats called the areas of contention quite serious and
said they were determined to try to block the videotaped
depositions from public view and close off the possibility of
witnesses appearing in the Senate chamber. They were particularly
concerned about Ms. Lewinsky, whose testimony, with investigators
or before the grand jury, recounting the story of her affair with
the president, has never been seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about salacious material, material that has no
place on the Senate floor,'' Daschle said. ``We don't need to have
Monica Lewinsky or anyone else talking in the well of the Senate
about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said the votes of 44 Senate
Democrats in favor of ending the trial indicated that Clinton would
not be convicted. ``So it isn't a question of whether removal or
conviction is on the table any longer, it's whether we're going to
engage in the spectacle of moving this into the public domain and
trying to move public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the Democrats were trying to
pre-emptively block the Senate from making Ms. Lewinsky or her
videotaped image public, without even knowing whether she would say
anything that would add to the trial or should be aired. Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, called the stance ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``Videotaping is an additional tool in this modern
era that senators can use to review what the witnesses have to say.
We don't say that it will be used on the floor. We don't prejudge
that. We say that it would be up to the Senate to decide. The
Democrats don't want that to happen, and I don't understand their
alarm about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major point of division was over whether to bar the
Senate from considering ``findings of fact'' that Clinton had
committed perjury and obstruction of justice, separate from the
final vote on whether to convict him and remove him from office.
The findings could be approved by 51 senators and would not require
the 67 votes needed to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican left this possibility open while the Democrats
wanted to block it. ``We strongly believe that this notion,''
Daschle said, ``is just not one that may even be constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House spoke out even more strongly against it. ``It
would establish a terrible precdent for the future,'' said James E.
Kennedy, a White House spokesman, ``making it easier for future
congresses to contemplate punishing a president when they disagree
with him or her. In addition it's really a political vehicle to
exact as much punishment of the president without having to meet
the two-thirds requirement for conviction and removal set forth in
the Constitution.''

 WASHINGTON: the Constitution.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republicans did make one significant concession to the
Democrats, however. House prosecutors have tried to retain the
option of introducing new evidence or calling for a second round of
witnesses later in the trial. In negotiations Democrats have tried
to foreclose such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan leaves it up to Lott and Daschle to decide
jointly on whether to allow such a request by the House. That in
essence grants Daschle a veto. Lott said he thought that the
Democrats would not abuse this power and that if the depositions
produced some startling reason for new evidence or witnesses, ``he
or I would be very hard pressed to deny that option.''
</P>
<P>
   In a plea for good will and some trust between Republicans and
Democrats, he said, ``our colleagues have to have faith in us. We
have to have faith in him, and his conference has to have some
faith in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their votes were strictly along party lines, the
senators seemed amiable on the Senate floor, exchanging backslaps
with friends in the other party, joking and showing no signs of
rancor. The scene suggested that some of the day's statements had
as much to do with the political needs of the two parties as with
the real mood.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have already sunk in opinion polls because of
their handling of the impeachment trial, and Democrats have every
incentive to continue painting them as unfair and as the party of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seized the opportunity again Thursday night. ``I
think it's fair to say that Democrats first and foremost want this
matter ended,'' Daschle said after the vote, which was the second
Democratic effort in two days to halt the trial.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Senate Republicans are trying not to seem as
fiercely partisan as Republicans in the House. So Thursday night
they sought to minimize the extent of the partisan strife. ``The
two sides are still talking to each other,'' Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., insisted. ``I do not think we've damaged personal amity
across the aisle.''

FALLOUT FROM SCANDAL MAY LIMIT DREAMS OF AFRICAN ATHLETES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JERE LONGMAN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In the West African nation of Senegal,
there is one all-weather running track, one indoor basketball court
and one Olympic-sized pool, filled with sea water and located not
at a training center, but at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to arrange for the training of our athletes,'' said
Lamine Diack, the president of the Senegal Olympic Committee.
``Now, we are building our first swimming stadium. Our problem is
one of having not enough facilities, equipment and coaches. Our
dream is to have the same sports system in our schools that the
United States has. Then we will raise a lot of champions. But
without facilities and coaches, it is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee, under its president, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, has made the Games a truly global event.
Athletes from 197 nations took part in the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta, a wholesale reversal from the boycott-tainted 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But the far-reaching Olympic corruption scandal could threaten
the long-term participation of athletes from developing nations,
particularly from Africa, which already struggles to support sport
while contending with more urgent problems of poverty, disease and
war. In these developing nations, a decent pair of training shoes
can be a luxury. Some of the teams arrive at the Olympics without
so much as uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Olympic committee members from Africa _ more than a third
of the continent's representation on the world's most influential
sports body _ have been dismissed, resigned or remain under
investigation in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth member linked to the scandal died last year. One of
those ousted by Samaranch, Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, was
perhaps the most influential of Africa's IOC members, serving as
president of the continent's association of national Olympic
committees. Replacements for the ousted members will not
necessarily come from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially more devastating than a decimated leadership is the
threat to aid programs operated by the IOC that provide training
scholarships, coaching clinics and equipment and are funded by
corporate sponsorships and television rights fees. If corporate
sponsors begin pulling out of the Olympic movement, and television
rights are devalued, the financial drought will begin to dry up aid
to developing nations who need it most, Olympic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real losers will be millions of kids and athletes who
won't be funded,'' said David D'Alessandro, president of John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, one of a dozen worldwide corporate
sponsors of the Olympic movement. ``This scandal, if not handled
right, could force governments all over the world to have to take
over the funding of these programs, and the quality of athletic
programs could be set back 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The international committee operates a little-known but much
appreciated program called Olympic Solidarity, which is budgeted to
spend $122 million from 1997 through the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia. The money, generated by television rights fees,
is earmarked for the 198 national Olympic committees worldwide and
contains 12 programs designed to train and develop athletes,
coaches and administrators. The program has proved especially vital
in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, for instance, Olympic Solidarity is funding sprinters
at a training center in Senegal, and distance runners at a center
in Kenya, while negotiating to train athletes in judo and wrestling
in Ivory Coast and boxers in Tunisia. Among other things, Olympic
Solidarity pays at least $40,000 a year to each national Olympic
committee, and pays travel and accommodation costs for up to six
athletes and two officials from every country to attend the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Funds from Olympic Solidarity will be bolstered by another $110
million in corporate sponsorship money distributed by the IOC to
international sports federations from 1997 through 2000. Beyond
that, the financial pipeline is dependent on continued belief by
corporations and television networks in the ideal that the Olympics
can contribute to world peace through sport. This notion faces
tremendous skepticism at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If corporate sponsors pull back, you should see far fewer
athletes from underdeveloped nations in Athens in 2004,'' said John
Lucas, an Olympic historian and retired professor at Penn State
University.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in Olympic participation by athletes from developing
nations, particularly in Africa, would seriously erode one of the
pillar achievements of Samaranch's presidency. He took over in
1980, four years after African nations boycotted the 1976 Montreal
Games, rebuilt the continent's commitment to the Olympics and has
been commended by President Nelson Mandela for his role in edging
apartheid toward final collapse by readmitting South Africa into
the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, after an absence of
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Because NBC has agreed to pay $3.5 billion for the five Winter
and Summer Games to be held between 2000 and 2008, Olympic
officials said they are confident that Olympic Solidarity will
continue to grow. Michael Payne, the committee's marketing
director, said the funding for Solidarity is expected to rise to
$200 million for the quadrennium between 2001 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has attempted to create a global appeal for the
Games, Samaranch was also the one who appointed all eight committee
members from Africa who have been connected to accepting cash
gifts, medical treatment, tuition aid and lavish gifts from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials. Other African officials have joined in
the call for a housecleaning of the international committee,
although no one has called for Samaranch to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations in Salt Lake City might even prove beneficial in
spurring the IOC to offer more training programs to developing
nations, said Sam Ramsamy, an IOC member and president of the South
African Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more programs were in place, maybe these inducements
wouldn't be necessary,'' Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite an insatiable need for more financing and training
programs, African athletes distinguished themselves at the 1996
Summer Games in Atlanta, winning both the men's and women's
marathons, the men's 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000-meter runs, the
3,000-meter steeplechase, two women's swimming events and the men's
soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
   Elite athletes earn extravagant salaries and endorsement deals,
but they do it largely by leaving the continent. Soccer players go
to Europe. Distance runners, courted by agents and shoe companies
like Fila, Puma and Nike, have dispersed, at least part of each
year, to racing circuits and training camps in England, the
Netherlands, Italy, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better to get rid of these officials,'' said Jos
Hermens of the Netherlands, the manager of Ethiopia's Haile
Gebrselassie, the world's top distance runner, who won a gold medal
in the 10,000 meters in Atlanta. ``Corruption is a big problem.
Money always goes to the wrong people, ends up in private bank
accounts. It can't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neediest countries are the most vulnerable to financial
inducements, said Keba Mbaye, an international committee member
from Senegal, who was on the six-member commission that
investigated the Salt Lake City bid committee. It is not clear
whether the removal of a number of members will automatically
improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Charles Mukora, dismissed last Sunday as an IOC
member from Kenya for allegedly receiving payments of $34,650 for
his personal benefit, remains the head of his country's national
Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Rosa, a sports manager from Italy, whose family
represents such Kenyan athletes as Moses Tanui, a two-time winner
of the Boston Marathon, said he believed that Mukora had done a
commendable job in welcoming sports agents and shoe companies into
the East African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood that the more companies were there to get
athletes, the more money there would be for everybody,'' Rosa said.
``It is not possible to know that if he loses power it will be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Senegal, Diack said he appreciated the $50,000 or so per year
his Olympic committee receives from Olympic Solidarity, but that he
could use four times as much. Senegal has taken a common approach
of cobbling funds from a variety of sources. The Senegalese
government pays for travel expenses, he said. China built the
national track stadium in Dakar, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The French government and the world governing body of track and
field, of which Diack is a senior vice president, constructed a
national training center for sprinters and jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money from the IOC must go to the countries to develop
sport, not to cities organizing the Olympics,'' Diack said. ``My
Olympic committee gets $40,000 or $50,000, and Athens is guaranteed
$1 billion to organize the 2004 Summer Games. Something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Diack said that the IOC, wanting the cities that stage the
Olympics to use the billion-dollar guarantees to organize the Games
instea of to build stadiums and collect large profits, would
reduce the amount of television money given to the host cities in
the future by 10 percent and would place more funds into sports
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to develop in Africa, we need support,'' Diack
said. ``We are starting from zero. The first all-weather track in
Kenya was built in 1985. Before that they ran on grass or dirt. So
we are doing very well with nothing. But we would like to make a
fantastic move in all sports.''

MONITOR REJECTS BID TO OVERTURN HOFFA VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal monitor on Thursday rejected appeals to
overturn James P. Hoffa's election to the presidency of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, but he barred a Hoffa
running mate from taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The election overseer, Michael Cherkasky, found that the
violations by the Hoffa camp were too minor to warrant voiding last
month's election, which Hoffa, son of the famed Teamsters leader
James R. Hoffa, won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Leedham, Hoffa's main challenger, had sought to void the
election, asserting that the Hoffa slate engaged in campaign
finance violations. But Cherkasky ruled in Hoffa's favor on most
charges, and Leedham said he had to study the 76-page ruling
further before deciding whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal monitors had ordered last month's election after
vacating a 1996 election in which the previous president, Ron
Carey, had defeated Hoffa. The monitors also barred Carey from
running again after finding that three of his aides had diverted
more than $700,000 in union money to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Leedham's protest ``frivolous,'' Hoffa applauded
Cherkasky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been two years since the members of this union had
legitimate, elected leaders,'' Hoffa said in a statement. ``I call
on the Leedham slate to accept his decision and not further delay
the inevitable with appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky suggested that it would take three weeks for an
appellate officer to consider appeals on his ruling. If that
officer upholds the election, Hoffa is likely to take office in
late February or early March.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky voided the victory of J.D. Potter, a Texas Teamsters
official who was elected as one of 19 vice presidents on the Hoffa
slate. He was one of three vice presidents on the Hoffa slate who
faced charges.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the violations serious, Cherkasky also disqualified
Potter from running again, finding that he exceeded the $5,000
contribution ceiling by giving $10,000 and then lied about it.

PRIVACY ADVOCATES ASK FTC TO FORCE RECALL OF INTEL CHIPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   By JERI CLAUSING  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Privacy advocates who object to Intel Corp.'s plan
to put identification numbers in its next generation of computer
chips went to the Federal Trade Commission Thursday to seek a
recall of the Pentium IIIs.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with the commission followed a visit by Intel
executives to the Capitol Hill offices of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, an online advocacy group. On Monday, the group
and two other organizations called for a boycott of the world's
largest chip maker, saying the new technology would compromise the
privacy of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the boycott threat, Intel said the company would
alter the software that turns the identification feature on and
off. But the privacy groups said that solution was inadequate. So
Intel executives flew to Washington for a meeting Thursday at which
they defended the alteration, saying it gives consumers both choice
and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They met with us for almost two hours,'' said Marc Rotenberg,
director of the privacy center. ``We decided after the meeting that
we would actually extend the boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said the privacy advocates wanted Intel to remove the
processor serial number from any future Pentium III chip, and to
recall all processors that had been shipped with the processor
serial number already enabled.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy advocates then headed to the trade commission to
plead their case for a recall of the chip, which Intel confirmed
was already being shipped to computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission confirmed the meeting with the privacy
advocates, but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates are concerned that Intel's chips, which were
designed to enhance the security of electronic commerce and
safeguard against software piracy, would make it easy for
governments and online marketers to follow computer users around
the Internet and build profiles about their Internet habits.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, said the team that met with
the privacy group included a security expert, a public relations
executive and an employee in the company's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were grateful for the opportunity to explain our view of
the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy said Intel believed its solution gave ``consumers both
the choice and control over whether or not to use processor serial
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel is the world's largest computer chip maker, with $26.2
billion in sales last year. On Thursday, it announced a 2-for-1
stock split effective April 11, news that moved the company's stock
up $4.4375, to $137.1875, on the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara, Calif., company, which makes about 85 percent
of the world's computer processors, unveiled the Pentium III chip
containing the so-called processor serial numbers at a trade show
in Silicon Valley last week.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a coalition of privacy advocates began
discussions about a boycott of Intel. On Monday, as the protest was
announced, the company said it would alter software in the system
so that the serial number was disabled unless the computer user
turned it on. Originally, the feature would have been activated
automatically and it would have been up to the user to disable it.
</P>
<P>
   But the privacy advocates refused to end their protest, saying
the software patch was an unacceptable solution. Among other
things, they questioned whether it would protect against intruders
breaking in and switching the setting, even though Intel says that
is not possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new mayor's decision to accept the resignation
of a white aide who upset a black colleague by using the word
``niggardly'' has turned into a major embarrassment for the young
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the mayor, Anthony Williams, who is black, has
been widely criticized from all sides: blacks who already
questioned his loyalty, whites who see the move as pandering,
conservatives on a crusade against political correctness and gay
groups furious at his treatment of the aide, David Howard, the
mayor's first openly gay appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who was the mayoral ombudsman, used the word on Jan. 15
in a budget discussion with two co-workers. ``I will have to be
niggardly with this fund because it's not going to be a lot of
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niggardly,'' which means ``miserly,'' is derived from the
Scandinavian and has no racial overtones or link to the racial slur
it sounds like.
</P>
<P>
   At a community meeting Thursday night, Williams walked away from
a reporter who asked him about the matter. A spokeswoman, Peggy
Armstrong, said only that ``his position is that in this
environment it may have been poor judgment for someone in his
position to use that word, and based on that, he accepted his
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the gay groups, Williams has said he will
review the situation, to see if there was any wrongdoing by Howard,
and may offer him a different city post if there was not. The
review is to be completed by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Plotkin, a local radio commentator, said Williams finds
himself in the position of having to prove himself to the black
community, where his loyalty has been questioned by some who
wonder, in the words of a recent opinion article in The Washington
Post, whether he is ``black enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was strong in the black community,'' Plotkin said of the
mayor, ``he could have said, `This is absurd.'''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP, weighed in Thursday, saying
it was Williams who had been ``niggardly in his judgment on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to think you have to censor your language to meet
other people's lack of understanding,'' Bond said. ``This whole
episode speaks loudly to where we are on issues of race. Both real
and imagined slights are catapulted to the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Watters, past president of the mostly black National Bar
Association, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really know where the Norwegians got the word?'' Watters
asked. ``And how would another ethnic group react if you came close
to the line with a phrase inappropriate to that group?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Chavous, a City Council member who ran against Williams in
the November election, suggested that there must be more to the
story, or Williams would surely not have accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests some instability'' on Williams' part, Chavous
said. ``I don't think the mayor's being decisive enough on this.
Where does it end?''
</P>
<P>
   When Howard, a 44-year-old former restaurant manager who ran
Williams' volunteer office during the campaign, offered his
resignation, the mayor immediately accepted. Williams said later,
``I think it was appropriate that he resign,'' and he compared
Howard's use of language to getting ``caught smoking in a refinery
that resulted in an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor received a letter of protest from 22 homosexuals,
including Rick Rosendall, a prominent local activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Howard is the one owed an apology,'' Rosendall said.
``The mayor has been making incredibly lame statements defending
the fact that he accepted his resignation without even looking into
it first. The fact that he would cave in like this doesn't bode
well for his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter reads, in part: ``The facts have to count. If we fail
to distinguish between decent people and bigoted people, if we
acquiesce in treating the former like the latter, then we send a
poisonous message to the people of this city, not to mention an
illiterate message to our schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Howard, he is so contrite that he sounds apologetic about
even knowing the word. ``I learned it for my SAT test as a junior
in high school,'' he said, miserably.
</P>
<P>
   He said his use of a word that could be so misconstrued was
reason enough for him to be out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used bad judgment in using the word `niggardly,''' he said.
``It's an arcane word that's unfamiliar to a lot of people, and I
can see how someone not familiar with the word could perceive it
differently. You have to be able to see things from the other
person's shoes, and I did not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the mayor was premature. H. Patrick Swygert,
president of Howard University, the prominent historically black
university here, said he hoped people would realize that they
needed to ``at least count to three before jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, we're at a point in time that even an official who
as far as I can see has no history of this kind of conduct still
has no opportunity to put this in context,'' he said. ``It would
appear there was no intent to inflict pain. Should this be fatal
for a budding public official? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become hot on conservative talk radio, where it
has inspired fresh outrage from Rush Limbaugh and others on the
excesses of political correctness. ``Some poor overeducated slob
loses his job over a Swedish word and Bill Clinton keeps his job
after perjury and obstruction of justice,'' Limbaugh said Thursday.
``Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sol Steinmetz, a New York lexicographer and former editorial
director of Random House's reference division, said the word goes
back to the 14th-century Scandinavian term ``niggard,'' meaning
miser, thus preceding by hundreds of years the entry of the racial
slur into the English language, which happened about 1700. The slur
derives from the Latin ``niger,'' or black.
</P>
<P>
   But in another recent dust-up over the same word, The Dallas
Morning News published an apologetic clarification last month after
using the word in a restaurant review that said a black chef had
been ``niggardly'' with his use of spices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chunk of our readers apparently did not know what the word
meant and took it as a racial reference,'' said Stuart Wilk, the
newspaper's managing editor. ``It wasn't a good word to use. We're
in the communication business, and in 1999 that word does not
communicate as well as some other equally good words.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said that immediately after using the word, he saw the
startled looks on the faces of both of his colleagues in the
meeting, one white and one black. The white colleague, John
Fanning, seemed to accept his explanation, he said, while the
other, Marshall Brown, stormed out and would not let him explain.
(Neither could be reached for comment either at home or work.)
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Howard seemed heartbroken that he could have anything to
do with worsening already fragile race relations in Washington. And
certainly, he never intended to end up as a poster boy for a
crusade against political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Howard remains loyal to the mayor and is spending most of his
time at home kicking himself, he said, saying he deserves to be out
of a job over such an inelegant word choice. He said he had not
heard from anyone in the mayor's office since resigning on Monday,
but offered, ``I've been on the phone a lot.''

THE BRONCOS DEFENSE _ STEPPING OUT OF ELWAY'S SHADOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When you score 501 points, and your quarterback is a
legend, your running back amasses 2,000 yards, your tight end
redefines the position, does anyone care who plays defense?
</P>
<P>
   More important to the Broncos _ who are only a victory over the
Falcons away from their second straight Super Bowl triumph _ that
defense may finally have overcome its second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Since John Elway burst into the National Football League in
1983, he has symbolized not only his team, but also virtually the
entire city of Denver. Given Elway's limelight, the fellows on the
Broncos' defense have been pretty much in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were second-class citizens,'' said the Broncos' defensive
coordinator, Greg Robinson, ``not a lot of esteem. It was low.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson arrived in 1995, fresh from being fired as the Jets'
defensive coordinator along with the rest of Pete Carroll's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this,'' Robinson said. ``From 1983, since John
Elway arrived in Denver, the focus from the outside world is on
John Elway and the offense. When Terrell Davis entered that thing
with Shannon Sharpe and the others, I think, it just heightened
that focus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson's unit is holding its own. His defense allowed an
American Conference low of 80.4 rushing yards a game, second in the
league to Atlanta's 75.2. The nonbelievers can argue that the
figure does not necessarily indicate a great defense, merely a
great offense. With the Broncos outscoring the opposition by almost
2 to 1 by halftime, opponents abandoned the run, started to pass,
and the rushing average plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' style places eight men in the imaginary box up
close to the line of scrimmage and dares you to run at them. It is
not a large defensive line, with no starter topping 300 pounds, so
won't Denver's linemen wear down? Won't it be tough to play
eight-in-the-box against the versatile Falcons?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be what we are,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   He comes by his confidence honestly. Robinson's defense has
progressed dramatically since he took it over. The first year he
joined the club, Denver's points-against improved by 51 points. By
1996, the Broncos had moved from 28th against the run to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the four seasons before Robinson's arrival, the Broncos had
sent four defensive players to the Pro Bowl. In the four seasons
under Robinson there have been nine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Robinson's defense has done well in the giveaway-takeaway
differential. It was second in the conference this season.
</P>
<P>
   In two playoff victories, this defense lowered the rushing
average to 60 yards a game. Now, the Broncos face an outstanding
runner in the Falcons' Jamal Anderson. He rushed for 1,846 yards
during the season, and another 180 in playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knows that some reporters perceive the Broncos'
secondary to be a weak link, that the cornerbacks Ray Crockett and
Darrien Gordon are beatable.
</P>
<P>
   There is some reality in the perception: The Broncos ranked 18th
in the league in interceptions. They yielded 28 passing touchdowns
while picking off only 19 passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in my ability to assess the
situation,'' Robinson said. ``I try to remedy it if I need to.''
The 47-year-old Robinson has a veteran defense, and he is a
big-game coach who has put together a game plan to halt two
receivers he knows very well.
</P>
<P>
   Terance Mathis was with the Jets when Robinson was there. ``He
supposedly didn't fit into our system, in that we wanted these big,
long receivers,'' Robinson said. ``He is more of scat-type. Also,
we defended Tony Martin for years when he was at San Diego. I was
surprised when he was traded. It was like a breath of fresh air for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Falcons, Martin and Mathis have teamed up to become one
of the rare receiving duos to gain 1,000 yards apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Denver will probably blitz to disrupt Chandler's timing with
Martin and Mathis. ``Look at Denver the last two games,'' said the
Falcons' offensive coordinator, George Sefcik. ``Their
aggressiveness at the line of scrimmage, and they go to the ball. I
think they'll blitz us a lot and we've prepared that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knows what his defense will give. ``I don't have any
problems any more. There hasn't been that discrepancy between the
offense and defense.'' &QL;

IOC DRUG CHIEF CALLS FOR SHIFT IN BANS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OLY-AFRICA) 
(DW) 
 By JERE LONGMAN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ With international sports facing legal
defeats and a lack of uniformity in doping sanctions, the drug
chief of the International Olympic Committee has proposed a radical
change in the way athletes are disciplined for using
performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of proposing a minimum two-year suspension for drug use
at a worldwide doping conference here next week, the IOC drug czar,
Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, said Thursday night that he
would offer a major compromise. Under the plan, athletes would
still be allowed to compete in some events while they served
punishments for doping violations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, athletes must serve their suspensions without any
chance of competing. Swimmers caught using steroids, for instance,
are banned for four years.
</P>
<P>
   As more international sports have become professional, however,
doping sanctions have run afoul of right-to-work laws, particularly
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have ruled increasingly that longer punishments interfere
with an athlete's right to earn a living. Track and field's world
governing body has reduced its punishment for steroid use from four
years to two years to comply with the new legal climate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, such sports as international soccer, cycling
and tennis have refused to go along with the IOC's request that a
minimum two-year ban be applied for major doping offenses. Petr
Korda, the tennis star, was not suspended at all after testing
positive for steroids, although the International Tennis Federation
is now seeking to suspend him.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such rebellion, the IOC drug chief said Thursday
night that he proposes allowing athletes to pursue a living while
serving drug sanctions. He said that his plan was being refined and
would probably not be implemented immediately.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would propose that major international events be off
limits during drug punishments, but he did not specify whether that
would include the Olympics and the various world championships.
While serving punishments, athletes would be subjected to frequent
drug testing under de Merode's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't take part in big events, they won't be paid as
much as before, and everyone will understand that they are
punished,'' de Merode said, speaking from Belgium. ``But they do
not completely lose their opportunity to work. I think these
sanctions can be applied without being reversed by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   One highly publicized challenge to drug tests enters a new phase
Friday in Paris when track and field's international governing body
opens an arbitration hearing into the distance runner Mary Slaney's
argument that a widely used test that resulted in her suspension
was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Duplantis, the lawyer for Randy Barnes, the Olympic
shot-put champion who is facing a lifetime ban for using the
supplement androstenedione, said he thought that de Merode's
proposal was fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could still feed the children and pay the rent,''
Duplantis said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the compromise is viewed as a retreat by international
sports officials, calls might increase for the resignation of the
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who is feeling tremendous
heat from the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. Samaranch was shouted
down last summer when he proposed that only drugs considered
harmful to the body be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Merode and Samaranch don't agree on everything,'' Dick
Schultz, the executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of the world calling for stricter sanctions after
last year's Tour de France scandal and other international doping
embarrassments, Samaranch may find it politically untenable to
approve more lenient punishments. De Merode's plan is certain to
bring more accusations that Samaranch is not seriously interested
in curbing the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more finessing; this isn't dealing with the problem,''
said John Hoberman, author of ``Mortal Engines: The Science of
Performance and the Dehumanization of Sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it surprising they are not taking a harder line.''

INTERROGATORS AND WITNESSES PREPARE FOR FACEOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lead graf to chage word to ``interrogators,'' stead of
``inquisitors'') (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the Senate voted to summon three
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial, the
interrogators honed questions they hoped would turn their case
around, and their targets prepared to say nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican prosecutors assigned to interview the
witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal _
met separately on Thursday morning with their aides and the lead
prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, to map strategy and
plan questions for depositions that are to begin on Monday with Ms.
Lewinsky. Jordan and Blumenthal will follow on Tuesday and
Wednesday, but as of Thursday night, the sequence had not been
decided.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team, even as it argued for a quick end to
the proceedings, continued to prepare for extensive discovery and
the possible calling of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After their meetings on Thursday, some of the House managers
jumped on airplanes to tend to business back home. Rep. Ed Bryant
of Tennessee, who will interrogate Ms. Lewinsky, surveyed tornado
damage in western Tennessee. And Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,
who will question Jordan, is scheduled to speak at a Chamber of
Commerce banquet in Booneville, Ark., on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On his flight home, Hutchinson said he was planning to re-read
Jordan's grand jury testimony. He wondered aloud how he would crack
the polished Washington insider and million-dollar superlawyer whom
House prosecutors have contended helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job to
buy her silence in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan is an experienced lawyer who is extraordinarily
poised,'' said Hutchinson, a former federal prosecutor. ``It's
going to be difficult to handle in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hutchinson played down expectations of any new
bombshells exploding from the upcoming depositions, and said the
House managers' goal is to persuade the Senate to take the next
step in the trial: calling the three witnesses to testify on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting any grandiose revelations from these
depositions,'' Hutchinson said in an interview. ``There may be a
few new areas, but they won't be earth-shattering. We'll make a
case for live witnesses on other than new information. It has to
come out of the conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors prepared for the interviews of their professional
lives, they waited all day for word from the Senate on the
logistics for the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition ground rules adopted on Thursday night restrict
the scope of the questioning to the Senate record. Senate leaders
were still negotiating time limits on each deposition, with the
House managers and the White House counsels each receiving from two
to four hours per witness.
</P>
<P>
   Two senators, one from each party, will preside over the
depositions and rule on any questions. Objections raised by either
side would be noted and decided by the full Senate after all of the
witnesses were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As the House managers watched the roller-coaster day unfold in
the Senate, the witnesses themselves, not yet served with Senate
subpoenas, were also preparing to give yet more sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a 63-year-old Clinton confidant, was reportedly out of
town. His lawyer, William G. Hundley, did not return several phone
calls on Thursday. But an associate of Jordan said he would be back
in time to have lunch on Saturday with his mentor and law partner,
Robert S. Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For Blumenthal, Thursday was sort of a normal day. The
50-year-old presidential aide whom House prosecutors contend helped
plan a possible smear campaign against Ms. Lewinsky, spent the
morning at the White House and the afternoon with his lawyer in
Baltimore, and was planning to attend a dinner at the British
Embassy on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say the same thing he's already testified to,'' said
William A. McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer. ``If the managers ask him
something new, like about the smear campaign, his answer will be,
`No, I didn't do it.' They are just lost in a fog of fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's interrogator, Rep. James E. Rogan of California,
was busy on Thursday preparing the questions he would put to his
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, long reviled by Republicans as championing the
``right-wing conspiracy theory'' against the Clintons, told the
grand jury that the president first described Ms. Lewinsky as a
``stalker'' and said she ``threatened'' to tell people ``they'd had
an affair.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors have sought to use these descriptions to prove
that the White House engaged in a campaign to smear its opponents,
and have accused Clinton of lying to his aides because he suspected
that they would become witnesses and would relate his denials of
the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In and out of meetings most of the day, Rogan popped up on CNN
early on Thursday evening, just as the Senate was preparing to vote
along party lines on rival ground rules for depositions, to made
another urgent plea to the Senate to allow live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had almost three weeks of lawyers bloviating about what
the facts in the case are,'' Rogan said. ``Wouldn't it be easier to
bring the witnesses? Those witnesses should be heard in the well of
the Senate. The truth comes from the witnesses, not from the
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Lewinsky, the witness who is central to the entire case,
was making arrangements to return here from Los Angeles, less than
a week after she flew in for a two-hour court-ordered meeting with
three of the House prosecutors. Her lawyers have insisted that she
has nothing new to add to the record.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who met with Ms. Lewinsky last Sunday and was impressed
with her as a potential witness, faces the task of reconciling what
the prosecutors said earlier this week was an ``almost complete
disconnect'' between the president's testimony and Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in pretty good shape to go ahead with the questioning,''
said Steve Susens, Bryant's spokesman. ``His main priority is that
the tornado cleanup effort goes ahead.''

COLLECTING CARS WITH STAR QUALITY, RAT PACK TO FAB FOUR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz.)  (bl)

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ This may be the biggest weekend of the year
in sports, but for car collectors, the Super Bowl has come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-day buying spree here last weekend at the 28th annual
Barrett-Jackson auction, nearly 600 highly desirable cars changed
hands at prices ranging from the expected to the extraordinary.
Size alone assures Barrett-Jackson a position of prominence among
aficionados. But beyond that, over the last four years the event
has accurately gauged the prevailing winds driving collectors and
investors, serving as an indication of the health of the collector
market.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett-Jackson has also evolved from a simple auction into a
spectator sport that draws a bigger on-hand audience than the Super
Bowl. This year, some 125,000 car buffs watched, at various times,
as more than 2,000 bidders vied in sometimes heated competition to
take home some of the world's most interesting and coveted cars. A
total of 734 cars were offered and 567 were sold. That 77.2 percent
selling rate compares with 65.5 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales reached $20 million, plus $1.7 million from the
big-ticket cars in the Exposition Tent, a separate area where cars
are sold one-on-one, allowing for more complicated transactions,
including trade-ins. Expo sales ranged from $126,500 to $1.2
million, for a 1931 Duesenberg Model J LeBaron Special Phaeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's economy is booming, America is where the money is,
and Americans are buying the dream cars from their youth,'' Craig
Jackson, owner of Barrett-Jackson Auction Co., said in summarizing
this year's results. ``There were plenty of Europeans in the
audience, but unlike four or five years ago, when they could
cherry-pick through the cars they wanted and take home the best
ones at bargain prices, this year they just couldn't match up to
what the Americans were bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest auction-block sale of the weekend, at $304,500, was
a 1973 Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona Spyder, one of 124 built by the
factory. Authenticity plays a big part in the market value of
Daytonas; coupes were often converted to open cars by after-market
specialists; one such Daytona ``chop job'' sold here for $127,050.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest cheers of the weekend went to the buyer of an
immaculately restored 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible who paid
$89,250, at least $30,000 above the normal price for this model.
Painted turquoise with a white top, it had a 283-cubic-inch V8 and
a rare factory fuel-injection setup, a three-speed manual
transmission and a limited-slip (positraction) rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders were willing to ante up for vehicles that belonged to
celebrities, like three cars once owned by Hollywood's Rat Pack. In
their heyday in the 1960s, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean
Martin indulged their automotive desires as freely as they flaunted
their pursuit of wine, women and the good life. A car formerly
owned by each crossed the block here.
</P>
<P>
   A 1956 Ford Thunderbird two-seat roadster originally owned by
Frank Sinatra brought $159,600, easily $130,000 more than a
standard '56 T-Bird. The custom-colored metallic gunmetal-silver
car was laden with options, including a factory hardtop, wire
hubcaps, fender skirts, an external spare tire mounted in a
Continental kit on the back bumper, a spotlight and dual rear
antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Among car collectors, Old Blue Eyes commands the kind of premium
that ``dot com'' adds to common stocks. Last August, Christie's got
$178,500 for an ordinary 1989 Jaguar XJS coupe at Pebble Beach,
Calif. Without Sinatra's name on the title, such a car would be
worth barely $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The cars of Sinatra's cohorts didn't do as well. A 1962
Dual-Ghia L6.4 coupe once owned by Dean Martin, in slightly
disheveled condition with custom-fitted luggage, chrome wire wheels
and distinctive appointments including a gun holster under the
driver's seat, sold for $63,000 to the Blackhawk Collection in
Danville, Calif. Though it was among only 26 Dual-Ghia coupes
built, the selling price was in line with those of cars that lack a
celebrity connection.
</P>
<P>
   These exotics combined Italian coachwork with a powerful
383-cubic-inch Chrysler V8; they were built by Ghia in Italy and
distributed in the United States by Dual Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of the Rat Pack cars did not find a new
home. Davis' 1964 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III convertible _ what
the British call a ``drophead coupe'' _ failed to sell despite a
bid of $305,000. With a body by Mulliner, the English coach
builder, and exquisitely restored with maroon paint and a tan
leather interior, this is one of fewer than 30 left-drive Silver
Cloud III convertibles built. A car in similar condition sold for
$247,500 in December 1997 at an auction in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis' and Martin's cars failed to move bidders' paddles,
Elvis and the Beatles set the crowd rocking. An enormous 1965
Rolls-Royce Phantom V limousine _ with a rare left-hand-drive
configuration _ brought $115,500, more than twice what these
behemoths normally fetch. The car's providence was extraordinary,
however, in that it had a double-Beatle history. John Lennon, the
original owner, sold it to Richard Starkey _ better known as Ringo
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Two cars once owned by Elvis Presley also did well. A mundane
four-door 1976 Cadillac Seville, two-tone blue with a custom grille
and garish gold trim _ typical of Elvis' cars _ sold for $30,450 to
the 120-car Klassix Auto Attraction in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been looking for an Elvis car to go in our celebrity
section,'' said David Murray, the winning bidder. ``We already own
the Batmobile, the Munsters' Dragula, and the Flintstones movie car
driven by John Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray conceded that a seller ``would be lucky to get more than
$7,000 for the same Cadillac without the Presley history.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Elvis car brought more. A 1969 Mercedes-Benz
long-wheelbase 600 sold for $72,400, although its air suspension
seemed to have collapsed. That flaw was perhaps offset by the
gold-lettered ``TCB'' on the doors _ for ``taking care of
business.'' These cars have a reputation for being exceptionally
difficult and expensive to repair; $20,000 would be considered a
generous offer for a regular 600 in like condition.
</P>
<P>
   Several Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwings, with their trademark
flip-up doors, did well. A recently refurbished '55, in silver with
a black leather interior, sold for $189,000. The same car had sold
last March at an auction in Las Vegas for $138,600, demonstrating
that even for high-end collector cars, fresh paint and a wax job
pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many Corvettes sold, the most unusual was a 1963 coupe
that was customized by the General Motors styling staff and
presented to their long-time boss, the legendary designer Harley
Earl, in his retirement. Festooned with 16 gauges and adorned by
external exhaust pipes that resembled a bundle of snakes, it
brought $152,500. ``We've sold this same car four times now,''
Jackson said. ``And each time we get more money for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the last car had crossed the block, the elaborate auction
tents had been taken down and tumbleweeds were again blowing across
the Sonoran Desert, Jackson reflected on the prospects for the
market.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw collectors moving into cars that are not
necessarily perfect, but offer good times. ``I'd keep an eye on
mid-'50s Chevys in driving condition,'' he said. ``People want cars
they can take to cruise-ins, relive the past and enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers we get at Barrett-Jackson, especially the
first-timers, aren't looking for show cars to pamper and admire.
They just want something they can have fun with.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ After an extraordinary personal appeal from Pope
John Paul II, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a supporter of capital
punishment, commuted the death sentence of a convicted murderer on
Thursday to a sentence of life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said his decision was a one-time event and a
tribute to the pope rather than ``a signal'' that he had changed
his mind on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to say I was moved by his concern for this
prisoner,'' Carnahan said in an interview Thursday afternoon in
Washington, D.C., shortly before he was to receive an award from a
meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. In a statement, he added:
``I continue to support capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision came one day after the pope concluded a
brief pastoral visit to St. Louis, during which he preached a
homily that included the strongest condemnation of the death
penalty he has made on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   After his final public event, a prayer service at St. Louis'
Roman Catholic Cathedral, the pope approached Carnahan, a Southern
Baptist, who was seated in a front pew, and, the governor said,
``asked me to show mercy'' to Darrell Mease, who was scheduled to
be executed on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, a 64-year-old Democrat serving his second term, has
approved 26 executions since taking office in 1993. He said he had
commuted one other death sentence, that of a prisoner he described
as being ``very retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mease owed his life to a chance event, Carnahan said,
``You may wish to call it that. It is the coincidence of the pope
being there, taking a personal interest in him, making a personal
request that I chose to respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Catholic Conference, which handles social
policy for the American bishops, said they could think of no
previous instance in which a direct appeal from a pontiff had
persuaded an American governor to grant clemency to a death row
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   In a previous case in Missouri in 1991, two years before
Carnahan became governor, the pope unsuccessfully sought clemency
for a man convicted of killing a state trooper. The man, Glennon
Sweet, was executed last year, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II issued an unsuccessful plea last year on behalf of
a condemned Texas prisoner, Karla Fay Tucker, who had become a
born-again Christian while in prison. In 1987, he spoke out on
behalf of an Indiana woman, Paula Cooper, who was sentenced to die
for a murder she committed when she was 15. Her sentence was later
overturned by an Indiana court and she is serving a life sentence
for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, a nonprofit research organization in
Washington, said it was ``certainly unusual'' for an elected
official to respond favorably to a religious leader's request for
clemency for a condemned prisoner. ``The clemencies themselves are
rare, about one or two a year since the death penalty was restored
in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the death penalty
constitutional in 1976, 510 prisoners have been put to death, with
the greatest number of executions taking place in Texas, Virginia,
Florida and Missouri, respectively, Dieter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mease's lawyer, Laura Higgins Tyler, said she was
``ecstatic'' over Carnahan's decision, Jim Justice, who prosecuted
the case, said he was disappointed by it, although he said he
respected the governor's right to make it. Describing himself as a
``strong Christian,'' Justice said he believed all things happen
for a reason. ``If the pope would've come two weeks earlier, it
would have been the previous guy,'' he said, referring to another
death row inmate who was executed. ``It just happened to be
Darrell, and I guess there's a reason for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's decision brings a dramatic end to a controversy that
had shadowed preparations for John Paul's two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Mease, 52, was convicted of the 1988 ambush slaying of a Taney
County couple, Lloyd Lawrence, 69, and his wife, Frankie, 56, along
with their disabled grandson William, 19. Mease, who killed the
trio with a 12-gauge shotgun as they rode all-terrain vehicles near
their rural Taney County farmhouse, alleged that the senior
Lawrence had been his former partner in a drug-manufacturing
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Mease had been scheduled for execution by lethal injection
Wednesday at 12:01 a.m., while the pope was in St. Louis. But
shortly after setting that day last November, the Missouri Supreme
Court, without explanation, re-scheduled the execution for Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action drew strong praise from Bishop Joseph
Fiorenza, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
the organization that represents the American prelates. ``The Holy
Father's plea for one man's life, someone who has been convicted of
having done great evil, reflects the church's concern for all human
life,'' Fiorenza, spiritual leader of the Galveston-Houston Diocese
in Texas, said in a statement. ``We oppose the death penalty not
just for what it does to those guilty of heinous crimes, but for
what it does to all of us; it offers the tragic illusion that we
can defend life by taking life.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show, however, that most Catholics do not agree with this
position, but rather support the death penalty by a roughly 2-1
margin. In this way, they do not differ much from other Americans
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pambianco, chief policy counselor at the Washington Legal
Foundation, a public interest law and policy center that supports
the death penalty, criticized Carnahan's decision because of the
nature of Mease's crime. ``It's exactly the sort of crime that the
death penalty was intended for,'' Pambianco said. In granting
clemency, he added, Carnahan was ``undermining the death penalty's
deterrent role, because he's weakening the consistency of the
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As of Oct. 1, 1998, there were 87 on Missouri's death row,
according to figures from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund Inc. Missouri executions are by lethal injection or lethal
gas.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's intervention on behalf of Mease unfolded rapidly on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning Mass attended by an estimated 100,000 people,
he called on Catholics to be ``unconditionally pro-life,'' a stance
in which he included opposition to the death penalty. ``Modern
society has the means of protecting itself without definitively
denying criminals the chance to reform,'' the pope said. He called
for ``a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary
of state, who was traveling with the pope, invited Carnahan to an
afternoon meeting at the residence of St. Louis Archbishop Justin
Rigali. ``The governor was asked to come to my residence, precisely
to discuss this case, and he very graciously agreed,'' said Rigali,
who also attended, along with Joaquin Navarro Valls, the pope's
chief spokesman. Carnahan was accompanied by Joe Bednar, his chief
legal counsel, and Angie Heffner, another state legal counsel.
Rigali said the meeting lasted 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Carnahan attended the interfaith prayer service with his
wife, Jean, sharing a front pew with Vice President Al Gore Jr. and
Tipper Gore. The service ended about 6 p.m., after which the pope
stepped away from the altar and came forward, blessing some
children, speaking to local religious leaders, then greeting Gore.
``And then he stopped and talked to me and asked me to show mercy
to Mease,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an unusual circumstance, having a papal visit in St.
Louis,'' Carnahan said. ``It was a very high and emotional event in
itself. And the pope, during his time there, to show particular
interest in this individual, to seek me out to discuss that,
through his secretary of state and then personally, moved me very
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, the governor's spokesman, said Carnahan made up
his mind to commute Mease's sentence at about 9 p.m. Wednesday
night, shortly after the pope had departed on a return flight to
Rome. He signed the commutation order Thursday morning, Sifford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, the former Taney County prosecutor, said the governor's
office called him for his opinion Wednesday before Carnahan reached
a decision. ``I told them I felt when I prosecuted the case that it
was a death penalty case and I still think that,'' he said. He
added that he had prosecuted 20 murder cases and sought the death
penalty only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyler, Mease's attorney, said she called her client at the
state correctional center in Potosi to share the news. ``He felt
much like I did, overwhelmed, grateful to the pope and to the
governor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lexie Mease, Mease's mother, said, ``Oh, there are just no words
to describe how thankful and happy we are!'' She also said she had
been expecting news like this since her son's sentencing. ``I've
been listening and looking for it and today it came,'' said Mrs.
Mease, 71. ``We knew God was on Darrell's side and God is the best
lawyer you can get. He's never lost a case.''

GONZALO TORRENTE BALLESTER, SPANISH NOVELIST, DIES AT 88 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Spain)   By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, a novelist who drew
heavily on the myths and witchcraft lore of his native Galicia and
won top literary prizes, died on Wednesday at his home in
Salamanca. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he won the government's Cervantes Prize for Literature,
considered the world's most important award for Spanish-language
writing. He also won Spain's National Prize for Literature in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote 25 novels and had been working on another, dictating
about a page a day to his wife. Colleagues said that his work mixed
irony and profound thought, emphasizing the poetic dimension of the
novel. But he also strove to include what one friend called ``a
sufficient reality'' and ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Torrente did not gain a wide following until 1972, with his
novel ``La Saga/Fuga de J.B.'' (The Legend/Flight of J.B.). It was
set in Galicia, the rainy, green and hilly section of northern
Spain with deep Celtic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, a censor for the Franco dictatorship complained
that it was ``completely impossible to understand. The action takes
place in an imaginary town where there is a holy figure who appears
in water and a series of crazy people who talk a lot of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrente's fame increased in the 1980s after state-run Spanish
Television serialized his trilogy ``Los Gozos y Las Sombras'' (The
Delights and the Shadows). Written from 1957 to 1962, the books
focused on a humble Galician fishing family confronting a local
political tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Torrente was a smallish man with a broad face and large ears. He
wore thick spectacles with dark frames and in later years still had
nearly a full head of hair. He dressed classically, favoring suits
and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Torrente was born on June 13, 1910, in Serantes, a hamlet near
the northwestern port of Ferrol. His father, a sailor, brought home
plenty of books by Spanish and foreign authors. Torrente earned
Spanish university degrees in philosophy and letters, and later in
science and law.
</P>
<P>
   He was studying in Paris when the Spanish Civil War began in
1936 and he returned home, enlisting in Franco's right-wing Falange
movement in 1937. Some Torrente scholars have since interpreted
that as a move to save his own neck, because Torrente as a young
man had worked as a journalist for an anarchist union newspaper, La
Tierra.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he taught literature at high schools and worked
as a theater critic, but Franco's censors kept a close watch
despite his professed allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   He quit the Falange in 1942. In 1943, his first novel, ``Javier
Marino,'' about the search for identity by someone on the edge of
the Civil War, was censored.
</P>
<P>
   Torrente definitively broke with the Falange in 1962, signing a
manifesto in opposition to Franco regime policies. This prompted
his expulsion as a history professor at the School of Naval
Warfare, and his next novel (in 1963), ``Don Juan,'' suffered
because he was ostracized politically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he moved to New York, where he taught Spanish
literature at the State University of New York at Albany. He
returned to Spain in 1972 and soon settled in the historic
university town of Salamanca, where he taught at a high school for
five more years before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Torrente was inducted into the Spanish Royal Academy,
the Madrid institution seen as the ultimate arbiter and guardian of
the Spanish language.
</P>
<P>
   Torrente also wrote six plays, which were rarely staged, and
numerous essays.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Fernanda Sanchez-Guisande, and 11
children from his two marriages.

SHIP LATE, BUT ANDERSON READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He had grown up around greatness, and on draft day in
1994, Jamal Anderson decided it was time for his own ship to come
in.
</P>
<P>
   So, mama Zenobia hosted the first _ and likely last _
draft-watching party in Anderson family history.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal said he had heard from scouts to expect to be drafted
sometime in the first three rounds. But round two passed ...
followed by round three ... and then Mel Kiper and ESPN signed off.
And in the middle of the draft's second day, still unselected,
Jamal Anderson snuggled up to his napping mother and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, he had held his own. He had playfully kept ``Uncle
Muhammad'' from hogging all the movie popcorn, and he had
out-wrestled a house guest named Tyson for the TV remote control.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years, Jamal Anderson's father, James, has
served as a sort of Security Man for the Stars. The ``Uncle'' was
the Greatest, Muhammad Ali. The TV buddy's first name was Mike.
Actor/comedian Richard Pryor let him roller skate around the house.
Disco queen Donna Summer read him bedtime stories.
</P>
<P>
   But on that draft day in 1994, Anderson was reminded that
greatness wasn't a routine phone call.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Atlanta Falcons called, 200 other players and 23
other running backs had already been picked. It was the draft's
seventh round, the final round.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Uncle Muhammad'' would remind Jamal, that didn't mean the
fight was over.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, as it turned out. On a bright morning in south
Florida, Anderson was beaming. The last shall be first. The
last-round running back rushed for 1,846 yards, and the eternally
grounded Atlanta Falcons are just hours from their first Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad days for Jamal Anderson,'' he assessed.
``We're here, and we're the only two teams playing for the world
championship. It's the greatest athletic stage there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is good, Anderson said. If the bright lights of Super Bowl
XXXIII are bringing a lump to some Falcons' throats, he is too busy
smiling, soaking it in, to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a lot to do with your foundation,'' Anderson
explained. ``My mother and father didn't allow us to live our life
in any special way. Regardless of who was around our house, we
treated everybody the same. Sugar Ray Leonard didn't eat before
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   James Anderson had worked as a policeman in Newark, N.J., and as
a lieutenant at a Muslim mosque. The senior Anderson met Ali at a
convention, and Muhammad was struck by the resemblance to the
champ's brother. He all but gave James a lifetime security contract
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When Jamal was seven years old, the Andersons left New Jersey
for southern California, and James' security business mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Stars and celebrities-to-be began showing up on the Anderson
doorstep. Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown taught the
then-9-year-old Jamal to stiff-arm would-be kid tacklers. Ali made
him stand in line and buy 15 tickets for the entourage to see
``Return of the Jedi''.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal even thought about boxing _ once _ when that Tyson fellow
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of mock slap-boxing _ you know how you get with
your buddies?'' Anderson recalled. ``You duck, acting like you're a
boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal's thespian skills, as it turned out, surpassed his boxing
ones. Tyson, for some reason, suddenly swung back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had kind of a flashback,'' Anderson said, who felt
a sudden stiff breeze knock him backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, like, `Twenty-second timeout. This game is over.' ''
He hasn't tried to box since.
</P>
<P>
   It took two stops for Anderson to finish his college football
career _ ``I had too many days like Ferris Buehler,'' he explained.
Some scouts saw him as a fullback type, or as a thick-legged
one-dimensional halfback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself in a situation where you were either
unwanted or overlooked,'' Anderson said. ``So, it's a constant
motivator. Other people constantly remind you of things you aren't
supposed to do. People don't think players like myself or Terrell
Davis \Ranother late-round pick\S should be achieving these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely always prominent in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Those thick legs carried the football a record 410 times during
the regular season. The same scouts who once suggested he was
one-dimensional are now comparing Anderson to Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons are to have a chance against the favored Denver
Broncos on Sunday, the ringing consensus is that Anderson has to
put on an MVP-caliber performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for us,'' said Anderson, who
doesn't shy from the notepads or minicams. ``This is the ultimate
stage. I've been a spectator for so many Super Bowls that I'm happy
to finally be a part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he was last, but on Sunday, Jamal Anderson will run for
first.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's his turn to be the star around the house.

MAVS, NELSON SAY THEY CAN BE CONTENDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Forward Cedric Ceballos submitted Wednesday that the
Mavericks have the makings of a playoff team. The re-signing of
Ceballos and the acquisition of forward Gary Trent and center John
``Hot Rod'' Williams also have generated playoff talk in and around
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The closest coach Don Nelson came to predicting a playoff
journey for the Mavericks this season was after practice yesterday
when he broke down the playoff situation in the NBA's Western
Conference by groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson put Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston, Seattle and
San Antonio in the top tier in the West and lumped Portland and
Phoenix in the middle group. Then he casually mentioned that the
Mavericks should battle Minnesota for the eighth and final playoff
spot, with the addition of Chris Webber and Vlade Divac giving
Sacramento an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at those other bottom dwellers, and Minnesota made
the playoffs the last two years,'' Nelson said. ``We should be able
to compete with those guys, and make a run at \Rthe playoffs\S
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're not a playoff team; I'm saying I don't
know. We're still young, we haven't played together, and we're
going to have a hard start. There's a lot of questions we haven't
answered yet. But we're very confident. I love our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent time the Mavericks reached the playoffs was 1990
when they finished 47-35 and were swept by Portland in three games
in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA's shortened season opens Feb. 5, Nelson likely will
start Michael Finley at shooting guard, Steve Nash at point guard,
Dirk Nowitzki at small forward, Samaki Walker at power forward, and
Williams at center. That leaves a second unit of Robert Pack and
Hubert Davis in the backcourt, Ceballos and Trent at forwards, and
Shawn Bradley in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even take into consideration A.C. Green, Erick
Strickland, Chris Anstey and rookie Greg Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a situation where our second team will be better
than our first one,'' Nelson admitted. ``We may have one of those
kind of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Williams, Trent and Ceballos in the past week
give the Mavericks playoff-caliber depth. Williams is a solid
rebounder and defender, and Ceballos is a proven scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Trent is a powerful rebounder and swift enough to drive to the
basket or shoot over the sleek small forwards on the perimeter. But
even Trent, who played on a playoff team in Portland, hesitates to
link the Mavericks and playoffs in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to go to the playoffs, but it depends on
our chemistry and how we play together and how we gel as a unit,''
Trent said. ``We have to understand each other and get a feel for
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley said he knows why Nelson isn't flat-out
saying the Mavericks are a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're young, and youth is usually that factor that
either makes or breaks you,'' Finley said. ``Hopefully it can be
something we don't use as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a deep team, and depth goes a long way in this league.
Hopefully we can gel together and put some victories together and
be a team that earns some respect.'' REEVES IN LIMBO Guard Khalid
Reeves remains in limbo, because Don Nelson said he has been unable
to find a team to trade him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offers; nothing,'' Nelson said. ``He's an NBA player ...
but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nelson said Reeves' playing time would be drastically
reduced if he remained with the team, so he would do him a favor
and trade him just for a draft choice or a small amount of money.

STARS GO WINDOW SHOPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bob Gainey might not be ready to order, but
he'll at least take a look at the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Monday, the Stars general manager will get a
first-hand view of two of the players who are expected to be
auctioned off to the highest bidder before the March 23 trade
deadline _ left winger Wendel Clark of the Tampa Bay Lightning and
right winger Theo Fleury of the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Stars president Jim Lites has acknowledged a need to add another
goal scorer, preferably one who can play left wing. Although Gainey
said he is not actively seeking a trade for any player but is
staying abreast of all trade talk, much of it centering on Fleury
and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the NHL, there always has been and there always will be
ongoing discussion on players and where they might or might not
fit,'' Gainey said. ``As a group, we try to be aware of all of
those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean face-to-face meetings with Lightning GM Jacques
Demers today and Flames GM Al Coates on Monday, but Gainey wouldn't
confirm that he would be talking to anyone within the next few
days. Gainey declined to speak to specifics concerning the interest
the Stars might have in any player, including Clark and Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   However, team president Jim Lites said fans shouldn't expect
Gainey to pull the trigger on any deal soon, especially if it
concerns a request for any of the Stars' younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very good team, and we have the ability to be a very
good team for years to come as long as we don't do something
stupid,'' Lites said. ``We're not going to mortgage the future to
take a chance on a player who might not even be here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The caveat on the three major players available to the Stars is
that all three have contracts that expire at the end of the season.
Fleury and Mark Recchi of the Montreal Canadiens will be
unrestricted free agents, and Clark has an option year remaining on
his contract that would likely allow him to become a free agent
this summer. That could mean the Stars would trade a top prospect
and then risk losing the player they acquired.
</P>
<P>
   That's the main reason all three players are available. Fleury,
30, is a gritty, goal-scoring right winger who has said he will
test the free-agent market this summer even if traded before then.
Fleury, who is under contract for $2.4 million this season, is
expected to command between $5 million to $6 million on the open
market. The Flames can't pay that and likely will trade him rather
than lose him without getting anything in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens are faced with the same problem concerning Recchi,
30. The left-handed-shooting right winger, who played junior hockey
for Stars coach Ken Hitchcock in Kamloops, British Columbia, is
under contract for $4.5 million. If the Canadiens are in jeopardy
of missing the playoffs, they'll likely deal him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clark, he is a bargain at $1.4 million this season.
However, the Lightning are trying to build with youth and are
expected to ask for a strong prospect in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendel has raised the price all by himself,'' Demers told the
Tampa Tribune of Clark's 19-goal season. ``We won't just be giving
Wendel Clark away, you can bet on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might have the deepest group of prospects in the
league with defenseman Richard Jackman, winger Jason Botterill and
goalie Roman Turek among players the league GMs covet. Do not
expect Gainey to even consider dealing such players as Jamie
Langenbrunner or Richard Matvichuk, no matter how many GMs inquire.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars believe that if no trade can be made, Langenbrunner
playing out of position still is a solid left winger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are somewhat lopsided, but we still have talented players
playing the left side,'' Lites said. ``We've already given up Todd
Harvey and Jarome Iginla to improve the team, and that's already
eaten into the depth of our young players. We don't want to win the
\RStanley\S Cup and then be horrible in five or six years.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do want to win the Cup, and that could mean keeping
track of every trade scenario right up to the trade deadline _
although Gainey said he can't worry himself with what other teams
are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend your time trying to derail other teams, I don't
think you have your focus in the right area,'' Gainey said. ``If we
can make a move to improve our own roster, we'll look into it, but
not to take something from someone else.''

EX-TROJAN IACENDA TRANSFERS TO NEW MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Hart High and USC running back Ted Iacenda
has decided to transfer to New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda left USC last month, after wanting a fresh start because
of the stress he said he felt for more than two years after being
charged _ and subsequently cleared _ of sexual assault charges
brought during his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons Iacenda decided to attend New Mexico was
offensive coordinator Jim Fenwick, the former head coach at Cal
State Northridge and Valley College.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to run a new offense, kind of like what Hart
does,'' Iacenda said. ``And I like Jim Fenwick a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stress-related circumstances of his case, the
NCAA waived Iacenda's residency requirements, which means he will
be immediately eligible next season at New Mexico. He will have two
years of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda also considered Brigham Young, Fresno State, Nevada-Las
Vegas, Boston College and Colorado before selecting the Lobos.
Iacenda's father, Andy, said his son was prohibited by USC coach
Paul Hackett from going to another Pacific-10 Conference school or
any schools on future USC schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the schools that contacted Iacenda wanted him to enroll
in the fall, because he did not receive his official release from
USC until after schools had already begun their winter semesters.
New Mexico was willing to offer a scholarship immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Mexico was the only one who took a chance,'' Iacenda said.
``I didn't want to wait until the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda leaves for Albuquerque today and will be able to
participate in spring practice with the Lobos.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda led Hart to the Division II title in 1995 and was a
two-time Division II Player of the Year. Iacenda scored a Southern
Section-record 99 touchdowns at Hart, and had 604 points in his
career, second-most in state history.

 CBS IS GRANTED MORE TAX CUTS TO STAY PUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six years after New York City granted CBS Inc. nearly
$50 million in tax breaks to stay in Manhattan until the year 2008,
the city has given it an additional $10 million in subsidies _
after being told the company was considering relocating to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old deal, the company had pledged to spend $300
million to upgrade its studios on West 57th Street with digital
equipment. But it only started doing so 18 months ago. The new deal
extends the company's commitment to Manhattan for an additional 10
years, until 2018, and city officials said it contains new
assurances that the network will make the investment that it had
earlier promised.
</P>
<P>
   CBS told city officials last spring that it was considering
moving its studios to the Newport Office Center, on the waterfront
in Jersey City. That apparently sent the city scrambling to keep
the CBS jobs from heading to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, the deputy mayor for economic development, said
Thursday that the city agreed to provide the additional benefits
because there was a real danger that CBS would have moved to New
Jersey, despite the company's 1993 pledge to remain in Manhattan
until 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat was very real,'' Levine said. ``We made this deal
competitive with the offer from New Jersey that they were
considering. The fact that we can secure their presence for the
next 20 years is very good for the city.'' CBS also committed
itself to keeping its corporate offices, now at 51st Street and
Avenue of the Americas, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of such so-called corporate retention deals said that
the new subsidies amounted to a reward for a company that was
threatening to break its original agreement with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no standards,'' said Ronnie Eldridge, a city
councilwoman in whose West Side district the CBS studios are
located. ``They're just giving away benefits to large companies. If
we were as tough on corporations as we are on poor people, the city
would have more to spend on schools, bridges and subways.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana McClintock, director of communications at CBS, said that
the latest agreement, which he called an ``amendment'' to the
original deal with the city, recognized that CBS had undergone many
changes in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal with CBS requires the network to maintain at least
as many employees in New York City as the 1993 agreement: a minimum
of 3,862 full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate developers and economic development officials in
Jersey City said they doubted that CBS was serious about relocating
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher, director of economic development in Jersey
City, said that Jersey City officials had met with CBS last spring.
But, he said, nothing came of it, and no offer was made to give CBS
any benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some conversations,'' Gallagher said. ``I wouldn't say
they were negotiations. At some point, we moved on to other
prospects. In their case, a New York location is probably better
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have come under increasing criticism for granting
tax breaks to a multitude of companies that have threatened to flee
New York without assessing whether the threat is real. Critics say
the subsidy packages shift the city's tax burden to small and
medium-sized companies and rob the city's treasury of desperately
needed funds.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of moving is not always illusory. CIGNA Healthcare
and U.S. Trust Co. announced Thursday that they would move about
1,000 employees from Manhattan to the Newport Center.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Giuliani administration, the city had given 43
companies, including Conde Nast, Bear Stearns and Reuters, a total
of more than $1.5 billion in tax breaks, cash and subsidized
electricity. The New York Times received a similar tax break, for a
printing plant in College Point, Queens, during the Dinkins
administration.

SUPER BOWL BETTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to respected Las Vegas gambling figure Jimmy Vaccaro,
the wagering on Super Bowl XXXIII is unfolding much like in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is looking to lay the points and the wise guys are
looking to take them,'' says Vaccaro, a wise guy himself who is
going against his brethren and taking Denver and laying seven
points against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the spread on Sunday's match is now up to 7{ at many
betting parlors, which is not surprising to Vacarro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say four of the five tickets written at the sports books
are on Denver,'' says Vaccaro. ``The public simply overpowers the
wise guys on this game. And I think about 15 out of the past 20
games, the public has been right. The favorite usually covers the
spread in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro says the one betting proposition that has been most
enticing for the wise guys in this Super Bowl has been the
unders/overs, which had held steady at 54 but now is down to 53{.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-four is the highest unders/overs total in the history of
the Super Bowl,'' says Vaccaro ``Almost all the wise guys I know
took the unders at that number. I took it, and bet a lot more on
this than I did on the game itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro, the former director of the Mirage's sports and race
book who now has his own sports betting tout service, predicts a
record amount will be bet on this Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new casinos in Las Vegas, and that means
more people will be in town to bet on the game,'' he says. ``It's
going to be a zoo here in Las Vegas on game day. I'll watch the
game from the comfort of my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too.
</P>
<P>
   And I won't become depressed no matter what happens during the
game.
</P>
<P>
   I've beaten the bookmakers every year now since Jan. 1, 1991 in
the only way it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   I don't bet. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ The old Long Beach sporting gentleman, Mike Economou, now
doing his betting quite legally in Las Vegas, has perhaps the most
interesting wagering proposition on the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He has one bet on Denver plus 3{---this is not a misprint---and
another on Atlanta plus 7{, as he's looking to middle the game.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to get points on the Broncos when the sports books
around Las Vegas posted the AFC Super Bowl entrant as a 3{-point
underdog before the Minnesota-Atlanta match, figuring the Vikings
would be representing the NFC on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons upset the Vikings, giving those bettors like
Economu who sensed that would happen a huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Economou, a colorful character who once was this city's highest
profile bookmaker until chased out of town in 1986 by an obsessive
Long Beach vice cop named Big John Stolpe, is a 1961 Wilson High
graduate whose best friend, former major leaguer Bob Bailey, also
now resides in Las Vegas. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Down in Dominica, a small, tropical island in the Caribbean,
Paul (The Librarian) Lisenby, still another Long Beach native
heavily involved in sports gambling, reports business has been
brisk for him this week on the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, there will be more money wagered on
this Super Bowl with the off-shore sports betting places than in
the Nevada sports books,'' claims Lisenby, who's in charge of the
World Wide Wagering outfit. ``We're expecting it to exceed $600
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisenby, one-time owner of the old Naples Grill and Sports
restaurant and a 1978 Jordan High graduate, has been in Dominica
for the past 3{ years.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been an easy gig for him, as he routinely puts in
12-hour shifts, seven days a week and has been away for long
periods from his wife and two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, finally, it's starting to pay off,'' he says. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Snow's annual preseason Dirtbag banquet turned out to be
quite a success Wednesday night at the Hyatt, although I held the
ignoble distinction during the uplifting event of being the only
person to be booed when introduced.
</P>
<P>
   I heard later the jeers came from the Dirtbag's most zany
booster, Craig (Cucumber) Vestermark, which figured. The guy who's
usually pickled wasn't. In fact, it was learned through anonymous
sources he was on the wagon, and had been so for at least 24 hours!
No wonder he hooted at me. He had nothing better to do. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Malone was the keynote speaker, and, after he gave the

JERZY TUROWICZ, ANTI-COMMUNIST POLISH EDITOR 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerzy Turowicz, who skirmished with communist censors for nearly
four decades to produce a Polish Catholic weekly that became widely
known as ``the only free newspaper from Berlin to Vladivostok,''
died on Wednesday in Krakow, Poland. He was 86 and had suffered a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   News of Turowicz's death was brought to Pope John Paul II while
he was about to celebrate Mass in St. Louis. He then prayed for the
soul of the man who had been described as his closest friend at the
time of his election to the papacy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after communism fell in their native Poland in
1989, they differed over issues like abortion, but their friendship
went back to a time when Turowicz published the pope's poems and
essays while he was still Karol Wojtyla, a priest from Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   The death was front-page news all over Poland, and Thursday's
issues of Gazeta Wyborcza, a Warsaw daily, devoted eight pages to
Turowicz, including a poem about him by Czeslaw Milosz, the 1980
Nobel laureate in literature. In an editorial, the paper said
Turowicz ``was the moral authority of several generations of Polish
intellectuals; a wonderful essayist and a rational commentator on
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his Krakow-based publication, whose name means The
Universal Weekly, the editorial added, ``For more than a half
century he established Tygodnik Powszechny as an achievement
without precedent in the annals of Polish culture, an achievement
that for many years provided the only light in the dark Polish
tunnel.``
</P>
<P>
   The magazine was founded in 1945, sponsored by Adam Sapieha, who
was then Archbishop of Krakow. But after Turowicz took over as
editor in 1951, he moved it away from direct church control, often
enraging both communist and church officials with its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his boldest act occurred when, after the death of Stalin
in 1953, party officials ordered him to publish a eulogy of the
Soviet despot. He refused, and as a result the paper was taken away
from him and turned over to a Catholic group called Pax that was
collaborating with the communists.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later _ after worker-led uprisings in Poznan,
Poland; after a Hungarian rebellion was suppressed by Soviet
troops, and as a new Polish communist leadership sought credibility
_ the weekly was returned to Turowicz.
</P>
<P>
   Standing up to the censors and at times to church leaders, he
set about publishing articles on politics, culture and religion
that were unavailable anywhere else in the communist bloc. He
battled censors word by word and instituted the practice of
including dashes to show the readers where something had been
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not free to write everything we think,'' he said in
1986, ``but we have never been forced to write anything we do not
think. In the East bloc that's a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   From a reader's perspective, this view was echoed in this same
period by Slawomir Mrozek, Poland's best known playwright, who said
Turowicz had ``shown us that just because you cannot tell the
truth, you do not have to tell lies,'' adding, ``Because of
Turowicz, Poles have a newspaper we can believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in periods of less stringent censorship, his weekly
could say things quite directly, as it did when it published an
article by its featured essayist, Stefan Kisielewski, titled
``Socialism Is Idiotism.'' At other times, when the censors were
more aroused and energetic, he found many ways to say things that
conspiratorially sensitized Poles had little trouble understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the Polish government mounted a full-scale
anti-Semitic purge in 1968, Turowicz saw to it that his weekly
published a number of articles by people who were being shunned
elsewhere for their Jewish origins, and invited one such figure,
the poet Antoni Slonimski, to be a contributing editor. Or later,
in 1982, to mark the first anniversary of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski's declaration of martial law, he devoted six of the
publication's eight pages to a new translation of the Book of Job.
</P>
<P>
   Like all issues of the weekly during the communist period, this
one was limited to a press run of 50,000, but as always copies were
widely circulated among networks of friends and neighbors, some of
whom retyped and mimeographed articles for use in a burgeoning
underground press.
</P>
<P>
   As for conflicts with the church, Turowicz was often upbraided
for his commitment to church reform in the 1960s and 1970s by the
strong and aristocratic primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. In
these conflicts he was often defended by Wojtyla, the future pope.
Once Turowicz, having been summoned by Wyszynski, fell asleep while
being admonished.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with the man who became Pope John Paul II began
when he received an article about how materialistic temptations had
corrupted the Catholic Church in France. It was written by Wojtyla.
Turowicz ran it on the front page under a pseudonym, Andrzej
Jawien, which the future pope continued to use on his pieces in the
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met regularly, often discussing the ideas of
Emmanuel Mounier, a French Catholic whose philosophy of
``personalism'' had argued for a third way, a way to spiritually
invigorate people who had been depersonalized by either Marxist
atheism or capitalistic materialism. The idea would later find
expression in the Solidarity labor union movement in which Turowicz
served as an adviser, and in several of the pope's encyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   During the decade when Solidarity rose, was suppressed and then
ultimately triumphed in 1989, the pope and Turowicz maintained
close contacts. But once a free and democratic Poland emerged,
their differences widened.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Poland in 1991, the pope turned down a request
to see a group of liberal Catholic intellectuals that included his
old friend. In 1994 after the weekly published a debate that
included various opinions on abortion, Turowicz, who described
abortion as ``a lesser evil,'' was dismissed from the board of the
John Paul II Foundation, which distributes research grants. But in
1994, Turowicz met with the pope in the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Turowicz was born in Krakow on Dec. 10, 1912. He studied
philosophy at the city's Jagiellonian University and married Anna
Gasiorowska, the daughter of an aristocratic and influential
family. He survived the war years on her family's estate, to which
he invited Milosz after the poet's home in Warsaw was bombed. His
wife and their three daughters and five grandchildren survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945 he joined the newly created church magazine as an
assistant editor. Six years later he took over as editor and he
held that post until he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably I am not a bad editor,'' he once said. When asked
what it was that enabled him to endure all the pressures, he
replied, ``I think it is because I am calm.''

JURY AWARDS ANCHORWOMAN $8.3 MILLION IN SEX BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Challenging the common television practice of
choosing news anchors on the basis of their sex, a federal jury
awarded $8.3 million Thursday to a Hartford anchorwoman who
contended that she lost her high-profile and high-paying job
because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The anchorwoman, Janet Peckinpaugh, had charged that the
managers of the CBS station here had decided not to renew her
contract in 1994 because they had three anchorwomen and two
anchormen, and decided in advance to drop one of the women to make
the pairs come out even. Ms. Peckinpaugh, who is now 48, had also
accused the station of jettisoning her because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of five men and three women in U.S. District Court here
found that Post-Newsweek Stations Inc., the owner of the Hartford
station at the time, did not discriminate against Ms. Peckinpaugh
on the basis of age.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury ruled that the company and in some cases three of
its executives discriminated against her on the basis of gender,
breached her contract, made false statements to her suggesting she
could be assured of long-term employment, and retaliated against
her for complaining about an incident in which she said she had
been sexually harassed by her male co-anchor. The jury's award was
twice the amount that Ms. Peckinpaugh had sought.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict sent a jolt through an industry built on the nearly
universal pairing of attractive men and women to read the news at 6
and 11 o'clock. ``Good grief,'' said Barbara S. Cochran, the
president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, when
told the size of the award. She said broadcasters made such
pairings because they replicate ``the man and woman in the
audience.'' She added: ``That helps the audience feel the whole
newscast is relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   David A. Klatell, the director of the broadcast journalism
program at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism,
estimated that 90 percent of evening news programs in the United
States feature male and female co-anchors. He said news directors
seem to have ``a religious certainty'' that such pairings are the
best. ``I get a lot of calls from employers asking about our alumni
who say, `I need a male,' or `I need a female,' '' Klatell said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during the trial, the president of Post-Newsweek
Stations, G. William Ryan, testified that male-female couplings of
anchors are common and even desirable. ``We don't have such a
policy, but it is a general practice in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 18 witnesses during the eight-day trial, the jury
deliberated for just four hours. One juror, Bernard F. Woodard,
said in a telephone interview that he found the evidence clear.
``Most everyone understands it's the industry practice _ male and
female,'' he said. ``But you can't discriminate on the basis of
sex, and they were blatant about that from their own records.''
</P>
<P>
   The gender issue arose when the station, WFSB, Channel 3, asked
its three female anchors to tape auditions with a new male anchor,
then did not renew Ms. Peckinpaugh's contract after she scored the
lowest with viewers on several key measures. The other two women,
both younger, were paired with the two male anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peckinpaugh testified that station executives never
considered pairing two women, but rather were intent on keeping the
male-female teams. In addition, Ms. Peckinpaugh testified that
several executives told her that the station had ``too many
women.'' On the stand, those executives testified that they
actually said the station had too many anchors.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the jury found that Ryan and two other
Post-Newsweek executives ``aided and abetted discrimination,'' and
that the company ``acted with malice or with reckless indifference
to Ms. Peckinpaugh's federal right against gender discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-Newsweek Stations, a division of The Washington Post Co.,
had contended that it had no obligation to Ms. Peckinpaugh beyond
her four-year contract, which ended in 1994. She remained on the
air, although in an assignment she considered a demotion. After the
verdict, Ryan, the Post-Newsweek Stations president, said that
discrimination laws apply to hiring, not to pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should have been a simple case about whether management
had a right to let a contract terminate,'' he said. ``All these
other things got spun onto it as satellites. They did a very good
job of spinning a web of confusing facts and dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the company would appeal the award.
</P>
<P>
   Out of her job at the CBS station, Ms. Peckinpaugh saw her
annual salary drop from $250,000 to $45,000 when she accepted a job
in 1995 as the early-morning anchor at the NBC station in Hartford.
She still has that job, and is now paid $80,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory for every woman in television, and
every woman who wants to go into television,'' Ms. Peckinpaugh said
outside the courthouse.

 &HT;    Jackson pushes for `access to capital,' youth mentoring
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are two sides to the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson
Sr.
</P>
<P>
   There's the charismatic orator who speaks in hypnotic rhythms.
There is Jackson the nomadic politician who in 1988 made an
unsuccessful, but impressive pitch for the Democratic U.S.
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Like a series of intertwined electrical wires, it was difficult
to tell where part of the man ended and another part began as he
spoke Thursday night at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   After the singing and praying, Jackson touted his latest
initiative: to link 1,000 U.S. churches by the Internet to create
investment and consumer clubs. Jackson also wants church leaders to
establish relationships with juvenile court judges to mentor
troubled youth as part of his ``Reclaim Our Youth Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow/Push Coalition leader said while blacks are free of
chattel slavery, legal segregation and now have the right to vote,
the final frontier to conquer is ``access to capital.'' He favors
building bridges between Wall Street and poor whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all of the first three and still starve,''
Jackson told the nearly 200 people during his one-hour pitch. ``You
have the right to vote but you're too weak to get to the voting
booth because you're hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to fight this economic fight.''
</P>
<P>
   With massive investments in corporations, Jackson explained,
comes clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose each church bought 10 shares of Microsoft and went to
the next board meeting, which is all white,'' Jackson theorized.
``That would change. There's no corporation who can say ``no'' to
us with this degree of organization. ``
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was as fiery about youth mentoring and education as he
was about investing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jackson, it costs $51,000 to imprison an individual
in Ohio, but $6,000 a year to educate a student. In addition, the
average school building in Appalachia is 46 years old and half of
southern Ohio schools hold classes in temporary locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And not far away are these first-class jails,'' he added. ``It
costs so much less to educate them on the front side than to
incarcerate them on the back side. Let's teach them how to read the
stock page and not just the sports page.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Schools superintendent James Williams, present at the
event, lauded Jackson's efforts, saying the two initiatives go
hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger our economic clout, the better our institutions
will be in our communities,'' Williams said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ The average sports fan likely hasn't heard of Calvin
Collins or Gene Williams or Ephraim Salaam. They might not have
heard of Robert Tobeck or Bob Whitfield.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Falcons will tell you Jamal Anderson wouldn't be
the second-leading rusher in the NFL and Chris Chandler wouldn't be
going to the Pro Bowl if not for the improved production from these
five, Atlanta's starting offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The group boasts no superstars, though Whitfield was added to
the Pro Bowl roster at left tackle this week. Tobeck, the center,
began his career in 1993 on the developmental squad. Salaam, a
seventh-round draft pick, not only made the team but starts as a
rookie at right tackle. Texas A&AMP;M ex Collins, a sixth-rounder in
1997, was converted from center to starting left guard this season.
Williams, at right guard, is in his eighth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got drafted in the seventh round,'' Salaam said. ``There are
a lot of guys who got drafted in the first through sixth rounds who
have millions of dollars but haven't played a snap in the NFL, and
I'd rather be in the situation I am in right now. I wouldn't trade
this situation for millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The season began with Collins and Tobeck exchanging positions.
Throw in one new face _ Salaam _ and only two positions remained
solid. It was not surprising the line was awful. Salaam was
manhandled by Kevin Greene, Carolina's perennial Pro Bowler, in
Week 1. By the end of Week 3, Atlanta had allowed 16 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that with Art Shell as our (offensive line) coach, a
Hall of Fame player who had been to four Super Bowls, we'd
eventually come around if we'd listen to what he had to say,''
Collins said. ``He was successful. He knows how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has improved as much as anyone. The Beaumont native
received one of those draft-day surprises as he waited and waited
and waited but didn't hear his name called. The four-year starter
for the Aggies had been predicted to be a late-third- or
early-fourth-round draft pick, but many teams thought he was too
short, at 6-2 and 307 pounds, to be an NFL lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happens to your psyche, your whole mindset,''
Collins said. ``And I have ESPN2 (which shows the late rounds), so
I saw everybody get drafted in front of me. I kept thinking, `Wait,
I'm better than him. I'm better than him.' And every time you hear,
`offensive lineman,' you think, `maybe, maybe, maybe' then they say
somebody else's name. By the time I got drafted, it was just, `Oh,
thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   But when Collins got to Atlanta before the 1997 season, he found
he knew no more or no less than anybody else. It didn't matter that
he was a rookie, because the team was switching from the
run-and-shoot that it ran under former head coach June Jones to a
more traditional run-oriented offense under new coach Dan Reeves.
Everybody was just as lost as he was.
</P>
<P>
   Four games into the season, he won the starting center job and
called the plays for the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a rookie at the quarterback position of the offensive
line _ that didn't help,'' he said. ``I had some growing pains.
There were a couple of times out there when I'd try to make a call
and I'd be like, `OK, what do I do?' I'd look around, and they'd be
quiet, too. They didn't know what to do, either. There were some
definite growing pains, but I think toward the end of the year we
started to play better. Then this year, we took it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta allowed 54 sacks last season as the line struggled to
learn the schemes. But as the season progressed, the line became
more comfortable. And as the line got more comfortable, the Falcons
started winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the New Orleans game (game 12) last year,''
Collins said of the turnaround. ``I think we played with some
emotion and we had some success and we discovered, `Hey, we can be
a good offensive line. We can run the ball. We can impose our will
on people.' It was a confidence thing. I think that game was
crucial for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why Anderson rushed for 1,002 yards in '97, most of those
coming in the second half. Chandler threw for 2,692 yards. He had
seven 200-yard passing games from Week 7 on. But those numbers
don't compare to this season, when Anderson rushed for 1,846 yards
in the regular season and Chandler threw for 3,154 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our record and offensive production has gone, it's really
based upon how the offensive line has played,'' Chandler said.
``They really struggled the first half of last season, (but) they
played awesome the second half of last season.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Broncos guard Dan Neil used to hate quarterback John Elway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why? Because Elway engineered the winning field-goal drive in
the second round of the 1991 playoffs that pulled out a victory
over Neil's favorite team, the Houston Oile &QL; 
rs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I was cussing John like crazy,'' Neil says about that
26-24 Denver victory. ``I just knew the Oilers were going to pull
that one out, but they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil is a Houston native who attended Cypress Creek High School
and the University of Texas. Neil's favorite players were Oilers
offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never stood up in football,'' he says, laughing. ``I've
played my entire career in a three-point stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's why I loved to watch guys like (Bruce)
Matthews, (Mike) Munchak, (Dean) Steinkuhler and (Jay) Pennison.
When Munchak, Matthews and Steinkuhler were the No. 1 picks three
straight years, they were the foundation for those playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked watching Matthews best. He was such a great player.
Still is. I really admired Munchak, too. I've never told them that.
I'm sure that's the last thing they'd want to hear from a
second-year guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Matthews and Munchak might want to hear about the
Super Bowl XXXII ring Neil got as a rookie. Or perhaps they would
like to hear about his goal of earning rings in his first two
seasons with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was what every veteran hates _ a rookie in the
Super Bowl,'' Neil says. ``For me to get a ring as a rookie and
think how Matthews and Munchak have never been in this situation,
well, it makes me feel sorry for them because of everything they've
accomplished individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil shouldn't feel sorry for anyone. He has earned the right to
be where he is. With the Longhorns, he was a four-year starter. The
Broncos drafted him in the third round, but a groin injury
curtailed his rookie season. When he was active, he played on
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, veteran guard Brian Habib signed with Seattle,
leaving a spot available. Neil stepped in, and the offense has been
even better this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason we're able to plug in other guys is because of
Alex's philosophy,'' Neil says, referring to line coach Alex Gibbs.
``He lets the second- and third-team linemen get almost as many
reps as the veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired, backup Harry
Swayne moved into the lineup on the right side and Tony Jones moved
from right to left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tribute to the guys in this room that we made
those changes, and the results have been as good or better,'' left
guard Mark Schlereth says. ``We've got great study habits, and
we're a cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play real hard for each other. We're a tight-knit group.
Any change isn't going to be dramatic for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the Broncos' linemen are not stars. Jones and
center Tom Nalen are going to the Pro Bowl. Collectively, though,
they make up the best line in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the linemen block well enough to help running back
Terrell Davis rush for 2,008 yards and score 23 touchdowns in the
regular season, but they allowed only 25 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work well together,'' Neil says. ``We do an excellent job
of communicating. We know how to adjust. We have an answer for
anything the defense might try against us. Because we communicate
so well, we do a good job of making adjustments. The truth is,
Terrell's become a better back this season. He's a great all-around
back, and we're an all-around team.''
</P>
<P>
   No Broncos offensive lineman missed a start this season. Even
Schlereth, who has undergone surgery on his knees more than 20
times, didn't miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get hurt, you keep playing because you don't want to
let one of your teammates down,'' Neil says. ``How can you get hurt
and miss a game when you see Mark over there busting his butt after
all those surgeries?''
</P>
<P>
   No one appreciates the effort and determination of the linemen
more than Davis. He rewarded them with Rolex watches after last
season. He's planning something special again after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have the kind of success I do without them,'' Davis
says. ``When I get the ball, I try to be patient and wait to see
where the hole is. Then, I try to burst through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have the lightest line in the NFL _ the starting
five average 287 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some systems, I'd have to play center,'' says Neil, 6-2 and
281 pounds. ``But I came to the right system to take advantage of
my size and talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The system belongs to Gibbs, who has been one of the better line
coaches in the league for years. He wants his players to rely on
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Alex is a great coach,'' head coach Mike
Shanahan says. ``He likes guys who can move. Quickness is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, his guys have to be strong enough to
pass-protect and yet have the mobility and agility to block for the
running game.''

SOME NEW YORK SCHOOLS FIGHTING NEW REGENTS EXAMS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To earn her diploma, Vanessa Gravenstine, a senior at
the Beacon School, a small alternative public school in New York
City, has been going through a process more familiar to doctoral
candidates at a university than to most teen-agers: To prove that
she met the New York state foreign-language requirement, she wrote
a play in French and presented it to a committee of teachers,
speaking French the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   To show that she is proficient in math, she will tell another
committee how she sat on a street in Manhattan and plotted the
probability that buses run in clumps rather than on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Now, schools like Beacon _ along with hundreds of private and
many traditional public schools across New York state _ are
fighting a new state decision to abolish homegrown and sometimes
idiosyncratic graduation requirements like portfolios and oral
examinations and to require every high school student in the state
take tough new Regents exams as a condition of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The state's decree has led to fierce lobbying campaigns by New
York City's top private schools, religious schools, alternative
public schools and even some affluent suburban school districts to
be exempt from the new tests.
</P>
<P>
   The school leaders _ supported in New York City by Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew _ complain that the new state requirements
will impose stifling uniformity on curriculums and teaching styles,
forcing teachers to teach to the test and students to memorize
facts and figures rather than understanding material in depth.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials fear that granting exemptions could
undermine their efforts to make sure that all schools meet the same
high standard for graduation. And they worry that any move to relax
requirements for some schools will lead to dozens more requests for
exemptions from the state tests and perhaps even to lawsuits by
parents angry that their children have to take state tests while
others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regents exams clearly represent high standards,'' Richard P.
Mills, the state education commissioner, said in an interview. ``I
don't see how taking a Regents exam or one of the fourth-grade
exams can be anything but good.''
</P>
<P>
   Regents exams, on a menu of subjects from English to physics to
Italian, have been given in New York state schools since 1865 (or
as James A. Kadamus, the state's deputy education commissioner, put
it, since the time of the Gettysburg Address). But until now only a
minimum competency test has been required for graduation. Only a
minority _ fewer than 25 percent of graduates in New York City _
have received diplomas certifying that they passed the more
difficult Regents exams.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills and the State Board of Regents, which oversees public
and private schools, say the competency tests allowed thousands of
students to graduate from high school woefully prepared for life
and work. The new exams are harder _ so much so that many educators
fear that they will lead to widespread failures and paralyze the
school system.
</P>
<P>
   The new exams are being phased in, beginning this June, when
11th-graders will be required to take the two-day, six-hour
reading, writing and listening test in English. The class of 2003
will be required to take five subject exams _ in math, science,
global studies, American history and government, and English.
</P>
<P>
   The dissident schools include a handful of affluent,
high-performing suburban school districts, including Scarsdale,
Bronxville, Mamaroneck and Chappaqua in Westchester County and
Brighton High School near Rochester, that do not award Regents
diplomas. Instead, they have relied on standardized tests like the
SAT and Advanced Placement tests, on tests written by their own
teachers and on their record of placing students in good colleges
to demonstrate their high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an anti-Regents move,'' said Sherry P. King, the
superintendent of schools in Mamaroneck. ``It is absolutely schools
in support of higher standards, and looking for multiple ways that
we might be able to demonstrate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those schools admit that they may face painfully high
failure rates, as much as 25 percent, if their students are forced
to take Regents exams, said Michael V. McGill, the superintendent
in Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the independent schools, most Jewish and Catholic
schools have administered Regents exams to their students, but they
want to keep them voluntary, said Rabbi Martin Schloss, chairman of
a state advisory committee on nonpublic education.

SHIP LATE, BUT ANDERSON READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He had grown up around greatness, and on draft day in
1994, Jamal Anderson decided it was time for his own ship to come
in.
</P>
<P>
   So, mama Zenobia hosted the first _ and likely last _
draft-watching party in Anderson family history.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal said he had heard from scouts to expect to be drafted
sometime in the first three rounds. But round two passed ...
followed by round three ... and then Mel Kiper and ESPN signed off.
And in the middle of the draft's second day, still unselected,
Jamal Anderson snuggled up to his napping mother and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, he had held his own. He had playfully kept ``Uncle
Muhammad'' from hogging all the movie popcorn, and he had
out-wrestled a house guest named Tyson for the TV remote control.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 25 years, Jamal Anderson's father, James, has
served as a sort of Security Man for the Stars. The ``Uncle'' was
the Greatest, Muhammad Ali. The TV buddy's first name was Mike.
Actor/comedian Richard Pryor let him roller skate around the house.
Disco queen Donna Summer read him bedtime stories.
</P>
<P>
   But on that draft day in 1994, Anderson was reminded that
greatness wasn't a routine phone call.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Atlanta Falcons called, 200 other players and 23
other running backs had already been picked. It was the draft's
seventh round, the final round.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Uncle Muhammad'' would remind Jamal, that didn't mean the
fight was over.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, as it turned out. On a bright morning in south
Florida, Anderson was beaming. The last shall be first. The
last-round running back rushed for 1,846 yards, and the eternally
grounded Atlanta Falcons are just hours from their first Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bad days for Jamal Anderson,'' he assessed.
``We're here, and we're the only two teams playing for the world
championship. It's the greatest athletic stage there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is good, Anderson said. If the bright lights of Super Bowl
XXXIII are bringing a lump to some Falcons' throats, he is too busy
smiling, soaking it in, to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a lot to do with your foundation,'' Anderson
explained. ``My mother and father didn't allow us to live our life
in any special way. Regardless of who was around our house, we
treated everybody the same. Sugar Ray Leonard didn't eat before
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   James Anderson had worked as a policeman in Newark, N.J., and as
a lieutenant at a Muslim mosque. The senior Anderson met Ali at a
convention, and Muhammad was struck by the resemblance to the
champ's brother. He all but gave James a lifetime security contract
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When Jamal was seven years old, the Andersons left New Jersey
for southern California, and James' security business mushroomed.
</P>
<P>
   Stars and celebrities-to-be began showing up on the Anderson
doorstep. Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown taught the
then-9-year-old Jamal to stiff-arm would-be kid tacklers. Ali made
him stand in line and buy 15 tickets for the entourage to see
``Return of the Jedi''.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal even thought about boxing _ once _ when that Tyson fellow
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of mock slap-boxing _ you know how you get with
your buddies?'' Anderson recalled. ``You duck, acting like you're a
boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal's thespian skills, as it turned out, surpassed his boxing
ones. Tyson, for some reason, suddenly swung back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had kind of a flashback,'' Anderson said, who felt
a sudden stiff breeze knock him backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, like, `Twenty-second timeout. This game is over.' ''
He hasn't tried to box since.
</P>
<P>
   It took two stops for Anderson to finish his college football
career _ ``I had too many days like Ferris Buehler,'' he explained.
Some scouts saw him as a fullback type, or as a thick-legged
one-dimensional halfback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself in a situation where you were either
unwanted or overlooked,'' Anderson said. ``So, it's a constant
motivator. Other people constantly remind you of things you aren't
supposed to do. People don't think players like myself or Terrell
Davis \Ranother late-round pick\S should be achieving these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely always prominent in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Those thick legs carried the football a record 410 times during
the regular season. The same scouts who once suggested he was
one-dimensional are now comparing Anderson to Earl Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons are to have a chance against the favored Denver
Broncos on Sunday, the ringing consensus is that Anderson has to
put on an MVP-caliber performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for us,'' said Anderson, who
doesn't shy from the notepads or minicams. ``This is the ultimate
stage. I've been a spectator for so many Super Bowls that I'm happy
to finally be a part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he was last, but on Sunday, Jamal Anderson will run for
first.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's his turn to be the star around the house.

MAVS, NELSON SAY THEY CAN BE CONTENDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Forward Cedric Ceballos submitted Wednesday that the
Mavericks have the makings of a playoff team. The re-signing of
Ceballos and the acquisition of forward Gary Trent and center John
``Hot Rod'' Williams also have generated playoff talk in and around
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The closest coach Don Nelson came to predicting a playoff
journey for the Mavericks this season was after practice yesterday
when he broke down the playoff situation in the NBA's Western
Conference by groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson put Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston, Seattle and
San Antonio in the top tier in the West and lumped Portland and
Phoenix in the middle group. Then he casually mentioned that the
Mavericks should battle Minnesota for the eighth and final playoff
spot, with the addition of Chris Webber and Vlade Divac giving
Sacramento an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at those other bottom dwellers, and Minnesota made
the playoffs the last two years,'' Nelson said. ``We should be able
to compete with those guys, and make a run at \Rthe playoffs\S
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're not a playoff team; I'm saying I don't
know. We're still young, we haven't played together, and we're
going to have a hard start. There's a lot of questions we haven't
answered yet. But we're very confident. I love our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent time the Mavericks reached the playoffs was 1990
when they finished 47-35 and were swept by Portland in three games
in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA's shortened season opens Feb. 5, Nelson likely will
start Michael Finley at shooting guard, Steve Nash at point guard,
Dirk Nowitzki at small forward, Samaki Walker at power forward, and
Williams at center. That leaves a second unit of Robert Pack and
Hubert Davis in the backcourt, Ceballos and Trent at forwards, and
Shawn Bradley in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even take into consideration A.C. Green, Erick
Strickland, Chris Anstey and rookie Greg Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a situation where our second team will be better
than our first one,'' Nelson admitted. ``We may have one of those
kind of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Williams, Trent and Ceballos in the past week
give the Mavericks playoff-caliber depth. Williams is a solid
rebounder and defender, and Ceballos is a proven scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Trent is a powerful rebounder and swift enough to drive to the
basket or shoot over the sleek small forwards on the perimeter. But
even Trent, who played on a playoff team in Portland, hesitates to
link the Mavericks and playoffs in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential to go to the playoffs, but it depends on
our chemistry and how we play together and how we gel as a unit,''
Trent said. ``We have to understand each other and get a feel for
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Michael Finley said he knows why Nelson isn't flat-out
saying the Mavericks are a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're young, and youth is usually that factor that
either makes or breaks you,'' Finley said. ``Hopefully it can be
something we don't use as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a deep team, and depth goes a long way in this league.
Hopefully we can gel together and put some victories together and
be a team that earns some respect.'' REEVES IN LIMBO Guard Khalid
Reeves remains in limbo, because Don Nelson said he has been unable
to find a team to trade him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offers; nothing,'' Nelson said. ``He's an NBA player ...
but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nelson said Reeves' playing time would be drastically
reduced if he remained with the team, so he would do him a favor
and trade him just for a draft choice or a small amount of money.

</P>
<P>
   ``We're a deep team, and depth goes a long way in this league.
Hopefully we can gel together and put some victories together and
be a team that earns some respect.'' REEVES IN LIMBO Guard Khalid
Reeves remains in limbo, because Don Nelson said he has been unable
to find a team to trade him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``No offers; nothing,'' Nelson said. ``He's an NBA player ...
but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nelson said Reeves' playing time would be drastically
reduced if he remained with the team, so he would do him a favor
and trade him just for a draft choice or a small amount of money.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bob Gainey might not be ready to order, but
he'll at least take a look at the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Monday, the Stars general manager will get a
first-hand view of two of the players who are expected to be
auctioned off to the highest bidder before the March 23 trade
deadline _ left winger Wendel Clark of the Tampa Bay Lightning and
right winger Theo Fleury of the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Stars president Jim Lites has acknowledged a need to add another
goal scorer, preferably one who can play left wing. Although Gainey
said he is not actively seeking a trade for any player but is
staying abreast of all trade talk, much of it centering on Fleury
and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the NHL, there always has been and there always will be
ongoing discussion on players and where they might or might not
fit,'' Gainey said. ``As a group, we try to be aware of all of
those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean face-to-face meetings with Lightning GM Jacques
Demers today and Flames GM Al Coates on Monday, but Gainey wouldn't
confirm that he would be talking to anyone within the next few
days. Gainey declined to speak to specifics concerning the interest
the Stars might have in any player, including Clark and Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   However, team president Jim Lites said fans shouldn't expect
Gainey to pull the trigger on any deal soon, especially if it
concerns a request for any of the Stars' younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very good team, and we have the ability to be a very
good team for years to come as long as we don't do something
stupid,'' Lites said. ``We're not going to mortgage the future to
take a chance on a player who might not even be here next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The caveat on the three major players available to the Stars is
that all three have contracts that expire at the end of the season.
Fleury and Mark Recchi of the Montreal Canadiens will be
unrestricted free agents, and Clark has an option year remaining on
his contract that would likely allow him to become a free agent
this summer. That could mean the Stars would trade a top prospect
and then risk losing the player they acquired.
</P>
<P>
   That's the main reason all three players are available. Fleury,
30, is a gritty, goal-scoring right winger who has said he will
test the free-agent market this summer even if traded before then.
Fleury, who is under contract for $2.4 million this season, is
expected to command between $5 million to $6 million on the open
market. The Flames can't pay that and likely will trade him rather
than lose him without getting anything in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens are faced with the same problem concerning Recchi,
30. The left-handed-shooting right winger, who played junior hockey
for Stars coach Ken Hitchcock in Kamloops, British Columbia, is
under contract for $4.5 million. If the Canadiens are in jeopardy
of missing the playoffs, they'll likely deal him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clark, he is a bargain at $1.4 million this season.
However, the Lightning are trying to build with youth and are
expected to ask for a strong prospect in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendel has raised the price all by himself,'' Demers told the
Tampa Tribune of Clark's 19-goal season. ``We won't just be giving
Wendel Clark away, you can bet on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might have the deepest group of prospects in the
league with defenseman Richard Jackman, winger Jason Botterill and
goalie Roman Turek among players the league GMs covet. Do not
expect Gainey to even consider dealing such players as Jamie
Langenbrunner or Richard Matvichuk, no matter how many GMs inquire.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars believe that if no trade can be made, Langenbrunner
playing out of position still is a solid left winger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are somewhat lopsided, but we still have talented players
playing the left side,'' Lites said. ``We've already given up Todd
Harvey and Jarome Iginla to improve the team, and that's already
eaten into the depth of our young players. We don't want to win the
\RStanley\S Cup and then be horrible in five or six years.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do want to win the Cup, and that could mean keeping
track of every trade scenario right up to the trade deadline _
although Gainey said he can't worry himself with what other teams
are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend your time trying to derail other teams, I don't
think you have your focus in the right area,'' Gainey said. ``If we
can make a move to improve our own roster, we'll look into it, but
not to take something from someone else.''
