<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Anti-aids campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made all-out efforts to
fight and prevent the spread of aids, the most deadly disease of the
century, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,200 HIV/AIDS cases have been detected in 40 of the
country's 53 cities and provinces by august 24. among them, 353
are aids victims with 184 have died.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city has 1,550 HIV carriers and 200 aids sufferers,
the highest number of the disease-infected victims followed by
Khanh Hoa with 350 victims. 25 persons have been found to be HIV
positive in Hanoi, where three have reportedly died of the Deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
The government has been launching various awareness campaigns
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Information on safe sex and HIV/AIDS prevention is broadcast
through mass media, sometimes through movies, art performances,
cultural activities and the family-planning program.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 billion VND (about 2.7 million U.S.dollars) has been
invested in blood test kits for 162 district-level and provincial
hospitals and other devices to test and detect HIV, the virus that
causes aids, for medical centers in 20 provinces and cities this
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a project to control and take care of HIV/AIDS
patients on a community basis, and to provide relevant consultancy
services is being carried out by the ministry of public health in
Ho Chi Minh city, and the southern provinces of Khanh Hoa and An
Giang.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the project is confronted with big
challenges, as only 50 per cent of all HIV/AIDS victims are cared
for and put under close watch in Ho Chi Minh city, a pioneer in
vietnam's current efforts to combat the disease, due to many
patients trying to keep their names and addresses secret when
they are blood-tested.

<HEADLINE> World's Leading Insulin and Enzymes Producer Keen on China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Novo Nordisk A/S,
one of the world's leading producers of insulin and industrial
enzymes, intends to increase its investment in China, in order to
occupy nearly half of the enzyme market share in China.
</P>
<P>
Mads Ovlisen, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk, revealed the
company's investment strategy in China today at a ceremony to mark
the beginning of construction of the company's China headquarters
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters, valued at 10 million US dollars, will also
serve as a research and development center, and is slated to open
in 1997. It is expected to bring together Chinese and foreign
researchers who will conduct research in Novo Nordisk's major
areas -- biological pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes -- to
benefit Chinese industry, consumers and patients, Ovlisen said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, nearly all insulin imported by China, which is used
by diabetics, is produced by Novo Nordisk, Ovlisen added.
</P>
<P>
Novo Nordisk has set up three solely-owned enterprises, as well
as two joint ventures in China, bringing its total investment in
the country to nearly 300 million US dollars, Ovlisen said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, 200 million US dollars will go to
construction of an enzyme production base in Tianjin in north
China, which is expected to be completed in 1998. By then, the
base will help China to become Novo Nordisk's third global enzyme
production base, after Denmark and the United States, that covers
business in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
And it plans to invest an additional 60 million US dollars to
set up a pharmaceutical production base in Tianjin at the start of
the next century.
</P>
<P>
It will provide pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and
technology to China, and is expected to strengthen cooperation
with China for its treatment of diabetes and epilepsy, and for
women's healthcare.
</P>
<P>
A number of high-ranking Chinese officials and the Danish
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Niels Helveg Petersen, attended the
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Rise 0.5 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain
increased by 0.5 percent last month, traditionally one of the
quietest months in the property market, giving further evidence of
a stable UK housing recovery, according to a survey published
today by the Halifax Building Society.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, says that house
prices in August were 5.7 percent higher than a year ago, up from
5.3 percent in July and also the highest year-on-year increase
since October 1989.
</P>
<P>
A typical home last month cost a little over 64,500 pounds
(99,975 US dollars), 3,500 pounds (5425 US dollars) more than in
August last year, the Halifax says.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Halifax says that house prices were now 5.6 percent
above their trough at the beginning of 1993, but still 8.1 percent
below the peak of 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The further small rise this month confirms our view that house
prices are now steadily recovering," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, in common with many other mortgage lenders, it is not
revising its prediction that house prices will rise by five
percent this year since evidence suggests that the recovery is
still very patchy, with some regions seeing little evidence of
improvement.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: HK's Economy Fosters Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is
fostering bright prospects despite the fact that its economic
growth rate has slowed down in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the August update of the economic forecasts for
1996 recently issued by the Hong Kong government, the overall
gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow by 4.7 percent in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the figure is below the growth rate of 5
percent forecast earlier, but it does not mean a beginning of a
new recession.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the slowing pace in Hong Kong economic growth
has nothing to do with the potential of the territory's economy on
the whole, which is expected to be further boosted in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
According to their analysis, the slow pace of Hong Kong's
economic growth resulted from the effects of the slowdown in its
external trade in the first half of 1996, which was more abrupt
than initially expected and led directly to weaker overall
economic growth in the period.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, Hong Kong's total export
growth fell to 4.4 percent, down from the 18.2 percent growth
registered in the same period in 1995, while total imports growth
also fell to 3.1 percent from 15 percent of the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hong Kong's GDP growth rate touched a low of 3.1
percent in the first quarter before it rebounded in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the downward trend in Hong Kong's external trade growth,
economists of the Standard Chartered Bank pointed out that the
slowdown of the economic growth is the result of Hong Kong moving
further towards services-based economy.
</P>
<P>
They said that it reflects the increase in manufacturing and
cargo handling capabilities of the Chinese mainland, which makes
it unnecessary for such cargo to go through any further processing
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
An expert of Salomon Brothers, one of the world's leading
investment banks, said that due to a slowdown in intra-regional
trade in Asia, a slowdown in exports has been recorded in many
economies including Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and
Singapore in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Freris, Salomon's chief regional economist, said that
the current decline in export growth in the Asian economies
reflects a series of cyclical developments and there is no
evidence of common trends pointing to a long-term loss of external
competitiveness in the economies.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the latest report from the Census and Statistics
Department shows that by the end of July, the value of Hong Kong's
total export growth picked up by 4.9 percent over the same period
of last year, rising a 0.5 percentage point over the June's
figure.
</P>
<P>
As far as other sectors are concerned, the cyclical
developments are becoming increasingly favorable.
</P>
<P>
The property market, one of the pillar sectors in Hong Kong's
economy, is on recovery. A total of 67,445 sale and purchases
agreements of building units were lodged in Hong Kong in the first
six months this year, representing increases of 43.5 percent and
36 percent respectively over the figures recorded in the second
half of 1995 and the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of the considerations involved in the sales
and purchases, amounting to 185.42 billion HK dollars (23.92
billion US dollars), indicated increases when compared with the
first as well as second half year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales are on rise while inflation declines. Retail sales
from January to June this year rose 5 percent in value and 0.4
percent in volume over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price
index (CPI A), rose by an average of 6.5 percent in the first half
of this year, which was significantly slower than the increases of
9.3 percent in the first half and 8.1 in the second half of last
year.
</P>
<P>
As for the labor sector, labor market conditions continued to
improve in recent months. The seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate edged lower to 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 1996 and
2.9 percent in the three months ending July, from 3.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1995 and 3.2 percent in the first quarter of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the local stock market had turned more active since
the beginning of 1996, with daily turnover in the first half of
1996 averaged at 5 billion HK dollars (645.16 million US dollars),
52 percent higher than that in 1995. The Hang Seng Index closed by
the end of June at 11,020, 947 points or 9.4 percent higher than
at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Hong Kong's financial sector was stable. In
the first half of this year, most of the banks listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange achieved a 25 percent increase in their
profits, which is higher than the forecast.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the total assets
of exchange fund stood at 485 billion HK dollars (62.5 billion US
dollars) by July, an increase of 5.3 percent over the amount by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong still provides a competitive advantage to overseas
firms which are on steady increase. The number of newly-opened
overseas firms increased by 12 percent to 324 in the first half of
this year over a year ago. The total number of overseas-funded
enterprises now exceeds 4,500.
</P>
<P>
Based on the positive factors, economists held that there is no
need to worry about the slowdown in Hong Kong's current economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Hong Kong's GDP is expected to pick up
further in the coming months and Hong Kong's economy is fostering
bright prospects in the future.

its own interest.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civil Servants Strike Costly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's business sector is
losing dearly as a result of the civil servants' strike which has
cost the government up to 100 million U.S. Dollars in revenue,
the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants started an indefinite strike two weeks ago
demanding salary increases of up to 60 percent, paralyzing
government services.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC President Danny Meyer said it was difficult to estimate
the cost to the commercial sector in monetary terms as it would
be a mammoth exercise.
</P>
<P>
He added foreign buyers could be discouraged from doing
business with Zimbabwe because of the strike and there is the
danger of losing out to other foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
''The situation is now critical and needs to be resolved
urgently,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Says Rebels Control 90 Percent of Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels control 90 percent
of the Caucasian republic at present, says Russian security chief
Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, Secretary of the Russian Federal Security Council, told
a press conference that rebel chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov had
complete control of 60 percent of the region of Chechnya, and
partial control of 30 percent. Only 10 percent of the area was out
of his control.
</P>
<P>
The retired paratroop general corrected previous official
figures on casualties in the nearly 21-month Chechen conflict.
The death toll was around 80,000 and the wounded were three times
as numerous.
</P>
<P>
Earlier official releases put the death toll at around 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who negotiated a peace plan with Maskhadov on Saturday,
warned that the accord was only the first step and "there is still
a potential for confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The deal reached by Lebed and Maskhadov, which received the
support of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin on Tuesday, defers
the thorny question of Chechen independence by five years and
allows the Chechens to decide their own future "according to
accepted international norms."
</P>
<P>
Lebed said the deal opened a new phase for settling the Chechen
conflict and laid the legal basis for future coordination between
the Russian government and the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
He added that he and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin jointly bore
the main responsibility for restoring peace in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen representative, appointed by President Boris
Yeltsin, stressed that he was acting in line with presidential
orders on the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said the exchange of war prisoners in the conflict would
soon begin.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has a remarkable
consensus across the political spectrum on all vital national
issues, President Farooq Leghari said here today.
</P>
<P>
Leghari made the remarks while meeting with a visiting
Australian delegation led by Nick Minchin, parliamentary secretary
to the Australian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that all major political parties in Pakistan have
consensus on major economic policies of the country and security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
He said that upon his election as president of Pakistan, he
resigned from his party though there was no constitutional
obligation to do so.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to send a signal that the presidency is for the whole
of Pakistan and not for any particular political party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari noted that Pakistan has a very strong democratic
tradition and the country actually came into existence as a result
of a mass movement in the sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
On economic cooperation between Pakistan and Australia, Leghari
said that Australian companies and entrepreneurs have great
expertise in several sectors like energy and communications.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there would be enhanced trade and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Minchin said at the meeting that Australian businessmen are
interested in setting up joint ventures with Pakistani partners.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the two countries could enter into join
venture relationship in several areas.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets New Zealanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, met in Beijing
today with Richard Nottage, secretary general of the Ministry of
Foregin Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, and his party, to
present the timetable for the establishment of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He said that as there are 301 days until the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland, the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
SAR is busy working to meet deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The timetable is roughly as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- On Sept. 15, the application for taking part in the
Selection Committee will be finished;
</P>
<P>
-- By November, the Selection Committee will be formed;
</P>
<P>
-- Before the end of this year, the Chief Executive of the
government of the Hong Kong SAR will be chosen and its leading
body designated and the provisional legislature formed;
</P>
<P>
-- In 1998, the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR
will be established.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that he has full confidence in the work of the
Preparatory Committee, believing that Selection Committee's choice
for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, with assistance from
the Hong Kong people and members of the Preparatory Committee,
will be acceptable to all sides in Hong Kong,
</P>
<P>
He said he was optimistic about Hong Kong's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has abundant foreign exchange reserves totalling 60
billion U.S. dollars, and has implemented a policy of free trade,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Countries that pour capital into Hong Kong will face equal
competition, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong's legal system is sound: foreign
investors clearly know what they are able to do and what they are
not, he said.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, "we will carry out the principle of 'one country,
two systems' toward Hong Kong," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's existing system will remain unchanged, and the
policy of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" will be
implemented, except in regard to foreign and defense affairs,
which come under the jurisdiction of the central government.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong is currently a member of the World Trade
Organization, and that after 1997, Hong Kong will still be a WTO
member, but officially listed as a separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
"Entrepreneurs are welcome to invest in Hong Kong. We hope that
the governments of China and New Zealand will further cooperate on
the question of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nottage said New Zealand has a close relationship with Hong
Kong, which is New Zealand's sixth largest export market. About
3,000 New Zealanders now live in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely wish China success in the recovery of Hong Kong,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> IFOR: Serbs Suspects in House Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Six Muslim houses have been
blown up in the past two days in the Brcko area of Sarajevo and
Serbs are suspected as culprits, says the NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The explosions, on Sunday night and early Monday morning,
destroyed or damaged the houses, IFOR spokesman Lt. Colonel Max
Marriner said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday morning, an IFOR patrol found an explosive
device attached to a foot bridge south of Brcko and later defused
it.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the destruction of the houses and the device
on the foot bridge are all related...(it is) symptomatic of Serb
intimidation of Muslims who are trying to resettle and rebuild in
the Brcko area," Marrriner said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for United Nations-led
international police, said local authorities were investigating
those incidents which represented a "very worrying trend".
</P>
<P>
"The area can only be described as far from calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reported
that it had to evacuate 31 Muslims from Banja Luka who were
evicted from their homes two months ago.
</P>
<P>
They were driven out of their homes by displaced Serbs who were
angry at the return of a Muslim refugee to Banja luka from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Chris Janowski said Serb authorities had
promised to put the evicted Muslims back in their homes, but no
action ensued.

<HEADLINE> France Keeps Distance with U.S. over Raid on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- France has kept a clear distance
with the United States after the latter launched a cruise missile
raid on Iraq. But Paris refrained from criticizing the action as
Moscow has done.
</P>
<P>
French foreign minister Herve de Charette reaffirmed this
afternoon France's "attachment" to "the territorial integrity of
Iraq," and called for a rapid application of the U.N. Oil for Food
plan with Iraq, to which France has greatly contributed.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted a French official source as saying
that Paris "understood" that the U.S. raid "is limited to a coup
of scolding" and will not develop into repeated interventions.
</P>
<P>
While expressing its worry over the situation in Iraq, the
French foreign ministry said earlier today that Iraq did not
violate U.N. resolutions by launching a military operation in the
Kurdish area in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This stand taken by France contrasts sharply with other major
Western allies of the United States, who have unanimously
expressed support to the raid.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted a French diplomatic source as
saying that while still regarding Washington as its ally, France
considers today's missile attack as "an American operation."
</P>
<P>
"It is far from the situation of the Gulf War and even far from
the situation when Saddam Hussein bombarded Kurds in the north
after the war, because it is inter-Kurdish fightings which we have
never messed with," said the source.
</P>
<P>
France maintains 130 soldiers, six Mirage 2,000 fighters and
one C-135 supply plane in a military base of Western allies in
Saudi Arabia, and has 120 soldiers, five Jaguar combat aircraft
and one C-135 supply aircraft in southern Turkey to guard the
No-Fly Zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to his Iraqi counterpart Tarik Aziz Monday,
French foreign minister de Charette asked Baghdad to start talks
with anti-government Kurdish forces, which Paris said is the best
way to bring back stability and peace to northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France has always competed with the United States in the Middle
East as a mediator, including during the Israeli-Lebanese conflict
in April and in the present deadlock of peace talks between Israel
and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
France supported Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s and
has urged a softening of U.N. sanctions against Baghdad.

UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today expressed the hope that tensions in
Iraq would quickly subside so that the United Nations could get on
with the work of alleviating the suffering of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said in a statement that the secretary-general
was concerned over the impact of the latest events which clearly
would adversely affect the implementation of the U.N. programs for
humanitarian assistance.

Iraqi troops entered Arbil, a Kurdish enclave in the north, in
support of the forces from the Kurdistan Democratic Party against
its rival faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan favored by
Iran.

dollars in six months for import of urgently needed food, medicine
and other necessities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fires Missiles at Iraqi Installations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today
that the United States fired 27 unmanned missiles from bombers and
warships against "selected air defense targets in Iraq".
</P>
<P>
The orders came from President Bill Clinton and were in
retaliation for Iraqi troops crossing into the "no fly" zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said 13 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired
by the U.S. Navy cruiser Shiloh and the destroyer Laboon, in the
Gulf, and another 14 AGM-86 air-to-ground missiles were fired from
B-52 bombers off Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The results of the attack were not immediately known. The
officials said further strikes would depend upon damage
assessments and whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would ease
his attacks on the Kurds in the safe haven, north of the 36th
parallel. The haven was imposed by the U.S.-led allies to prevent
Iraqi troops entering the area where the Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
The officials said no U.S. missiles were fired at military
targets in and around Baghdad, but reports said air raid sirens
were blasted there.
</P>
<P>
At a White House news conference, Clinton said he ordered the
cruise missile attacks against Iraqi air defense installations to
send a blunt message to Saddam that he must a pay price for his
military action in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives are limited but clear: to make Saddam pay a
price for the latest act of brutality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops captured Irbil, a Kurdish city close to the 36th
parallel, over the weekend. Soon after it announced it was pulling
out of the city.
</P>
<P>
Reports said it had nearly completed the withdrawal and left
the city in the hands of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which had
requested Saddam's help in driving out the allegedly Iran-backed
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan last week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that he received somewhat lukewarm support
from U.S. allies. But, he said: "I think it is important to move
now."
</P>
<P>
Observers said that with Saddam's challenge to his foreign
policy in the Middle East just weeks before the November
presidential election, Clinton had no choice but to make a tough
response.
</P>
<P>
And his retaliation using cruise missiles on Iraq could go
down well with voters -- if there are no U.S. casualties.

OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious and deadly illness
has claimed the lives of at least eight young, southeast Asian
male immigrants in the Canadian city of Toronto since 1992.

<P>
The illness usually stroke at night when these people slept,
the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported today.

The death is quite similar to sudden infant death syndrome, the

<P>
At present, doctors still don't know how these deaths happened
and have no idea how to prevent them, Cairns said.
</P>
<P>
And there's no way to screen people for susceptibility to the
disease, Cairns added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes U.S. Strike Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government says it
it is opposed to the U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official government statement on Tuesday said: "The
government of Russia considers the American military operation an
unacceptable reaction to the latest events in northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Russia insists on the halt of all military actions in Iraq
threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that
country."
</P>
<P>
The statement called for efforts to ease tensions in the region
through political means, saying that Russia would promote the
process in the most positive way.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said the
U.S. missile raids on what the United States said were military
targets in southern Iraq could send events in the region "out of
control."
</P>
<P>
"Developments in the Gulf region are taking an extremely
dangerous course," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the unnamed
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile raids, which lasted about 45 minutes, took
place in broad daylight, a few minutes after air raid sirens were
heard over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said up to 27 cruise missiles were launched.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, the Pentagon said, were launched from Navy ships
and at least one Air Force B-52 bomber, a type which was used to
launch similar missiles at the start of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Their "selected" targets were Iraq's defense installations,
including surface-to-air missile launch sites, radar installations
and air defense control towers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan police today took
a series of measures to prevent the re-entry of thousands of
illegal foreign businessmen who had been expelled last month.
</P>
<P>
Garcia Miala, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, told
parliament here today that the the measures included changing the
ID cards of the foreign immigrants, tightening visa issuing
procedures and intensifying customs checking.
</P>
<P>
Miala said each expelled foreigner had been photoed from
various angels by the police. The photos, together with their
personal profiles, have been sent to all of Angola's embassies
overseas which had been instructed to stop issuing visas to the
expelled foreigners.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign named "Cancer II" in August, the police arrested
a total of 2,204 foreigners, accusing them of conducting
unauthorized, illegal business transactions.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 U.S. Dollars and 5 billion Kwanza (one US Dollar
equals to 200,000 Kwanza) confiscated by the police has been
deposited in the national bank.

PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- France, one of the three Western
countries who founded the exclusion zones in Iraq in 1992, today
refused to comment on the decision by the United States and
Britain to extend the exclusion zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I have no information on this subject," said French foreign
minister Herve de Charette when asked about the decision,
announced this morning by British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo.
</P>
<P>
"I assure you the attachment of France to the territorial
integrity of Iraq," said de Charette who met the press after a
meeting with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that he has nothing to comment on the U.S.
raid on Iraq this morning.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the exclusion zone, set up by the United
States, France and Britain in 1992 to protect Iraqi Shi'ite
Muslims, would push the exclusion line to 50 kilometers from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Iraq worries us. We have followed with a lot
of attention the latest clashes between the two Kurdish
movements... as well as the initiative taken by the Iraqi army,"
said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
He also said that no one should block the application of the
U.N. Security Council resolution 986, also called Oil for Food
plan, to let Iraq sell part of its oil to buy food.
</P>
<P>
U.S. president Bill Clinton said today that Iraq cannot sell
its oil for food as long as humanitarian aid does not reach the
Kurdish area in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali suspended the
application of the plan Sunday, after Iraqi troops attacked
Kurdish forces in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Syrian foreign minister al-Shara said that Syria
opposes the idea of setting up exclusion zones in Iraq and opposes
the partition of any Arab country.

<HEADLINE> Geneva Conference Disagrees on Future Disarmament Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The 61 members of the
Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament failed to agreed on future
disarmament agenda after an unsuccessful conclusion of talks on a
global nuclear test ban treaty, diplomats here said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary of the Conference, the sole multilateral
disarmament negotiating forum, Algerian Ambassador Hocine
Meghlaoui said the climate at the disarmament Conference was
"lacking in serenity" following the nuclear test ban talks.
</P>
<P>
Meghlaoui, who is also Special Coordinator charged with
conducting consultations with member states on the future agenda
of the disarmament forum, said that such a situation at the
Conference made the review of agenda more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The issue of nuclear disarmament was at the centre of concerns
of many delegations, he said, adding however that the gaps between
the priorities of different groups remained quite large.
</P>
<P>
One issue that polarized the Conference was the opening of
negotiations on a convention to ban the production of fissile
materials for the building of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to Meghlaoui, no delegation objected to such a
convention, but difficulties persisted, and such difficulties had
been aggravated by the outcome of the test ban talks.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the disarmament Conference, whose 1996
session will end on September 13, could restart its work at the
outset of its 1997 session in January with the opening of
negotiations on a convention on land mines.
</P>
<P>
He believed that land mine negotiations might allow the
Conference to restore its somewhat tarnished reputation, permit
negotiations on the agenda to continue and "make the temperature
drop".
</P>
<P>
The credibility of the Conference on Disarmament has been
widely questioned since it failed last month to reach consensus
necessary to transfer a draft nuclear test ban treaty to the UN
General Assembly for approval. The transfer was blocked by a
single veto from India.

<HEADLINE> Perry: US Attacks on Iraq for US Interests, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry defended U.S. missile attack against Iraq earlier
today as for U.S. national interests and the region's security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"We have acted on what we thought were our most important
national interests," Perry said at a special Defense Department
briefing this morning after the United States launched 27 cruise
missiles against military targets in southern Iraq from two Air
Force B-52 bombers and two Navy ships in the Gulf overnight.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military action followed the reported withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from Irbil, a city in a region under United Nations
protection since the end of 1990-91 Gulf War. The Iraqi troops
had moved to the city a few days earlier to support one Kurdish
factions against others.
</P>
<P>
"Our national interests are not tied to which party prevails
in this conflict in Northern Iraq, but we do have vital
national security interests in maintaining security and
stability in the region," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the vital interests include "protection of
friendly nations including Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
and other Gulf States."
</P>
<P>
They also include "protection of the flow of oil," said the
U.S. Defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Without a military response, Saddam Hussein's position in the
country and the region would be strengthened, and vital interests
to the United States could be threatened," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered
a cruise missile strike against Iraqi military targets. In 1993,
Clinton ordered U.S. warship to fire 24 Tomahawk cruise missiles
at intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in retaliation for an
alleged assassination plot against former President Bush.

<HEADLINE> Desertification Convention Nears Entry into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- With the Convention to
Combat Desertification expected to enter into force in a few
months, officials from 100 governments are meeting here today at
U.N. headquarters to launch a two-week negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
The ninth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee will address a series of practical issues vital to the
global battle against drylands degradation.
</P>
<P>
These issues need to be settled so that the Conference of the
Parties (COP) can start to oversee the Convention's
implementation, probably late in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eleven more ratifications are needed to meet the threshold of
50, which starts the three-month period for entry into force,
after which parties will be legally obligated to start carrying
out their commitments.
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues to be debated in the U.N. headquarters
is the Global Mechanism. The delegates must draft recommendations
regarding the exact functions and operations of the Global
Mechanism; this Mechanism will support the Convention's
implementation by promoting actions that help mobilize and channel
substantial financial resources to affected developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegates must also formulate a series of recommendations
to the COP on the Convention's financial rules, program, and
budget.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Govt Condemns Rebel Attacks Amid Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's new
government today sent a "strong message" to the rebels over their
attacks in the south and east of the country last week which
killed over 100 civilians.
</P>
<P>
"We would not compromise on security of civilian lives and
this has been communicated to the Sankoh's rebels," said the
Presidential Special Adviser on Peace, Sheka Mansarayin,
referring to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday
Sankoh, who is at present in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said peace talks are still going on.
</P>
<P>
"The peace negotiations are still on track despite the
regrettable ceasefire violations by the rebels," said Mansarayin.
</P>
<P>
He explained the RUF has not changed its position for the
withdrawal of foreign troops, especially the South African
mercenary group sent by a Johannesburg company.
</P>
<P>
"But behind the scenes, negotiations were continuing to bridge
the gap to reach peace," he said, disclosing that President
Kabbah "has a special telephone hotline" connected with Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Sierra Leone's military authorities said the
strategic highway linking the capital Freetown to the country's
second largest city of Bo is at present "safe for traffic".
</P>
<P>
The road, which had long been the scene of rebels' renewed
attackes and ambushes, was closed by the military last week.
</P>
<P>
And reports from Bo said the first vehicle to make the journey
from Freetown was a state-owned corporation bus with 40
passengers and they reported no hitch on the way.
</P>
<P>
Last week, over 200 civilians were reportedly abducted by the
rebels during a series of ceasefire violations.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces Moves Military Center to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish National Defense
Minister Turhan Tayan confirmed here today that the military
coordination center of the U.S.-led Allied Forces in northern
Iraq had moved to southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tayan said: "Presumably, a displacement has been made as a
precaution after today's developments (in Iraq)."
</P>
<P>
Tayan made the remarks after attending Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan's meeting with visiting Kazakhstan Defense
Minister Alibek Kasimove.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey had expressed its hope that the military
center of the allied forces in Zaho, northern Iraq, should
be transferred to Silopi town of Sirnak province bordering Iraq
where the allied forces stayed during the Gulf War in 1991
to drive out Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration ordered U.S. forces to launch a
cruise missile attack this morning on "selected air defense targets"
in southern Iraq in response to Iraqi army's weekend strike at the
Kurdish "safe haven" established by U.S.-led forces after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Tayan added that Turkey is following closely with the situation
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said that nine armored
vehicles carrying personnel of the allied forces in Zaho had
moved to the second Tactic Air Force Commandership in
Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, after they arrived at Silopi this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The coordination center oversees the work of private aid
agencies in northern Iraq. It also monitored the needs of Iraqi
Kurds, who set up a "semi-autonomous state" following the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The move was reportedly to be a result of the Kurdish Democratic
Party's cooperation with Baghdad against the rival Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan.

CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri will head a delegation to attend the first meeting of
the Egyptian-Chinese Higher Committee to be held in Beijing in
October.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be co-chaired by the two countries' premiers,
will discuss means of removing obstacles hindering the development
of bilateral trade, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency said
today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss a proposed barter deal and
cooperation in establishing an industrial zone in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, el-Ganzouri is expected to open the first
exhibition on Egyptian products in China.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition scheduled for October 25-31 is aimed at
increasing Egypt's exports to China.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian official statistics, Egypt imports about
450 million U.S. dollars worth of goods from China each year,
while its annual volume of exports to the Asian country is only
some 13 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been hoping to reduce its trade deficit with China
through opening the Chinese market for more Egyptian products.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price to Go Upward if US Attacks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices in the world
market are expected to go upward if the U.S. strike at Iraqi
military targets in southern Iraq continues, Kuwaiti Oil Minister
Abdul Mohsen Madajoil predicted today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, the Kuwaiti oil minister said
that if the striking continues and the state of instability
remains, the oil prices will increase by a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military forces launched early this morning 27 missiles
from B-52 bombers and a warship in the Gulf region against Iraqi
air-defense systems in the south and military commands near the
Iraqi capital Baghdad in the wake of Iraqi military attacks on its
northern Kurdish area, which was demarcated as "safe haven" for
the Kurdish people by the United Nations following the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti oil minister said that the decision adopted by the
latest OPEC meeting held last June in Vienna which maintained the
production ceiling by adding 800,000 barrels of Iraqi oil in line
with the oil-for-food deal was a clear-sighted strategy as oil
prices continued its upswing despite widely-prospected decline.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC is still performing a major role in maintaining prices
despite excessive oil production and export by some of its member
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices have remained at around 18 U.S. Dollars
per barrel since 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf region boasts of more than half of the proven world
oil reserves so far and the situation of the region would have
great impact on the world oil prices, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The current developments caused by the U.S. attacks on Iraq
have been closely watched by the states in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Manufacturing Speeds Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. manufacturing growth
accelerated in August, the third consecutive month of growing, and
it was the latest suggestion of broad strength in the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index rose
to 52.6 percent in August from 50.2 percent in July, according to
a report released today by the association. A reading above 50
percent is a sign of an expanding industrial economy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the growth in manufacturing was fueled by
strength in factory production, new orders and new export orders.
The report was based on survey responses by purchasing executives
at more than 300 major industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
The private industry group also reported that the overall
economy grew for the seventh month in a row since last January.
</P>
<P>
In a positive sign for the nation's inflation outlook, prices
paid by factories for raw materials fell for a third month in a
row.
</P>
<P>
Stock and bond prices pared early losses after the survey was
released. Investors had been concerned that the report would show
an unexpected surge in the manufacturing sector, indicating that
the economy is growing at a pace likely to aggravate inflation
pressures. But the figures were in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
The survey is one of the first economic indicators from August,
and the figures are watched closely on Wall Street because they
are more current than most government and private reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are determined to end
the perennial cycle of derailed peace plans for Liberia, Nigerian
Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi said today.
</P>
<P>
Advising parties to the Liberian crisis against testing this
resolve, Ikimi reminded them of the sanctions agreed upon at the
August meeting of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, against those who obstruct the
implementation of the Abuja peace plan for the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
At the swearing-in of Ruth Perry as the Chairperson of the
six-member Liberia Council of State in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, the minister reviewed the various unsuccessful attempts
by the ECOWAS leaders to restore peace to liberia which were
frustrated by factional leaders.
</P>
<P>
While calling on all Liberians to support the new chairperson,
who was appointed at the Abuja meeting last month, Ikimi urged
Ruth Perry to be ''neutral, dispassionate, evenhanded and
fairminded in all dealings with colleagues and the liberian
people'' so as to ensure the faithful implementation of the Abuja
agreement, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for the establishment of an
independent electoral commission to ensure that elections in the
country would enjoy the support, confidence and endorsement of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Perry, a former senator of the Republic of Liberia, is
the country's first woman head of state and chairperson of the
ruling Council of State, who takes the gavel of authority today.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns USA for Attacking Iraqi Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
 Rafsanjani today condemned the United States for attacking Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
He said:"we are closely following the situation and believe
that the U.S. attack and events preceding it as well as the
policy of the Iraqi government are not justified."
</P>
<P>
"The (Iraqi) people are being sacrificed and a mishap will
trample international laws," said the Iranian president during his
visit to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
American warships and B-52 bombers fired a total of 27 cruise
missiles against the military targets in southern Iraq early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old president was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying "it seems the election issues in America
are meant to determine the fate of the rest of the world people."
</P>
<P>
"The ignorance of the Iraqi government and erratic policies of
the Baathist Party have also provided an excuse for the
Americans," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani noted in this regard that Robert Dole, the
Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, has accused
President Bill Clinton of being unable to guarantee security in
northeastern Iraq, while Clinton for his part, in order to garner
more votes, has fired missiles on Iraq, and accordingly both the
persons are busy trying to deceive the public.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, Saddam Hussein is trying to
project himself as a national hero by saying that he will not
accept the regulations for the safety zone.
</P>
<P>
"They are all trying to deceive the public," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Washington's prime mistake was its support for the Baathist
Party against Iran, and they moved into action when the Iraqis
occupied Kuwait," recalled the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani called on all countries and people defending human
rights to make efforts to contain the spread of fighting in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Kurdish groups should understand that neither Saddam nor
America likes them and their meaningless infighting is giving an
excuse to both Saddam and America," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Kurds should not give any excuse to the aggressors, and
this is what all our efforts are aimed at," he said, adding "we
are guarding our frontiers and will not allow the sedition in
Iraq to cross into our borders."
</P>
<P>
On Iran's contacts with the Kurdish groups in northern Iraq, he
said, "we enjoy excellent ties with all these groups, and we
pursue only anti-revolutionary elements and mischiefmakers in
northern Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria, France Share Stand on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara scored a big success winding up at noon today a
round of official talks in Paris with his French counterpart Herve
de Charette.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-French talks focused mainly on the developments of
conditions in the Middle East, ways to revive the Middle East
peace process, the bilateral ties, and preparations to be made
for the visit by French President Jacques Chirac to Syria in
October.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to France, al-Shara conveyed to President
Chirac a message from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the
developments of the peace process and the deadlock caused by
Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, both
Syria and France expressed their adherence to achieving
a fair and overall peace in the Middle East on the basis of the
Madrid Conference, and to implementing the relevant U.N.
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister also affirmed that his country was
ready to resume with Israel its peace talks that were suspended
last February, pointing out that the stalement of the peace
process would do harm to all, but Israel would be the greater
loser.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with French officials in Paris, al-Shara
criticized Israel's hardline policy, and its ignorance of the
basis of peace negotiations, namely implementation of the related
U.N. Security Council resolutions and the principle of
land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister made it clear that Israel's policy
was faulty and not acceptable neither to the Arabs nor the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the future peace talks on the
Syrian-Lebanese tracks can not be separated, asserting that Syria
will sign no agreement with Israel without Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, French President Jacques Chirac expressed
concern over the threats faced by the Middle East peace
process, pointing out that to resume the peace negotiations from
naught is unadvisable.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that peace would be established between Israel and
the Arab states, vowing that his country would be a peace
factor in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Damascus think that al-Shara's recent
visit to France has helped the two countries find many in common
regarding the Middle East peace process.

allies will extend the "no fly" zone in southern Iraq from the
32nd parallel to the 33th parallel, meaning Iraq will be forced to
yield another 70 miles of territorial sky in the southern part of
the country to the United States and its Western allies, Britain
and France, for their aerial patrol.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's announcement came after the United States fired from
warships and B-52 bombers 27 cruise missiles at "selected air
defense targets in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston
said that by moving the zone from the 32nd parallel to the 33th
parallel, it will take away a major Iraqi military training area
and two of its key air bases.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the move denies Iraq the means of conducting joint
training in the area among its ground and air forces, Ralston
said.
</P>
<P>
Both "no fly" zones in norther and southern Iraq were imposed
by the U.S.-led allies after the Gulf War in 1991 under the name
of the United Nations. The United States said it was established
to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq and the other faction of
Muslims in southern Iraq from Saddam's military forces.
</P>
<P>
The extended zone goes into effect at 12 p.m. local time
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon briefing, Defense Secretary William Perry told
reporters, "This will substantially weaken Saddam Hussein's
ability to pursue military adventures in the south and,
additionally, will weaken his ability to maintain an air force
capable of projecting power in any directions."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move leaves Iraq with a 230-mile-long swath cut east
to west through the middle of the country where it is allowed to
fly its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Ralston said that by denying Saddam the additional area, Iraqi
ground troops will effectively no longer be able to train with air
forces in the immediate region, and it in turn will affect the
readiness of Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called the "no fly" zones "null
and void" and vowed they would be ignored entirely. He ordered his
troops to shoot down any allied aircraft patrolling the zones.

<HEADLINE> France, Syria Share Same Objective in Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that France and Syria share the same objective
in "what was once the Mideast peace process," which he said should
be moved forward on the basis of the "land for peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who had talked with his Syrian counterpart, Farouq
al-Shara, for four hours, said that without the principle, there
would be no serious discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to establish between us very close and deepened
coordination on the ways and means which would allow one to be
able to renew finally the necessary thread of peace," said de
Charette.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the fear that the Mideast peace process "is
being buried with a complicated method."
</P>
<P>
On Israeli-Palestinian relations, de Charette said that it is
"indispensable to observe what has already been agreed upon
(between the two sides) on the future of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
He criticized Israel for failing to withdraw its troops
completely from the Palestinian town of Hebron, as is required by
the agreements it signed with Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UN Food Program Urges More to Be Done for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Catherine Bertini,
executive director of the World Food Program (WFP), today appealed
to the international community to ensure that promises made last
year for the advancement of women are kept.
</P>
<P>
"One year after the Beijing conference on women, there is
little tangible evidence that significant progress has been made
by the international community," said Ms. Bertini, head of the
U.N.'s Food Aid Agency.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to every government, organization and group who made
concrete commitments to women, to ensure that their pledges are
being implemented," Ms. Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, 1995, representative of 189 governments
gathered in Beijing, China, for the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
The conference produced the Beijing Declaration and Platform
for Action, for which delegates voted unanimously. Under the
platform, governments promised to begin breaking down the barriers
to women's advancement by revising laws and ensuring equal access
to education, food, health and training.
</P>
<P>
"We have all made all promises to the women of the world," said
Ms. Bertini. "Let us see that we keep them. There is still so much
to be done."
</P>
<P>
A background press release by the WFP noted that all of its new
projects now contained a women's component. The WFP has set a goal
that at least 60 percent of the program's food aid resources be
earmarked for women and girls. More than 50 percent of school
feeding resources are also targeted to young girls.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program is the largest international food aid
organization in the world. Last year, the WFP fed more than 50
million people, including half the world's refugees and internally
displaced people. It feeds more women and children than any other
international agency.

ANKARA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi paid a one-day working visit to Turkey today to "see the
changes and developments" since the formation of the Islamist-led
coalition government in Turkey, according to the semi-official
Anatolia News agency.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who arrived here late Monday night, is the first
European leader to visit Turkey since the establishment of the
government led by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) Chairman
Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Italy is Turkey's second largest European trade partner after
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Prodi met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Prodi, Erbakan said that the
trade volume between Turkey and Italy would be doubled and the
two countries were allies that have a lot of common ground.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two prime ministers decided to improve
relations between Turkey and Italy.
</P>
<P>
"We agree on the need for dialogue and cooperation between
the Christian world and the Islamic countries," Erbakan added.

<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Defense Headquarters
has reiterated the commitment of the west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG to facilitate peace in Liberia, just as
Ruth Perry took the oath of office in the country today.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the neutrality of ECOMOG, Assistant Director of
Defence Information Godwin Ugbo said that additional troops
would beef up the strength of the peacekeeping force and enable
it to effectively man key and very important points around the
country.
</P>
<P>
The increased strength would also facilitate the encampment and
disarmament of the fighters of all the warring factions in the
war-torn country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although ''peace is very difficult'', he expressed the hope that
the countries that promised additional troops for ECOMOG would
soon send them.
</P>
<P>
There are some 12,000 ECOMOG soldiers currently operating
in Liberia, and ECOMOG Field Commander, Nigeria's Major-General
Victor Malu, has said recently that about 18,000 troops would
be required to carry out the assignments of the force.
</P>
<P>
The six west African countries of Ghana, Gambia, Benin,
Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Bukina Faso have expressed readiness to
send troops to beef up the strength of ECOMOG, which now has
7,000 Nigerian soldiers.  enditem

ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of businessmen
held a demonstration here today demanding lifting of the recent
regulation on price fixing for rents of houses, stalls and
verandahs used for commercial purposes issued by the Addis Ababa
Regional Council.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were quoted by the official Ethiopian News
Agency as saying that the regulation is ''a failure to consider
the paying capacity of traders and businessmen'', ''unstudied and
spontaneous''.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the Addis Ababa Regional Council to immediately
lift the regulation.
</P>
<P>
However, the council said the regulation was thoroughly
researched and meticulously studied before it was formulated into
a law.
</P>
<P>
It said the regulation would remain in place as it was
justifiable.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the demonstration was
rejected by the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
The report said, when the demonstrators presented a written
appeal to the Office of the Prime Minister, Secretary of the
Council of Ministers Tekle Abegaz told their representatives that
regional governments have all the rights to lease, control,
administer and fix taxes of properties in their respective
territories.

<HEADLINE> What Motivation, What Consequence? (by Kang Xingping) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unleashed 27 cruise
missiles at military targets in southern Iraq this morning on
grounds of punishing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for attacking
Kurds in a U.N.-imposed safe zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. declared that its limited military operation
against Iraq drew to a close, but Iraq showed defiance of the
U.S.-designated expansion of "no-fly zone" in southern Iraq, at
least for the time being, a probe into the motives behind the
assault seems no less than necessary.
</P>
<P>
An Oriental military expert told Xinhua that with this strike
on Iraq, the U.S. wanted to beef up its military presence in the
Gulf to reinforce its control in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
The expert, who requested anonymity, said that expansion and
consolidation of its military presence in the Gulf is one of the
set policies of the United States in its global strategy. This
time, it had lost no time to grab this opportunity, which was
provided by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, to achieve its purpose.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the strike served U.S. Bill Clinton's need to
strengthen his image and influence as a world political leader at
home so as to win the upcoming presidential elections in
November. The "triumph" the U.S. assault gained from the attack on
Iraq could served the need of reminding the American voters of the
victory the U.S.-led coalition forces achieved by driving the
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
As the recent polls showed that Clinton was 20 percentage
points ahead of his Republican rival Bob Dole, the U.S. president
needed only a "limited military operation" to consolidate the
lead. In this view, there is no need for him to risk prolonging
the military operation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, checking Iran and Iraq on the one hand and promote
the peace process in the Middle East on the another is yet another
set policy of the U.S. government. Therefore, the U.S. desperately
needed to make a good show in containing the Iraqis to offset its
impotence in bolstering the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The expert pointed out that the U.S. deliberately used a scheme
to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. When the Iraqi troops
began moving to the north in preparation to attack the Kurds in
the so-called "no-fly zone," the U.S. did nothing to prevent the
attack although its highly-effective intelligence had gathered the
information of the imminent Iraqi offensive.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. waited until it gripped the much-wanted pretext for
attack when the Iraqi forces were reportedly "pushing deeper" into
the Kurdish area and killing political opponents they had
captured.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, local observers and Middle East watchers here maintain
that the superpower has not fully achieved its plausible purposes
of the strike, because the U.S. assault, carried out by two Air
Force B-52 bombers and two Navy ships in the Gulf, triggered wide
condemnation and criticisms from the Arab world and other
countries, including some of the U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
To name a few of them. Of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, only Britain firmly supported the
U.S. strike, France only showed reserved support, with China and
Russia against the move.
</P>
<P>
There was belief at the the U.N. headquarters that the
U.N. resolution cited by the Clinton administration for the
missile assault on Iraq provides a "shaky legal foundation" for
military moves following the Iraqi troops' push into the
Kurds-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cited Security Council Resolution 688 of April 5,
1991, which was approved after Saddam cracked down on dissident
Kurds, to justify its military action against Iraq this morning.
But the resolution does not specifically authorize the use of
force, nor does it stipulate the establishment of "no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
In the Arab world, only Saudi Arabia expressed support to the
U.S. action; Kuwait, the victim of Iraqi military brunt and
occupation six years ago, only expressed understanding of the
U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
The attitudes of other Arab countries were negative. Egypt and
Syria, which sent troops to participate in the U.S.-led coalition
to fight the Iraqis during the Gulf War six years ago, criticized
the U.S. attack on Iraq. Syria issued a fierce condemnation on the
missile bombing.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, widely viewed as a regional U.S. ally which blasted
Baghdad for inciting riots in Jordan last month, showed no support
for the U.S. this time. On the contrary, it opposed military
action and asked the U.S. government for restraint.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, which groups all of the 22 Arab countries,
today issued a harsh condemnation on the U.S. brunt on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that launching the limited operation,
the U.S. has to risk discoordination with its western and Arab
allies.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here say that further U.S. military moves
are contingent upon the development of the situation. Escalation
of tension could not be ruled out as Saddam said in a nation-wide
speech that Iraq would no longer recognizes the no-fly zones and
called upon the Iraqi forces to resist against U.S. aggressors.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that tension buildup in the region would
undoubtedly cast a shadow on the underway efforts to revive the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Attack on Iraq Rouses Arab Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Most Arab nations today
expressed grave concern over U.S. missile attacks on Iraqi
targets and warned that the American strikes could only
complicate the already worsened situation in Baghdad which has
been under U.N. sanctions for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid
strongly condemned the U.S. missile attacks, saying that the
attack was a violation of the sovereignty of an Arab League
member state, an intervention in its internal affairs and a
breach of international law.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing foreign intervention in northern Iraq, Abdul-Meguid
said that Iraq's territorial integrity must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
He said the military action will only lead to further
escalation of the tension there and jeopardize the regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Syria, which were U.S. allies during the 1991 Gulf
war, said the attacks would only worsen the suffering of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that the use of
force will not only affect the Iraqi people, but also shake
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Syria's reaction was stronger. A statement by its foreign
ministry called the attacks "an action that violates the
U.N. charter and international laws."
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz warned that
the U.S. military operation "could lead to another war in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Even Iraq's opponent Jordan, which accused Iraq of stirring up
trouble among Jordanians last month, urged for dialogue to solve
the conflict instead of using military force.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is "deeply concerned by the recent escalation and the
military operations that could return Iraq to the whirl of
violence and counterviolence,'' Information Minister Marwan
Mouasher said.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, ordinary Palestinians condemned the U.S. attacks in
outrage, but their leader Yasser Arafat did not comment on the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian Councillor Abu Zayad strongly condemned
the U.S. missile attacks as a crime that would affect adversely
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Libya, U.S. main opponents in the region, condemned
the United States for the missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian state-run radio said the U.S. attacks did not serve
the interests of the Kurds because Americans have no desire to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
In Tripoli, a high-ranking Libyan official termed the
U.S. military attacks on Iraq today as a "violation of the
sovereignty of an Arab country and an interference in its
internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Gomaa el Fezzani, Secretary General of Libya's General
People's Commission for Unity Affairs, told the Iraqi ambassador
in Tripoli today that Iraq is entitled to exercise its
sovereignty over it entire territory.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, another country under U.N. sanctions, also condemned
the U.S. military operation in southern Iraq as a "violation of
the sovereignty of an Arab country".
</P>
<P>
U.S. attacks on Iraq would pose danger to the security,
stability and peace in the region, the foreign ministry said in
an announcement.
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community and the United
Nations Security Council to assume the responsibility of forcing
the U.S. government to stop its attacks on Iraq immediately.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries should also take necessary measures to
guarantee the sovereignty and security of Iraq, the announcement
noted
</P>
<P>
Among Arab nations, only Saudi Arabia, which was host to the
U.S.-led coalition that fought the 1991 Gulf War, appeared to
support the strike. But the Pentagon said the kingdom did not
allow U.S. planes based in the country to participate in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which was invaded by Iraq in 1990, also declared its
"understanding and support" of the missile strike.
</P>
<P>
The reservations by others show that Arab nations are
frustrated by what they see as needless suffering of Iraqis, who
have endured misery since the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Revival of Sisal Industry Urged in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Investigations by the
government, the Tanzania Sisal Authority (TSA) and other bodies
have shown that the sisal industry can be revived to contribute
significantly to the social economic development of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day workshop today on the sisal industry
held in the town of Tanga, about 300 kilometers from here, TSA
Managing Director Salum Shamte said that in 1995 the industry
earned the country more than 15 million Tanzania Shillings (about
25,000 U.S. Dollars) in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the industry could earn the country 29 billion
T.Shs. (about 48 million U.S. Dollars) in five years.
</P>
<P>
Narrating the history of the crop, he said sisal was the only
agricultural product where Tanzania once claimed supremacy both
in quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
"65 percent of the infrastructure is still there and over the
years a lot of managerial, skilled and semi-skilled workers have
been developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of TSA, which is due for privatization
soon, noted that the sisal industry took a severe battering in
the 1970s and 1980s and production in Tanzania fell from 230,000
tons in 1964 to 30,000 tons in 1986.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there is more demand now for natural products
and Tanzanian policies are now conducive to re-investment and
export.
</P>
<P>
The managing director also mentioned new products from sisal
fiber such as pulp and paper, buffing cloth, geotextile and wood
substitute which have extended use to 98 percent of the sisal
plant.

<HEADLINE> China Be Positive Force for Global Peace: Senior Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China will doubtlessly develop
into a stablizing and positive force for Asia and the world in the
21st century, said a leading Chinese historian at the First
Conference of the 21st Century Forum, which opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng, vice chairman of Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and president of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, told those attending the conference
that China will continue to do what it has been doing for the
second half of the 20th century so as to play "a more positive and
stablizing role in promoting peace and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
"To reach this end, China should first enable its people, who
account for one fifth of the world population, to have enough food
and a fairly comfortable living," he said. "Second, China should
be capable of defending itself, so as to make it known to the
world that the country will not tolerate invasion and plundering."
</P>
<P>
Hu said that during the last two decades of the 20th century,
China has focused its efforts on the socialist modernization drive
and stuck to the reform and opening-up policies. China's economy
in this period could grow at an average annual rate of about 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that this development momentum will continue
in the next century, and any external force trying to contain this
movement will be unjustified and doomed to failure, said the vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hu pointed out that China will continue to be a
developing nation, if calculated on a per capita basis, even when
its economic aggregates develop and, as some research institutes
predict, enter the world's front rank in the first two decades of
the 21st century. China's self-defense capability will rise, yet
the gap will still be large compared with that of world's major
powers.
</P>
<P>
As a socialist country, China believes that the historical
experience of the 20th century does not testify to the extinction
of socialism, but proves the necessity to reform the socialist
system, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice chairman, the socialist model that
prevailed during most of the 20th century was not the only
feasible model.
</P>
<P>
With the turn of century, he noted, new models are facilitating
the revival of socialism. The Chinese Communists represented by
Deng Xiaoping succeeded in generating the new plans for the
socialist cause in China in the late 20th century, because they
learned a great deal from their successes and failure.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the country's conditions, the Chinese people
will continue to adhere to the renovated socialist system, which
demands that the focus of the country's endeavors should be
economic development, which in turn should lead to the improvement
of people's living, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the country's opening-up drive, the system requires
exchange and cooperation with all countries in fields such as
economy, trade, technology, which should be conducted on the
principle of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
To practice such a system, China needs a peaceful international
environment and should pursue a foreign policy of peace, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the foreign policies China pursues now conform
with the nature of its socialist system, including not seeking
hegemony, opposing any form of hegemonism and power politics, and
stressing the handling of relations between states according to
the five principles of peaceful coexistence, with non-interference
in each other's internal affairs at the core.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China maintains that each country's social system and
way of life should be decided by its own people. It also advocates
equality for all the countries, as well as the solution of
international disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that in the process of the socialist modernization
drive, China has no wiser choice than sticking to and further
improving these policies in its foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Subsidy to Stay in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government will
not cut down the fertilizer subsidy provided to the paddy farmers
in the country even if there is a rise in the fertilizer prices in
the world market, sources from the Ministry of Agriculture said
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government currently imports
fertilizer at the cost of 14.88 US dollars per 50 kilos and sell
it at 14 US dollars to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The former government withdrew the fertilizer subsidy on the
advice of the World Bank. The move caused severe hardship to the
poor farmers in the country, who were struggling to survive, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The current government, as promised in its election manifesto,
took immediate steps to restore the fertilizer subsidy.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the restoration of the subsidy had
contributed to remarkable progress in the agricultural sector in
the country.
</P>

Last year saw a high yield of paddy production and the
government hopes to maintain the momentum, said the sources,
adding that the government will not withdraw the subsidy as called

<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today renewed his support for President Bill Clinton after
the second United States missile strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Foreign Office told Xinhua in a telephone
interview that Major repeated his backing this morning. He quoted
the prime minister as saying that "the attacks were not against
new targets but those which had not been taken out fully in
Tuesday's raid."
</P>
<P>
Fearing its citizens to be high on the hit list of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, the British government has urged about
30 British aid workers in northern Iraq to leave.
</P>
<P>
Protests over Britain's backing of the U.S. raids on Iraq began
on Tuesday. A vigil was mounted outside the U.S. embassy on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Labor MP Tam Dalyell called for the Parliament to be recalled
to discuss the growing international isolation of British and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
United States officials said late Tuesday that the U.S. had
launched a second round of cruise missile attacks against Iraqi
air defense sites within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said 17 cruise missiles were fired in the second
strike from three U.S. Navy ships and one submarine, all in the
Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Senior British Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that after a period of twists and turns, there emerges
a trend for improvement in Sino-British relations, which have
embarked on a track for normal growth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is delighted to see such a positive trend, Li
said during his meeting here with Ian Lang, British secretary of
state for trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since Britain is one of China's major trade
partners in Europe, as well as the largest investor in China among
countries in the European Union (EU), there is a sound basis for
the bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain, which are economically complementary, have
great potential for developing trade, and Britain has advantages
in energy, communication, chemical industry, telecommunication and
aviation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that British business, with advanced
technology and abundant funds, could find opportunities to
cooperate with China.
</P>
<P>
China is optimistic about the future of Sino-British trade
relations, because the improvement of bilateral political and
diplomatic ties will help expand the two-way trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the issue of Hong Kong is the most important
problem between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
There are only 300 days before the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland, and that return is irreversible, he said. Therefore,
he added, China and Britain should strengthen cooperation and
avoid new trouble in order to ensure the smooth transfer of the
power of Hong Kong to China, which is in the interests of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Lang said that the British government and businesses are all
satisfied with the improvement of bilateral ties, and would like
to establish long-term and extensive cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The British businesses are definitely promising in the Chinese
market, as they have advantages in many fields which China values,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Britain government, like its Chinese counterpart, hopes
that the power of Hong Kong can be transferred smoothly, and
Britain would like to cooperate with China to this end, he said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The 88- member Legislative
Palestinian Council (PC) issued a statement in Gaza today
denouncing the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration has ordered its forces to launch
two cruise missile attacks in 24 hours starting early Tuesday on
"selected air defense targets" in southern Iraq in retaliation
for Saddam Hussein's weekend military operation against Kurds in
the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
"As the Palestinian Council asserts that it strictly stands
by the brotherly Iraq and respects its right to protect its
unity, people and land, it calls upon the United States to stop
its aggression and to adhere to international law," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The PC also appealed to the international public opinion, all
parliaments of the world, and the United Nations to bear
responsibilities to put an end to the U.S. aggression.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Arab countries to stand firm in confronting the
U.S. attacks, and Washington to stop its practice of "double
standards."

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
expressed his satisfaction with the constant development of
Sino-Moldovian ties here today during his meeting with visiting
Moldovian Foreign Minister Mihai Popov.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in
1992, their exchanges and cooperations in various fields have
continued to expand, and they have supported each other on
international issues.
</P>
<P>
There is no obstacle for the growth of the Sino-Moldovian ties,
and consolidating such relations is in the interest of the peoples
of the two countries, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that China respects the choice of the Moldovian
people, as well as Moldovia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and he sincerely hoped that Moldovia would enjoy
political stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li also said that China would like to improve its trade ties
with Moldovia on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and
would encourage and support Chinese businesses to cement contacts
and establish direct relations with their Moldovian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Although two-way trade is small-scaled, it will develop
significantly as long as the two sides spare no effort in this
regard, Li continued.
</P>
<P>
Popov conveyed a letter from Moldovian Prime Minister Andrei
Sangeli to Li, and said that spurring the Moldovian-Chinese ties
is one of Moldovia's diplomatic focuses. Moldovia would like to
increase its cooperation with China in various fields, especially
in trade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government will always abide by the "one
China" policy, support China's stand on the issues concerning
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and also support China's efforts for
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Popov also said that the Moldovian leader has invited Li to
visit Moldovia, and Li expressed his thanks for the invitation.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Ambassador: Extension of No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's permanent delegate to the
Arab League Nabil Negm today termed the extension of the no-fly
zone in southern Iraq as an illegal measure which violates
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone was enlarged to the suburbs of Baghdad today
after the U.S. forces launched a second round of missile attack
against selected air defense targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Washington, U.S., French and British
aircraft began patrolling the enlarged no-fly zone today.
</P>
<P>
Negm, in a statement carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
said that the expansion of the zone is a unilateral measure.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government pays no attention to the world public
opinion and adopts instead an aggressive and provocative line,"
said Negm.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab stance is supportive and positive to Iraq
because the Arabs condemn the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq and
underline the necessity of maintaining Iraq's unity and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Cairo-based Arab League Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, in reaction to the first round of U.S. missile
attack on Iraq Tuesday, said that the attack was a violation of
Iraq's sovereignty, an intervention in its internal affairs and a
breach of international law.
</P>
<P>
Negm also accused the U.S. of placing obstacles to prevent the
implementation of an oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the U.N.,
under which Iraq is allowed to export limited amounts of oil for the
purchase of food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Containment of China is Wrong, Says Schmidt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Helmut Schmidt, former German
chancellor, said here today that it is wrong for some Americans to
believe China is "militarily aggressive" and to talk about the
necessity of "containment."
</P>
<P>
Schmidt made this remark at the ongoing first conference of the
"21st Century Forum," sponsored by the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the speech entitled "China, Asia and Europe in the Early
21st Century," Schmidt said Taiwan was part of China for many
centuries before the USA became independent from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
accepted that the Taiwan question was considered an intra-Chinese,
not an international strategic problem, and again in 1979, the USA
accepted that Taiwan is a part of China and that there is just one
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But quite a few Americans - and also some Europeans - do from
time to time forget what they formerly already had agreed to," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Washington and Taipei would be prudent to accept the Chinese
slogan of 'one country, two systems' and if they bought Jiang
Zemin's eight points regarding Taiwan," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As one of the founders of the summit of seven industrialized
nations, Schmidt renewed his appeal to invite China and Russia to
full participation.
</P>
<P>
He said China, Japan and the USA ought to define long-term
and convergent interests, and sort out conflicting interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the early 21st century, neither China nor
Russia will need or accept any American interference or mediation
in their relations.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that many states and economies will need
Japanese capital inflow in the future, and India will soon emerge
as a major economy.
</P>
<P>
The former chancellor said that only if the European Union
develops into one great economy will European nations be strong
enough to effectively pursue their interests in relation to the
USA, China, Japan, India and other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also touched on the issues of global population growth,
shrinking natural resources, world peace, and development of
regional bodies, including economic organizations.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Issues Fool Proof Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has started to issue
new fool-proof passports that conform to the highest international
technological standards, Defense Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the first country in the world to issue such
high-security passports and the United States is expected to
follow suit next year, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The photograph signature and other details of the passport
holder are computer-printed on the passport, which denies all
possibilities of tampering, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, a passport could be issued in six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The system will also make the detection of forgeries much
easier both in Sri Lanka and abroad, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, about 250 passports were reportedly lost
from the Sri Lankan Immigration and Emigration Department and
another 250 passports were recovered from a toilet in the premises
of the department, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese PM on Situation of Asian Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Toboru Takeshita said here today that the continuous and vigorous
economic development in Asia has stimulated and led global
economic growth, and this would be the basic economic situation of
Asia in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In his lecture to the "21st Century Forum," sponsored by the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, Takeshita said the next century would be Asia's, and
that Asia would be one of the world's fastest-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Asian countries, unlike the European countries, should
take their own respective development roads while expanding
cooperation with the Pacific countries, in order to seek
development on common ground because of differences in population,
culture, religion and economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita predicted that some of the Asian countries would
become industrialized nations in the near future, before
progressing to a slow-growth period, while other countries would
register rapid development. During the process, he added, Asian
countries would face acute competition with one another, but at
the same time develop a relationship of mutual existence.
</P>
<P>
It should be the common aspiration of all Asian countries to
maintain the present peaceful situation, eradicate the root cause of
disputes as early as possible, solve issues by peaceful means and
seek economic growth in order to keep the country strong and the
people prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The former Prime Minister urged that the Asian region should
try to register greater development in an environment of peace as
it is heading toward the 21st century, so that it can give scope
to the role of locomotive of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
So all countries in the region should not only treat each other
in the spirit of cooperation, but also forge close ties with
Europe and America, Takeshita said.

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua)-- Following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Facing limited and messy options after the earlier war
against Iraq ended without overthrowing its leader, President
Clinton is fighting the war George Bush never finished.
</P>
<P>
-- After assessments that he would be open to criticism, Bob
Dole backed away from his earlier comments about the action in
Iraq, saying he offered his support for American forces in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- The mall of America, the nation's largest, has been troubled
by rowdy teenagers. So the mall plans to require young shoppers to
have chaperones on weekends, a policy that will be closely watched
by other shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States fired a second volley of cruise missiles
against air defenses in southern Iraq last night, less than 24
hours after launching a first round and declaring it would enlarge
the area south of Baghdad barred to flights by Iraqi military
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. missile attacks on Iraq sent oil prices higher as
prospects faded for Iraq to sell its oil on world markets.
</P>
<P>
-- Aides to Clinton and Dole said they expect the debut over
drugs to develop into a major battle.

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<P>
-- The IRS is conducting an audit of a course House Speaker
Gingrich taught for two years, officials at two Georgia colleges

was an effort to recruit Republican activists.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times:
</P>
<P>

long-avoided and potentially risky turning point in the two
nations' six-year confrontation as the United States extends its

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants Settlement of Car Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia hopes to settle the
controversy over its national car policy, which Japan intends to
bring to the World Trade Organization (WTO), through bilateral
talks, Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The WTO usually suggests that such issues be settled through
bilateral talks, he said, adding that if bilateral discussions
fail, then the issues are brought before a WTO panel.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Shumpei Tsukahara said in
Tokyo Tuesday that Japan intends to take Indonesia to the WTO once
it confirms that Timor cars, which bear Indonesia's national brand
but are currently being produced in South Korea, enjoy
preferential tariff treatment.
</P>
<P>
Tsukahara is scheduled to arrive here next Thursday for further
discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo said that Indonesia has already explained its
national car policy to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"However, we are prepared (to explain it to the WTO) in case
Japan takes the issue to the WTO," he said, reiterating that
Indonesia has not violated any trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90 percent share in the Indonesian car
market, has criticized Indonesia's national car policy, along with
the United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy issued last February, Indonesia's national car
producers will be granted exemptions from import duties and luxury
sales tax which increase the price of imported cars by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor Putra Nasional (TPN) has been selected as the first
national car manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The TPN, holder of the Timor brand, has established a joint
venture with South Korea's Kia Motors. Some 2,000 Timor cars made
by Kia Motors arrived at the Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta last
week.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Cannot Win Independence: Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singaporean Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew stated today that Taiwan cannot win
independence, even if the Americans want it to.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing first conference of the "21st Century
Forum" in Beijing, Lee said it is not possible for Taiwan to be
independent against the will of a united and an
economically-strong China.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan will be re-unified with the mainland "eventually
and peacefully, without the use of force."
</P>
<P>
The senior minister said most countries in the United Nations,
including the US, have accepted the "one China" principle. "It is
in China's interest to let Taiwan prosper through more trade with
investments on the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the speech entitled "Asia and the World in the 21st
Century," Lee noted that the next century will see Asia recover
its place in the world.
</P>
<P>
"If the present concentration of economic growth and
cooperation prevails in East Asia for another 10 to 20 years, Asia
will be transformed," he predicted. "For East Asia to maintain its
rapid growth, peace and stability must be maintained. The future
is what the East and West together are responsible for."
</P>
<P>
Nations must learn to adjust to and accommodate each other,
even when they cannot agree, he advised.
</P>
<P>
He said most Western analysts view the rise of China as
de-stabilizing to the present world order, but China has the
ability to demonstrate that a huge prosperous nation of 1.3
billion people in the year 2020, with a per-capita GDP about
one-fourth of that in the US, can only be better for the world
than an impoverished and unstable nation of the same population.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that growth in China and the rest of East Asia
will provide opportunities for the West, and there will also be a
better global balance, both economic and strategic.
</P>
<P>
He said the renaissance of China and East Asia will
re-invigorate the world.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I am optimistic when I view Asia and the world
in the 21st century," he added.

<HEADLINE> OSCE: No Date Yet For Bosnian Municipal Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The American diplomat in
charge of elections in Bosnia said here today that he did not
have a time table established yet for the cancelled municipal
voting.
</P>
<P>
Rober Frowick is the U.S. Ambassador representing the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which
is overseeing Bosnia's first post-war election. He disclosed the
absence of times after reporting to the North Atlantic Council at
the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) headquarters in
Brussels on the outlook for the election process.
</P>
<P>
Frowick cancelled the municipal elections two weeks ago because
of vote-rigging tactics by Bosnian Serbs. But elections for
regional and national assemblies and presidencies are still
scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to narrow the time frame rather than wait until
later on," Frowick said.
</P>
<P>
"This decision (of postponing) has obviously implications for
IFOR (the peace implementation force in Bosnia) and the strategic
and important relations between IFOR and OSCE," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accords, the 6,000-strong IFOR is
scheduled to leave Bosnia by the end of 1996, after the elections
are held.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told the press after
meeting Frowick that the withdrawal decision would be reconsidered
if the elections had not been held by then.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention whether IFOR would stay in Bosnia until the
moment the municipal elections took place, which was widely
expected to be next year. He said NATO would maintain enough
troops on the ground "to the very end of the year, and the very
end of its mission".
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief added that IFOR and OSCE were cooperating "in a
very positive manner", and that NATO's commitment to help OSCE's
successful holding of the elections would be maintained.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there would be real democratic elections in
Bosnia, Frowick replied: "It is not possible to view these
elections the way we view free and fair elections in the western
democracies...Our goal is to drive the process forward to ensure
they will be as free and fair as possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Council
of Arab Economic Unity Hassan Ibrahim today condemned the
U.S. missile strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, carried out Tuesday and early today, are an
aggression on Iraq's sovereignty and a violation of the
international law, he was quoted by Egypt's news agency MENA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The use of force leads to more instability in the region,
hinders efforts to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people and
has a negative impact on the Middle East peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The council today issued a statement saying that security and
stability in Iraq require more dialogue and peace negotiations
between the parties concerned instead of use of force.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the maintenance of Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and non-interference with its internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Plane Evacuates Foreigners Holed up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
landed a giant C-141 transport plane in Bujumbura to evacuate
foreigners amid fears of a large scale ethnic war in Burundi,
said a senior U.S. diplomat in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"It is a military plane. We landed the plane in order to pull
out those who want to leave," said the diplomat in a telephone
interview with the Xinhua Nairobi office here.
</P>
<P>
The starlifter plane landed in the Burundi capital at 08:30
gmt, and was immediately guarded by Burundi's Tutsi-dominated
army, said an earlier report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"The plane will be flying back to Washington via the Kenyan
capital of Nairobi. At present we are still working with the
Burundi government on it," explained the U.S. diplomat who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. diplomat refuted reports that the U.S.
embassy staff would be evacuated from Bujumbura."The embassy is
not to be evacuated. We are still working," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also dispelled reports that ousted Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya, holed-up at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in
Bujumbura ever since the July 25 military coup, would be among
those leaving.
</P>
<P>
Today's air evacuation came after a night of fierce fighting
outside Bujumbura between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu
rebels, observers say, noting that fears are mounting over an
outbreak of Rwanda-type ethnic cleansing and an all-out ethnic
war.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Burundi, the military wing of the
Hutu rebels, the Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD),
used rocket-propelled grenades to attack the army in a stepped-up
campaign against the military government.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman of the Burundi government said the armed forces
had repelled the rebels after heavy fighting at the town of
Tshiangano Commune, just a few kilometers outside the city.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started at curfew, 10 p.m. Tuesday night, and
gunfire could also be heard inside Bujumbura, raising fears that
the rebel war would soon break out in the Burundi capital which
has been largely free from violence since the army coup on July
25.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the rebels are taking advantage of the economic
sanctions on Burundi imposed by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) since July 31 to pressure Pierre Buyoya's military
government to return to national reconciliation and
constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Burundi also said the Hutu rebels' forces this
week mounted a series of military campaigns from the countryside
and border areas to isolate Bujumbura which was controlled by the
Tutsi-led government troops.
</P>
<P>
While all the air and road links with Burundi have been cut,
the Burundi capital is slowly grinding to a halt and the daily
necessities of food and fuel are running out, it is said.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said international aid operations in Burundi have
been closed down. "There is nothing I can do here," said a
Belgian as he waited to board the American plane.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation is getting worse and people are
increasingly scared," said an American businessman.
</P>
<P>
Regional analysts fear Burundi may go down the same path as
its northern neighbor Rwanda where up to a million people were
slaughtered in genocidal killings in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Around 150,000 people, mainly civilians, have died in ethnic
fighting in Burundi since 1993 when the country's first
democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye of the Hutu
majority, was murdered by renegade soldiers of the Tutsi
minority.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Afghan Peace Process Gains Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Positive changes have taken
place in the Afghan scenario since the reconciliation between the
government of Burhanuddin Rabbani and his rival Hezb-i-Islami
(Hekmatyar Group) in May.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a new five-party coalition government in
June with Hekmatyar in the premiership and Rabbani in the
presidency has been widely welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the momentum, Rabbani proposed to hold an
all-party conference in Afghanistan at the beginning of July to
end the four-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan led by
its new envoy, Norbert Holl, visited the war-torn country and
gained support from almost all the Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Holl's decision to shift the headquarters of the UN Mission
from Islamabad to the Afghan eastern city of Jalalabad showed the
UN's resolve to strengthen its peace efforts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The following month witnessed several major breakthroughs in
the Afghan issue, which not only offset the bad impact of sporadic
fighting in the country but also strongly pushed the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
The strained relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan has
taken a turn for the better with Islamabad planning to reopen its
embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique, signed by a visiting high-level Afghan
delegation and senior Pakistani officials on August 12, offered a
complete normalization and further enhancement of bilateral
relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Commentators said that the improvement of their relations will
benefit the Afghan peace process as Pakistan remains a bridge
between Afghanistan and the world.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has also been pushed forward by many
international mediators. Apart from the UN Mission, a 50-member
Pakistani religious delegation, a Russian delegation, U.S.
congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Allauddin Broujerdi visited Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
Inside Afghanistan, the Rabbani government and Rashid Dostum,
the leader of rival Junbush-i-Melli which controls seven provinces
in northern Afghanistan, reached an agreement on a ceasefire, the
reopening of the strategic Salang Highway and swapping of POWs.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Salang Highway, which is the artery
between Kabul and northern Afghanistan, will greatly improve the
accommodations of the Afghan capital and the economic situation in
the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, the Afghan government accepted a
five-point peace proposal put forward by the Taliban Student
Militia and invited the Taliban to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Points of Taliban's proposal include a country-wide ceasefire,
disarmament of factional forces, removal of dishonest people in
the Kabul government, negotiations between the Taliban and the
Kabul government, and the establishment of an interim government
under the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the Rabbani-Hekmatyar alliance, the
Taliban, and Dostum's faction are the top three players in the
Afghan arena, which control large territories and possess strong
military forces.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of the Afghan peace process would to some extent
depend on whether major compromises could be reached among the
three parties.
</P>
<P>
Both Rabbani and Hekmatyar have been offering olive branches to
other Afghan factions since the reconciliation between them. They
even said that they could give up their positions if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Dostum has called for the formation of a broad-based interim
government which he said must include representatives from all
Afghan parties.
</P>
<P>
"We support any step to end the bloodshed in Afghanistan, and
there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem," said
Dostum. He said Hekmatyar's participation in the Rabbani
government was a positive move.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban's attitude appears ambiguous with some of
the Taliban leaders wanting to solve the crisis through
negotiations and others preferring to resort to force.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that although the Taliban has yet to come
up with a clear-cut initiative, any Afghan peace process cannot
succeed without the participation of the Taliban, which controls
half of the Afghan territory.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaffirms Opposition to Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- European Union Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has reaffirmed the EU's opposition
to the United States' Helms-Burton legislation which involves Cuba.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. Under Secretary of
Commerce for International Trade here on Tuesday, Brittan said the
EU shares the desire to bring democracy back to Cuba, and has been
active at different levels to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the EU's determination to defend its interests and
those of the European companies within the Helms-Burton context.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at the request of Eizenstat, the former
U.S. ambassador to the EU in Brussels, who will also meet
European Commission Vice-President Manuel Marin and Consumer
Policy Commissioner Emma Bonino.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton signed into law the
Helms-Burton Act in March but decided, under strong pressure
worldwide, to suspend for six months its Title III. Under this
clause, lawsuits could be filed in the U.S. against foreign
companies that invested in U.S. properties confiscated by the
Cuban government after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
European Union foreign ministers agreed on July 15 to a list of
options for retaliation against the U.S. legislation. These
included bringing the dispute to the World Trade Organization,
visa requirement for visiting U.S. businessmen and EU retaliation
legislation.

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Sets Goals for Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the South Pacific
Forum members today agreed to push forward economic reforms in
their countries by adopting broader goals for regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a closed-door meeting at the Outrigger resort in Majuro, the
capital city of the Republic of Marshall Islands, leaders of the
16 forum members managed to bridge their differences on economic
and development issues and adopted several common goals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Julius Chan, the spokesman
for the forum, said that after 27 years of summits, the forum has
become serious about addressing the region's economic and
development problems.
</P>
<P>
The aid-dependent island nations have realized that the only
way to get out of an economic crisis is to reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the forum theme "regional solidarity for the common
good," leaders of the 16 members agreed to hold regular meetings
of economic ministers, with the first meeting to be held in
Australia next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers' meeting will coordinate economic
development strategies of the forum members within the framework
of regional and sub-regional cooperation, the leaders said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It will also serve as a vehicle for the ministers to consider
further steps to maintain the momentum of tariff reforms in the
forum's island nations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that forum members would soon develop "comprehensive
and clear" foreign investment policies to help keep the region in
pace with the global changes in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
They will also adopt favorable policies toward the private
sector in their own countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that aid donors, such as Australia and New
Zealand and non-forum members of Japan, the European Union and the
United Nations, should ensure support for key reform objectives to
facilitate the economic reforms in the island countries.
</P>
<P>
It said that the support should include recognition that the
island countries would respond to global changes in various ways
according to their size, geography and relative economic strength.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders considered that the establishment of clearly defined
goals would generate a renewed spirit of commitment to Pacific
solidarity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The forum summit, which opened Tuesday, also decided to lift
the suspension of France's status of a post-forum dialogue
partner. It refused to consent to a plan of the host country
Marshall Islands to set up a nuclear waste dump on its atolls
contaminated by nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
A communique of resolutions will be released after the forum
summit resumes its formal session on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The oversupply of prime goods
and low demand for them in Indonesia has pushed the inflation rate
down by 0.27 percent in August, Information Minister Harmoko said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet meeting on economy, he said that the low
inflation rate was made possible by the decline of some 0.35
percent in the prices of food stuff, especially chili.
</P>
<P>
The drop of inflation in August led to the cumulative inflation
of 4.98 percent in the first eight months of this year, a
significant decline compared to the 6.41 percent in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also touched on Indonesia's trade surplus of 193
million US dollars in June as exports reached 4.138 billion US
dollars while imports recorded some 3.945 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraqi Crisis Likely to Feed Thailand's Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. cruise missiles hit Iraqi
military targets early Tuesday morning and they also hit the
nerves of Thai businessmen and officials who are cautiously
tackling the country's already battered economy.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has several reasons to worry about the Gulf crisis at
a time when its economy faces numerous problems, including a high
current account deficit, sluggish exports and a fragile monetary
market.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy grew fast over the past years, so did its
demand for oil. Its daily oil consumption averaged 113.7 million
liters during the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assault in the oil-producing region will undoubtedly
lead to rising oil prices on the world market, which will
frustrate the Thai government's efforts to curb inflation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Economists and businessmen here noted that the limited military
attacks have not yet made great impact on the global oil market
since Iraq is not so important an oil producer as Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that if the fighting spreads, the
situation would be different and Thailand's economy would be
harder hurt.
</P>
<P>
The economists acknowledged that higher costs caused by oil
price hikes could be cushioned to some extent by an increase in
product prices. But they said there were more causes for concern
beside oil prices.
</P>
<P>
One major fear is for investment falls and financial volatility
in Thailand, whose economy has for years relied heavily on exports
and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Arporn Chewakrengkai, former chief economist of
the Thai National Economic and Social Development Office, a
deteriorating situation in the Middle East will destabilize the
world financial markets, including that in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Citing possible results from an escalation of the Gulf crisis,
she said that interest rates and capital and production costs may
be pushed higher while Thailand's hopes to prop up its sluggish
exports in the second half of the year may be dashed.
</P>
<P>
She also warned that Thailand's current account deficit would
explode and its economic growth would slide below seven percent if
the situation worsens.
</P>
<P>
The 1990-1991 Gulf war pushed Thailand to the verge of an
overwhelming crisis like the one in Mexico, which has still not
fully recovered from its economic distress, she said.
</P>
<P>
Thai government leaders have instructed relevant departments to
monitor the situation in Iraq and withdraw Thai workers from that
country if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry also ordered the Thai Central Bank to
watch closely the financial market to protect Thailand against any
disaster.
</P>
<P>
At present, many Thai officials and businessmen said they
believed that the current situation in Iraq, if not aggravated,
would not seriously hurt the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Pala Sookawesh, governor of the Petroleum Authority of
Thailand, said that Thailand has enough oil reserves for the
country to go around for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Pongsak Asakul, president of the Thai Textile Manufacturing
Association, said he believed that the crisis in Iraq would not
last long as the U.S. only wanted to show its power as the
presidential elections are approaching.
</P>
<P>
Jada Wattanasiritham, executive vice president of the Siam
Commercial Bank, said that the immediate impact on the Thai
monetary market was the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and
tightening of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
She also said that foreign investors should adjust themselves
in advance and that the Thai currency baht is still providing
higher returns than other currencies.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Ng Fung Hong, Major Food Supplier for HK People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- It is 5:00 am. Trucks
carrying fresh pork and beef begin to drive out of the gate of the
abattoir at Cadogan Street of Kennedy Town, Hong Kong Island, and
head for the butchers' shops in every corner of the island.
</P>
<P>
Inside the abattoir, workers and quality control officials are
busy working along the slaughter lines. Everyday they handle some
2,000 pigs and nearly 60 cows.
</P>
<P>
This is only one of the three abattoirs run by Ng Fung Hong
Ltd., the largest food supplier for Hong Kong's 6.3 million
residents and its numerous visitors from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Apart from pork and beef, Ng Fung Hong also provides the Hong
Kong market with a rich assortment of products including poultry,
eggs, fish, fruits, grain and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
With an area of only 1,000 sq. km and most of which has been
used for industrial, commercial and residential purposes, Hong
Kong has to rely heavily on imports for its food supply.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wangheng, General Manager of Ng Fung Hong, said his
company was established to cater to the needs of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
" 'Ng Fung' mean 'abundant harvests of all food crops' in
Chinese, and our company adopted the name to convey the blessed
assurance of a good supply of all kinds of food for Hong Kong
people," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to related statistics, the amount of
food consumed by each Hong Kong resident on an annual average
includes 52.6 kg of rice, 99 kg of fruits, 25.7 kg of fresh pork,
24.9 kg of chicken, 10.5 kg of beef, 11.1 kg of frozen pork and
7.8 kg of freshwater fish, most of which come from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the mainland supplied Hong Kong with some 2.4 million
pigs, 110,000 cows, 9,100 goat, nearly 50 million head of poultry,
52,000 tons of frozen meat, 36,000 tons of fresh fish, 24,000
tons of fruits, over 10,000 tons of fresh eggs, 250,000 tons of
vegetables and more than 316 tons of the famous live Dazha Crabs.
</P>
<P>
Ng Fung Hong was founded in 1951 as a small trade company.
Being the sole agent of mainland food in Hong Kong, it grew fairly
fast and steadily in the past 45 years. Before it was listed on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in October 1995, it has had an annual
business volume of 10 billion HK dollars (1.28 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Now Ng Fung Hong has more than 50 sub-companies in both Hong
Kong and the mainland and most of them are engaged in the food
industry. It also runs seven wholesale markets and three
abattoirs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ng Fung Hong has never ceased efforts to improve the quality of
food, Wang said. Ng Fung Hong has been cooperating with local
suppliers in establishing livestock and poultry breeding farms,
and now nearly all the supplies to Hong Kong come from these
farms, he said.

<P>
"The Chinese government and leaders always pay great attention
to food supply for Hong Kong," Wang said. "On the instruction of
the late Premier Zhou Enlai, three special trains were launched in
1962 to transport food to Hong Kong and they have so far operated
34 years."
</P>
<P>
"The three trains have run a total distance of 52.47 million
km, that's 1,300 rounds around the equator."
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure the freshness and the quality of food,
the Chinese government granted the three trains the privileges of
express train, and as a result, the running time for each train
has been shortened from seven days and six nights to the present
77 hours and 35 minutes from Zhengzhou to Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"China has the world's largest population to feed and its farm
produce and by-products are far from abundant. However, the
Chinese government has always given priority to Hong Kong even
during the difficult periods in history when the mainland was
extremely short of food supply," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a few years ago when severe floods hit east and
south China and destroyed rail tracks, hundreds of trucks were
mobilized to transport live pigs and cows from Jiangxi and some
other inland provinces to Shenzhen for supplying Hong Kong's
market.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of truck transportation is especially high, you are
still losing money even if you sell the pork at 100 HK dollars a
kilogram," he said. "Actually we managed to maintain the normal
price level, which best explains the brotherhood friendship of the
mainland people toward Hong Kong compatriots."
</P>
<P>
Talking about food supply beyond 1997, Wang said that when
China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the
economic relations between Hong Kong and the mainland will become
much closer, and the business conditions for Ng Fung Hong more
favorable.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy
sufficient food supply in the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM: Many "Terrorists" Gather at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that many
"terrorists" have gathered at the Iraqi-Turkish border and would
sneak across border into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to take all the measures to protect our
interests," Ciller said in a statement on the latest developments
in Iraq following the U.S. air strikes at selected targets in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She said that Turkey is in the position to secure the border
security and prevent the "terrorists" from sneaking into the
Turkish territory in such a dangerous situation. "We must ensure
the security of the lives and the property of the innocent people
living in this region, " Ciller said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ciller refused to give unconditional support for or
condemnation on the U.S. military operation in Iraq, saying
that Turkey had done all to prevent such action.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's position was in stark contrast to the mood in the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) wing of the coalition
government. Officials and deputies from the senior partner were
seething with anger at the U.S. air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener, a leading RP member,
slammed the U.S. for the attack on Iraq, saying that the problems
of the region should be solved through negotiation with the
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration ordered U.S. forces to launch
missile attacks Tuesday on "selected air defense targets" in
southern Iraq in response to Iraqi army's weekend strike in the
Kurdish city of Irbil in northern Iraq.

Prosecutor's Office Thursday indicted independent member of the
National Assembly, Kim Hwa-nam, on further election law violation
charges.
</P>
<P>
Elected from the country's North Kyongsang Province, Kim was

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Sets Goals for Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the South Pacific
Forum members today agreed to push forward economic reforms in
their countries by adopting broader goals for regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a close-door meeting at the Outrigger resort in Majuro, the
capital city of the Republic of Marshall Islands, leaders of the
16 forum members managed to bridge their differences on economic
and development issues and adopted several common goals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Julius Chan, the spokesman
for the forum, said that after 27 years of summits, the forum has
become serious about addressing the region's economic and
development problems.
</P>
<P>
The aid-dependent island nations have realized that the only
way to get out of an economic crisis is to reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the forum theme "regional solidarity for the common
good," leaders of the 16 members agreed to hold regular meetings
of economic ministers, with the first meeting to be held in
Australia next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers' meeting will coordinate economic
development strategies of the forum members within the framework
of regional and sub-regional cooperation, the leaders said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It will also serve as a vehicle for the ministers to consider
further steps to maintain the momentum of tariff reforms in the
forum's island nations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that forum members would soon develop "comprehensive
and clear" foreign investment policies to help keep the region in
pace with the global changes in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
They will also adopt favorable policies toward the private
sector in their own countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that aid donors, such as Australia and New
Zealand and non-forum members of Japan, the European Union and the
United Nations, should ensure support for key reform objectives to
facilitate the economic reforms in the island countries.
</P>
<P>
It said that the support should include recognition that the
island countries would respond to global changes in various ways
according to their size, geography and relative economic strength.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders considered that the establishment of clearly defined
goals would generate a renewed spirit of commitment to Pacific
solidarity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The forum summit, which opened Tuesday, also decided to lift
the suspension of France's status of a post-forum dialogue
partner. It refused to consent to a plan of the host country
Marshall Islands to set up a nuclear waste dump on its atolls
contaminated by nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
A communique of resolutions will be released after the forum
summit resumes its formal session on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Forwards Proposals About Asian Stability, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
set forth a five-point proposal about the prosperity and
development of Asia at the opening ceremony of the "21st Century
Forum" in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government and people care greatly about the future
of Asia, and stand ready to work with other Asian countries for
stability and development in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
His five-point proposal says:
</P>
<P>
-- The diversity of Asian countries should be fully
respected. While having a great deal in common, Asian countries
are quite different from one another in terms of their social
systems, religious beliefs, economic levels and modes of
development. Such diversity should not become an obstacle to
mutual understanding and progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government fully respects the diversity of Asia and
the independent choices made by its people. It will endeavor to
further exchanges and cooperation among Asian countries in the
spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while putting
aside differences.
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts should be made to establish and maintain long-term
and stable relations of friendship and good-neighborliness. It is
a key component of China's independent foreign policy of peace to
maintain stable, friendly and good-neighborly relations with its
surrounding countries. It is unavoidable for neighboring countries
to experience differences or disputes. Countries should bear in
mind the long-term interest of all peoples, and proceed to find
practical solutions through friendly consultations and
negotiations, taking in account the interests of all parties.
</P>
<P>
Differences which cannot be settled may be temporarily shelved,
allowing the parties to seek common ground while reserving
differences, in order to retain normal state relations.
</P>
<P>
The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were initiated by
the Asian countries as a full testimony to the far-sightedness of
Asian peoples and their statesmen, he noted, adding that the
guidelines have become universally-accepted norms in the
international community, and are the foundation for a new type of
state-to-state relations.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Dominate at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist China,
fresh from a narrow win in Sendai of Japan, is aiming for a more
dominating performance when the world women's volleyball Grand
Prix visits Beijing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China won the Sendai event by the narrowest of margins, piping
Russia on points aggregate after suffering a 3-1 defeat to the
Russians in their final match last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But in front of their home crowd in Beijing, the Chinese would
not be happy with anything short outright dominance of their three
rivals, Olympic gold medalist Cuba, South Korea and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
China scored a 3-0 victory over the Cubans in their first match
in Sendai, avenging their loss to Cuba in the Atlanta Olympic
final.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese coach Lang Ping was not happy with China's
performances in their last two matches, which also included a
narrow 3-2 win over Japan.
</P>
<P>
Her major worry has been China's inability to breach high
defences. "Our attacks were blocked many times by Russians' high
walls," said Lang Ping. "I realise that we have to take measures
to overcome high blocks if we are to win this title."
</P>
<P>
The experienced Sun Yue has been China's outstanding player so
far in the series while the Cubans are still trying to stabilise
themselves following the shock sacking of head coach Eugenio
George two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, which finished third in Sendai on a countback after two
wins and one loss, is also searching for the best combinations
following the retirements of stars Mireya Luis and Magaly Carvajal
after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
It will be China's and Cuba's first taste of opposition from
the South Koreans and Dutch in the five week, nine-city Grand Prix
series.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands experienced mixed results in Jakarta which also
with sendai formed the first week of the 1.5 million U.S. Dollars
series.
</P>
<P>
An impressive fifth in Atlanta, the Dutch had a hard-fought 3-2
win over defending overall champion the United States, although
they were beaten 3-0 by Olympic bronze medalist Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans finished one place behind the dutch in
Atlanta, but had a fifficult time in Jakarta, losing in three sets
to Brazil and in five to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with Beijing leg, Osaka will be hositng Brazil,
Japan, Russia and the United States as part of the second week of
the series.
</P>
<P>
The series will be also held in Honolulu, Macao, Taipei and
Hong Kong with the top three teams and China qualify for the
finals in Shanghai slated for September 27-29.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I am convinced that the Asian countries are entirely capable
of living in harmony with one another on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and of settling their
differences or disputes by relying on their own wisdom and power
free from any outside interference, in order to maintain peace and
stability in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Economic cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit
should be energetically stepped up. Such cooperation should be
based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese
Government stands ready to further strengthen its economic
cooperation and trade with other Asian countries on the basis of
equality, mutual benefit and openness, long-term cooperation and
common progress.
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of a regional security cooperation
consistent with Asian realities should be accelerated. The
security mechanism in Europe must not be copied blindly, since the
situation in Asia is not the same. The issue of Asian security
should be addressed and resolved by Asian countries and
peoples. Involvement of outside forces, often futile, may
sometimes make the matter even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
It is not consistent with Asian reality, nor does it conform
with the trend of the times, for someone to attempt stronger
regional security by beefing up bilateral military alliances
introduced during the height of the Cold War. The security in Asia
should be jointly maintained through bilateral or multilateral
peaceful consultations conducted on an equal footing, improved
mutual understanding and trust, and broadened and deeper economic
exchanges and cooperation. The Asian countries and peoples are
confident in their capability to maintain peace and stability in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- The important role of the Asian heritage should be given
adequate attention.
</P>
<P>
"Practices show that the rich cultural and ethical traditions
of Asia are a positive factor conducive to social progress and

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Mongolia's Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain supports Mongolia's
democratic process and its transition to a market economy, says
Malcolm Rifkind, British State Secretary for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs..
</P>
<P>
Rifkind was speaking to the press before his departure from
Mongolia. He said his visit, just after Mongolia's new government
was formed, had much significance.
</P>
<P>
The state secretary congratulated the Mongolian Democratic
Union which won the parliamentary elections in July.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Rifkind met with Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister Mendsaihani
Enhsaihan. They talked about bilateral issues and trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia was the last leg of Rifkind's Asian trip, which had
already taken him to Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Japan.

<P>
Earlier, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen and European
Union Commission member Hans Van Den Broek also visited Mongolia.

<P>
Observers here said the visits by the three European officials
soon after a new government was formed reflected Europe's
attention to Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Former Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, Chinese President
and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, today urged the Japanese to learn from the past and
have an accurate understanding of the history between Japan and
China as they conduct bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a Japan-China goodwill mission for the eighth
Great Wall Project, headed by former Japanese Prime Minister
Tsutomu Hata and his entourage, including members of the New
Frontier Party, President Jiang said that the main aspect
of the Sino-Japanese relations has been good in general.
</P>
<P>
However, there still exist some problems such as how the
Japanese side treats the Japanese war of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide
for the future. He hoped the Japanese will educate the young
people with correct historical views, in order to close the book
on the past and prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and Japan are important countries in
the region. The strengthening of bilateral cooperation in every
field, based on the principles of the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty, will
not only preserve the fundamental interests of the two peoples,
but also benefit peace and development in the region and the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the healthy, stable and long-lasting
development of the China-Japan relations requires arduous work by
people on both sides of the issue -- the younger generation in
particular.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Hata and other Japanese statesmen of
the new generation will continue to play positive roles and will
channel greater enthusiasm and wisdom into developing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Hata said the far-sighted Japanese statesmen fully recognize
the importance of enhancing bilateral ties, and will do their
utmost to promote dialogues through various forms.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, he said Japan should first take an earnest,
introspective look at its history, and educate the young people
with correct historical views.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so can the two countries establish more trust in
their cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall Project is a large, non-governmental program
jointly sponsored by the All-China Youth Federation, the New
Frontier Party of Japan and the Japan-China Association for
Exchanges Between Youngsters.

SEOUL, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office Thursday indicted independent member of the
National Assembly, Kim Hwa-nam, on further election law violation
charges.
</P>
<P>
Elected from the country's North Kyongsang Province, Kim was
charged with spending 78,700 U.S. dollars more than the legal
election spending limit of 95,000 U.S. dollars, a prosecution
official said.
</P>
<P>
Kim was previously arrested and indicted on May 9 on suspicion
of distributing 91,000 U.S. dollars in cash and goods to
voters. But he was released from prison on July 19 in accordance
with a parliamentary resolution.
</P>
<P>
More recently he was again referred to prosecutors for
investigation by the Central Election Management Commission (CEMC).
</P>
<P>
Kim became the first South Korean legislator indicted out of
the 21 who have been referred to the prosecution for investigation
by the CEMC.
</P>
<P>
The 21 incumbent legislators under investigation for spending
more money than the legal limit in the general election campaign
include 13 from the ruling New Korea Party (NKP).

<P>
Should any be convicted, they will automatically lose their
parliamentary seats, the official said.

MADRID, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Five times Tour de France
champion Miguel Indurain may retire this year according to sources
close to his Banesto team.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Statesmen and scholars from
around the world will exchange views on political and economic
trends in Asia and China at the 21st Century Forum, which opened
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Among the 50 noted participants at the opening ceremony were
former President and Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew,
former Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, former Federal
Republic of Germany Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former US
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event is sponsored by the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
What the future will hold for the 21st century has become a
question of universal concern. Thus, it is significant that the
CPPCC National Committee is sponsoring the forum, Chinese Premier
Li Peng said in a speech titled "The Impact of China's Development
and Asia's Rise on the Future World."
</P>
<P>
Asia is a vast continent with a long history and strategic
importance, Li said, and "peace and development, the dominant
themes of our time, are most distinctively pronounced in Asia. The
rise of Asia has indeed become an irreversible trend of
development."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rise of Asia is good news to both Asia
and the entire world, and will help bring about a better world
that is desired by all people.
</P>
<P>
China is a member of the Asian community, and China's economic
links and friendly exchanges with the other Asian countries date
back to ancient times, he said, stressing that China is willing to
further exchanges and cooperation with the other Asian countries
in a wider range of areas.
</P>
<P>
"To realize modernization, China, the world's most populous
developing country, needs to work hard for several more decades in
an international environment of lasting peace and stability,
particularly a favorable surrounding situation," he said.

mutual benefit should be energetically stepped up, the
establishment of a regional security cooperation consistent with
Asian realities should be accelerated, and the important role of

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Secretary of State on China-U.S. Points in Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said here today that the U.S. and China have a
common stake in stability and progress in Asia and can work
together to make a "decisive contribution to world order."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first conference of the "21st Century Forum",
sponsored by the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee, Kissinger said that "nations of the
world can only benefit from a prospering Asia and an American
commitment to its future."
</P>
<P>
He said the central issues before the two
governments now are proliferation, human rights, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With respect to human rights, he said that an "American
administration of either party will be concerned about values
shared by most Americans and these will have an influence on their
perception of the countries with which we deal," but that they
"should resort to diplomacy to end the pressures of sanctions or
the threat of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
In the matter of non-proliferation, it is time for a high-level
dialogue to give expression to this common interest, instead of
dealing with it as a matter of unilateral American legislation, he
advised.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Kissinger said that Chinese
leaders have, from 1971, insisted that Taiwan is a domestic
Chinese issue and that they are determined to maintain the
territorial integrity of China.
</P>
<P>
"They have also informed us that they are patient about final
solutions" and have several times offered negotiations to Taiwan
and welcomed negotiations between the Chinese parties, Kissinger
said, pointing out that "six American presidents have affirmed
that they recognize only one China and that they will not support
a two-China or a one-China, one-Taiwan policy," and that the
pledges should be honored.
</P>
<P>
"If this framework is respected," he said, "it should permit a
constructive evolution which enables both sides to work together
to create conditions in Asia in which their overriding common
interest can be affirmed."
</P>
<P>
He said the world is changing a great deal and that technology
is playing an increasingly important role. "The world is becoming
much more evenly balanced" and "the biggest threats to peace are
local conflicts rather than great power conflicts," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is in the process of transforming its political
institutions and probably the orientation of its postwar foreign
policy," while "India is shifting toward a greater readiness to
embrace market economics and a more active foreign policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Some in America, watching China's rise to industrial strength
are calling for a containment policy of China. This is an
illusion" that will have exactly the opposite effect and "will
have no takers," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese will not accept America's implying
that its cooperation is a special move on a reciprocal basis to be
withdrawn at will and used as a form of blackmail.
</P>
<P>
"China wants the U.S. as part of its relationships with
powerful neighbors and to contribute to China's growth; America
needs Chinese cooperation," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Sugar Crisis to Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's sugar industry,
which has been caught in a deep crisis since the beginning of the
year, is still facing enormous problems because of the scant
supply of the basic raw material.
</P>
<P>
The price of sugar has started falling after large quantity of
sugar was imported by the private sector. However, the abnormal
market behavior still points to the presence of a persistent
crisis in the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, one of the major sugar producing countries, has to
import the commodity mainly because most of its 70 sugar mills run
far below their capacity.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of sugarcane is believed to be one of the major
reasons for the inability of the sugar mills to run in full
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, already planning to import 500,000 tons of sugar in
the current fiscal year, may have to buy even more to meet the
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Yousaf Talpur, food and agriculture minister, has said that
Pakistan is likely to continue sugar imports this year to meet its
growing needs. The government is considering buying another
200,000 tons of refined sugar for delivery in September and
October.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's sugar production sank to 2.47 million tons in the
1995-96 fiscal year from 3 million in the previous year. And
sources from the sugar industry fear that the weather conditions
mean no big increase is likely this year.
</P>
<P>
Rain, floods and cloudy weather could slow the normal growth of
sugarcane in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Sources from the sugar
industry believe that the sugar production this year may rise to
about 2.7 million tons, roughly meeting the domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, some sugar mill owners are of the view that domestic
production could fall this year because of slower recovery in
sugarcane supply. The recovery rate fell to 9.19 percent in the
last fiscal year from 9.65 percent in the previous year, when
farmers sold unripe cane to mills early in the season.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the sugar industry noted that the present
situation facing the industry is not only the short supply of raw
material, but also the low quality of the sugarcane which has far
less sucrose content than that of the other sugar producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Research Council has been working on new seeds
during the last few years to produce better quality sugarcane.
However, no major breakthrough has been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among those countries where per hectare yield of
sugarcane is very low. Despite millions of rupees spent on
research every year, the per hectare yield has not gone above 47
tons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's production of sugarcane in the last fiscal year went
down to 45.23 million tons compared with 47.17 million tons in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the sugar industry noted that as the next
sugarcane crushing season begins in the last quarter of the year,
the government will have to find what it can do to increase the
supply of sugarcane to the sugar mills.
</P>
<P>
The supply of sugarcane to sugar mills has already gone down to
60 percent from 80 percent a few years ago, and the shortage of
raw material has already forced four sugar mills to shut down.
Nothing has so far happened to suggest that the situation this
year will be any better.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the crisis facing Pakistan's sugar industry
is to worsen, and the country will have to continue its sugar
import.

<HEADLINE> Rising Asia Will Help Produce Better World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng,
addressing the first conference of the 21st Century Forum here
today, said that a rising Asia will usher in a better world in the
coming century, a world desired by everyone.
</P>
<P>
Asia is a vast continent with a long history and strategic
importance, he said, and in nearly half a century, it has had some
major changes, changes that moved history forward.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development, the dominant themes of our time, have a
distinctness in Asia," he said, noting that the area "enjoys
relative political stability, sustained and rapid economic
development, steadily increasing trade and investment, a healthy
trend of regional cooperation, and closer political consultation
on an equal footing."
</P>
<P>
But, the rise of Asia has upset centuries of domination by the
world powers, as well as their monopoly in world political and
economic affairs, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important landmark for fresh historical progress,"
he said, noting that Asia mainly comprises developing countries
with rather weak economic and technological foundations, as well
as varying degrees of historical difficulties. They must continue
their efforts and the road ahead is quite long to achieve complete
political independence, long-term stability, economic prosperity
and national strength.
</P>
<P>
A 'New Asian Century' is impossible without economically
rebuilding most of Asia's developing countries, he said, but "in
spite of this, the rise of Asia has indeed become an irreversible
trend."
</P>
<P>
The rise of Asia is good news to Asia and the entire world, he
said, giving the reasons why:
</P>
<P>
-- It has contributed to world peace, and will continue to do
so. A stronger Asia will accelerate the move towards a
multi-faceted world and contribute to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
-- It has given fresh impetus to the world economy, and will
continue to do so. An important part of the world economy, Asia
has had robust economic growth which breathes new life into the
world's economy and opens a huge market to international trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
-- It will have a positive influence on developing countries
and their search for methods suitable for their own
development. The rise of Asia has increased the strength of
developing countries as a whole, and helps improve North-South
relations and safeguard the rights of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
-- It will help do away with the old international political
and economic order which is unjust and irrational, and help
establish a new international political and economic order based
on the five principles of peaceful coexistence.

The U.S. would have carried out the so-called "punishment
actions" anyway so long as they serve its power politics, Tippach
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the "surgical strike" on Iraq, said Tippach, was
to give U.S. President Bill Clinton advantage over his Republican
rival and help him finally win the coming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The spokeman declared that DSP opposed any military
interference with the Kurds in Iraq, saying the issue should be
solved only through "political and diplomatic means".
</P>
<P>
Tippach urged the government to "keep a distance from the
U.S. policy of punitive military action."
</P>
<P>
Also today the German government denounced Iraq for its
attacks on Kurds, saying that Germany "completely understood the
U.S. reaction".
</P>
<P>
However, government spokesman Peter Hausmann hoped that efforts
should be made to avoid any escalation of the current dangerous
situation in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Big Waste Water Disposal Plant Operational in Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A 305 million yuan extension
to a waste water disposal plant, the largest river purification
project in northest China, has become operational in Jilin City,
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Daily waste water disposal capacity of the plant has increased
from 8,000 cubic meters to 10,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The project by Jilin Petrochemical Corporation has been built
to help clean up the Songhuajiang River, a 1,927-kilometer-long
river that runs through Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of many large and medium-sized factories
at the upper part of Songhuajiang River since 1950s, the river
became seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Petrochemical Corporation, located in the upper part
of the river, is a large petrochemical industry group.
</P>
<P>
It started work on the waste water extension project in late
1993 with the construction of a 300,000-ton-ethylene project.
</P>
<P>
The original waste water disposal plant was built in 1980, the
biggest industrial waste water plant at that time.
</P>
<P>
The extension project uses equipment shipped in from Britain,
Japan, and the United States.

<HEADLINE> 30 Drowned in S. Leone's Boat Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 4 (Xinhua) - At least 30 people drowned on
Tuesday when a canoe hit a rock in a Sierra Leonean river amid
bad weather, the Freetown police announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The boat named "Enemy Shame" was on its first trip after it
was commissioned on Monday, said Saidu Kallon, the owner of the
boat.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred between the northern towns of Lungi and
Kawaley when the boat hit a rock and broke into two.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the dead were market women and the rough sea made
emergency rescue extremely difficult," said a police officer.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulty, rescue patrol made up of the navy and
the ports authority rescued some 20 people who were on the brink
of being drowned, said an eye witness.
</P>
<P>
The boat captain who was among those rescued said the boat
began to drift in high winds and then sped toward the rock where
it was split.
</P>
<P>
Marine officials said an investigation has been launched into
the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We have insisted that boat owners take their vessels for
inspection to guarantee the safety of their craft but this has
constantly been ignored," said a marine official.

<HEADLINE> One Million Redundant Workers Seeking New Jobs in Industrial Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- At least one million state
firm workers in China's leading heavy industrial base of Liaoning
will have to find new jobs in the next five years, and the local
governments have pledged all-out efforts to help them.
</P>
<P>
Market rules are forcing hundreds of state firms in the
province to chase efficiency in a way that redundancy among
employees is no longer to be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning province, in northeast China, has 1,400 or one-tenth of
the nation's large and medium-sized state firms which have played
an important role in decades of economic development, and are
equally important in increasing employment of local labor force.
</P>
<P>
But as China has gradually turned its planned economy into a
market one, a large proportion of the province's old industrial
giants have faced tough trial because of overstaffing and
out-dated equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the province's redundancy among
industrial employees at more than 1.4 million at present, out of a
total of 8.53 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Accelerated bankruptcy process and increasing take-over cases
have at the same time added to unemployment, with urban jobless
rate of the province standing at 3.6 percent in the first half of
this year, compared to the national average of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Re-employment of the long dole queue has become one of the
major tasks for local governments. Provincial governor Wen Shizhen
has vowed to help one million redundant workers get re-employed by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
A number of semi-official employment services, financed by
local governments, have been set up, providing job skill training
to those needing jobs. A total of 200,000 workers have finished
training courses in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Some 140 preferential local policy measures have been taken to
encourage redundant workers to get self-employed, including
exemption of a series of government fees and charges for those
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 600,000 redundant workers or the
jobless in Liaoning have started new careers since the early
1990s, and two-thirds of them are self-employed.
</P>
<P>
Ding Chunlin, secretary of the provincial research association
of employment, said that as the Chinese economy keeps booming, job
opportunities will keep on the rise, especially in the service
trades and private sector.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that staff reduction in the state industrial sector
is inevitable, and believes that growth of job opportunities in
service trades and private sector, in addition to government
efforts, will be sufficient for the one million redundant local
workers to get re-employed in the next five years.

BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said late Tuesday night
that it would be watching closely the stance of the the U.N.
Security Council members, particularly the permanent members on
the U.S. missile attacks against Iraq in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted a spokesman of the
Revolution Command Council (RCC) and the Baath Party's command as
saying that the U.S. "aggression against Iraq was not only
unprovoked and lacking the minimum ground, but also a dangerous
attitude which will have its repercussions both at present and
future if the other Security Council members, particularly the
permanent members did not convince Iraq and the international
community that there is a minimum limit of respect for the
international law."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued following a joint meeting Tuesday
night of the RCC and the Baath Party command chaired by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the U.S. of carrying out aggression
behind the cover of the Security Council resolutions and
explaining the U.N. resolutions the way it wishes.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the U.S. decision made Tuesday to freeze
the implementation of the oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and
the U.N. on May 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a number of decisions and measures have
been taken to face up the situation following the U.S. missile
attacks against the country, but he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
According to INA, President Saddam met this morning with the
command of the air defense and the general staff, but it did not
give any detail on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces in the Gulf fired 17 missiles against the air
defense sites in southern Iraq early this morning, the second
attack against Iraq within 24 hours, to destroy the targets that
survived the first attack, which killed five people and wounded
19 others..
</P>

Observers here believe that President Saddam discussed with
his senior army officials the situation in the wake of the

<P>
GUIYANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese village with some
100 households, hidden inside a forest of bamboo, has amazed
doctors with its natural healing and health qualities.
</P>
<P>
The residents call it home, but for the experts Laochang
village in Panxian county, in southwest China's Guizhou province
is a 'Garden of Eden' -- rich in natural medicines and miraculous
water.
</P>
<P>
The drinking water in the village, which is surrounded by some
670 hectares of bamboos, contains extremely low mineral substance
and sodium, and is extremely soft.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such kind of water has been found in
the world, according to Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
Inside the bamboo forest, which is 1,800 meters higher than sea
level, rare Chinese herbal medicines grow in abundance. Decocted
with local water, the medicine has helped cure seven cancer
patients, including one retired official from a local county
office.
</P>
<P>
One expert even held that there is possibly a form of
radioactive substance dozens of meters under Laochang village. The
substance can kill cancer cells but is harmless to human bodies,
he believes.
</P>
<P>
Laochang village is also famous as "longevity village" and
"beauty village" in Panxian county.
</P>
<P>
The average life span for the village exceeds 80. But there is
another aspect to life in these oriental Garden of Eden. Amazingly
not a single villager has ever seen a single worm or mosquito in
their lives.

Iraq, one in the south below the 32nd parallel and the other in
the north above the 36th parallel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared that the southern
"no-fly" zone would be moved up from the 32nd to the 33rd
parallel, a line that reaches the southern suburbs of Baghdad and
places roughly half of Iraq inside the zones.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the United States launched another round
of cruise missiles at Iraqi targets, but seemed to have caused no
visible panic among residents here.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Baghdad Radio and Television did not report this
morning's attacks.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens blared out here before dawn as the United
States fired cruise missiles at Iraqi targets for the second time
in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The alert ended with a long all-clear whistle two hours later.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes in response to
Iraqi troops' weekend attack on a Kurdish faction in Irbil, the
main city in an allied protected Kurdish save haven in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two U.S. warships and a pair of B-52 bombers fired
27 cruise missiles at military targets in southern Iraq, killing
five people and injuring 19.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said that the
first strike had fallen short and two of the four Iraqi air
defense targets had to be struck again.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi reports said one Iraqi was killed and seven
injured during the second round of U.S. missile attack.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Continue Cooperation on Internet Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed here today
to continue their cooperation and sharing of information in
formulating and fine-tuning regulations on Internet.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a three-day ASEAN Forum on Internet here today,
the ASEAN members said in a statement that they acknowledged the
value of Internet as a communications and information resource.
</P>
<P>
They said they agreed that ASEAN should harness the potential
of Internet to project its rich heritage and identity to the
region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that regulations and laws were necessary to
set up a framework for Internet to develop and flourish, given the
great potential for business, information and cultural exchange,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Forum agreed that the appropriate regulatory
framework should depend on the culture and legal system of each
country.
</P>
<P>
The Forum "affirmed the importance of having safeguards against
easy access to sites which ran counter to our cherished values,
traditions and culture," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Forum statement said that ASEAN would
encourage other nations, especially the West, to understand its
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also affirmed that government regulations played an
important role in safeguarding national values, while industry
self-regulation was equally important.
</P>
<P>
The member countries agreed at the Forum that given the rapidly
evolving nature of Internet, there should be continued regional
cooperation and sharing of information to help each country
formulate and fine-tune its regulatory approaches.

<HEADLINE> WTO 0fficial: Multilateral Trading System to be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- There is a widely shared
preoccupation among the members of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) to preserve and strengthen the multilateral trading system
and to maintain the thrust for liberalization, a senior WTO
official said.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the opening of the Senior Official
Meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission of
the Asia Pacific (ESCAP), WTO Deputy Director General Anwarul Hoda
said that after 20 months of its operation, "We can say that the
confidence in WTO was not misplaced."
</P>
<P>
The WTO was established on January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the developments in world trade, the WTO official
said both developed and developing countries have made great
efforts for reducing tariffs on their exporting products.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries have undergone radical economic and
trade reforms that have not only brought them into the trading
system but also made them leading players, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the major components of the WTO agreement is the
specific liberalization commitments made by the members in both
goods and services. The first 20 months of WTO operation have not
disclosed any slippages in the implementation of scheduled
commitments, he added.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, he said, there is already a commitment in the
agreement to begin negotiations on the continuation of the reform
process by the year 2000. In services, too, there is an existing
undertaking to begin the next round of negotiations by 2000, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there is a proposal that the negotiations on
industrial tariffs should be held at the time of negotiations on
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which is being attended by more than 20
ESCAP members and a number of international organizations, is
aimed at preparing for a WTO ministerial meeting scheduled for
December 9-13, 1996, in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP meeting will focus on the review of the
implementation of WTO agreements, in particular the problems that
have been encountered by the developing countries -- the built-in
agenda on agriculture, services, and textiles and clothing, trade
and environment, and the emerging new issues such as labor
standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for Ethiopian
nationals Mohamed Haji Abdurahman has asked his compatriots to
minimize movements within Somalia and prepare evacuation from the
horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came after the killing of an Ethiopian businessman
at the Bakara Market in Mogadishu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the Ethiopian businessman was shot in the
head by a Somalia gunman, who also injured another Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 Ethiopians have been killed in Somalia since
Ethiopian troops invaded southern Somalia early last month in
what they termed as "hot pursuit against a multi-national
fundamentalist extremist group".
</P>
<P>
So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the killings
of Ethiopian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Somali businessmen and intellectuals have condemned the
killings. Ali Hashi Ga'al, a Somali intellectual in Mogadishu,
told reporters he hoped this isolated incident would not affect
relations between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has been disturbed by gunmen
near the border lines between Somalia and Ethiopia. Two trucks
loaded with commercial good were looted last week on the way
from Mogadishu to Ethiopia.

ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of Turkey's
Labor Party (IP) Mehmet Bedri Gultekin said here today that the
U.S. air strikes at Iraq violated the U.N. resolutions and
international law.
</P>
<P>
The IP placed a black wreath in front of the U.S. Embassy in
Ankara in protest against the U.S. military operations against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Gultekin said in a press statement that "the United States is
the biggest enemy of the peace in our region. The U.S. domination
in this region has not brought peace and freedom, but disaster
to the Kurdish people."
</P>
<P>
He accused the United States of staging air strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. officials said that the United States has
launched 17 missiles against the air defense sites in southern
Iraq early this morning, the second attack within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
More missiles were launched because the targets were not
destroyed completely in the initial strike, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration ordered U.S. forces to launch
missile attacks Tuesday on "selected air defense targets" in
southern Iraq in response to Iraqi army's weekend strike in the

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Calls for Better Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda today expressed concern over the overall degradation of
standards in the country's education system and asked the teaching
community to create a congenial climate for learning, the Press
Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite considerable progress, it is unfortunate that we have
not yet been able to fulfill our constitutional commitment of
providing free and compulsory education to all children up to the
age of 14," Gowda said while addressing a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Gowda urged the entire teaching community to pay special
attention to the educational needs of such sections of society as
the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, women and the disabled who
have not benefitted equally from the progress made in the field of
education.
</P>
<P>
At the primary and lower levels, he said, the children seemed
to be burdened with far too much academic load and often, the
syllabus was divorced from reality.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had adopted some measures to eradicate
illiteracy and realize the goal of universal access to elementary
education in the country. The success of government's policies
and reforms, he added, would ultimately depend on the commitment
and dedication of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said that one of the major problems at the primary level
was the high drop-out rates, especially among girls.
</P>
<P>
It was not only the enrollment of children, but their retention
in school and achievement of the identified minimum levels of
learning that would have a lasting impact, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The teachers play a crucial role in providing a congenial
climate for learning so that children are on their own attracted
to schools and non-formal learning centers and experience the joy
of learning, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that welfare of teachers and their
conditions of service were an important aspect which needed to be
continuously monitored by the government.

<HEADLINE> Further Chinese Cooperation With Asian Countries: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China agrees to greater
exchanges and co-operation with other Asian countries, Chinese
Premier Li Peng said here today at the opening ceremony of the
21st Century Forum's first conference.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is an Asian nation and its destiny is
closely linked with those of other Asian countries, and that
China's development can not be achieved without Asia, nor can the
development of Asia without China. China needs a stable and
prosperous Asia and Asia needs a stable and prosperous China.
</P>
<P>
China's economic links and exchanges with other Asian countries
date back to ancient times, Li pointed out, adding that "we have
similar long history and cultural heritage and have all had the
painful experience of being subjected to long-term aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Today, most of us are living in a period of rapid economic
growth, and ending backwardness has become our common objective,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to relations with other Asian countries and is engaged in
increasing friendly cooperation with them politically,
economically, scientifically, technologically, and
culturally. Both in foreign trade and direct overseas investment,
Asian countries and regions make up the largest share for China,
reaching 62 percent and 66 percent respectively in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China's total foreign trade volume will reach
400 billion US dollars, and its foreign economic and technological
exchanges and cooperation will grow even further.
</P>
<P>
"This will play a positive role in the economic development of
Asia," he said. "The economic revitalization of other Asian
countries, likewise, will provide new opportunities for the
economic development of China."

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Optimistic about Socialism in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, said
that the building of socialism in China is of great significance
for the development of the world and the progress of human society.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remark in an interview with Rainer Nahrendorf,
editor-in-chief of the Handelsblatt, the German daily financial
and business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Communist Party of China (CPC) has always held
that the fundamental tenets of Marxism should be combined with the
concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and construction.
</P>
<P>
It has also stuck to the principle of seeking truth from fact,
being realistic, and practice is the sole criterion for judging
truth, added Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this was the most fundamental principle for
the CPC in the past, and at present.
</P>
<P>
Whether in the revolutionary war period, or in peaceful
construction times, whenever the CPC adheres to the principle,
China's problems can be solved successfully, noted Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in history the CPC had experienced
detours, setbacks, and even made mistakes. In the final analysis,
these were attributed to losing contact with Chinese realities,
besides some objective reasons.
</P>
<P>
The point is that whenever mistakes were found they were
corrected in accordance with reality, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Under new historical conditions, the CPC, with reality as its
starting point, emancipated minds and made active explorations,
which resulted in the birth of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, said the NPC chairman.
</P>
<P>
The theory answered in a systematic way the question on
building socialism in an economically and culturally undeveloped
country like China, noted Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of this theory, he continued, the CPC
formulated the basic line at the primary stage of
socialism. Simply that was to take economic construction as the
core, and stick to the four cardinal principles, and the reform
and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
China's development and changes during the past years were
remarkable, said Qiao
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that Deng's theory and the CPC's basic line
are in line with Chinese conditions, and thus went deeply into the
 minds of Chinese people, the chairman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He held that only by taking this road, China can become a rich,
strong, democratic and modern socialist country with modern
civilization.
</P>
<P>
China will not draw back, for a draw-back leads to no way out,
stressed Qiao, adding that the whole CPC and the entire Chinese
people will not permit such a draw-back.
</P>
<P>
In proceeding, while advancing the reform and opening drive and
making new explorations, various interferences should be removed,
said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Deng once pointed out that China might be influenced by the
Right tendencies, while the deep-roots is the "Left" tendencies,
Qiao quoted, adding that China should be on guard against the
Right tendencies, but mainly, the "Left" tendencies.
</P>
<P>
"We must keep a clear mind to avoid making big mistakes, and if
problems crop up, we can correct them in a timely way", said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Now that the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics
has scored noticeable achievements, we firmly believe that the
prospects for the drive are wonderful, and is bound to enjoy a
greater success, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this is a long process demanding the efforts of
several generations.
</P>
<P>
The completion of building socialism in a big country with more
than one-fifth of world's population, is of great significance for
the development in the world and the progress of society, Qiao
stressed.

PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- France reiterated its worry over

<HEADLINE> Yemen Says: US Missile Attack on Iraq Unjustified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Yemen, which
has pursued the U.S. missile attack on Iraq, thinks that this
severe attack is unjustified, the Yemeni newspaper Al-Thawra said
in its editorial today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Yemen emphasizes its eagerness for the
sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, and for the
Iraqi people not to be subjected to any dangers or threats that
will add to their suffering, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra pointed out that the attacks launched by the
U.S. bombers and warships on Iraq have aroused a great deal of
worry and indignant reactions in the nations of the world which
are eager for the stability of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"These attacks", the paper continued, "seem to be something
unacceptable and unjustified, because they are a flagrant
interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and a violation of
the U.N. Charter and international laws, in addition to the fact
that they add to the suffering experienced by the Iraqi already
on account of the economic embargo laid on them."
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the U.S. -- by launching these attacks
-- has heavy humanitarian and moral responsibility to bear for
these regrettable developments," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> CPC's Leading Role in Building Socialist Democracy: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
voiced his conviction that a socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics is bound to be built up.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remark in an interview with Rainer Nahrendorf,
editor-in-chief of the Handelsblatt, the German daily financial
and business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said that the leading role in China of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) came into being during a long historical
process. Besides the CPC, there are eight democratic parties in
China.
</P>
<P>
"We practise a multi-party cooperation and political
consultation system, with the CPC as the party in power, and
democratic parties as the parties participating in the exercise of
political power, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this system, which was also formed in the
long historical process, is a system with Chinese characteristics,
which is not like western multi-party or two-party systems, nor
like a one-party system.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the eight democratic parties fought side by side
with the CPC in the democratic revolution. After the founding of
the People's Republic of China, they also made great contributions
to the recovery of the national economy, and socialist
transformation and construction.
</P>
<P>
At present, they are making joint efforts together with the CPC
to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, noted Qiao.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy of "long-term co-existence and mutual
supervision" and "treating each other with true sincerity and
sharing weals and woes", the CPC consults with the eight
democratic parties, supports their participation in the exercise
of political power and democratic supervision, and supports
members of democratic parties, and public figures without party
affiliation, to hold leading posts in the Chinese government, Qiao
noted.
</P>
<P>
Qiao cited China's NPC as an example, saying that there are
people from the eight democratic parties holding leading positions
in the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that this system, which can meet the
demands of Chinese conditions, are conducive to China's stability
and development, and "we will stick to this system in the future".
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that building a high-level socialist democracy is one
of China's basic goals and tasks.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said as early as at the end of the 1970s Deng Xiaoping
said that "without democracy, there will be no socialism and
socialist modernization".
</P>
<P>
In the past decade and more, Qiao said, "we pushed forward
political reform, while carrying out economic reform, and have
achieved remarkable progress".
</P>
<P>
From now on, "we will continue our efforts in these fields, in
a bid to institutionalize and legalize the democratic system, and
ensure the democratization of our country's political activities,"
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that China is a country with a feudal history
of thousands of years, and there are also other factors, so
democracy should be developed step by step in China, and should
conform to China's realities.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he is convinced that a socialist democracy with
Chinese characteristics is bound to be built up, as long as
unremitting efforts are made.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Reliable and detailed
documents from the past centuries were decisive for China in
launching its Three Gorges project and drafting the building
design, Chinese experts said today.
</P>
<P>
Li Dewan, Deputy Curator of the Archives of the Yangtze River
Water Conservation Committee, said that the time needed for a
feasibility study of the world biggest water conservation project
had been shortened by at least six to seven years with the help of
preserved historical records on the hydrological, geological and
seismic conditions of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Li is attending the ongoing 13th International Congress on
Archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the fixing of the height, storage capacity of
the reservoir, and power generation capacity of the Three Gorges
dam was based on research of flood records of the river spanning
the past 800 years, and 113 years of successive data on hydrology
surveys.
</P>
<P>
The geological documents of the Yangtze River indicated that
the building of the dam could not be influenced by water seepage,
because rock there is hard.
</P>
<P>
Li said this was the reason why Sandouping was finally chosen
as the dam site.
</P>
<P>
The dam, located at Yichang City of central China's Hubei
Province, will be the world biggest dam, with a height of 185
meters, and power generating capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The dam project is expected to be finished in 2009.
</P>
<P>
China began its feasibility study of the Three Gorges water
conservation project in the 1950s, with the project finally given
the go-ahead by the National Peoples' Congress in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yanming, an expert who has been studying archives for the
Three Gorges project in the past few years, said, "the records of
earthquakes in the past decades, and over 2,000 years of documents
indicate that the earth's crust at the Three Gorges area is
stable, without any threat of earthquakes, which provided sound
evidence for the selection of the dam site."
</P>
<P>
Deng added that the hydrological data of the Yangtze River and
the Hanjiang River, a major branch of the Yangtze River, helped
experts to come to the conclusion that the reservoir would not
become silted.

<HEADLINE> CPC Never to Become Socialist Democratic Party: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, said
that China's history and reality decreed that the Communist Party
of China (CPC) would never become a socialist democratic party.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the statement in an interview with Rainer Nahrendorf,
editor-in-chief of the Handelsblatt, the German daily financial
and business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that the social and historical roots of the
CPC's birth were completely different from that of western
socialist democratic parties. The CPC was born in the
disaster-ridden old China, which was a semi-colonial, semi-feudal
society.
</P>
<P>
After the CPC was born, it led Chinese people to establish a
new China through unyielding fight, in line with the principle of
the integration of the fundamental theory of Marxism, with the
concrete reality of China, said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China the CPC tried to solve the
problem of building socialism in China, especially from the end of
1970s. Then the CPC, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, sum up
historical experiences and took the road of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
Practice proved that this road is correct and has gained
support from the Chinese people, Qiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
In brief, the road that the CPC takes, and its line, principles
and policies, are the results of the practices of China's
revolution and construction after decades of struggle and
sacrifices by the Chinese people led by the CPC. The line, which
has been developed and tested by practice over many years, will be
carried forward in the years to come, said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Qiao stressed that at present, the CPC has friendly relations
with some socialist parties, socialist democratic parties and
their international organizations, but China's history and reality
determined that the CPC will never become a socialist democratic
party.

peace.
</P>
<P>
And Chinese people will always be trustworthy friends of the
people of Asia and other parts of the world, added the premier in
a speech in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To realize modernization, China, the world's most populous
developing country, needs to work hard for several more decades in
an international environment of lasting peace and stability,
particularly a good surrounding environment, he said at the

Forum".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan Expresses Dissatisfaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
voiced rejection of external interference in Iraq's internal
affairs while opposition parties and the public strongly condemned
the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The government, in a statement released after a cabinet
session Tuesday, stressed Jordan's firm position rejecting any
attempt to undermine the sovereignty of Iraq, the unity of its
people and its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
This was Jordan's reaction to Tuesday's U.S. missile attacks on
Iraqi targets which killed five people and injured 19 others.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the U.S. launched another 17 missiles from
three ships and one submarine in the Gulf at targets in southern
Iraq, where 27 missiles fell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
No official reaction for the fresh missile attacks has yet been
announced.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's government statement reiterated Jordan's policy that
"the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq must not be
subjected to any danger."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet expressed "grave concern" about the recent
escalation and the military operations, and warned that the
military actions "might take Iraq back to the cycle of violence
and counter-violence, with its various ethnic and religious groups
paying the price."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan stressed that "its territory has never and
will never serve as a base for any attack directed against any
Arab country or people," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti voiced
"denunciation of external interference in the internal affairs of
Iraq," Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Weiss told reporters after
meeting with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But members of the opposition in the Lower House of Parliament
went as far as condemning the U.S. attack on Iraq as "barbaric
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"We declare our absolute support for Iraq in its just stand in
the face of the American aggression, which aims at humiliating the
Iraqi people and implementing colonial plots to partition Iraq,"
said the opposition members in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They condemned "all countries which offered facilities to the
American forces, enabling them to achieve their aggressive ends,"
according to today's English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed dissatisfaction with the Arab countries and
international powers who kept silence on the U.S. missile attacks
in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the silence of the Arab regimes and the
international circles vis-a-vis this barbaric aggression," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the government issue a "condemnation of the
U.S. aggression and seek to end it at the international fora and
to work towards lifting the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
The centrist Al Ahd party issued a separate statement
describing the U.S. attacks as "unjustified".
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi army's movements in its northern part came "in
response to aggression from neighboring countries which
contradicts the commitment of the allied forces to protect Iraqi
territories from aggression and to maintain the unity of its
people," said the party.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, Jordan Times also justified the Iraqi troops
movements in the north and rebutted what U.S. President Bill
Clinton describe the U.S. dawn strike as a retaliatory act to
"make Saddam pay a price for the latest act of brutality" against
Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"In light of credible reports that Iran was intervening ... in
a bid to control northern Iraq for its own ends and objectives,
Baghdad felt compelled to arrest this outside intervention and
neutralize it by moving its land forces northward in a manner that
did not violate any single U.N. resolution for the ultimate
purpose of protecting its borders from foreign interferences," the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said the U.S. policy towards Iraq was incredible
and short-sighted, adding that "no doubt the U.S. cruise missile
attacks on Iraq was an escalation that could serve no practical
or positive purpose under the circumstances."

<HEADLINE> ESCAP SOM Meeting Opens in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today that many countries strongly oppose the
idea of linking core labor standards with trade and are against
discussion of such a linkage within the purview of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the senior official meeting (SOM) of
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission of the Asia
Pacific (UN-ESCAP), he said the WTO has no competence whatsoever
to undertake the promotion of basic human rights and human rights
standards as part of core labor standards.
</P>
<P>
He said the reasons for opposing the linkage are: the WTO is
the international trade organization aimed at accelerating trade
liberalization; The WTO is a contractual agreement among
governments based on rules and disciplines governing trade
relations; And it is also an enforcement body for specific
commitments in the trade area.
</P>
<P>
Studies to-date, Alatas added, indicate that there is no
empirical evidence demonstrating a clear and quantifiable linkage
between trade and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
Since the WTO was established on January 1, 1995, he said,
substantive progress has been achieved in the development of the
institutional underpinnings of the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round had indeed brought many improvements to the
multilateral trading system and to international trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ESCAP SOM, which was attended by more than 20
member countries and a number of international organizations, is
aimed to prepare for a WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore
scheduled for December 9-13 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP SOM will aim to sharpen the perception of member
countries on a number of major and new issues to be discussed in
the Singapore meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti MPs Hope US Attacks on Iraq Topple Saddam's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti parliamentary
members expressed their hope that the U.S. missile attacks against
Iraq would help topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion Tuesday night about the latest developments in
the Gulf following the first series of U.S. attacks against air
defense targets in southern Iraq, members of the National
Assembly of Kuwait welcomed the U.S. attacks with most of them
hoping that this operation would reverse Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Khaled al-Adwa, reflecting most of other MPs, said, "I
hope the U.S. is not practicing military war games in the region
as usual and this attack is not a kind of medicine taken only to
calm the pain."
</P>
<P>
Although it is not clear about the real intentions of the
U.S. president who is in the midst of his re-election campaign,
all Kuwaiti deputies are firm in their unequivocal support for the
operation, said another deputy Abdallah al-Naibari.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mubarak al-Duwailah, while expressing hope that the
attack should be accompanied by other steps to prevent the Iraqi
president from attacking vulnerable targets, said, "It is a very
serious message to Saddam about respecting U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the deputies also expressed their concern
that the operation would cause casualties to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
They said they wanted to believe that the U.S. attacks
targeting only military installations would not kill civilians.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Kuwaiti cabinet in a meeting expressed full
understanding of the U.S. attacks.
</P>
<P>
To many Kuwaiti deputies, the U.S. attack is a reminiscence of
the Desert Storm Operation launched by the U.S.-led allied forces
five years ago which liberated Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi
occupation. They hope that this attack would help topple the
Saddam regime in Iraq once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fired 17 missiles at the air defense targets in
southern Iraq for the second time in 24 hours early today to
destyoy the targets that survived the initial attack Tuesday,
which killed 5 people and wounded 19 others.

<HEADLINE> NPC Safeguarding People's Rights, Freedom: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China has attached great
importance to safeguarding the rights and freedom of people by
strengthening legislation, said Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the statement in Beijing on Tuesday, in an interview
with Rainer Nahrendorf, editor-in-chief of the Handelsblatt, the
German daily financial and business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In China, Qiao said, the people are the masters of the country
and society, and the citizens enjoy extensive rights and freedom
conferred upon them by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or more, China's NPC and its standing
committee have put great efforts into strengthening the work in
the field, according to Qiao.
</P>
<P>
At present, a legal system with the constitution as its core,
has taken shape to safeguard the citizens' rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
There is a chapter of "citizens' fundamental rights and
obligations" in the constitution, which clarifies the fundamental
rights of citizens, including freedom of speech, publications,
rallies, gatherings, parades, demonstrations and religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"We have amended the electoral law several times in accordance
with our experience to perfect the election system, and safeguard
the citizen's electoral rights," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
According to the current election law, not only political
parties and organisations can slate candidates for the People's
Congress, but the electorate, or delegates can also jointly
propose candidates, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
The direct elections for delegates to people's congress has
been expanded to county level.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard citizens' rights to sue government departments,
for violating their rights and requiring government compensation,
China has stipulated administration procedure law and a state
compensation law.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the citizens can participate in administration
at grassroots level, China has stipulated a law on the
organization of villagers' committees in rural areas, and a law on
the organization of neighborhood committee in the cities.
</P>
<P>
China has also made a series of laws on compulsory education,
labor, women's rights, children and people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"It is safe to say that China has been relatively complete with
laws to safeguard the citizen's rights and freedom," Qiao said,
adding that China will continue its efforts, and will continuously
perfect the system in accordance with the will of the people and
in the light of practice.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Unlikely to Attack Israel: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Iraq expert
said today that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is unlikely
to launch missile attacks, as during the Gulf war, against
Israel, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio following the second U.S. cruise
missile attack against Iraq early this morning, Amatzia Baram,
head of Haifa University's Middle East History Department, said
that Saddam Hussein does have the ability to attack Israel and
certainly it is not out of the question.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is believed to have a few missiles, maybe
six, maybe 16 or maybe 20, with few warheads, chemical and
biological, although not very effective.
</P>
<P>
Baram noted that, however, Saddam will do it "only if and when
he is really desperate. I don't think he is that desperate now. He
will get much to lose by doing that, so why should he?"
</P>
<P>
"Right now he manages not so badly. He has got Irbil.
He will withdraw heavy troops, but still in control of the
city. He can present this rightfully as a victory."
</P>
<P>
Washington announced early this morning that 17 missiles were
launched from three ships and one submarine in the Gulf at targets
in southern Iraq, where 27 missiles fell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the second U.S. air raid in Iraq, the leading
Israeli expert on Iraq said that Saddam may realize that
U.S. President Bill Clinton is serious in light of the forthcoming
elections. "My assessment is that Saddam doesn't want to go to
war against America all the way," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Having achieved something and taken Irbil, Saddam will
consider withdrawing heavy equipments," he said. "But I don't
think he will withdraw at this stage, maybe even later,
infantry commandos."
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at
Israel in an effort to draw it into the war and break up
the American-led coalition. The gas masks were distributed to
the public for fear that a chemical warfare should follow.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday
told the public that there is no reason for concern over an
Iraqi missile attack against Israel, crowds flooded to the army
gas mask distribution centers to get the equipment.

<HEADLINE> China's Improvement In Implementation of Laws: Qiao Shi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said that China has made relatively great improvements in the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remark during an interview with Rainer
Nahrendorf, editor-in-Chief of the Handelsblatt, the German daily
financial and business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The awareness of law, and ability to behave in accordance with
the law, have been gradually improving over the years on the part
of the government departments at all levels. Judicial and
administrative departments have taken pains to strictly abide by
the laws on the whole, and the awareness of officials and people
has been considerably strengthened, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
It will take a long period of time for China to formulate a
complete legal system, owing to historical reasons and present-day
reality, Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that some problems still exist concerning the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
"The neglect of law, and even overriding laws with
administrative power, are relatively serious in some localities
and departments," Qiao said. "And in some cases, some laws are not
carried out well."
</P>
<P>
"We have placed great emphasis on these problems and are taking
measures to solve them," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the judicial and administrative systems will be
reformed and perfected to strengthen the building of law
enforcement, and improve judicial and administrative performance,
Qiao stressed.
</P>
<P>
Systems for the investigation of law enforcement departments
and personnel, and related compensation are important measures,
Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, China has strengthened the supervision of law
enforcement, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao noted that the NPC National Committee sends out several
inspection teams every year to supervise law enforcement and
encourage relevant departments to improve their work.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that local people's congresses also take various
measures to supervise law enforcement. And standing committees of
people's congresses at all levels have set up special organs to
handle people's arraignments, appeals and prosecutions, as well as
related malpractice by departments, added Qiao.
</P>
<P>
The third major measure is profound and long-lasting law
education, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
China has completed two 5-year plans for the popularization of
laws, and started the third five-year plan this year, noted Qiao.
</P>
<P>
Qiao stressed that China will exert greater efforts to improve
the awareness of law, and the ability to act by the book by the
broad masses of cadres and people, especially leaders at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Plenum of the Eighth Standing Committee of the NPC
passed the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and Outline of
Long-term Goals by the Year 2010 this March, stressing "government
by law to build China into a socialist country with a sound legal
system".
</P>
<P>
We believe that, under the guidelines, further improvements
will be made in the implementation of the law, with concerted
efforts of both government departments and the people, and greater
achievements will be made in the building of the legal system,
Qiao said.

<HEADLINE> More Funds to Combat HIV/AIDS disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The central government has
vowed to further increase its funding for the fight against the
spread of HIV/AIDS in China, while stepping up the formulation of
a long-term strategy for the nationwide campaign to control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted Dai Zhicheng, director of the
disease control department under the Ministry of Public Health, as
saying that the State Council will soon gather more than 20
relevant governmental departments to discuss the current HIV/AIDS
situation in China and work out national policies for the next
five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the long-term national program on control of
HIV/AIDS will be reviewed at the meeting, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The program, drafted by the Ministry of Public Health, the
State Science and Technology Commission and the State Planning
Commission, will specify duties of different social sections and
set goals for AIDS-control activities.
</P>
<P>
Fewer HIV carriers have been detected in the first half of the
year compared with the same period the past two years, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, a total of 3,341 HIV-Positive cases
were reported in the country, including 117 AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
All known HIV transmission channels have been reported in this
country, with shared intravenous drug injection the leading factor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of venereal diseases
(VD) increased to 362,000 last year, rising by an annual rate of
18 percent, according to the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" quoted Dai as saying that the ministry is
planning to further improve its VD and HIV/AIDS surveillance
network, upgrade laboratory testing techniques and carry out
extensive publicity to increase public awareness of the risks.
</P>
<P>
HIV-testing laboratories are to be set up in each of the 30
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in China's inland
areas. Currently only half of them have laboratories equipped with
facilities that can accurately confirm HIV cases.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on AIDS prevention is due to open this
October to further increase local governments' awareness of the
issue and urge them to take immediate and forceful actions in the
work, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ministry of Public Health is to set up a National
Center for HIV/AIDS Control within this year to help implement
State policies in the field.
</P>
<P>
An international donors' conference will be held at about the
same time as World AIDS Day in December to draw more international
support for China's AIDS control program, said Dai, adding that
China's HIV/AIDS control efforts have already received increasing
support from international organizations in recent years.

BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
spoke highly of Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's role in the smooth
development of relations between China and Singapore.
</P>
<P>

Singapore's former Prime Minister, who is in Beijing to attend the
"21st Century Forum", sponsored by the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> South Pacific Forum Resumes France's Dialogue Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Pacific Forum today
resumed France's status as a dialogue partner of the organization
after near a year of suspension.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the summit of the forum that is
underway at the Outrigger resort in Majuro, capital of the
Republic of Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
Leaders and senior officials of the 16 South Pacific Forum
members decided that France would be able to take part in the
post-forum dialogue on September 6-7.
</P>
<P>
France was suspended from the post-forum dialogue on October 2,
1995 after it resumed nuclear test in the South Pacific region in
June last year.
</P>
<P>
"In light of France's permanent cessation of testing, and other
welcome measures...to comply with the Forum's position on testing,
Forum leaders have decided to lift the suspension with immediate
effect," the leaders said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the dialogue between the forum members and France will
have to be arranged separately from the main schedule of the
meeting. It might be held in the next few days or in the next few
weeks, a spokesman from the forum secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders looked forward to the resumption and further
development of a constructive relationship at regional level with
France," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, the resumption of France's dialogue
partnership received strong support from New Zealand Prime
Minister Jim Bolger who is also attending the current forum
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other dialogue partners of the post-forum meeting include
China, Canada, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Li Zhaoxing will
lead a six-member delegation to attend the dialogue meeting later
this week.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Newspapers Condemn U.S. Missile Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading Kenyan newspapers today
condemned the U.S. Tuesday missile attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"East African Standard" said in a commentary "this anti-Saddam
strategy will fail".
</P>
<P>
The commentary said "as expected, the US cruise missile attack
on Iraq has drawn mixed response. This time international support
has been limited unlike the case during the 1991 Gulf War."
</P>
<P>
"And contrary to what the US may consider as a successful
attack, the world has been exposed to the underlying weaknesses
in the West's containment policy against President Saddam
Hussein. These policies have helped Saddam entrench his
leadership over Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that "Arabs now invariably feel
threatened of this awesome military machine right on their
doorstep where to make decisions will depend on the feeling of
Bill Clinton and his Democrats who have been criticized for using
the raid as an election ploy."
</P>
<P>
"Kenya Times", the organ of the Kenyan ruling KANU party, also
carried a commentary, describing the U.S. action as "sheer
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"The reaction by Washington is not only excessive but uncalled
for. It also serves to heighten suspicions of many less mightier
nations on what to expect from a singular superpower whose goals
keep changing and interests continue infringing on the
sovereignty of other nations for selfish and hypocritical
interests," the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Last-Minute Dispute Disrupts Agreement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute dispute
disrupted an earlier agreement to hold a summit meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, it was revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are continuing intensive talks to resolve the
differences in a bid to nail down the crucial meeting, the
Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said the meeting could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
Local media all expected the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting to take
place on Tuesday, but it failed to take place.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, in an interview with
Israel Television Tuesday night, accused Netanyahu's lawyer
Yitzhak Molcho of disrupting an earlier agreement reached by him
and Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Dore Gold.
</P>
<P>
Erekat confirmed that an agreement on a Netanyahu-Arafat
meeting had been indeed reached on Monday, but Molcho expressed
misgivings about it during a meeting with Arafat in Gaza later
that night.
</P>
<P>
"We reached an understanding yesterday (Monday) with Dr. Gold
and to our surprise at 8 p.m. yesterday, another representative
from the Israeli government came to Mr. Arafat and said that Gold
was not authorized to make agreements," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the major difference between the two sides
remained the Hebron issue. Israel demanded an enlargement of the
Jewish enclave in Hebron and the expansion of joint
Israeli-Palestinian patrols to Palestinian-controlled areas of the
town.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side insisted Israel should implement
the former agreement on Hebron redeployment. Israel protested
the change of mind on the part of the Palestinians, who
they said had earlier agreed to discuss the revision of
Hebron pullout.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing contacts are still conducted under the auspices of
the U.N. coordinator of the territories Terje Larsen and his
Norwegian diplomat wife Mona Juul. The couple have been in
constant touch with U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis
Ross and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
Pressure continues mounting today as Netanyahu plans to visit
Washington next Monday to hold talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who reportedly has refused to meet him if he fails to
meet Arafat by then.
</P>
<P>
In another development, it was reported that Arafat plans to
fly to Rome today unless there is last-minute progress in the
talks which will make his meeting with Netanyahu possible.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Drops Dismissal of Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government last
night gave in to pressure of striking civil servants and withdrew
dismissals of thousands of its employees who had defied an order
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro, however, said the government workers would not be paid
for the duration of the work stoppage, which started on August
19.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants, who include nurses, doctors, magistrates
and fire fighters, were demanding salary hikes of up to 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The strike paralysed vital services, especially the already
limping health delivery system, justice and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the government has agreed to give a 20 percent
increment.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of striking Zimbabwean civil servants said last night
they disagreed with the government conditions for the
reinstatement of fired members and would not make the
confirmation of the end of the strike.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to give a position as of now because the offer
by the government is below what we were expecting as the
negotiating team,'' said a striking leader said.
</P>
<P>
The striking committee is expected to address the civil servants
at Harare's Africa Unity Square this morning.

<HEADLINE> World's Earliest Paper Unearthed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A irregular shaped piece of
linen paper has been claimed by Chinese experts as the earliest
paper ever found in the world.
</P>
<P>
Their deduction indicates that China's paper-making history is
200 years earlier than the generally accepted time of China's
invention of paper-making techniques.
</P>
<P>
The piece of paper, the size of the palm of a hand, is being
exhibited during the ongoing 13th International Congress on
Archives in Beijing. It was unearthed from the ruins of an ancient
staging post building in Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
It is just one of the unearthed pieces of paper made in China's
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD).
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts held that the paper was made during the period
73 BC to 1 BC.
</P>
<P>
Among several piles of blank paper, a piece of paper with 30
Chinese characters written in an ancient style of calligraphy of
Western Han Dynasty was discovered.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists said they were the writings of records
of mail deliveries some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Paper-making experts said that China's paper-making technique
was not mature at the time, some pieces are quite rough.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi'an, Secretary General of Gansu Provincial Society on
Archives said, in fact, in Eastern Han Dynasty (25 A.D. -- 220),
Cai Lun, who has been regarded as the inventor of China's
paper-making technique, improved the paper-making technique after
summarizing the past generations' experience of paper-making.
</P>
<P>
Paper-making, printing, gun powder, and compasses have been
widely acknowledged as four major inventions in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
Before the making of paper, ancient Chinese used bones,
tortoise shells, bamboo slips, cloth and silk as materials for
writing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Foreign Trade Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain are to
establish three special working groups under the Sino-British
General Working Commission to consolidate cooperation in the
chemical industry, aviation and energy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during talks in Beijing today between Wu
Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,
and Ian Lang, British secretary of state for trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Wu said that China and Britain are
economically complementary with great potential for developing
trade.
</P>
<P>
Britain is ranked third in European Union countries as far as
trade volume with China is concerned.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, bilateral trade was worth 2.181
billion US dollars, 5.4 percent higher than the same period of
last year, and China's exports and imports amounted to 1.338
billion and 843 million US dollars, 6.3 percent and 3.8 percent
more than those of the previous year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said China welcomed British businesses to invest in
China, and hoped that they will make use of China's preferential
policies towards central and west China, by increasing their
investment in those regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from 1979 to the end of June this year,
Britain launched 1,673 investment projects in China, with
contractual and actually-used capital worth 10.92 and 2.71 billion
US dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain's investment in China is the highest in the
countries of the European Union, Wu noted, it is still large
compared with Britain's overall overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
Lang said that British business circles were very interested in
investing in China, and his government will support British
companies to enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Lang is here as guest of Wu.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Approves New Pork Import Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
endorsed a scheme to import live pigs and pork to ease the current
domestic shortage, despite strong criticism from local pig
raisers.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme worked out by the Commerce Ministry, Thailand
will import 40,000 live pigs per month from Malaysia until the end
of this year and a significant amount of pork from China.
</P>
<P>
The import tariffs on the two items will be reduced from 10
percent to one percent and 16 percent to one percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement came after the release of the August inflation
figure of 5.5 percent, partly due to rising meat prices, local
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry officials said that the imports are
necessary as local pig raisers failed to fulfill a promise to keep
the price of live pork below 43 baht (1.7 U.S. dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The current price of live pigs is around 45 baht (1.8 dollars),
which fuels up the pork price to 85-90 baht (3.2-3.6 dollars) per
kilo, they said.
</P>
<P>
A reasonable price for pork should be below 75 baht (3 dollars)
per kilo, they added.
</P>
<P>
Thinakorn Seriburi, president of the Swine Raisers Association
of Thailand, said that the imports will not bring a negative
impact on local raisers for the time being, because the live pig
price in Malaysia is 1.6 dollars per kilo and when transport costs
are added, imports could not compete with local pigs.
</P>
<P>
However, Thinakorn noted that the imports will have a
psychological impact on the raisers and they will lack confidence
in future prices.

COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have
arrested a man who planted one of three bombs which ripped through
a train loaded with office workers on July 24 at Dehiwela near the
capital Colombo, police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the 23-year-old Savarimuttu

SOFIA, Septmber 3 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian who hijacked a
Bulgarian passenger plane was arrested tonight, less than an hour
after the plane landed at the Gardermoen airport, about 95
kilometers from Oslo, Norway's capital.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Nazir Abdullah, 28, had claimed he had a

When the plane landed in Varna, the hijacker released all 149

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US Attacks on Iraq, Criticizes Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran today continued to
condemn the U.S. missile attack on Iraq and called it a political
move by the White House to bolster U.S. President Bill Clinton's
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi also criticized Iraq for
providing excuses for the United States to maintain its illegal
presence in the region and take military action in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government also fears that the massive presence of
the American forces constitute a major threat to its security and
would lead to a military attack on itself.
</P>
<P>
Many local newspapers published editorials, terming the U.S.
attacks on Iraq a "flagrant violation of international law," and
calling on the regional countries to hold an emergency meeting to
discuss the northern Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the U.S. forces fired some 27 cruise missiles on
"selected air defense targets" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, U.S. officials said in Washington that 17
missiles were fired from three ships and one submarine in the
Gulf, targeting Iraqi air defense systems in southern Iraq,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi denied in a report carried by the English daily Iran News
that Iran has any troops inside Iraq, saying that Iran is
watching the situation in northern Iraq very closely and will do
its best to prevent the repetition of the tragic mass exodus of
Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Tehran Times noted in its editorial that
the U.S. attacks are considered an overt aggression, violation of
international law and infringement upon the sovereignty of an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the U.S. attack have not really been
aimed at checking the military operations in Iraq because the
U.S. missiles hit targets in southern Iraq whereas the Iraqi
military operations were carried out in the northern part of that
the country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it added, the Iraqi military operations in Kurdistan
can not be viewed as an act contravening the U.S.-sponsored U.N.
Resolution 688 on Iraq because the resolution does not provide for
a "no drive zone" in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Although military measures will not yield a concrete solution
to the Kurdish issue, Iraq should be allowed to exercise its
sovereignty over its territory, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S. by launching the missile attack has not
only infringed upon Iraq's sovereignty, but also arbitrarily
expanded the southern "no-fly zone" from south of the 32nd
parallel to south of 33rd parallel, a distance of some 50
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The measure will boil down to the fact that Saddam Hussein
will no longer be able to use the air base he has been using so
far. Again, it should not be forgotten that the above zone is in
the south and has nothing to do with the military operations in
the north, it added.

BRASILIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando

The U.N. Security Council today decided to make no changes in
the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The council conducted a 60-day regular review of Iraqi
compliance with the obligations imposed by U.N. Resolution 687
which was adopted by the Security Council on April 3, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to hold further consultations on Iraq
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chile also expressed concerns over the U.S. missile raid.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the Chilean
government is deeply concerned over the country's peace mission in
Iraq. A foreign ministry spokesman said that his country will
continue its peace mission in Iraq but will closely follow the
development of events in the Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign minister also appealed to the U.N. Security
Council to examine the situation in Iraq and take a definitive
position.
</P>
<P>
Chile is participating in the Group for Peace which is carrying
out a U.N.-designated mission of verifying the disarmament on the
part of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala lamented the U.S. missile attacks which left at least
five Iraqis dead and 19 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said that the
U.S. military actions against Iraq are alarming but not surprising
since there was sufficient evidence to anticipate the increase in
tension.
</P>
<P>
Cuba blamed the U.S. missile attacks as a criminal aggression.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minister deputy spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol
said that the U.S. actions violated the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The arbitrary use of force was excessive and unjustified,
Ferriol said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 27 cruise missiles were launched Tuesday from B-52
bombers which took off from Guam in the Far East while a second
round of missiles were fired from three U.S. Navy ships and a
submarine, all from the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Confirms Second Strike at Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
late on Tuesday that it had fired cruise missiles at Iraqi air
defense sites for the second time in 24 hours, because critical
targets were not destroyed in the initial raid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military forces carried out additional strikes against
Iraqi air defense sites located below the 33rd parallel, White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"This operation is designed to eliminate sites not destroyed in
Tuesday morning's initial cruise missile attack.
</P>
<P>
"Like the initial strike, tonight's attack is necessary to
ensure the safety of aircraft and crews operating in the expanded
no-fly zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the second attack was approved by
President Bill Clinton, who ordered "to ensure we have completely
taken out Saddam Hussein's air defense network".
</P>
<P>
An official said this was a re-strike. "We have to go back and
get what we missed."
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the follow-up
strike from three U.S. warships and one submarine in the Gulf,
Pentagon sources said.
</P>
<P>
The three warships were identified as the destroyer USS
Russell, destroyer USS Hewitt and guided missile destroyer USS
Laboon. Submarine USS Jefferson City took part in the missile
firing.
</P>
<P>
The administration officials said it was decided that Iraq's
rebuilt air defense network had to be damaged as much as possible
as it is needed to protect U.S pilots when they fly over Iraq in
any further effort against the Gulf nation.
</P>
<P>
"It is to ensure that we can rule the skies over Iraq," they
said. "If it is successful, there will be no way he (Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein) can get to Jordan and he could mount
another attack against Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
The second strike began at 8 p.m. EDT. Officials had desired
to wait until the long-flying weapons had reached their targets
before releasing any information about the strike. But word
leaked out to reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, 27 cruise missiles were fired from B-52
bombers which took off from Guam in the Far East to execute the
initial strike.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Potash Giant to Buy U.S. Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fertilizer giant
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire its U.S. rival Arcadian Corp. for 1.18
billion U.S. dollars in cash and stocks.
</P>
<P>
The combination will create the world's largest integrated
producer and marketer of the three nutrients plants needed to
survive, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Potash, with headquarters in Saskatoon, Canada, is the world's
leading producer of phosphate and potassium-based fertilizers.
Arcadian, based in the U.S. city of Memphis, is North America's
top producer of nitrogen fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Potash Corp. will pay 25 dollars to 27
dollars a share, providing 12.25 per share in cash and the rest in
its own common stock.
</P>
<P>
The merger will be subject to approval by the shareholders of
the Arcadian Corp. and regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Nitrogen, the third primary nutrient, will complete our
existing product portfolio of potash and phosphate, providing
synergies as well as growth opportunities," Potash's President
Chuck Childers said.
</P>
<P>
Potash Corp. now accounts for 20 percent of the world's annual
production of potash. It posted record profits of 84 million
dollars during the first six months this year.

fallen short of its goal and "this is what we would call a mop-up
operation".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said in a written
statement: "This operation is designed to eliminate sites not
destroyed in Tuesday morning's initial cruise missile attack."
</P>
<P>
In all, the United States fired 17 Tomahawk cruise missiles
from three warships and one submarine from the Gulf in the
follow-up strike.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, 27 missiles were launched from B-52 bombers
and warships at the Iraqi air defense sites.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said President Bill Clinton gave the Pentagon the
go-ahead for the second strike on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the second missile strike would help reduce risks to
U.S., British and French pilots enforcing a newly expanded no-fly
zone in southern Iraq, which goes into effect on Wednesday at 12
p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
"We want to guarantee that our pilots have every opportunity to
fly safely over the expanded no-fly zone," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton earlier announced that the U.S. is extending the
"no-fly zone" in Iraq to deny Iraqi military flights from the
Baghdad suburbs south to the Iraqi border with Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Many Japanese Support Cut in U.S. Military Presence: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 80 percent of Japanese
nationwide responding to a newspaper poll support a cut in
U.S. military presence in Okinawa Prefecture, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a survey of people nationwide conducted Friday and Saturday,
Mainichi Shimbun found that 78 percent of the respondents support
a cut in the U.S. military presence in the southwestern island
prefecture, the Kyodo news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The poll covered 4,236 voters selected at random nationwide, of
whom 66 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
In a separate survey of Okinawan residents Saturday and Sunday,
which covered 1,171 voters, Asahi Shimbun discovered an identical
percentage favoring such reductions.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 69 percent of the respondents said they
will cast a vote on a prefectural referendum to be held Sunday
over whether to support a cut in U.S. bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
In the Mainichi poll, 84 percent of the respondents living
outside Okinawa oppose the relocation of some of the bases to
their localities, despite that fact that 78 percent of the
respondents support a cut in U.S. bases in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi poll also showed 81 percent of the respondents
support the Okinawa prefectural referendum, and 75 percent said
that the scale of the U.S. military presence in Japan should be
cut.

<HEADLINE> Gray Economy Expands Sharply in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Gray economy has been expanding
sharply in the Czech Republic over recent years, causing a "gray"
income to make up 10 to 15 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP), Czech economists said.
</P>
<P>
The economists estimated that income from gray economy totals
150 billion koruna (5.56 billion U.S. dollars) annually on the
average in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, a World Bank report said the income from "gray
economy" in the Czech Republic has already reached 18 percent of
its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Gray economy mainly includes unlawful contracts and
non-licensed operations and trading. It is routine for those
involved in gray economy to dodge taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Czech authorities adopted tougher measures and levied more
than 2 billion koruna (741 million dollars) of taxes from gray
markets in 1995, the local press said.
</P>
<P>
Fines on people engaged in operations of gray economy rose to
more than 1.5 billion koruna (5.56 million dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of the swell of gray economy, the gap
between the rich and the poor becomes increasingly wide in the
country and the normal performance of the national economy has
been affected, said the local press.
</P>
<P>
People owning property worth 2 million koruna (some 74,000
dollars) or more accounted for more than four percent of the
republic's population in 1994, compared with 0.1 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow increase of wages, bank savings in the Czech
republic soar by 20 percent every year mainly due to the gray
economy expansion and currently hit 390 billion koruna (14.44
billion dollars), putting great pressures on the normal market.
It is believed that those who are active on the gray market save
most.
</P>
<P>
However, gray economy is a common occurrence around the world.
The incomes from gray economy currently make up 40 percent of
Russia's GDP, 30 percent of Greece's, 20 percent of Italy's and 10
percent of both the United States' and Germany's.

BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Air raid sirens blared out
here in the Iraqi capital early this morning as the United States
fired cruise missiles at Iraqi targets for the second time in 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Air raid sirens went off just before dawn, but seemed to have
caused no panic to the residents, who began their new day amid
reports on a second round of missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced earlier this morning that 17 missiles were
launched from three ships and one submarine in the Gulf at targets
in southern Iraq, where 27 missiles fell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said that the first strike had
fallen short and two of the four Iraqi air defense targets had to
be struck again.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has so far defied the
U.S. missile attack, which killed 5 people and wounded 19 others
on Tuesday. There was no report on casualties in the second strike
so far.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam ordered his troops to shoot down foreign
aircraft in response to U.S. declared attempt to expand the no-fly

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made all-out efforts
to fight and prevent the spread of AIDS, the most deadly disease
of the century, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has been launching all kinds of
AIDS-awareness campaigns across the country.
</P>
<P>
AIDS-prevention programs are broadcast nationwide and about 30
billion dongs (about 2.7 million U.S.dollars) have been invested
in blood test kits for hospitals and blood-test centers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a project is under construction, which is to take
care of AIDS patients and to provide advice for them. But reports
said the project could house only half of the patients in bad need
of care and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 4,200 HIV/AIDS cases (including 80
foreigners) have been detected in 40 of the country's 53 cities
and provinces by August 24, and 184 victims have died.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city now has reported 1,550 HIV carriers and 200
AIDS sufferers, the highest number in a city followed by Khanh Hoa
with 350 victims. There are 25 people in Hanoi found to be HIV

<HEADLINE> Official Report Exonerates Indian PM from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- An official report prepared
by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) exonerating Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda from phone-tapping charges is likely to
be presented to him on Wednesday, The Times of India said.
</P>
<P>
According to a highly-placed official in the CBI, the report
has also stated that some reports alleging phone-tapping of
various political leaders were altogether "wrong and baseless."
</P>
<P>
CBI sources said that the report is currently with CBI Director
Joginder Singh who, in turn, is expected to hand it over to the
prime minister today.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, the CBI initiated a probe after the prime
minister ordered them to conduct comprehensive investigations to
verify these allegations on phone-tapping.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked the CBI to find out the truth about
the allegations to "clear any doubts on the matter."
</P>
<P>
The phone-tapping controversy had raised a furor in parliament
last month when it was reported that a number of Congress party
leaders such as former prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao were
being subjected to telephone-tapping.
</P>
<P>
It had also been alleged that the phones of major Bharatiya
Janata Party leaders such as L. K. Advani and Atal Behari Vajpayee
were being tapped.

<HEADLINE> NAM Needs to Play New Role: Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said today the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) is facing the challenge of recovering the
initiative it has made since its 35 years of existence and should
take the lead on debate about development.
</P>
<P>
While celebrating the 35th anniversary of NAM, Cuban First
Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos said the arrogance of those
who are trying to impose a new or unjust world order is the
biggest challenge for the NAM movement.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that solidarity should be given priority since
aggression against one NAM country should be seen as an aggression
against all.
</P>
<P>
Bolanos added that "whoever does not understand this today will
pay the consequences tomorrow". He mentioned the enactments in
the United States of the Helms-Burton and d'Amato-Kennedy Bills as
an obvious example of disdain of people's rights.
</P>
<P>
He stressed NAM's role during the de-colonization period, its
contribution to the elimination of apartheid and its initiatives
to invigorate the international economic agenda throughout its
more than 3 decades of existence.
</P>
<P>
The worsening of the policy of the north against the poor
south, the interest in imposing a single model on the third world
and the attempt to convert the United Nations into a vehicle of
measures, sometimes brutal ones, "oblige us to rethink the future
actions of the NAM", he said.

Stein said President Alvaro Arzu's government would have

understand that the action was taken after all diplomatic channels
had been exhausted".

<HEADLINE> Thailand Enlists ASEAN Support for Dried Fruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is persuading the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to send a letter to
pretest against the European Union's plan to increase tariffs on
dried fruits imports from Thailand, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Songsak Saicheua, first secretary of Thailand's mission to the
European Union, said that Thailand will seek the help of ASEAN
members as well as other developing countries to stall the EU
plan.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission recently announced a plan to raise the
tariff rates on dried fruit imports from Thailand, Taiwan and the
Philippines from 8 percent to 22-26 percent, saying the dried
fruits would be transferred to another tariff category due to
their sugar content.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the EU customs re-classification as a disguised
form of protectionism, Songsak said that Thailand will fight to
get the EU to drop its decision.
</P>
<P>
Thailand began exports of dried fruits to Europe just years
ago, which are growing rapidly this year. Analysts believe that
the growing exports triggered the EU move to pile up trade
barriers for the commodities.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's dried fruit exports totaled 32 million US dollars in
value last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military on Riot Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) has asked his countrymen to respond
with a clear mind to the recent announcement of a human rights
group's findings on the victims of the July 27 riot.
</P>
<P>
"People have to be able to respond to it with a clear mind so
that there will not be any incorrect interpretation particularly
in the case of the 74 missing people in the July 27 riot," the
ABRI's socio-political affairs chief, Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid, told
the local press after a seminar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said people had to accept first the result of the finding
properly and should not take it as final.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the National Commission on Human Rights released
the preliminary findings, saying that five people died, 149 were
injured and 74 others missing during and after the July 27 riot.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the military announced that four people died
and 28 wounded during the riot. But it has not given the official
number of missing.
</P>
<P>
The riot broke out on July 27 after a faction of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) took over the party headquarters which were
then controlled by supporters of the PDI leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
Hamid said "we have to focus our attention not on how to find
out the missing persons but on how to follow up the case."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hamid termed the missing of the people as a "normal"
consequence, saying that "maybe they went traveling."

<P>
BUCHAREST, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of Meningitis in
Romania has taken a death toll of 17 people lead to the
hospitalization of 303 others, mostly in the capital city, a
Health Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead were between 64 and 74 years of age, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Romanian government has approved the
allocation of 400 million lei (about 130,000 U.S. dollars) to help
prevent the disease from further spreading.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is believed to have been caused by virus carriers
from Cyprus, where more than 300 people have been hospitalized
with the disease over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Poor food hygiene in Romania also quickened the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the membranes,
especially as the result of infection by bacteria or viruses.

<HEADLINE> More Investment for Production of Top-grade Bearings Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 4 (Xinhua) --China is calling for foreign
investments to increase its production of high-grade bearings,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The demand for the more costly bearings is high and the country
wishes to reduce imports of them, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited an official in charge of machine components
under the Ministry of Machinery Industry as saying that
investments supporting the production of low-grade bearings will
be stopped because of over-supply.
</P>
<P>
China spent 174.63 million U.S. dollars last year on importing
high-grade bearings -- two and a half times the 70 million
U.S. dollars spent for 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, low-noise and built-in bearings used
in computers and air-conditioners and those used in cars, aviation
and space are in short supply in China. Some 80 percent of these
bearings are now bought from foreign market.
</P>
<P>
China plans to arrange special loans to update 15 obsolete
bearing-makers, said the official, adding that the country will no
longer approve the establishment of new foreign-funded firms
making general-use bearings during the coming five years.

COCHABAMBA, Bolivia, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The war against
poverty is of the greatest priority in Latin America, Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said today in the inauguration
of the summit of the Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest priority, our highest objective is the war
against poverty" which the president described as one of the major
causes of the destruction of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Physical and economic integration in the region is making
progress with unusual speed and intra-regional trade has increased
spectacularly, but poverty persists, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The rate of the economic growth in Latin America is the second
highest in the world after that in Asia and democracy is firmer
and more vigorous in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
He offered a three-tiered formula for fighting poverty: to give
political power to the people through local and community
governments, to put decisions on education and health in the
people's hands and offer the poor small loans and technology.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, nearly half of the 450 million Latin
Americans live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said that he is confident that
liberty, human rights and social justice will prevail in Latin
America, and education and health will receive priority there.
</P>
<P>
Twelve leaders of the 14 Rio Group countries attended the
two-day summit in Cochabamba, 400 kilometers southeast of Bolivian
capital La Paz.
</P>
<P>
As for drug trafficking, the Bolivian president said that all
countries should take part in the combat against this social
scourge.
</P>
<P>
About the environment, Sanchez de Lozada declared that there is
the conviction that economic development should be compatible with
nature.
</P>
<P>

challenges in the economic, political and social fields in the
next few years.

CANBERRA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said this morning that Australia understood and

the Australian Associated Press reported from Majuro, capital of
The republic of Marshall Islands.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who is attending the South Pacific Forum in Majuro,
said although Australia had not been notified before the U.S.
action, this was understandable in the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that the number of countries that were
in fact consulted in advance were very limited, including the
United Kingdom whose refueling facilities at Diego Garcia were
used by the B52s," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a limited military strike quite specifically designed to
reduce Iraq's air capacity," the prime minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany will increase investment
in Ukraine and provide fund to help overcome the economic crisis
of this east European country, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said here
today.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko,
Kohl said Germany will, through a Ukrainian commercial bank,
provide 15 million marks (about 10.14 million dollars) on a
seven-year term to support the country's investment projects.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Ukraine set up a fund to finance its small and
medium-sized enterprises and a credit bank, for which Germany will
provide a total of 40 million marks (about 27 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Lazarenko also discussed Ukraine's policies on imports
from Germany, its ties with the European Union and the possibility
of a German loan of 1 billion marks (about 675.4 million dollars)
to help make up for its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a number of contracts today on the
production of new locomotive engines and combine harvesters, and
on upgrading Ukraine's Odessa airport.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which is Ukraine's most important trading partner in
the European Union, has invested 174 million dollars in the former
Soviet republic since 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials said late
today that the United States has launched a second round of cruise
missile attacks against Iraqi air defense sites within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
More missiles were launched because targets were not destroyed
completely in the initial strike, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon said a total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the
second strike from three U.S. Navy ships and one submarine, all
from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven cruise missiles were launched earlier today from
B-52 bombers which took off from Guam.
</P>
<P>
A military source said the bomb damage from the first strike
was not as expected. "We need to go back and get what we missed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said U.S. President Bill Clinton has granted the
military the authority to hit the targets again if necessary, a
step that would further dampen Iraq's ability to strike back at
U.S. aircraft or other forces.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Rejects U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of
the Rio Group countries today declared their "energetic rejection"
of the Helms-Burton Law imposed by the United States against Cuba
in March.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Law "contravenes standards that govern the
coexistence among countries, ignores the fundamental principle of
respect for sovereignty and violates international law," the
presidents said in a draft declaration at the 10th summit of the
Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit held in the city of Cochabamba, 400
kilometers southeast of La Paz, the Rio Group leaders reiterated
their "objection to all attempts to impose unilateral sanctions of
extra-territorial nature."
</P>
<P>
The United States enacted the Helms-Burton Law in an attempt to
frighten foreign investments away from Cuba through sanctions
against non-U.S. companies doing business with assets confiscated
from U.S. citizens on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We stress the importance of the unanimous opinion expressed by
the Inter-American Legal Committee of the Organization of American
States (OAS) in the sense that the bases and the eventual
application of that law do not conform with international law,"
they added.

<P>
HEFEI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Paralyzed Fang Jinmei is
repaying society for the friendly help given by neighbours over
the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
She has made 100 schoolbags for poor students in Changfeng
County, in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Fang worked in a textile mill in Shanghai, but in 1988, when
she was 40, she suffered from cancer in vertebral nerve. She
underwent surgery several times, which saved her life but sadly
left her paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Fang suffered again, this time
from breast cancer. The cost of surgery was the last straw which
almost broke her family's back.
</P>
<P>
When workers at the Shanghai No. 15 Textile Mill heard about
the family's desperate plight they, and her neighbors, donated
over 10,000 yuan to cover her surgery fees.
</P>
<P>
In the process of recovery Fang decided to do something for
society, despite being severely handicapped with her
disability. With her weak hands, she began to sew school-bags for
school boys and girls in the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
She spent six to seven hours a day sewing, enduring the hot
weather and the pain of festering bed sores.
</P>
<P>
Several months later Fang finished the work. She was so happy
when the Shanghai municipal government decided to send the bags to
100 pupils in the Gudui Hui Nationality Primary School.
</P>
<P>
Changfeng County is one of the poorest counties in China, where
more than 5,000 children are unable to go to school.

Costa Rica exported 240.86 million U.S. dollars worth of coffee
beans between January and July 1996 versus the 268.97 million
dollars worth of exports posted for the same period last year.
</P>

Local economists attributed the reduction mostly to the low
prices of coffee beans on international markets.

<P>
CARACAS -- Production in Venezuela's garment industry decreased
27 percent between July 1995 and July 1996 as a result of a
contraction in the domestic market.

A report by the Venezuelan Garment Industry Chamber attributed
the reduction to the foreign currency restrictions imposed between
September 1995 and April 1996, to the drop in the purchasing power
as a whole, to low tariffs on textiles and clothing made in other
countries and to the counterfeiting of brand names which affects
the competitiveness of the products.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Industrial production in Argentina increased by
3.4 percent in July compared with the same month in 1995,
according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Celebrated Chinese acrobat
Feng Jiushan has set a new world record in high-wire walking, by
crossing a 730.22-meter cable over Hukou Waterfalls on the Yellow
River in 35 minutes and 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the Shanghai Great World Guinness Center said that
according to a video recording of the event, Feng has broken the
record set by Canadian-American "prince of the air" Jay Cochrane,
who walked a 640-meter cable across the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River in 58 minutes last year.
</P>
<P>
Feng achieved his goal three days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Feng stepped calmly onto the raindrop covered
cable with a 10-meter balancing pole in hands on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of spectators lined both banks of the Yellow River to
cheer Feng. They waved colorful flags and beat drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
The wind speed was beyond three meters per second, which made
the cable swing. Feng sang the Chinese National Anthem while
walking swiftly to the other side.
</P>
<P>
He also did some fascinating footwork while on the cable,
including balancing on one foot.
</P>
<P>
He reached the other side of the bank after stopping midway for
a short pause.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Guinness World Record office has decided to
report Feng's new world record to the headquarters in Britain of
the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
Cochrane has not given any comment on Feng's world record.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has called on
the United Nations to step in to help solve the latest
developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger, now in Majuro of the Marshal Islands
for a South Pacific Forum meeting, made the position clear after
the U.S. missile attack against Iraq last night.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by a local TV report today as saying that the NZ
government would like to see the UN Security Council get involved
and ensure that there is an objective view of the events in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Don Macknnon has expressed NZ
support for the missile strikes, but the backing was seen as
lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
He called on the UN Security Council to meet promptly to
consider and formulate a response to the developments in Iraq.
This stance has been seen as an indication that the NZ government
believes the U.S. should work through the UN rather than taking a
unilateral move.

<P>
WUHAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 52,000 primary and
middle school students in flood-stricken areas in central China's
Hubei province have returned to school, thanks to efforts of local
educational departments.
</P>
<P>
More than 9,300 schools in the province suffered losses during
this year's serious floods, which damaged thousands of classrooms
and over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars) worth of
books, desks and chairs.
</P>
<P>
Total economic loss reached 1.2 billion yuan (about 150 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
With help from local governments and educational departments,
some schools were rebuilt after the floods. However, many schools
are still flooded with water because of the higher water level in
the Yangtze River, lakes and areas hit by the most serious floods.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and educational departments borrowed
residential houses to use as temporary classrooms or sent students
from flood-hit areas to other schools, and some towns even bought
tents to use as makeshift schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hubei provincial education committee raised 500,000
(62,500 US dollars) yuan to help poor students.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Up on New York Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The turmoil in Iraq sent oil
prices sharply higher today, but analysts said the rise shouldn't
have much impact on consumers.
</P>
<P>
Ample stockpiles are expected to help stabilize prices, which
rose about two U.S. dollars a barrel overnight on reports the
United Nations delayed the sale of Iraqi oil in response to that
country's attacks on Kurds in U.N.-designated safe zones in
southern Iraq early today.
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for
delivery in October settled at 23.40 U.S. dollars, up 1.15 U.S.
dollars from Friday. Prices eased from their highs today.
</P>
<P>
Refined petroleum products also shot up, but they too retreated
from their highs of the day.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq pact would have allowed Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollar worth of oil over six months -- about 700,000 barrels
a day -- to buy food and medicine for its people, hard-hit by six
years of U.N. sanctions imposed following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Traders had anticipated the Iraqi oil would hit the
markets by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Prices were also higher overseas.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Considering Big Rate Hike: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Policy makers of the U.S.
central bank is considering a sharper-than-expected interest-rate
increase this month, unless clear signs of slower growth emerged
in the next three weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
If economic data in coming weeks suggest an overheating
economy, the Federal Reserve is intending to raise the Fed-funds
rate by one-half a percentage point, or twice what the markets
anticipate, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The central bank could act as soon as its next policy meeting
on September 24, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which rekindled inflation worries among investors,
sent the Dow Jones industrial average lower this morning.
</P>
<P>
Last week's economic data eroded investor confidence that the
Fed won't need to hike its lending rates to slow the economy and
inflation. Two weeks ago, the Fed left rates unchanged amid
indications that economic growth was slowing on its own.
</P>
<P>
But higher rates won't be welcome in the White House, which the
paper said is counting on a strong economy to blunt Republican
criticism and carry President Bill Clinton to a second term.
</P>
<P>
However, officials, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, expressed their growing concern about inflation which
may be picking up later this year. "You have to lean very hard
against any tendency for inflation to rise," said Donald Kohn,
the Fed's director of monetary affairs.

<HEADLINE> Scientific Research Stressed in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Any country whose
strategy for socio-economic development is not backed by firm and
strong foundation of scientific knowledge and technological
know-how cannot have a future.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made here today by Athanas Kauzeni, a professor
of the University of Dar es Salaam when presenting a paper at a
two-day workshop, which started yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"This is because in the final analysis science and technology
together constitute the life blood of every form of human
development," said Kauzeni, adding that science and technology
are necessary and indispensable tools for socio-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said experience indicated that no country has attained any
break through in its economic development without the development
of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that agricultural research institutions in
Tanzania, which serve an important role in generating
technologies, are needed to raise productivity, diversify
production and conserve resources.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness in the capacity of national agricultural research
systems to develop suitable technologies for the farm sector will
weaken the supply response of the agricultural sector to an
improved policy environment in terms of attainment of expected
economic development goals," emphasized the professor.

<HEADLINE> Over 60 Pct of Bosnian Refugees Vote in Serbia by Sept. 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 percent of
refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina have turned out to vote in Serbia
by today, a Yugoslav government statement said.
</P>

More than 50,000 of the 79,000 refugees who had decided to vote
in Yugoslavia had done so in the first two days, according to the
statement.
</P>

Most of the refugees mailed their votes to the electoral
commission, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
About 84,000 refugees in Yugoslavia's two republics -- Serbia
and Montenegro -- were supposed to cast their ballots. More than
70,000 Bosnian refugees living in Yugoslavia will return to the

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Forces living Species to Move North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- An American biologist has
obtained the clearest evidence so far that global warming is
forcing living species to move toward the poles and to higher
altitudes, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Experts have long predicted that many organisms would shift
their ranges in response to climatic change. But good evidence of
such movement in response to the modest warming of the last
century has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
The clearest evidence was found by Dr. Camille Parmesan, a
researcher at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She
drove 45,000 miles and lived in a tent for 14 months in the
summers of 1992 through 1994. She made on-the-spot survey of more
than 100 previously recorded populations of the butterfly from
Mexico to Canada and eastward to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
By comparing what she found with previous records, she
discovered a pattern of local extinctions and colonizations that
taken together, documented the northward movement of the species.
</P>
<P>
She said that the shift is surprisingly large for the
relatively small average warming of the earth's surface, about one
degree Fahrenheit, over the last century. So, she concluded that
warming is the cause of the change.
</P>
<P>
Biologists say that the warming of the earth's surface over the
last century has probably been caused by emissions of
heat-trapping waste industrial gases. They predicted that the
warming will continue most likely amounting to about 3.5 degrees
by the end of the next century if emissions are not reduced. The
predicted warming is expected to cause widespread climatic,
ecological and economic dislocation.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street bounced
back from sharp opening losses today, ending mixed, as the bond
market shook off another bout of inflation and interest rate
worries.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 32.18 to 5,648.39,
after it plunged 55 points in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 333.49
million shares, up from 256.95 million in Friday's light trading
before the long holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.77 to 351.76, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.74 to 654.73.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.86 to 1,142.36, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.89 to 557.79.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes recovered from early slides too, with
smaller and speculative issues lagging blue-chip and large-company
measures.
</P>
<P>
Stocks followed bonds lower in the morning as last week's
inflation worries were aggravated by a report suggesting the
Federal Reserve tends to hike interest rates aggressively. The
negative tone was deepened by another indication of robust
business activity and surging energy prices in commodities trading
amid the latest turmoil in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped as high as 7.14
percent this morning before dropping to 7.06 percent on the
purchasing managers report.
</P>
<P>
A 0.2 percent increase in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators was a sign of potential inflation. But investors were
somewhat eased when the purchasing managers report showed that
factory supply prices fell for a third month in a row during
August.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Adopt Its Own Policy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has been urged to adopt its own, well-thought-out
policy towards helping Burundi attain a full democracy and not
just follow the lead of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Portfolio
Committee in a special briefing session today in Cape Town, Jan
Van Eck, former African National Congress parliamentarian, said
South Africa is the only country to which Burundians looked for
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Van Eck, who has spent five months of the past year inside
Burundi studying that country's problems as a conflict-resolution
consultant, said he believes President Jean-Pierre Buyoya really
wants to return the country to democracy and that the conflicting
factions inside the country are more amenable to consider
negotiations as a solution following the July 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, Burundi's Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
was ousted and replaced by military-supported former head of
state Buyoya, a Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
Civil fightings between Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis have
reportedly claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
While referring to international efforts aiming to end the
crisis in Burundi, Van Eck said merely imposing sanctions, as the
OAU and Tanzania had initiated, is not helpful and South africa
should to this effect adopt a more creative approach.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa is the most appropriate model for this
central African state, wracked by long-held mistrust and fear
between its Hutu majority and Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
Countries around Burundi all seemed to have their own agendas
in the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> Polish FM Expresses Interest in Ties With Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister
Dariusz Rosati said here today that Poland was interested in
developing relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic,
Rosati told reporters that he had conferred with Milosevic on the
necessity of further developing bilateral relations and about
regional problems, in particular the future promotion of the peace
process in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Rosati arrived here Monday on a three-day official visit to
Yugoslavia, the first visit by a Polish foreign minister after the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed in April of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed absolutely everything should be done to
promote both trade and political relations between the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Rosati also held talks with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Milan Milutinovic, President of the lower chamber of the
Yugoslav parliament Radoman Bozovic and Deputy Yugoslav Premier
Jovan Zebic, and discussed with them the resumption and
development of bilateral dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At these meetings, Rosati noted that Poland is Yugoslavia's
traditional partner in all fields, especially economic exchange
and industrial cooperation. This is a good basis for reactivating,
developing and promoting all-round bilateral relations, he added.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Fall on Rate Fears, Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
fell sharply today on fears of a U.S. interest rate rise and news
of U.S. missile attacks on Iraq, but recovered from their lows in
later trading.
</P>
<P>
Fears of higher U.S. interest rates and Iraq tensions cast a
shadow over dealings in the London stock market, Europe's largest,
which hit its lowest point in early afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
But the market regained some of its losses later on and ended
28.5 points lower, helped by a smaller-than-expected rise in the
U.S. NAPM purchasing managers index for August, which is likely to
provide the U.S. central bank with fewer fears of the economy's
overheating.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed down sharply in the wake of the U.S.
missile attacks on Iraq and the DAX index finished the session
22.11 points lower.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 share index also slipped and ended down
5.55 points although well above its lowest on added concern over
French social unrest and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Traders said bullish oil stocks boosted by higher oil prices
and the reassuring U.S. economic figures helped the bourse
recovered from its lowest by the close.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 28.5 points lower at 3,855.9. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended down 22.11 at 2,510.77. In Paris, the CAC-40
share index finished down 5.55 at 1,971.43.
