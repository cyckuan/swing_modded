BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's king, Bhumibol
Adulyadej, on Thursday presented the Prince Mahidol Medical Award
to four individuals for their outstanding achievements in the
medical field.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place in the Grand Palace with the
participation of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and nearly 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
"In education and research for progress in the medical and
public health fields, persons concerned need to possess not only a
strong commitment, endurance, and readiness for personal
sacrifice, but must also have great compassion for their fellow
man, so as to be able to persevere until success in finally
achieved," the king said.
</P>
<P>
The Prince Mahidol Awardees 1998 have been selected by the
Board of Trustees of the Mahidol Award Foundation from nominees
worldwide, judging from their works which are of great benefit to
mankind internationally.

NEW YORK -- The Ford Motor Company announced Thursday that it
will acquire the passenger car division of Sweden's A.B. Volvo
for 6.45 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ford-Volvo deal will give Ford the right to use the Volvo
brand for passenger cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and
light trucks. It will leave Volvo as mainly a maker of heavy
trucks and buses.
</P>
<P>
Beating a rival bid from Italy's Fiat S.p.A, Ford's deal
marks the latest step in the consolidation of the global
automotive industry. Giant multinationals have been taking over
independent companies with limited production capacity and
inadequate global distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit-based automaker is expected to assume ownership
of Volvo Cars' worldwide sites, including three assembly plants
and two powertrain plants in Europe and the passenger-vehicle
product development center in Sweden. Ford is the world's No. 2
automaker after GM. (Ford-Volve-Acquisition)

<HEADLINE> Fischer: Military Threat to Force Kosovo Combatants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Western members of the Yugoslav
Contact Group want to force combatants in Kosovo to the
negotiating table within a week through the threat of military
force, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told a press conference that the six-nation Contact
Group -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the U.S. --
would use the threat at their London meeting Friday to bring both
ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government to talks. The talks
would begin within one week, probably in France.
</P>
<P>
"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) activation order
is already in place and it must be made credible," Fischer said.
"Without a credible threat to both conflict parties... it will not
be possible to get them to the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
Both sides would have to agree to basic principles within two
weeks which would "freeze" existing conditions prior to free and
secret elections deciding the future of an autonomous Kosovo
within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how NATO planned to threaten the Kosovo Liberation Army,
Fischer admitted that conventional military threats would not work
for a guerrilla army.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian side knows the importance of political acceptance
-- not for independence -- but rather for self-determination and
for adherence to human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer declined to discuss possible NATO options if both sides
failed to join negotiations. "I would warn against any early
scenarios about marching in, NATO and Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO authorized air strikes on Yugoslav military targets
last year but suspended the threat after an peace deal in October.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. warplanes Thursday
attacked an anti-aircraft artillery installation in northern Iraq
after observing fire from the site, a U.S. military official said.
</P>
<P>
The official with the U.S. European Command said the two F-15E
fighter jets observed fire by the anti-aircraft artillery site
located north of Mosul at about 3:45 p.m. (1245GMT). In response,
they dropped a total of three GBU-12 precision-guided bombs on the
site. There were no immediate reports on damage to the site.
</P>
<P>
Both planes continued their patrols of the northern no-fly zone
after the clash, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first clash between the United States and Iraq over
no-fly zones since the White House made public Tuesday an order
from President Bill Clinton to adopt a more aggressive policy in
dealing with Iraq's attacks against U.S and British planes
patrolling northern and southern no-fly zones.

<HEADLINE> EU Draws Detailed Strategy to Boost Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) drew
a detailed strategy to promote commerce in its White Paper newly
adopted Thursday by its executive body, the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper stated the EU will seek to improve the use of
policy instruments, administrative, legislative and financial
environment, the competitiveness and entrepreneurship, and the
trend of Europeanization and globalization -- the four priorities
designated to boost trade.
</P>
<P>
Christos Papoutsis, commissioner responsible for commerce and
distribution, said in a statement that the White Paper is
"intended to be a turning point in the way in which commerce is
viewed within the policy-making process."
</P>
<P>
Public policies "compatible with increasing competitiveness
and good services to customers" must be ensured if the EU members
want to maintain the vitality and quality of commerce and
distribution in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, a large-scale information campaign on the EU's
economic and social roles of commerce will be launched within the
15 member states.
</P>
<P>
Programs aimed at assisting small and medium-size enterprises
(SMEs) to take full advantage of electronic commerce are also
included in the paper.
</P>
<P>
Detailed measures also include strengthening the com
petitiveness of neighborhood shops, especially in less-favored
areas and helping SMEs get familiar with the introduction of the
euro.

ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Kenya Thursday
called for the speedy implementation of the framework agreement by
the Organization of African Unity on Mechanism for Prevention,
Management and Resolution of Conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The two countries issued a joint communique on the occasion of
the one-day official working visit of President Daniel Arap Moi to
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that during his visit, President Moi held
extensive discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi "
on issues relating to the current conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, as well as on bilateral and regional issues of common
concern."
</P>
<P>
On the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the communique
said, the two leaders reviewed in depth the genesis of the problem
as well as the efforts deployed so far by the OAU, the United
Nations and the international community at large to resolve the
conflict through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
It said, Prime Minister Meles informed President Moi that
Ethiopia has accepted the OAU High Level Delegation proposals for
a framwork agreement that was fully endorsed by the fourth summit
of the OAU Central Organ of the Mechanism for Prevention,
Management and Resolution of Conflicts held in Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso on December 17 and 18, 1998 which also called for the
speedy implementation of the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
During their discussions, Moi briefed Meles about the
discussions he held with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki during
this visit to Asmara on January 24, 1998. Moi also conveyed to
the Ethiopian government the assurance and willingness of the
government of Eritrea to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the
border dispute, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral matters, the communique said, the two leaders
exchanged views on the security situation along the common border
between Ethiopia and Kenya, and agreed to take the necessary
measure to address the threat posed by subversive and terrorist
elements to the peace and security of the two friendly neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, they expressed their resolve to continue
their joint endeavor to promote peace and regional economic
cooperation. They reiterated their commitment to the
Inter-Governmental Organization on Development (IGAD) as a vehicle
for regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
President Moi left here for Nairobi Thursday afternoon after
his one- day visit to Ethiopia. His visit is amid heightened
tensions and heavy military build-up on both sides of the
Ethio-Eritrean border which feared to result in a renewed outbreak
of clashes.

<HEADLINE> Low Quality Standards Hamper Zimbabwe's Exports: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's exports are being
hampered by low quality and packaging standards, Industry and
Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have a quality conference in May where we
really want to put stress on quality as our exports are being
affected by this issues. We also want to deal with packaging which
needs to be improved," the minister told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said a seminar on packaging would be held in a month's time
so that it could be impressed on companies how packaging affected
their performance.
</P>
<P>
He said the Standards Development Association was soon going to
be commercialized in a sense that a board would determine its
policy as far as standards were concerned.
</P>
<P>
"The board's responsibility will be to promote quality and
standard of goods so that industrialists can determine the quality
of their products," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged manufacturers to put more emphasis on producing
quality products if they were to stand the tough competition on
the local and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Local and international markets had become sophisticated with
emphasis on quality unlike in the past when more attention was put
on lower prices, the minister said.

ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Traffic in the Greek capital of
Athens came to a standstill Thursday when some 5,000 secondary
school students marched once again through central Athens to
protest against the government's education reforms.
</P>
<P>
There was a strong police presence deployed in side streets
along the course of the march with orders to immediately intervene
at any sign of disturbance.

Thursday's march ended peacefully although there were some
tension and scuffles.

Police and journalists came under attack by about 250
university and high school students who threw stones and bottles
and chanted slogans against them, protesting against arrests by
police of students during previous marches.
</P>

Students warned that they would continue their protest until
the government met their demands, namely the abolition of the
education reform law.
</P>
<P>
Marches were also reported in other cities such as Patras and
Iraklion.

<P>
Meanwhile, Greek teachers declared a 48-hour strike as of

JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Botswana
announced Thursday that it will increase its interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 12.75 percent, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
This was the second rate hike since August 1998, when the rate
was raised from 11.75 percent to 12.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the latest increase to the growing demand
for credit in the economy, which was leading to increased
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"It was imperative to take measures to ensure price stability,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana's year-on-year inflation increased to 6.4 percent in
December from 5.9 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The bank has previously warned of higher inflation this year
largely due to increased government spending, as it battles to
beat rising unemployment.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Eagle Brand Holdings Limited
(Eagle Brand), a manufacturer of ceramic sanitary-wares and tiles,
Thursday launched its initial public offering (IPO) of 230 million
shares in connection with its listing on the Main Board of the
Stock Exchange of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Eagle Brand Holdings Limited has grown up out of a township
enterprise in Guangdong Province, China.
</P>
<P>
The total share offer, representing 20 percent of Eagle Brand's
enlarged share capital, comprises a public tranche of 23 million
shares and a placement tranche of 207 million shares. At 0.19 U.S.
dollars each, the shares represent an estimated price earnings
ratio of 6.1 times.
</P>
<P>
The IPO is managed by the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd.
(DBS Bank). Both DBS Bank and China International Capital
Corporation (Hong Kong) Limited are the joint lead placement
agents.
</P>
<P>
First Established in ShiWan Township of the Fushan City,
Guangdong Province, in 1974, the Eagle Brand Group has become one
of the well-known players in the manufacture, marketing and
distribution of ceramic sanitary-wares and tiles in China, having
capabilities to turn out annually 1.7 million sets of sanitary
wares and 11 million square meters of tiles and offering a wide
range of products.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Thursday's launch of Eagle Brand's IPO, the Group's
Chairman and General Manger Pang Runliu said: "We believe we are
well-poised to soar into the new millennium on the wings of a
ceramic industry which can expect double-digit growth, given
China's sanitary needs, public housing reforms and the continued
emphasis on infrastructure development."
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is for Eagle Brand to enjoy international acclaim and
recognition," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Eagle Brand achieved a turnover of RMB 1.109 billion
(135 million U.S. dollars) and an after-tax profit of RMB 246
million (29.9 million U.S. dollars), up 14 and 62 percent
respectively compared to the pervious year.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Sends Emergency Team to Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) Wednesday dispatched an emergency team to three
districts in Colombia in the wake of the most disastrous
earthquake in the country's modern history, UNICEF officials
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that their agency's priority is to bring
immediate assistance to an estimated 10,000 children who have been
victimized by the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"The devastation in the Department of Valle del Cauca is
profoundly distressing," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy
said. "The injuries and loss of life are tragic reminders of the
destructive power of natural disasters and of our obligation to
provide immediate assistance to their victims, particularly
children and women."
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 people were left homeless and cities and
villages were virtually leveled by the quake in western Colombia,
which measured 6.0 on the Richter scale and sent shockwaves in a
radius of more than 160 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF estimates that 60 percent of the quake's victims are
children and women.
</P>
<P>
The official government toll Wednesday was 628 dead and more
than 2,500 injured. But the Colombian Red Cross predicted Tuesday
the death toll would rise as high as 1,500.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF staff, together with representatives of the Colombian
Red Cross, traveled Wednesday to Risaralda, Quindo and Valle del
Cauca to carry out a rapid assessment of the most urgent needs of
children and women there.
</P>
<P>
The children's agency is also evaluating the effect of the
quake's damage on health, on nutrition and on education projects
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF representative for Colombia, Carel de Rooy, said
Wednesday that the agency's emergency response would include:
</P>
<P>
-- Distribution to families of Basic Survival Kits which
include tents, blankets, kitchen utensils, water tanks, lamps and
first-aid items;
</P>
<P>
-- Development of 150 volunteers from the Colombian Movement of
Children for Peace to help children overcome the trauma of this
tragedy;
</P>
<P>
-- Provision and distribution of education kits, school
materials, notebooks and pencils to thousands of children whose
education has been disrupted by the emergency.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF estimates that at least 500,000 U.S. dollars will be
needed to fund these and other emergency response over the next
three months.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Ghanaian Parliament Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu said this at a meeting with Ghanaian parliament Speaker
Daniel Annan, which took place shortly before he ended a three-day
official visit here and left for Cote d'Ivoire to continue his
13-day four-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
He said that to further the state-to-state ties not only needs
the concerted efforts from both governments, but also requires the
forceful support from the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The contacts between the two parliaments have played an
important role in promoting mutual understanding and friendship
between the two nations and the two peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu stated that the Chinese government will continue to take an
active attitude towards the friendly contacts and cooperation
between the two parliaments and expressed the hope that the two
parliaments will make concerted efforts to contribute to the
continuous enhancement of bilateral friendship and friendly
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Annan recalled the experience of a visit to
China in 1996 by a Ghanaian parliamentary delegation led by him
and expressed the hope that new efforts should be made to expand
the friendly contacts and cooperation between the two parliaments
as well as the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Hu Jintao also met representatives of
various political parties in Ghana and exchanged views with them
on the enhancement of cooperation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister
Ji Peiding, Chinese Ambassador to Ghana Li Zupei, Ghanaian
Minister for Parliament Affairs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Joint Efforts for Recovery of Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Tourism Ministers
meeting here issued a statement Thursday pledging to join efforts
to restore the vibrancy of the grouping's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
In reaffirming the commitment to ASEAN Leaders' Agenda in the
Hanoi Plan, the ministers resolved to implement the Visit ASEAN
Millennium Year in the year 2002 with special focus on
international travel and tourism to the ASEAN region as well as
within ASEAN itself.
</P>
<P>
They adopted a broad strategy toward its eventual
implementation by the ASEAN National Tourism Organizations in
greater partnership with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their pleasure with the progress made
in the five areas of cooperation -- marketing the ASEAN region as
a single tourist destination, encouraging tourism investments,
developing a pool of critical tourism manpower, promoting
environmentally sustainable tourism and facilitating seamless
intra-ASEAN travel.
</P>
<P>
Setting the pace for the realization of the tourism priorities
of the Hanoi Plan of Action, they agreed to launch the Visit ASEAN
Millennium Year 2002 in the Philippines, to conduct strategic
studies for joint marketing of the ASEAN region in the 21st
century, to promote eco-tourism and cruise tourism programs, and
to establish a network among ASEAN Tourism Training Centers with
emphasis on new job skills and new technologies in tourism policy
and planning.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged the acceleration of trade
liberalization for tourism services under the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on Services with a view to removing all obstacles to the
free flow of tourism services among member countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that member countries should promote
a positive, intra-ASEAN investment climate and to pursue air
services liberalization to promote intra-ASEAN Travel.
</P>
<P>
Tourism ministers of the nine ASEAN member countries or their
deputies attended the meeting Thursday. Cambodian Tourism Minister
Veng Sereyvuth also attended the meeting as an observer.

<P>
ABIDJAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao wound up his three-day Ghanaian tour and arrived in Abidjan
Thursday for an official visit to Cote d'Ivoire, the third leg of
his 13-day four-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president came here from Accra by special
plane as guest of the Cote d'Ivoire government, with Prime
Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan greeting Hu at the airport.
</P>
<P>
In his written statement upon arrival, Hu said since the two
nations forged diplomatic ties 16 years ago, the China-Cote
d'Ivoire relations have been proceeding smoothly under the care
from leaders of the two nations and with concerted efforts by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Areas of bilateral cooperation are continuously expanding,
especially in the economic and trade sectors which have scored
remarkable results, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"Continuing to consolidate and develop bilateral friendly
relations of cooperation is in the interests of both peoples and
the common aspiration of the two governments," he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that his current visit will serve to promote mutual
understanding and friendship, and push bilateral friendly
cooperative ties in a sustainable, healthy and steady way into the
forthcoming century, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Drop Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. steel imports in
December dropped sharply to 2.5 million tons, 31 percent lower
than the 3.6 million tons recorded in November, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary figures, the first ever in its
kind released by the department, imports from Japan decreased by
47 percent to 384,597 tons in December from the 728,478 tons in
November.
</P>
<P>
This reversal could let Japan temporarily avoid broad trade
sanctions sought by struggling U.S. steel producers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had promised a
government-initiated trade complaint against Japan unless the
December figures showed a substantial reduction.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports from Russia, another target of the U.S. steel
industry's complaints, dropped to 135,777 tons in December, a 79
percent decrease from the 658,363 tons a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The administration decided to release preliminary data,
beginning with the December figures, to give the U.S. steel
industry an earlier warning of import trends. Final figures are
due in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months last year, Japanese producers
shipped 5.7 million tons of steel products into the United States,
nearly three times the 2.1 million tons for the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the single-largest source of steel imports, which have
driven down prices in the United States and contributed to more
than 10,000 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. steel producers and two steelworkers unions already have
filed dumping complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil,
accusing them of flooding the United States with hot-rolled carbon
steel, the most common product, at prices lower than the costs of
making it.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decrease in Japanese and Russian imports appears to
reflect the prospect for additional tariffs threatened in a
November ruling from the Commerce Department. The department
determined that any duties later applied against those countries
might be retroactive to mid-November because imports had surged so
much early last year.
</P>
<P>
A final ruling is not expected until this summer, according to
local media.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Sinks 0.5 Pct in S'pore in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production sank a
marginal 0.5 percent in Singapore in 1998 compared to 1997 while
the manufacturing output fell 2.7 percent in December 1998, the
country's Economic Development Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Output in the electronics cluster declined by 3.1 percent in
1998 over the previous year with the December output dropping a
3.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster grew 15.3 percent in output in 1998
compared to 1997 and the growth was specially contributed by the
hefty 59.4 percent hike in December 1998 compared to the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The contribution mainly came from the pharmaceuticals segment,
which registered a 470.5 percent growth in December and 70.8
percent growth for the whole year, and the petrochemicals segment
which grew 10.6 percent in 1998 and 4.8 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The engineering cluster sank 0.6 percent in 1998 compared to
1997 with the output in December shrinking by 12 percent over a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> NATO Issues Warning Again on Kosovo (Part 3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NATO reaffirms, Solana said, its support to international
efforts to bring peace to Kosovo and to avoid a humanitarian
catastrophe there. NATO supports the efforts by the United Nations
Security Council, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, the European Union, the countries in the region and the
Contact Group, the NATO chief said.
</P>
<P>
"NATO stands ready to act and rules out no option to ensure
full respect by both sides of the demands of the international
community, and in particular observance of all relevant U.N.
Security Council resolutions," added Solana.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance has decided to increase its
military preparedness to ensure that the demands of the
international community are met.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group members --the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy -- are scheduled to meet Friday in
London and are expected to issue an ultimatum of its own, laying
down its demands for the conflicting parties in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of NATO,
will follow the developments in Kosovo and decide accordingly on
future measures in the light of both parties' compliance with
international commitments and requirements, said the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
warned during his visit to NATO that people may be reaching limit
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the NATO council, Annan said, "The bloody wars of
the last decade have left us with no illusions about the
difficulty of halting internal conflicts -- by reason or by force
-- particularly against the wishes of the government of a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"But nor have they left us with any illusions about the need to
use force, when all other means have failed. We may be reaching
that limit, once again, in the former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
NATO observers here believed that Annan's speech sounded like a
verbal support for actions on the part of those that have the
capabilities to do so.
</P>
<P>
NATO is waiting for the Contact Group to formulate a time table
for the demanded start of the political negotiation between the
conflicting parties in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some people suggested that the deadline might be between 10
days and three weeks after the issuance of the Contact Group final
warning.
</P>
<P>
NATO threatened with the use of force last year as a backup for
diplomatic efforts coping with the Kosovo crisis and the Western
military alliance later ordered an air strike against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia without the mandate of the United Nations
Security Council. It later halted the operation but kept the air
strike order in abeyance so as to revert to military intervention
if it sees fit.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Meets Leader of Ghana's Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, GHANA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Thursday met here Nan Kunadu Agyeman-Rawlings, President of
31st December Women's Movement and Ghana's first lady.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Agyeman-Rawlings happily recalled the
experience in Beijing during the Fourth World Conference on Women
held in 1995, saying that inspired by the Beijing conference,
Ghanaian women had extensively carried forward women's movement
and actively promoted the friendly exchange and cooperation
between the women organizations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese leader expressed thanks to the first lady
for her donation, on behalf of President Jerry John Rawlings and
Ghanaian women, to the Chinese people who suffered from heavy
flooding last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the friendly exchange and cooperation between
Chinese and Ghanaian women is an important part of the friendly
relations between the two countries. He noted that the Chinese
government has always paid attention to the role played by women
and taken a set of policies to safeguard women's equal status and
rights in the fields of politics, economy and social life.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and All-China Women's Federation have
taken a series of follow-up actions after the adoption of "Beijing
Declaration" at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He sincerely hoped the women organizations of the two countries
will continue to promote their friendly cooperation and play a
positive role in enhancing the existing friendly relations between
the two countries.
</P>

Hu Jintao left here Thursday for Cote d'Ivoire to continue his

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wages, Benefits Rise at Fastest Pace Since 1993 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that robust economic growth in 1998 pushed up U.S. wages
and benefits by 3.4 percent, the fastest pace in five years.
</P>
<P>
The increase is the third consecutive year of improvement, the
Department said. Wages and benefits rose 3.3 percent in 1997, 2.9
percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, inflation has been decreasing, so workers'
purchasing power has shown significant gains.
</P>
<P>
However, the same numbers that cheer employees have raised
concern at the inflation-wary Federal Reserve and among
businesses, particularly manufacturers, who face a profit crunch
as they attempt to compete against firms operating in Asian and
Latin American countries with devalued currencies.
</P>
<P>
The wage and benefit growth, indeed, was more subdued in
manufacturing, 2.7 percent, the Department added. It was minuscule
in health services, 0.9 percent, compared with annual rates
pushing 7 percent in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Compensation increased strongly at public utilities, 5 percent,
reflecting deregulation, particularly of telephone companies, and
in finance, insurance and real estate, up 5.9 percent, reflecting
record home sales and an expanding mutual-fund industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, low interest rates, along with the strong wage and
benefit increases, have fueled strong consumer spending, more than
compensating for waning demand abroad. However, many economists
are looking for more moderate economic growth this year and, thus,
believe compensation costs will not accelerate further.
</P>
<P>
The increase in just wages and salaries, excluding benefits
such as health insurance, actually slowed slightly in 1998, to 3.7
percent, compared with 3.8 percent in 1997. Benefit costs,
however, increased 2.6 percent, up from 2.1 percent in 1997 and
the strongest pace in four years.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has purchased a
helicopter worth seven million U.S. Dollars from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The 15-seat helicopter was handed over in Dar es Salaam
Thursday to the Minister of Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, by
the U.S. ambassador to Tanzania, Rev. Charles Stith.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a function held at the police hangar in the
capital city, Ameir said the helicopter will help the police in
disaster rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, capable of searching and rescuing in all types
of surface or conditions, was manufactured by the the Bell
Helicopters Texton of Texas. This is the fifth helicopter the
Tanzanian government has purchased from the company.
</P>
<P>
Experts sent by the manufacturer will be in the country for one
month to train Tanzanian pilots. Mohamed urged the pilots to fully
learn the knowledge imparted by the experts and well maintain the
helicopter so that it could be used longer.
</P>
<P>
Stith said the helicopter is a symbol of economic relations
between the two countries which has existed for the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
The minister, accompanied by Stith, Inspector General of Police
Omar Mahita, and other senior police officers, made a maiden
flight over Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> WEF Annual Meeting to Discuss Globalization in Davos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, Switzerland, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic
Forum (WEF) began its 29th annual meeting here Thursday with
globalization as its theme.
</P>
<P>
"We need globalization because globalization means the
opportunity to share capital, technology and knowledge on a global
scale and to ensure that we can take care of a world which, at the
end of this century, has four times inhabitants than at the
beginning of the century," said Professor Klaus Schwab at the
opening session of the six-day event.
</P>
<P>
The WEF founder and president said that the most important
challenge at the transition into the 21st century will be to find
the right balance between the forces of the market and the needs
of people who fear that some unpredictable event occurring in a
market halfway around the globe, over which they have no control,
could catastrophically alter their own and their family's life.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that competitiveness and social cohesion
are not natural enemies. "They are the results of corporate
decisions and government policies," Schwab said.
</P>
<P>
"The mega-mergers of the past months, the global ramifications
of the events in East Asia, Russia and Latin America, the fact
that national boundaries have often become irrelevant, are just
some of the signs that we live in a new reality where
globalization is no longer a process but a condition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schwab told the 2,000 participants at the session that world
leaders in politics, business, science, and civil society should
use the opportunity in Davos to define what "responsible
globality" is.
</P>
<P>
By creating new global boundaries, he said, globalization will
lift millions of people out of poverty and provide them with
adequate healthcare and education.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he stressed that all the countries in Asia,
Eastern Europe, South America and Africa should be encouraged that
they will not be losers in the new world economy.

Cyprus had canceled the order for the S-300 missiles, and
therefore the missiles would not be deployed or stored on Crete,
a local press report quoted Western defense officials as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas described it as "not true," saying that the original
agreement between Cyprus and Russia remained valid and the two
sides were now negotiating changes to the relevant contracts.
</P>
<P>
He added that the choice was Crete and the Greek government had
agreed that the missiles be installed on the island.
</P>
<P>
To bolster its defenses, Cyprus had decided to purchase the
missile in early 1997, but this had been opposed by the United
States and some European countries because they fear that the
missile deployment would increase tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both Cyprus and Greece also feared that the missile deployment
might harm Nicosia's efforts to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has bad relations with Greece and has some 35,000
troops in northern Cyprus, also has threatened to use force to
prevent the missile installation.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with Athens, Nicosia announced late last
year that it would not deploy the missiles on the divided island
but on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Chryssostomos is expected to
arrive in Athens on February 8 for talks with Greek leaders on the
transport and deployment of the missiles on Crete.

<HEADLINE> NATO Threatens Again With Force on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Thursday threatened again
with the use of force to coerce the conflicting parties in Kosovo
into an early settlement for political negotiation.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that the Western
military alliance had increased its military readiness to ensure
that the demands of the international community are met.
</P>
<P>
NATO is waiting for an ultimatum from the six-nation Contact
Group that is meeting Friday in London and is expected to issue a
final warning of its own to demand that the conflicting parties in
Kosovo stop fighting and start right away negotiations aimed at a
political settlement within a certain time limit.
</P>
<P>
Solana told the press that the North Atlantic Council, the
decision-making body of NATO, will follow closely the developments
in Kosovo in the next few days and decide accordingly what future
steps to take in the light of the compliance by the conflicting
parties with the requirements from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan
warned during his visit to NATO headquarters that people may be
reaching limit in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the North Atlantic Council, Annan said, "The bloody
wars of the last decade have left us with no illusions about the
difficulty of halting internal conflicts -- by reason or by force
-- particularly against the wishes of the government of a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"But nor have they left us with any illusions about the need to
use force, when all other means have failed. We may be reaching
that limit, once again, in the former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
NATO observers here believed that Annan's speech sounded like a
verbal support for actions on the part of those that have the
capabilities to act.
</P>
<P>
NATO is waiting for the Contact Group to formulate a time table
for the demanded start of the political negotiation between the
conflicting parties in Kosovo and the conclusion of an interim
agreement on autonomy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some people suggested that the deadline might be between 10
days and three weeks after the issuance of the Contact Group final
warning.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether NATO is prepared to send in ground troops to
Kosovo after initial air strikes, Solana said that the Western
military alliance would not rule out any possibility in its effort
to bring peace back to the region.
</P>
<P>
NATO threatened with the use of force last year as a backup for
diplomatic efforts coping with the Kosovo crisis and it later
ordered an air strike against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
without the mandate of the United Nations Security Council. It
later halted the operation but kept the air strike order in
abeyance so as to revert to military intervention if it sees fit.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, NATO threatened to use force against either side
in Kosovo that is not complying with the demands of the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Misuse of Viagra Could Produce Opposite Effect: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Healthy men who take Viagra, the
anti-impotence drug, in the belief that it'll boost their sex lives
could end up impotent, a British doctor warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Roger Kirby, a consultant urologist at St George's Hospital in
London, said that incorrect and experimental use of Viagra could
cause priapism, a persistent and painful erection, which could lead
to permanent damage and impotence.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Kirby, any man taking the drug, whether impotent
or not, should also be aware of side-effects as headache, facial
flushing and heartburn.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the drug on the retina may also result in temporary
abnormalities of vision and the perception of a "blue haze," Kirby
wrote in Student BMJ, a British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Viagra "has little to offer normally potent men and usage by them
carries inherent risks," and as a result "its recreational use should
certainly be discouraged", he concluded.

<HEADLINE> News Aanlysis: Will NATO Bombs Fall on Kosovo? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- To strike or not to strike,
and how to strike, that's where the rub is. That's the rub NATO
is facing while heading for an international dilemma if not a
disaster via acting out of its accord and without the mandate of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The rub popped up last October when the Western military
alliance ordered an air strike against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia also without the mandate of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The NATO operation was then supposed to force a sovereign
government to withdraw excessive security forces from a province
within its sovereign territory where separatists are fighting for
independence.
</P>
<P>
The air strike, however, would have otherwise assisted the
separatists even though NATO has proclaimed time and again not to
support outright independence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
When it made known its intention and readiness to strike in
Yugoslavia last October, NATO had to bear the brunt of criticism
as well as questioning. It was caught in the limelight as a
military bloc acting out of its own in the post-Cold War era and
what's more with no clear-cut end-game scenario up its sleeve for
the action it had threatened to take.
</P>
<P>
This time round, NATO chose to let the horse run in front of
the cart. It is tactically waiting for an ultimatum from the
six-nation Contact Group while NATO itself issued its final
warning to demand that the conflicting parties in Kosovo follow
the Contact Group demands.
</P>
<P>
Though by so doing may help it feel a little at ease in front
of international pressure, NATO still has to face the human
disaster to be inflicted at the fall of missiles and bombs in
Kosovo should diplomatic efforts run out of gas in the end.
</P>
<P>
The Western military alliance has still not yet resolved the
legality challenge for its self-determined interference not only
from Yugoslavia but from the international community as well. And
now it has also to risk causing instead of preventing humanitarian
disasters to be triggered by an all-out warfare in Kosovo against
the Yugoslav security forces for outright independence by the
Kosovar separatists who would insist on making the utmost of a
NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
With its intent already declared and with no ready solution to
either the legality or outbreak of war problems, NATO has come
across the juncture of a no-turn-around situation in which one
move, once set in motion, is sure to lead to one life-costing
problem after another.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Education
Ministry announced Thursday that various countries and
international funding agencies will give 500 scholarships to
Ethiopians in current 1998/99 year ending in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mitiku Berecha, Scholarship team leader of the Education
Ministry, told the local press that 350 scholarships have already
been offered in the last six months alone, reported the Ethiopian
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) will
sponsor 120 Ethiopians to attend higher education in India this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mitiku said 501 scholarships were obtained last year, but only
182 Ethiopians qualified for the scholarships which, he said, were
fraught with stiff international competition.
</P>
<P>
He said 172 Ethiopians went to India last year on a UNDP
sponsored scholarship.
</P>
<P>
A committee made up of experts drawn from the Ministry of
Education and other pertinent offices is responsible for
scholarships at the national level, Mitiku added.

UNITED NATIONS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Thursday decided to extend the United Nations
Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for a further period of six
months until July 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the council expressed its concern at the
failure of the Georgian and Abkhaz sides to conclude agreements on
security and the non-use of force, the return of refugees and
displaced persons and economic reconstruction, and urged the
parties to resume bilateral negotiations to this end.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly demanded that both sides observe strictly
the Moscow Agreement of 14 May 1994 on a Cease-fire and Separation
of Forces and all their obligations to refrain from the use of
force and to resolve disputed issues by peaceful means only.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned the activities by armed groups, including
the continued laying of mines, which endanger the civilian
population, impede the work of the humanitarian organizations and
seriously delay the normalization of the situation in the Gali
region.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its demand that both sides take
immediate and determined measures to put a stop to such acts and
ensure that the security environment of all international
personnel improves significantly.

<HEADLINE> New Brain Cancer Drug Launched in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A new brain cancer drug, which
is as easy to take as an aspirin, has been granted a license by
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and was launched Thursday
in the UK.
</P>
<P>
Temozolomide, marketed as Temodal, was developed by Britain's
Cancer Research Campaign (CRC) in conjunction with U.S.
pharmaceutical company Schering Plough.
</P>
<P>
The capsule-form drug works by damaging DNA in brain cancer
cells and causing them to commit suicide. Non-cancerous cells are
not harmed and, unlike most cancer treatments, it can filter
through the brain's protective barrier.
</P>
<P>
In tests, Temodal has been shown to boost survival rates as
well as reducing the side effects of other treatments, and experts
say it could eventually have a big impact on other cancers.
</P>
<P>
The new drug was "the most important advance in brain cancer
treatment for the past 20 years," Professor Gordon McVie, the
director general of the CRC, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Further trials will now be carried out on the drug to see if it
can also treat malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin
cancer, and other types of brain cancer, doctors said.

<HEADLINE> Weight Gain After Birth Could Be Inherited: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Women with obese mothers are
more likely to gain weight after childbirth, a new British study
has showed.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from the University of Greenwich studied 74
South London women from the beginning of their pregnancy to two
and a half years after they had given birth.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of women do not gain weight after
childbirth, a small minority who do are more likely to have
overweight mothers, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The researchers looked at a series of factors which could
influence weight gain, including smoking, depression, lack of
social support networks and stress.
</P>
<P>
They found that when all these factors were taken out of the
equation, women with overweight mothers and those who were
depressed about their body image after birth were more likely to
gain weight.
</P>
<P>
There may be some genetic reason why women with overweight
mothers gain weight, but it may also be due to inherited
lifestyles, the researchers reported in the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that offspring `inherit' lifestyles that
predispose them to gain weight by adopting similar eating habits
and exercise patterns to those of their parents," they said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches First National Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu announced Thursday that a national security
think-tank has been set up to deal with both external and internal
security issues.
</P>
<P>
This was an accomplishment previous governments have failed to
achieve, he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council, a non-governmental body which
will provide security analysis and suggestions on internal social
and economic conditions as well as external situations, was
founded one day after Defense Minister Moshe Arens took office.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the 1973 Middle East war, almost all Israeli prime
ministers have called for the formation of such an independent
body to contribute to decision-making in respect to national
security.
</P>
<P>
But their defense ministers have traditionally objected to the
idea, claiming there was no need for another body to assess
intelligence data besides the military intelligence branch.
</P>
<P>
Upon his election in 1996, Netanyahu tried to create such a
council. But former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai forced him
to drop the plan.
</P>
<P>
While re-introducing the idea hours after Arens was sworn in as
defense minister Wednesday, Netanyahu said Mordechai had opposed
this idea because he feared that an independent council would
harm his position.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who was fired by Netanyahu last week over alleged
disloyalty to the Likud, is leading a centrist bid to run against
Netanyahu in the coming elections due in May.
</P>
<P>
Those advocates of the council claim that the function of the
military intelligence branch is limited because it only collects
information on the enemy.
</P>
<P>
The security council, on the contrary, will expand this
spectrum to include security analysis of domestic social and
economic situations.
</P>
<P>
Until now, a small national security team has been operating
under the auspices of the Prime Minister's Office. However, it has
been utterly dependent for information on army intelligence and
the security service Mossad.

<HEADLINE> Microchip Implant Could Be Used for Drug Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists are developing a
microchip that can be implanted under the skin and made to deliver
drugs at specific times.
</P>
<P>
The system, being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Boston, the United States, could be a reality within
years, the researchers reported Thursday in the British science
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said in a letter to Nature that they are testing
a prototype chip which has 34 minutes reservoirs built in.
</P>
<P>
Each reservoir can store about 25 nanoliter (thousand millionth
of a liter) of chemicals that are released by applying a small
electrical voltage, which causes the reservoir cover to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
The prototype chip has wires connecting the reservoirs'
circuitry to an external power source.
</P>
<P>
But the researchers believed that it is possible to make a
self-contained device with a battery that could be pre-programmed,
triggered by remote control or activated by a biosensor on the
chip.
</P>
<P>
The device could be as small as 2mm, making it implantable, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a drug delivery system, but it could be used for
anything," said Dr Robert Langer, one of the scientists.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The government forces Thursday
took the rebel forces' strategic point of Nharea City in central
Angola and was advancing toward Andulo CIty, in which the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that Nharea was taken from UNITA's
hands after fierce fighting, with most rebel men surrendering to
the government forces.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are pursuing the fleeing UNITA men to
Andulo, UNITA's headquarters about 39 km away from Nharea.
</P>
<P>
Nharea, a city in northern Bie Province, has been regarded as
the political basis of UNITA and has long been under UNITA's
control along with Huambo, Bailundo, and Mungo cities.
</P>
<P>
The city is also an important diamond production basis for
UNITA, whose military supply depends heavily on diamond.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the capture of Nharea signifies that
the government is changing from a defensive status to offensive in
central part of the country, and UNITA is losing its long-year
nucleus area.
</P>
<P>
But the loss of Mbanza-Congo, capital city of northern Angola's
 Zaire Province, and the approach of oil-rich city of Soyo by the
rebels, might make situation in northern part of the country more
worrying.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Maneul "Jota", spokesman of the government
forces, said that the loss of Mbanza-Congo will not affect the oil
production as it is still far away from oil-production areas, and
life in Soyo is "very normal".

Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is essential for sustainable socio-economic development in

<HEADLINE> France Decides List of Countries to Benefit From Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- France decided Thursday the list
of the countries to benefit from most of its annual 38 billion
franc (7 billion U.S. dollar) overseas aid on development.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who chaired a meeting of
the Interministerial Committee of International Cooperation
(CICID), said that the names of these countries will not be
published until after being approved by President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that these countries are mainly countries of Black
Africa, the Indochinese Peninsula and Maghreb region in North
Africa, as well as Lebanon and the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
France has in the past focused its aid programs on 36
countries, 33 of them in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said at a press conference that by defining a "zone of
prior solidarity" in providing development aid, France is trying
to contribute effectively to the development of beneficiary
countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is not a list of number of countries, but a logic of
intervention which guides our policy, while our bilateral aid can
be effective and can respond to an objective of solidarity and
development of basic infrastructures," he said.
</P>
<P>
France remoulded its overseas aid mechanism one year ago by
absorbing the Ministry of Cooperation into the Foreign Ministry
and establishing the CICID.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slaps U.S. for Holding Up Contracts for Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 28 (xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday slapped
the United States for holding up contracts of spare parts needed
to upgrade its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Iraq said the U.S. delegate in the United
Nations Security Council's sanctions committee put on hold at
least a dozen contracts for spare parts and Britain blocked one.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United States announced it would remove
its objections for at least half of the contracts on oil equipment
it had blocked, an apparent effort to counter the proposals by
France and Russia towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been allowed since June of 1998 to import 600 million
U.S. dollars worth of industry parts. A total of 293 contracts
worth 163 million have been approved since then.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. "oil-for-food" plan, Iraq can export up to 5.2
billion dollars worth of oil every six months to buy necessities
for its people to help offset the effects of U.N. sanctions
imposed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But due to the dilapidated state of its oil industry and low
oil prices, it has only been able to export over 3 billion dollars
worth of oil over the last six months.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urged to Release Ethiopian Cargo at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian business
community Thursday urged the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) to take appropriate action to release
stranded Ethiopian cargo at Eritrean ports of Assab and Massawa.
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the special committee of three COMESA member
states appointed in regard to the Ethiopian cargo detained at
Eritrean ports, the ad-hoc committee of members of Addis Ababa
Chamber of Commerce said that cargo, property and money amounting
to more than 127,333,288 U.S. Dollars have been misappropriated at
Assab and Massawa as of May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The special committee to which Malawi, Uganda and Zambia are
members, was endorsed by the COMESA council of ministers' decision
taken at Lusaka last December, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The special committee came here Tuesday to verify Ethiopia's
cargo claims and to hold discussions with Ethiopian government
officials and business community.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea are members of the COMESA, which
Ethiopia had formally requested to pressurize its northern
neighbor to comply with the international maritime and free trade
laws to release its cargo and pay compensations for possible
damages.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian cargo has been stranded at Eritrean ports of
Assab and Massawa immediately after the border dispute between the
two countries flared up last May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bombard Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. warplanes Thursday
bombarded an Iraqi missile site in Mosul, part of the no-fly zone
in northern Iraq, said a U.S. spokesman of the Inicrlik Air Base
in Adana in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
two F-15 fighter jets, which took off from the Inicrlik base,
fired three precision-guided bombs on the site after they were
targeted by an anti-aircraft artillery in the site, Turkey's
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The F-15 fighters have returned to the base safely and the
damage to the missile site is being assessed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the enforcement of the no-fly zone will continue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed a no-fly zone in northern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, to allegedly protect the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of allied forces stationed at the
jointly-operated Incirlik base as part of the Operation Northern
Watch to patrol the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 17 U.S. warplanes, taking off from the base,
bombarded two radar units and one anti-aircraft system in Mosul.
</P>
<P>
A day later, 17 U.S. fighter jets set out from the base again
along with six tanker aircraft, four transport planes and one
AWACS plane to continue the patrol mission.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday that
Turkey would not allow the U.S. to launch attacks against Iraq by
using warplanes based in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. warplanes at Incirlik were solely
commissioned with reconnaissance over northern Iraq to deter Iraqi
government forces from attacking Kurds and creating another exodus
of refugees to Turkey similar to the one following the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes 965 Million U.S. Dollars for Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed 965 million U.S. dollars in new and increased spending
Thursday to retrain dislocated workers, teach illiterate adults to
read and increase job opportunities for at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
The items include increased grants for adult literacy programs,
a toll-free number that connects displaced workers to unemployment
and retraining resources, and 50 million dollars to create jobs
for disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
Clinton unveiled the proposals at a training facility jointly
operated by AT&AMP;T, Lucent Technologies, the Communications Workers
of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which are subject to approval by the
Republican-controlled Congress in February, call for 190 million
dollars in increased spending in fiscal 2000 over last year's
figures for adult education and family literacy programs, 368
million dollars more for job retraining assistance, and 405
million dollars to increase youth employment.
</P>
<P>
Behind the initiatives is Clinton's conviction that the income
gap in America reflects a skills gap.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the proposals shows Clinton is asking Congress to
expand the Workforce Investment Act signed into law last year to
streamline the job training system into grants that allow workers
to choose what kind of training they need.

LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- British government said on
Thursday farm incomes fell by 32 percent in real terms in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Farm Ministry for Total Income From Farming (TIFF) said,"This
is the second substantial fall in a row, again due mainly to lower

The industry's total income in 1998 was put at 2.173 billion
pounds (3.59 billion U.S. dollars), compared to 3.073 billion

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An international refugee
committee has worked out a plan of action on the Palestinian
refugees over the coming six months, head of the committee Andrew
Robinson said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, France will coordinate efforts to help reunify
Palestinian families, Robinson told a news conference after the
three-day meeting of the committee in Egypt's Sinai resort of
Sheikh el Sheikh, 380 kilometers southeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which is holding the presidency of the committee, will
dispatch a mission to Jordan to study the conditions of
Palestinian refugees there, said Robinson, who is also Canada's
Mideast peace coordinator.
</P>
<P>
Italy will concert regional cooperation in training Palestinian
public health workers, he said, adding that the U.S. will set up a
workshop for vocational training for the refugees and organize a
meeting on economic and social issues in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the plan is to seek improvement of the living
standard of the Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza,
Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, where the refugee camps are
overpopulated.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "fruitful," Robinson said it offered "a
good opportunity" to review and solve problems of the refugees in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The refugee committee, formed in 1994, groups Egypt, Israel,
Jordan, Palestine, the U.S., Russia, Candada, the European Union,
France, Italy, Kuwait, Norway and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Four Mideast wars in the past half a century between Arab
countries and Israel have made millions of Palestinians refugees,
who have sought shelters mainly in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Jobs, Crime Still Major Concerns for S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Job creation and the high
crime rate remain the most serious concerns among the South
African electorate, figures of the latest Opinion '99 poll
released Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 75 percent of South Africans cited job
creation as the biggest problem with only 22 percent agreeing that
the government was doing a good job to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one percent felt crime was their biggest concern with
only 27 percent giving the government positive ratings for their
handling of the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll conducted in October and November last
year, concern over crime rose dramatically since 1994 when only
six percent felt it was a major problem. Three years later, the
figure increased to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey was done jointly by market researcher Markinor, the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa and the South African
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The poll, based on some 3,500 respondents, was the second of a
series of polls released since last November to monitor attitudes
toward elections, registrations and voting.
</P>
<P>
Besides job creation and crime rate, respondents also cited
housing, education and the economy as major areas of concern.

<HEADLINE> Study finds Methanol Safer for Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. study shows that
methanol is safer than gasoline to the environment and humans, the
American Methanol Institute (AMI) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study by the environmental engineering firm Malcolm Pirnie
found fewer environmental threats from using methanol in fuel cell
vehicles than using gasoline to power internal combustion engines,
AMI said in a press release from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Methanol has some inherent propertiens: it is capable of
completely mixing with water, degrades quickly in the atmosphere
and rapidly biodegrades in surface waters and underground, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, methanol is less toxic to humans than gasoline",
AMI said.
</P>
<P>
The findings are important as AMI has estimated that by 2010,
two million fuel cell vehicles may be used in the U.S. where 880
million gallons of methanol are to be on demand per year, calling
for the expansion of the methanol refueling infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Drop Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. steel imports in
December dropped sharply to 2.5 million tons, 31 percent lower
than the 3.6 million tons recorded in November, the Commerce
Department reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary figures, the first-ever in its
kind released by the Department, imports from Japan decreased by
47 percent to 384,597 tons in December from the 728,478 tons in
November.
</P>
<P>
This reversal could let Japan temporarily avoid broad trade
sanctions sought by struggling U.S. steel producers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had promised a
government-initiated trade complaint against Japan unless the
December figures showed a substantial reduction.
</P>
<P>
Steel imports from Russia, another target of U.S. steel
industry's complaints, dropped to 135,777 tons in December, a 79
percent decrease from the 658,363 tons a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The administration decided to release preliminary data,
beginning with the December figures, to give the U.S. steel
industry an earlier warning of import trends. Final figures are
due in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months last year, Japanese producers
shipped 5.7 million tons of steel products into the United States,
nearly three times the 2.1 million tons for the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the single-largest source of steel imports, which have
driven down prices in the United States and contributed to more
than 10,000 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. steel producers and two steelworkers unions already have
filed dumping complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil,
accusing them of flooding the United States with hot-rolled carbon
steel, the most common product, at prices lower than the costs of
making it.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decrease in Japanese and Russian imports appears to
reflect the prospect for additional tariffs threatened in a
November ruling from the Commerce Department. The Department
determined that any duties later applied against those countries
might be retroactive to mid-November because imports had surged so
much early last year.
</P>
<P>
A final ruling is not expected until this Summer, according to
local media.

"I don't see an opposition group that has the viability to
overthrow Saddam at this point," the Marine Corps general told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said the the policy of supporting opposition groups,
championed by congressional Republicans, "could be very dangerous"
if not done properly.
</P>
<P>
He raised the prospect of dozens of splinter groups competing
for power. "The last thing we need is another rogue regime," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Congress passed a bill to provide up to $97 million
in overt assistance to anti-Saddam groups operating inside and
outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who signed the bill into law, early
this year picked up seven groups from various opposition sections
as what his administration deemed worthy of assistance.
</P>
<P>
Zinni, who criticized the bill before passing in Congress, told
senators on Thursday that he still skeptical about the policy,
saying there are as many as 91 separate potential opposition
groups.
</P>
<P>
"They have little, if any, viability," he said. "Even if we had
Saddam gone, we could end up with 15, 20, or 90 groups competing
for power."
</P>
<P>
However, Defense Undersecretary Walter Slocombe supported the
current policy, saying: "We believe we have a comprehensive
strategy."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Haiti to End Political Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday urged Haiti's political leaders to negotiate a settlement
over the political stalemate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Haitian President Rene Preval has invited all major parties to
meet with him in the next few days to work on the problem, said
U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
After a combative parliament rejected four of Preval's nominees
to be prime minister, the president announced January 11 he would
bypass parliament and form a new government by decree.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, a bipartisan group of senators, wary that Preval
was moving to subvert democratic processes, is proposing an
emergency meeting of Organization of American States foreign
ministers to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
Foley said OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria was expected to
be in Haiti on Thursday for talks with Haitian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We along with other members of the international community
continue to stress the importance we attach to the continuity of
all of Haiti's democratic institutions," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The OAS could have a role in the Haitian situation under a
provision that calls for joint efforts whenever democratic
processes in member countries are interrupted.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Sees Political Investment in Stock at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that investing a portion of
the social security trust fund assets in equities would arguably
put at risk the efficiency of capital markets and thus U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan also
repeated his criticism of one element of President Clinton's plan,
having the government investment around 700 billion U.S. dollars
of Social Security money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that he doubted decisions on investing this
money could be insulated from political pressures.
</P>
<P>
On the politically sensitive issue of benefit cuts or tax
increases, he said the demographics of a huge baby boom generation
retiring and fewer workers left to support retirees present
policy-makers with few choices.
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood, these taxes will have to be raised, or
benefits cut, given that the system as a whole is still
significantly underfunded," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week in his State of the Union message, Clinton put
forward a major proposal that would reserve about 60 percent of
the government's projected budget surpluses over the next 15
years, an estimated 4.4 trillion dollars, for shoring up the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said changes to Social Security will also likely
needed, but has not said what they should be. The president said
he believes deep benefit cuts or increases in the payroll tax rate
will not be necessary, however. Republican leaders in Congress
have also said they want to avoid increasing taxes or reducing
retirees' standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan in his prepared testimony made no comments about
current economic conditions this time.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's views carry great weight on Capitol Hill, given
what most politicians believe has been his exceptional direction
of monetary policy during the current lengthy period of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He is also considered a top authority on Social Security. He
chaired the blue-ribbon commission that recommended the last major
changes to the government's giant benefits program in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan praised the main thrust of Clinton's initiative, to
pay down the national debt, but he said a section of the Clinton's
program that would directly invest about 700 billion dollars in
the stock market was flawed.
</P>
<P>
The administration has argued that decisions on where to invest
this money would be made by an independent board insulated from
political pressures. But Greenspan said he doubted this approach
would work because the large sums of money being talked about
would inevitable lead to pressures from elected officials to have
a say in how that money was being used.
</P>
<P>
And political decisions on such investments would make the
economy less efficient and ultimately lower this country's
standard of living, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan praised Clinton's proposal to reserve the bulk of
coming budget surpluses for shoring up Social Security, calling it
a "major step in the right direction" because it would boost
United States' low national savings rate. "If they actually
materialize," he said, they "can significantly reduce the fiscal
pressures created by our changing demographics". But he warned
that the 4.4 trillion dollars in surpluses being projected over
the next 15 years are based on uncertain economic forecasts and
might well fall short of those projections.
</P>
<P>
He said that raising taxes to bolster Social Security may
"prove too burdensome" given that the government's second biggest
social program, Medicare benefits for the elderly, will also need
bolstering.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman did not express a preference for how benefits
could be cut, but he did note several choices _ raising the
retirement age, reducing payments or lowering the annual
cost-of-living adjustments.

<HEADLINE> Chile Says It Can Deal With Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) - Chile on Thursday told Britain's
House of Laws that the arrest of its former leader Augusto
Pinochet broke international law, and said Chile could deal with
allegations against him at home.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Collins, a lawyer representing Chile, told the highest
court in Britain that Santiago was not trying to protect Pinochet
from prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's arrest in London last October 16 on a Spanish
extradition request had interfered in Chile's affairs "contrary to
international law", Collins said.
</P>
<P>
His arguments, which are the first made on behalf of the
Chilean government, were heard on the eighth day of the rehearing
before the Lords on the question of whether Pinochet is immune
from extradition to Spain, where he might face alleged trial of
torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
A Spanish judge accused the retired general of responsibility
for the deaths of thousands of people during his 17 year rule
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers argued that he is immune from prosecution as
a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Chile's government "deplores the fact of major violations of
human rights in Chile, and reaffirms its commitment to human
rights," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
He said Chile was unhappy with some of the arguments from
lawyers for Spain, in particular one in which "the republic of
Chile was equated with Nazi Germany".
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the rehearing might last to its third week
as lawyers from both sides are trying to offer new materials to
prove their saying before the seven Lords, who formed the new
panel to rule on Pinochet's immunity.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a lawyer for Spain accused Pinochet's lawyer of
dragging out the hearing by raising irrelevant issues in a
four-day presentation.
</P>
<P>
But Lord Browne-Wilkinson, chairman of the panel, noted Spain
had also added new arguments that had only been touched on in a
previous hearing of the case.
</P>
<P>
In November five Law Lords ruled by three to two that Pinochet
had no immunity. But the ruling was set aside after it emerged
that one of the judges had close links to Amnesty International, a
human rights group which has called for Pinochet's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Collins was scheduled to continue his arguments on Monday,
which will be the ninth day of the rehearing.
</P>
<P>
The hearing in November lasted only six days.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is now still under police guard in a mansion in
the suburb of London, waiting for the result of the House of
Lords' rehearing.
</P>
<P>
He might leave for Santiago immediately if the Highest Court in
Britain rules in his favor. A Chilean air force plane is waiting
in an airport near the mansion he lives in, ready to fly him back
to his hometown.

<HEADLINE> Global Trade Barriers Should be Removed: Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A top European Union (EU)
official on Thursday called for intensified action by the EU to
remove barriers to overseas markets for European businesses.
</P>
<P>
Vice president of the European Commission Sir Leon Brittan told
representatives of European industry in Brussels that he had
outlined plans for an ambitious "barriers removal program" for
1999.
</P>
<P>
This would include agreeing with the EU member states a package
of offensive dispute settlement cases to be pursued in the World
Trade Organization (WTO), making greater use of the EU's Trade
Barriers Regulation, tackling a series of major non-WTO issues
with each of the EU's major trading partners, and drawing up
bilateral market access packages with non-WTO countries, Brittan
said.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the substantial progress made under the EU's
1996 Market Access Strategy. Since 1996, the EU has launched no
fewer than 41 consultations in the WTO, Brittan said. "Such
activity is unprecedented. Those who believe that the EU is always
on the defensive in the WTO, because of highly publicized cases
such as bananas, should note that the EU is the most active user
of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism," the vice president
said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet despite the success which most of the world's free market
have enjoyed for a long time now, the principle of free trade is
by no means unchallenged," Brittan said, adding that it is a cause
which still needs to be defended and to be advanced by pracical
measures.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the financial crisis which has swept through
Asia, Russia and now Brazil," he said, "I discern a worrying
tendency on the part of some governments around the world to
retreat into thinly-disguised trade isolationism, or even into
old-fashioned protectionism."
</P>
<P>
The EU commission head for trade affairs also said many
companies in Europe appear to be drawing back from exporting to
emerging markets, which often seems to be considered a risky and
time-consuming distraction, in order to concentrate on the "safe"
and still-profitable Western European and North American markets.
"Such reaction are quite understandable. But they are misguided,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"For their part, European companies must not allow the recent
turbulence on world markets to deter them from seeking new export
markets, and developing a long-term presence as key players in the
global market. This is the way of the future. And it is essential
for the prosperity of Europe," Brittan told the meeting, which was
organized by Brussels Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Rise Slightly in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said Thursday that orders to factories for big-ticket durable
goods jumped 1.9 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted 193
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For the year of 1998, it said, orders for durable goods --
items from air conditioners to aircraft expected to last three or
more years -- rose just 3.5 percent, a marked deceleration from
7.1 percent increase of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department reported seasonally adjusted
first-time applications for jobless benefits dropped sharply last
week for the second week in a row after shooting up during late
December and early January.
</P>
<P>
A five-week low of 301,000 claims were filed, down from 316,000
the week before. And before that week, it even reached 360,000.
Analysts said the total appears to have returned to a level closer
to the longer-term trend after some difficulty adjusting the
statistics for seasonal fluctuation.

<HEADLINE> UK Urges Kosovo Rivals to Begin Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Thursday that the warring parties in the Serbian
province of Kosovo in former Yugoslavia should begin "intense
negotiations" to secure peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to start talking and stop fighting. We intend to
summon the parties and make them confront their responsibilities
to the people of Kosovo," Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is intense negotiations, with international
involvement, within days rather than weeks. We will ensure these
talks do not drag on -- we must see rapid progress towards a
lasting settlement in Kosovo," said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair are expected to issue a joint statement on Thursday night
pledging to underpin a settlement with forces on the ground along
with other allies, a British official said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, which comprises
Britain, the United States, Russia, Germany, Italy and France,
will meet in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical point for Kosovo. We have seen over the
last few months how both sides are determined to go down the path
of violence rather than negotiation. This path has already brought
misery to the people of Kosovo," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that once the peace talks in Kosovo started, a
deadline of two weeks might possibly be set by the Contact Group
for concluding an interim agreement on Kosovo, which could consist
of self-rule, elections, a police force reflecting the ethnic
balance and a three-year review clause in the region.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Good Economic Situation In Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
published on Thursday a comprehensive analysis of the economic
situation in Finland, concluding that the Finnish economy has been
doing quite well since the end of the severe recession of the
early nineties and particularly since joining the European Union
(EU) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysis said the northern European country needs
to do more to boost employment and to consolidate the government
accounts in the medium-term.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the assessment report gives Finland good remarks.
Striking progress has been made with budgetary consolidation: the
public deficit was reduced from 8 percent of GDP in 1993 to be in
surplus in 1998, while other positive features of the Finnish
economy include low inflation, appropriate wage trends and low
interest rates, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the analysis, the commission, the EU's executive body,
considers present priorities for Finnish economic policy are
reducing unemployment through social security and tax system
reforms, and continued efforts to ensure lasting sound public
finances in the face of population ageing.

<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain said on
Thursday they were prepared to send ground troops to Kosovo to
support any peace deal reached in the turbulent Serbian province of
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries "are willing to consider all forms of
military action... necessary to accompany the implementation of a
negotiated agreement," British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
French President Jacques Chirac said in a joint statement issued
in London.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Chirac dined on Thursday evening and discussed the
worsening situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, which comprises Britain,
the United States, Russia, Germany, Italy and France, will meet
in London on Friday and looks set to demand that the Serbs and
Albanians in Kosovo meet for peace talks in France within a week
or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Blair said in the communique that they were
"determined to act to prevent the Kosovo crisis from turning into
another humanitarian tragedy and from threatening the stability of
the region."
</P>
<P>
"If an early political agreement proves impossible, the two
(French and British) leaders believe that all options will need
to be considered," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal Begin Talks on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Portugal
are scheduled to begin U.N.-brokered talks on East Timor Friday,
it was announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to continue through the next week, will focus on a
U.N. proposal for East Timor autonomy, U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker
told reporters after preliminary discussions on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marker, appointed in 1997 to break the talks for a solution to
the long-standing issue between Portugal and Indonesia, said he
hopes that the parties will reach an agreement at the end of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked about news reports that Indonesia may consider allowing
independence for East Timor, Marker said he would wait for
Indonesia's clarification on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's senior government officials were quoted as saying
on Wednesday that if East Timor people won't accept Indonesia's
offer for special autonomy, then Indonesia would discuss the
"release" of East Timor from the republic.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the news, while
urging maximum restraint and political wisdom on all parts in
dealing with the important period of transition.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a former Portugal colony until 1975. It was
occupied by Indonesia in 1976. The United Nations has since been
seeking a peaceful and just settlement to the issue.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Report: Philippine Rebels Free 510 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels freed 510 of 570 hostages Thursday night, but
brought along 20 teachers and 40 students as they retreated toward
Datu Piang in Maguindanao, Philippine Daily Inquirer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a local official as saying that the released
were 50 teachers and 460 students.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper report has not been confirmed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada Thursday down-played a
report that 1,000 MILF rebels took about 500 children and 70
teachers inside an elementary school in Capinpilan, Midsayap,
North Cotabato, as hostages.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that there were only 50 children and teachers who
were seeking refuge from fighting between government troops and
MILF rebels, and they had not been taken hostages.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he received the information from armed force
chief Joselin Nazareno.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine News Agency reported Thursday night that
local officials were negotiating the release of the hostages and
they were expected to strike a deal with the rebels Thursday night
for the release of the victims, especially the children.
</P>
<P>
A three-week fighting between the two sides in Southern
Mindanao have killed at least 31 people and wounded dozens of
others. Thousands of people have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
The government and the rebel group reached a ceasefire
Wednesday night but fighting reportedly continued Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Plan for Immediate Vote on Clinton's Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republicans on
Thursday crushed a Democratic call for an immediate vote on
President Bill Clinton's fate and adopted their own plan to allow
public airing of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky's vide
otaped testimony at Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
The rapid-fire developments on the Senate floor followed
strict party lines after Senate leaders deadlocked in daylong
efforts to negotiate a bipartisan timetable for the conclusion of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
Both sides envisioned a final vote on impeachment by February
12, and the depositions are to begin on next Monday. But there
were numerous differences on key details in the interim.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 55 to 43 against a motion by Senator Tom Daschle,
the Democratic leader, to go immediately to four final hours of
debate and then vote on the two articles of impeachment accusing
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with
his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the Senate rejected Daschle's plan to limit to
writing all records of the depositions of witnesses, preventing
the videotaping the House Republican prosecutors want and the
White House opposes.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans then pushed through their rules -- 54-44
--which would permit videotaping of the questioning and leave
open the possibility that it would be aired publicly.
</P>
<P>
The voting came after hours of sparring between Republicans
and Democrats over the way to conduct the final stages of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, put the rival plans
to votes with a minimum of explanation, which prompted one of his
colleagues to ask about details.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to
convict Clinton and remove him from office, which most still
consider to be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Gabriela Szabo Wants to Set World Record at 5,000 Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Romanian ace runner Gabriela
Szabo on Thursday vowed to break the world record at 5,000 meters
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If last year, at the Berlin Grand Prix, I succeeded to set a
new European record, and was only 3 seconds short of the world
record, in 1999 I want to be better than Chinese Jiang Bo who
retains the world record at 5,000 meter," Gabriela Szabo was
quoted as saying on Thursday by local press.
</P>
<P>
According to her results, Szabo was at the top of the 1,500
meters, 2,000 meters, 3,000 meters, one mile and 5,000 meters
races in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As 1999 precedes the Olympic year, it will be a difficult year
for Romanian athletics. "We hope everything will be okay and
we'll get many medals at the world championships," added Szabo.
</P>
<P>
After a period of training in Morocco, Szabo went to
Poshefeftorum, an altitude training site at 1,600 meters out of
Johannesburg which she said is "very good for the start of a new
season."
</P>
<P>
Szabo will return to Europe in late January for the first
competitions organized this year.
</P>
<P>
She will return to Romania on February 22 and on February 24
she will go with the Romanian delegation to Japan, to the World
Indoor Championships, where she hopes to win a gold medal.

<HEADLINE> Korda Awaits Doping Case Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The High Court in London will
deliver a ruling on Friday in the drugs case involving tennis
star Petr Korda.
</P>
<P>
Korda, who failed to retain the Australian Open title earlier
this month, is trying to stop attempts by the International
Tennis Federation (ITF) to have its own decision not to ban him
overturned.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Czech Republic player tested positive for the
banned steroid nandrolone at Wimbledon last July.
</P>
<P>
He was stripped of prize money and ranking points but an
appeal panel decided not to impose a one-year suspension after he
insisted he had no idea how the drug came to be present in a
urine sample he submitted in July.
</P>
<P>
Now the ITF wants to enforce the ban by appealing to the Court
of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The organization believes its own appeals board was wrong in
only docking Korda his ranking points and prize money in December.
</P>
<P>
But Korda's counsel, Charles Flint QC, told the court that the
ITF, under its own anti-doping programme, had no right in law to
appeal against the decision, which was "final and binding" on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The ITF argued, he added, that any such decision was only
final if not appealed and that, under its rules, the ITF or any
player had an "unfettered right" to re-open and re-argue any
decision at a full re-hearing in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Flint said: "We say that argument is incompatible with the
wording of the anti-doping programme and wholly inconsistent with
its code.
</P>
<P>
"The programme is designed to provide for speedy and final
determination of disputes as to allegations of doping before an
independent expert committee."
</P>
<P>
Korda's case is a rarity in tennis which has had only a
handful of positive drug tests in the past five years, none
involving top players and most covering recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
He was given the cold shoulder by fellow players and
spectators when he defended his Open title in Australia this
month, and was knocked out by American Todd Martin in the third
round.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier Warns Air Strikes on Kosovo May be Fiasco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO air strikes in the
crisis-stricken Serbian province of Kosovo without ensuring the
safety of the civilian population would be a fiasco, said Italian
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Thursday by the U.S. national daily
USA Today, D'Alema said that using force in Kosovo would be to
"rationalize it in terms of targets".
</P>
<P>
However, he added that because Italy was a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), his country agreed to the
use of air bases on national territory for launching such strikes.
</P>
<P>
If force is necessary to win compliance with United Nations
resolutions, "this is an option", he said, adding that there was
a duty in Kosovo to defend life against unacceptable and barbaric
repression.
</P>
<P>
"But, at the same time, we have to explain to the Serbs and
Albanians to get into agreement on a formula which will guarantee
stability in the region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Juninho Set for 10 Million Pounds Villa Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Juninho is set to sign for
Aston Villa early next week in a 10 million pounds move.
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory is understood to have offered
Juninho a five-year contract worth 1.5 million pounds a year,
which is acceptable to the Brazilian star.
</P>
<P>
Juninho is back in Spain after flying to Birmingham on
Wednesday for a 90-minute meeting with Gregory.
</P>
<P>
And the Villa chief is believed to have been involved in
further talks on Thursday with Juninho's British representative
Giaini Paladini.
</P>
<P>
The news will come as a shock to Juninho's former club
Middlesborough - who had been hoping to lure him back to the
Riverside stadium with a reported 50,000 pounds a week deal.
</P>
<P>
But Gregory remains confident that Villa's increased standing
in the game - plus the carrot of a Champions' League place if
they maintain their current Premiership position - will sway
Juninho in moving to the Midlands club.
</P>
<P>
Gregory has already been assured of the financial backing to
bankroll such a deal by the club's executive board of directors.
</P>
<P>
He knows that signing Juninho would convince people that Villa
deserve to be considered on the same level as other top
Premierhsip clubs.
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes ahead it will smash the club record of 7
million pounds paid out by Brian Little nearly two years ago to
sign controversial striker Stan Collymore.

LHASA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Every morning in this capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, hundreds of Buddhists
begin their daily praying around the Potala Palace at the city's
northwestern corner.
</P>
<P>
Before the repairs on the Potala, garbage piled up at the
square in front of it, said Gyaincain Ooizhion, a 75-year-old
Tibetan who once held the position of majordomo to the 14th Dalai
Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Now the square is as magnificent and clean as Tian'anmen
Square in Beijing", he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zhatang Temple in Shannan Prefecture, famous for its
frescos, was listed as one of the country's key protected
cultural sites in 1996, two months after the completion of repair
work on the Potala.
</P>
<P>
There are now 80 historical sites in Tibet under special
protection, and the Potala Palace is on the World Cultural
Heritage list of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
Vjam Dbyangs, director of the Regional Cultural Relics Bureau,
said that cultural relics in Tibet have been give unprecedented
protection over the past forty years by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has so far established seventeen
cultural administration and protection organizations in Tibet, he
said, and local cultural and archeological officials have
conducted research and investigations on the region's cultural
relics resources.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denies Sending Troops to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government on
Thursday denied foreign news reports that it had sent troops to
Angola to support the government of President Antonio Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
"It is totally untrue that there are Cuban troops in that
African country," Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said,
adding that "this is pure speculation."
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the Angolan government had requested the
sending of Cuban troops, saying that Havana was confident that
Angola and the African community could end the conflict between
the government troops and rebels.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Alejandro Gonzalez categorically denied Cuba's military presence
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba was concerned over the clashes with a
nti-government forces of the military arm of the National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, the Cuban troops went to Angola at the
request of this African country's then President Agostinho Neto
to support the forces of the ruling People's Liberation Movement
of Angola party.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's military presence in Angola continued until the end of
the 1980s, after they helped repel a South African offensive in
the south of the country and a peace accord was signed.

<P>
These scholars have discovered 1,700 cultural relic sites,
collected a vast amount of historical documents, and taken over
7,000 photographs over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also have published dozens of books and
dictionaries and maps and records of these historic relics and
sites. At the same time, the central cultural relics department
has spent more than 100 million yuan repairing many temples and
historical sites, with repairs to the 34,000 square meters of the
Potala Palace buildings alone costing 55 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
First built in the seventh century, the Potala was crumbling
due to long years of neglect before the refurbishment conducted
by the central government, because the old Tibetan governors
lacked the ability to repair this cultural landmark, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, exhibitions of Tibetan cultural relics have been
held in many foreign countries including France, Japan, Italy and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
With 100 million yuan of investment from the central
government, a museum on Tibetan Culture has been built and opened
to public.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China,
historical documents record a Tibetan history of 1,000 years. But
the three Neolithic sites discovered in recent years by central
and local cultural departments provide valuable evidence that
Tibetan history can be dated back some 4,500 to 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The historical relics unearthed are very similar to those in
the inland areas of China, he said, proving that the autonomous
region's close links with other parts of China began at least
4,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vjam mentioned Tong Enzheng, a professor with Sichuan
University and the archeologist who made the discovery. "The 14th
Dalai Lama had to admit that the Chinese central government did a
great good deed when he attended a related lecture given by Tong
in the United States," Vjam said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Takes New Measures to Stop Capital Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's central bank adopted
two new measures to attract foreign funds and curb capital flight
on Thursday .
</P>
<P>
The first measure reduces from 180 to 90 the number of days
foreign invested capital is required to remain in the country,
said Demosthenes Madureira, head of the international department
of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Madureira said the new shorter terms included all foreign
loans such as bonds, commercial paper and the so-called "63
caipira" through which banks can obtain foreign loans to fund
agriculture. Since 1997, the caipiras terms have also applied to
federal bonds offering higher earnings and less risks.
</P>
<P>
The shorter terms, however, would not be applied to foreign
loans to export firms or to funds used for the construction or
purchase of new buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
The second measure allows foreign investors to invest money in
the stock, commodity and futures markets and to invest their
profits in national treasury or central bank bonds.
</P>
<P>
Madureira pointed out that the two measures would help curb
capital flight, and to avoid pressure from speculators on the
exchange rate, which is causing a devaluation in the country's
currency -- the real.
</P>
<P>
The real registered a two percent drop on Thursday as the U.S.
dollar closed at 1.95 reals, compared to Wednesday's 1.89 rate.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, at least 8.2 billion dollars
have left Brazil, as investors' confidence in the economy eroded
and the demand for dollars increased.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, cental bank leader Francisco Lopes said
Brazil's reserves amounted to 36 billion dollars, including nine
billion dollars from a recent rescue package of 41.5 billion
dollars from foreign lenders.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Farming Production Down 3.21 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's agricultural
output fell 3.21 percent last year, the government Geography and
Statistics Institute said in a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Production totaled over 75 million tons of grain, vegetables
and oleaginous plants last year, 3.21 percent less than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The institute also predicted a continuing decline in
agricultural output this year, since producers had planted 27.68
million hectares, 0.4 percent less than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The output of half of the total 18 products rose last year,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The highest 1998 figures were registered for cotton, with a
growth of 46.36 percent, and coffee, with a 44.37 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The lowest outputs compared to 1997 were registered for rice,
with a 16.09 percent drop, while the output of wheat fell 8.96
percent, and onions fell 5.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
The institute said 93 percent of total farming output came
from the states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais,
the central and southern states of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and 1998, crops were affected by abnormal weather
patterns triggered by the warming of tropical Pacific waters, a
phenomenon know as El Nino, which caused droughts and destroyed
32.34 percent of crops in north and northeast Brazil, causing a
shortfall in food which affected nearly 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is one of the world's largest agricultural producers
and the biggest in products like sugar, oranges and coffee.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Supriati Sutono, Indonesian
winner of the women's 5,000 meters run at last year's Asian Games
in Bangkok, is aiming at improving her performance record at the
World Track and Field Championships scheduled in Spain in August.
</P>
<P>
Supriati clocked 15 minutes 54.45 seconds in her winning run
in Bangkok and, as coach Nicky Pattiasina said, she will target
to peg on 15 minutes 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Nicky hinted that his protege would not skip the 20th South
East Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei, although the two tournaments
will be held one after the other in the same month.
</P>
<P>
"Supriati may turn the SEA Games into a sparring arena ahead
of the world championship where she is expected to reach her
peak," Nicky was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Nicky said he did not fear Supriati being injured during the
SEA Games so long as preparation was well programmed.
</P>
<P>
However, Supriati can't afford to lose in Brunei. Otherwise
she is highly likely to miss the world tournament.
</P>
<P>
"If she loses there must be something wrong in her
preparation. And this will need evaluation," Nicky added.

<HEADLINE> China Warned of AIDS Epidemic in Floating People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's AIDS control
institutions have urged efforts to control the spread of HIV/AIDS
in the floating population because they are highly susceptible to
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The country has 120 million people on the move annually. About
80 million of them are rural laborers migrating to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the rural migrants are young people and adults in the
prime of their lives. Deprived in their knowledge of culture and
hygiene, these people are weak in self-protection and thus easily
infected with HIV," today's China Daily quoted Liang Guoyun, an
expert at the National Center for STD (sexually transmitted
disease) and Leprosy Control as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since these people frequently change work sites and travel
seasonally between rural and urban areas, they, in turn, are
likely to become transmitters of HIV or STDs," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has revealed that 12,580 HIV infection
cases were reported throughout the country by the end of last
year. Of them, 439 patients developed full-blown AIDS and 337
have died.
</P>
<P>
Because blood testing is now available only among high-risk
groups of people, experts estimate the actual number of HIV/AIDS
cases has exceeded 300,000 and may hit 1.2 million next year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Association of Prevention and Control of STDs and
AIDS has planned to set up a network including public health,
family planning and the media to further prevention efforts in
floating people.

Drugs then leave Ukraine for other destinations within the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stresses NATO Ultimatum on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday reinforced the threat of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to use force in Kosovo even as it promised to
keep pressing both sides for a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic continued to refuse
to withdraw his forces from the southern Serbian province, "those
threats may become very real", said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
"We think that it's very important that we move towards an
interim settlement that will end the fighting and move towards
self-rule in Kosovo," Lockhart said at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to, on the diplomatic track, put pressure on
Milosevic and the Kosovo Albanians to reach an agreement. But we
will also continue on the NATO track to use the credible threat
of force to make him comply with the agreements he made in
October," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Foley also stressed
the diplomatic effort was backed by force.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that by marrying an accelerated diplomatic effort
with a willingness to back that effort with NATO's capabilities,
it will be possible to achieve a negotiated settlement to this
conflict," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
warned of a "critical turning point" and admonished the warring
parties to begin peace talks immediately or face allied military
action.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said in a statement that NATO "stands ready to
act and rules out no option".
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet in London with
other representatives of the six-nation Contact Group, made up of
the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, on
efforts to bring peace to Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Nuclear Power Plant Running Well: IAEA Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- International atomic energy
experts said Thursday they were satisfied with the operation in
Bulgaria's Kozlodoui nuclear power plant after a three-week
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Zigmund Domaracky, head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) team, said they were impressed with the significant
improvements made in the plant and also made a number of further
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"The recommendations are not of a dramatic nature. We voiced
many positive evaluations about the program for the nuclear
plant's repairs," Domaracky said after briefing Deputy Prime
Minister Evgenii Bakurdjiev on the inspection result.
</P>
<P>
According to the plant's deputy manager in charge of safety,
Yordan Kostadinov, this mission may turn out to be a crucial
turning point in the attitude of the Western Europe to the
Bulgarian nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
He said the experts acknowledged that the plant could fully
guarantee the safe exploitation of the four 440-megawatt units.
The IAEA has made 48 recommendations, which, according to
Kostadinov, was within the usual number of between 40 and 60 made
by each mission.
</P>
<P>
He noted the mission's evaluation will be a strong argument
which the Bulgarian government will use in its future
negotiations with the European Union on the future of the small
power units.
</P>
<P>
Plant chief Krassimir Nikolov said a detailed report on the
IAEA recommendations will be sent to the government in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The Kozlodoui management will invite the IAEA experts to visit
Bulgaria again in 18 months to see how their recommendations have
been followed.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Support to Non-State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China needs to take effective
measures to facilitate the growth of the non-state sector so as
to ensure a sound development of the national economy, according
to a senior official of the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The government should further adopt proper policies and
provide necessary support to the non-state sector, Zheng Xinli,
deputy secretary-general of the commission, said in an article in
the latest issue of the Economy and Infotimes monthly published
this week.
</P>
<P>
Due to waning demand and market expectation as well as
insufficient capital supply, the growth rate of the non-state
economy has been falling markedly for the past year.
</P>
<P>
Investment by the non-state sector witnessed a zero growth at
best in 1998, compared to a 22 percent increase in state sector
investment, Zheng revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is extremely abnormal, given that investment by
the non-state sector grew by an average annual rate of 28.6
percent in the past two decades, 10.2 percent more than the state
sector," Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the non-state sector, encouraged by
the state's reform and opening-up policy, contributes about 75
percent of the gross domestic product and the state sector only
25 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
"The recent slowdown in the growth of the non-state sector
should be taken seriously and the problem should be tackled,"
Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to maintain the vigor and momentum of the
non-state sector," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China and Cote d'Ivoire should
extend cooperation and actively explore new ways to raise
friendly bilateral cooperation to greater heights, China's
Vice-President Hu Jintao said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived in Abidjan Thursday for an official visit,
told Cote d'Ivoire President Henri Konan Bedie that the Chinese
government respected his important contributions to the
friendship between the two nations and its peoples.
</P>
<P>
The Cote d'Ivoire government, under Bedie's leadership, is
striving to safeguard their national stability and unity, and has
achieved favorable results in developing its economy, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic achievements have proved that stability
is a significant pre-condition for a nation's progress, and only
through development can stability be effectively guaranteed, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cote d'Ivoire's experiences can serve as a
good example for other developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed Bedie on China's domestic situation and its
views on the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bedie recalled his visit to China in 1997 and thanked China
for its support and assistance over the years. He hoped bilateral
cooperation would continue to score achievements.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Hu met with a delegation from the ruling
Democratic Party and briefed them on the Chinese Communist Party.
Following the meeting, Bedie hosted a banquet in Hu's honor.
</P>
<P>
Hu is scheduled to confer with Prime Minister Daniel Kablan
Duncan on Friday.
</P>

After the Cote d'Ivoire tour ends on January 31, Hu will
proceed to South Africa, the last leg of his 13-day four-nation
African tour, which will end on February 4.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budget Surpluses to Reach 2.6 Trillion Dollars Over Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) predicted on Thursday that the federal budget
surplus will total 2.6 trillion U.S. dollars over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The CBO, a nonpartisan budget office, also said nearly
one-third of the 2.6 trillion U.S. dollars -- 787 billion
dollars-- would come from the non-Social Security side of the
budget over the period ending in 2009.
</P>
<P>
In his States of the Union Address delivered last week,
President Bill Clinton projected his administration will run a
total budget surplus of 4.4 trillion dollars over the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The mere expectation of those huge numbers is already opening
the door for a bitter partisan fight over what to do with the
money.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed setting aside 2.7 trillion dollars of
the surplus for Social Security. He also wanted to use the rest
of the surplus -- about 1.7 trillion dollars -- for Medicare, the
health insurance program for the elderly; to help set up private
retirement accounts for Americans; and for defense and domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans, however, have signaled they want to use the
rest of the surplus for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
CBO projected that the surplus for the fiscal year of 1999,
which started October 1, 1998, would be 107 billion dollars, 50
percent more than the 1998 total of 70 billion dollars. In the
year 2009, the surplus is expected to rise to 381 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the budget office projected 1.5 trillion dollars
in surpluses between 1999 and 2008.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department is
expanding its investigation of the Olympic bribery scandal to
determine whether a Salt Lake Olympic official carried about
$50,000 to Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 when the 2002 Winter Games
were awarded.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents interviewed former Salt Lake Councilman Tom
Godfrey, who said the Olympic official acknowledged carrying the
money to Hungary in the days before Salt Lake was announced as
the host city.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey provided the official's name to agents last night,
said a person with knowledge of the interview.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey said he could not provide details of his discussion
with the FBI. He has identified the official only as a staff
member of the Salt Lake Olympic bid committee.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey was a member of the Salt Lake Olympic delegation that
traveled to Budapest in June 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Bows to People's Will on E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) vowed that the military would support the people if they
wanted East Timor to be separated from Indonesia, Press reports
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with President B.J. Habibie, ABRI Commander
Gen. Wiranto said Thursday: "I think it is the best choice at the
moment should such an option (independence) come some day. This
should be accepted by the whole nation and ABRI will defend it."
</P>
<P>
The shift in Indonesia's policy on East Timor was announced by
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Wednesday after a cabinet meeting
headed by President Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said if the government's offer to give the province
special autonomy was rejected, the granting of independence could
be considered after the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
If the forthcoming People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session
really adopts a resolution to let East Timor go, the ABRI will be
ready to safeguard its implementation, Wiranto noted.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also defense minister, however, warned the
nation not to forget the sacrifices of the country, and of the
soldiers and civilians who lost their lives to defend the
territory's integration into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to Wiranto, more than 1,000 ABRI members lost their
lives in East Timor. "This figure does not include the East
Timorese and non-East Timorese people who were killed," he added.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the U.N. has not
recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Deputy PM Meets EU Envoy on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Deputy Prime Minister
Ratko Markovic emphasized to the European Union Thursday that any
negotiations on Kosovo should take place within Serbia or
Yugoslavia, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to EU special envoy to Kosovo Wolfgang
Pietritsch, who reiterated the EU's proposal that peace
negotiations be held outside Yugoslavia to seek a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue began in Pristina and that is where it should
continue," Markovic was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that peace talks should not just include Serbians and
ethnic Albanians, they should also include all other ethnic
groups in Kosovo, such as Turks, gypsies and non-Albanian Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Pietritsch, along with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, has been
asking the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which is
fighting for the province's independence, to participate in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, a spokesman for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's Socialist Party ruled out the possibility of
government negotiations with the rebels whom they consider
"terrorists".
</P>
<P>
The KLA, for its part, has long rejected the idea of a peace
talks unless they will lead to full independence, despite strong
international pressure for Kosovo to remain within Yugoslavia.

Lhasa, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures explaining the ethnic regional autonomy system practiced
in the Tibet Autonomous Region:
</P>
<P>
Tibet is an area where the Tibetans live in compact
communities, with people of the Tibetan ethnic group making up 95
percent of the total population of 2.44 million in the autonomous
region, and the people of the Han and other ethnic groups
accounting for only five percent. According to the Constitution
of the People's Republic of China, the state practices the ethnic
regional autonomy system in Tibet, which has been established as
the Tibet Autonomous Region. Between 1965 and 1998 more than 110
local laws and regulations were worked out, such as the Rules of
Procedure of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region
and the Regulations on the Study, Use and Development of the
Tibetan Language in the Tibet Autonomous Region (for trial
implementation), covering politics, the economy, culture,
education, environmental protection and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The legislative and administrative organs of the Tibet
Autonomous Region have designated the Tibetan New Year, the
Sholton and other traditional festivals of the Tibetan ethnic
group as the Region's holidays, in addition to the official
national holidays. In accordance with the special natural and
geographical conditions of Tibet, the autonomous region has
decreed a work week of no more than 35 hours, five hours less
than the official national work week for workers and staff.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of laws and regulations
worked out since 1992 by the People's Congress of the Tibet
Autonomous Region and its Standing Committee to safeguard the
interests of the Tibetan people in light of the actual conditions
in Tibet exceeds the total formulated during the 12 years
preceding 1992.

<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China has introduced a series
of preferential loan and fee exemption policies to accelerate the
development of coal gas as one of the nation's major new energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baoming, director of the State Administration of Coal
Industry, said the government will not require enterprises

overcome a shortfall in the energy supply. The increased use of
coal gas is expected to improve the country's consumption
structure of energy resources, reduce air pollution and enhance
safe production.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has abundant coal gas resources,
with 3.5 billion cu.m in estimated reserves for coal fields in
north, northeast and south China.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed over 50 coal gas projects in recent
years, including gas storage tanks with a total capacity of
650,000 cu.m. and coal gas pipelines with a cumulative length of
620,000 meters.

<HEADLINE> China to Upgrade Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China plans large-scale
upgrades for its power plants as part of an effort to control
pollution, increase efficiency and guarantee the safe operation
of power grids, according to a senior power official.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yan, president of the China State Power Corporation
(CSPC), said today that plans call for completing technological
upgrades on 7.5-8.0 million kw medium- and low-pressure condenser
tube generating units which have been in operation for at least
25 years.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to improve the capability of related units to meet
peak demand for power consumption, increase security, lower
energy consumption and improve environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the average coal use for power plants nationwide must
be reduced by an average of 34 grams for production of a kilowatt
hour of electricity.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that more than 95 percent of voltage in major
cities must meet the national standard, and the reliability rate
of the power supply must hit at least 99.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that China's power grids should strengthen
coordination to ensure the transmission and control capacities of
the country's five major regional and 15 provincial power
companies reach advanced international levels.

<HEADLINE> China to Tap Huge Potential for Hydropower Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's plan to increase its
installed hydropower capacity by five million kw annually between
2000-2010 will provide a vast potential market for foreign
enterprises and consortia.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the China State Power Corporation said
the country leads the world in terms of hydropower resources,
with related exploitable energy resources estimated at 376
million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he pointed out a great deal must be still be done
to exploit the nation's enormous hydropower resources. China's
total hydropower generating capacity currently accounts for only
13.8 percent of the total exploitable potential, a level which is
substantially lower than the worldwide average.
</P>
<P>
China's medium- to long-term hydropower development plan calls
for raising the total capacity to 70 million kw by the year 2000,
and still further to 125 million kw, or 33.1 percent of total
exploitable hydropower resources, by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have helped boost China's hydropower deve
lopment, said the official, adding that 23 major hydropower
projects in operation or under construction involve foreign
funding of close to four 4 billion U.S. dollars. The projects
have a total generating capacity of over 18.84 million
kilowatts.

COLOMBO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 116 foreign and

jobs for 22,363 youths. Investments in these projects are likely
to increase with their expansion in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These projects are the result of the government's various
incentive packages offered through its budgets to boost the
industrial sector," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investors had shown special interest in investing in textiles,
wearing apparel and leather products in the country.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Plays Bigger Role In Cross-Strait Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province
has conducted more frequent higher level exchanges with Taiwan,
according to a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
More provincial and city government officials have had a
chance to visit Taiwan. Some 1,000 people joined 150 programs to
visit Taiwan last year. In the past two decades, the province has
organized 835 exchange programs to promote cross-straits
relations, involving 5,373 people in culture, sports, art,
science, and medical programs.
</P>
<P>
Because Guangdong is just across the Straits from Taiwan so it
has a geographical advantage for cross-straits relations,
besides neighboring Fujian Province, which is much closer to the
island province. It is also native home to many people who live i
n Taiwan. Over 7.6 million Taiwanese have visited the province
since 1978, and 19,000 people from Guangdong have been to Taiwan
on private visits.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's fast growing economy has been attractive to
Taiwanese investors, who have set up 10,000 companies here, with
15 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts, some 7 billion
dollars of which has been used.

WARSAW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Polish Defense Minister Janusz
Onyszkiewicz said here on Thursday that the United States will
provide some of its "surplus military equipment" to Poland at
little or no cost.

<P>
Poland will receive gratuitously, or with a small token fee,

<HEADLINE> Toronto Bidders Expose Olympic Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The organizers of Toronto's bid
for the 1996 Olympic Games disclosed that visiting members of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) milked them for about
800,000 Canadian dollars (520,000 U.S. dollars) through airfare
scams and other abuses eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Friday that at least 18
IOC members appeared to have cashed in first-class plane tickets
that the bid group provided and many of them asked for gifts of
"cash, jewelry or other items easily converted to cash."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the organizers made public a 26-page report in
which they made those charges in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was submitted to the Swiss-based committee after Toronto
finished third behind Atlanta and Athens in a 1990 vote on the
1996 host city.
</P>
<P>
The IOC thanked them for the report but never got back to them
about it, the group said.
</P>
<P>
The report gave no names and the organizers refused to do so
Thursday as they handed out copies in response to charges that
they granted questionable favors to at least a few IOC members or
their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1991 report, abuses "associated with IOC
member visits" may have cost the group "some 700,000-800,000
Canadian dollars (455,000-520,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Toronto group spent four years and 16.8 million Canadian
dollars (10.92 million U.S. dollars), trying to get the Games.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Leader on Bangla-Indian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said Friday that the relations between Bangladesh and India
are good and there are no major problems for enhancing such ties.
</P>
<P>
She said this at a press conference she held at her residence
Friday afternoon right after she returned from West Bengal of
India where she paid a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Though the relations between the next-door neighboring
countries are harmonious, there are still some problems such as
water sharing of other common rivers besides the Ganges, border
disputes and the trade gap, she noted.
</P>
<P>
These problems could be solved through negotiations so long as
the both sides attach great importance to their relations, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question, she said the bus service between Dhaka and
Calcutta would be soon launched and this would become an impetus
to the promotion of trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Bangladesh and India are preparing to further strengthen
the existing cooperation in various fields on the basis of mutual
benefit and to bring a much better bilateral relationship into a
new century, she added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Against NATO Threat of Force on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it is
categorically opposed to the threat of force against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia made by NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Our principle attitude to the matter remains unchanged. Any
attempts of using force against a sovereign state in
circumvention of the U.N. Security Council is unacceptable," the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is surprising that in its statements it not only tried to
foresee the decision of the ministerial meeting of the Contact
Group but tried to link them to the scenarios of the use of force
planned by the alliance," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States, the member states of the Contract
Group on former Yugoslavia, were scheduled to meet Friday in
London to discuss the worsening situation in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. Clashes between government forces and ethnic
Albanian separatists have left dozens people dead in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Contact Group itself is capable of deciding whether to
seek assistance from anyone or not," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It was also groundless to claim that the U.N. shares the aims
of the alliance, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The aspiration of NATO to rise above the U.N. is tantamount
to trying to undermine the existing international security
system," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes that "any attempts of outside interference by
force in Kosovo are counterproductive."

<HEADLINE> Progress Made on POPs Treaty in UNEP Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from 103 countries
Friday made solid progress in drafting a global treaty to reduce
and eliminate emissions and discharges of persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) at the second round of talks convened by the
U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
The talks began on January 25 and ended at the UNEP
headquarters here Friday. The talks are the one of the five
anticipated negotiating sessions to reach a global agreement on
POPs by the year 2000, the deadline set in the UNEP Governing
Council mandate issued in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the constructive progress made this week
will produce a legally binding agreement by the year 2000 that
will help safeguard people worldwide from these dangerous
pollutants and protect generations to come," said UNEP Executive
Director Klaus Toepfter.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 delegates from 103 countries have agreed to a
draft text as the working basis for discussions of all substantive
articles. They explored from technical and policy perspectives,
issues involved in restricting or eliminating the 12 POPs listed
in the UNEP mandate as well as scientific criteria for identifying
other POPs for inclusion in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They also examined issues associated with implementation,
including capacity building, technology transfer, and financing,
which are key to the ability of nations to fulfil their
responsibilities under the future treaty.
</P>
<P>
The draft text and meeting report will serve as the basis for
the third round of talks, tentatively set for September or October
1999.
</P>
<P>
The talks have focused on provisions to reduce and eliminate
the 12 POPs and how to ensure that all countries can successfully
implement the provisions.
</P>
<P>
The POPs under debate are aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin,
dioxin, endrin, furans, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex,
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and toxaphene.
</P>
<P>
The 12 "dirty dozen" fall into three categories: pesticides,
industrial chemicals and unintended byproducts of combustion and
industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have also agreed that the treaty must have criteria
and a procedure to add new POPs to the convention. A Criteria
Expert Group was established at the first round of talks in
Montreal. It met in Bangkok, Thailand in October 1998 where it
reached early consensus on proposed scientific criteria. It
plans to meet again later this year to continue its work.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Kills 52 in North Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Meningitis, which broke out
recently in Rwanda, has claimed 52 lives in three communes of
northern Ruhengeri prefecture, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two others are reportedly hospitalized in local health
centers and at Nemba Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The communes scourged by the epidemic are Cyabingo, Nyamugal
and Cyeru.
</P>
<P>
The officer in charge of Ruhengeri Health District, Charles
Furaha, said that about 40,000 doses of vaccine are needed to
contain the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General in the Ministry of Health, Charles
Rudakubana, who visited the area Thursday confirmed the existence
of meningitis in the three communes and said that an emergency
team as well as drugs will be sent there soon.
</P>
<P>
Similar outbreaks of meningitis hit the Umutara region and
Ngarama Commune in northeast Rwanda in the past few months. But
the number of people who might have perished because of the
epidemic is not known.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-S. Korean Balloon Team to Traverse Yellow Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expedition is held in honor of the seventh anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South
Korea, said Liu Liancheng, president of the balloon committee of
China Aeroaviation Association.
</P>
<P>
The joint team, comprised of two Chinese and nine South Korean
balloonists, will set off from Rongcheng, China's nearest city to
South Korea, and fly four hot air balloons toward the west sea
coast of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to take eight or nine hours to fly about 610
kilometers before landing.
</P>
<P>
Among the South Korean balloonists are Lim Jin-Chool, a
58-year-old member of South Korea's national assembly, and Hwang
Yong-Jo, the marathon gold medalist in the Barcelona Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Both of them have only received brief training about flying
balloon and they anticipated much challenge in this expedition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited as well as frightened at the thought of flying
over the billowing blue sea over such a long time," said Lim.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for me to fly balloon, at first I even
wanted to quit, but finally I made up my mind to face the
challenge,' she added.
</P>
<P>
Huang, now a sports postgraduate, only received the
balloon-flying certificate shortly before. "This expedition will
be a challenge for me and I take it in order to give some
incentive to my compatriots which are being beset by economic
crisis," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Denies Raising Proposals on Summit With U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
PYONGYANG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Friday denied that it proposed a summit
with the United States last year, according to the Korean Central
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK Foreign ministry spokesman said that the DPRK never
planned to hold a summit with the U.S. because of Washington's
hostile attitude.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to a report published by
Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper on January 22 that the DPRK
proposed a summit with U.S. in Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
The Sankei Shimbun suggested that the proposal, presented to
the U.S. unofficially by the DPRK's U.S. experts during a seminar
at the American National Defense University in Washington last
spring, was rejected by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This is "groundless" and "totally fabricated," said the
spokesman, stressing that no experts from the DPRK ever attended
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The report, no matter reflecting the view of the newspaper
itself or instigated by some sources, is undoubtedly part of the
U.S.-Japanese scheme to tarnish DPRK's image, the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Gov't Decides to Cut Officials' Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 29 (Xinhua) -- In response to teachers'
strike for salary rises, the Cambodia government announced Friday
that government officials' salaries will be cut by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made at Friday's cabinet meeting, said that the
salaries of those at undersecretaries of state level and above,
including the prime minister, would be reduced by 70 percent
beginning from next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the weekly cabinet meeting also suggested the
National Assembly cut down parliamentarians' salaries by the same
level of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The effort was to ease teachers' grouses for the huge gap
between the salaries of ministers and parliamentarians
(1,000-2,000 U.S. dollars per month) and those of teachers and
civil servants (only 15-20 dollars per month).
</P>
<P>
Under the decision, about 210 officials were expected to get
their salaries cut. It would reduce the government's expenses by
about 3500 million riel (about 920,000 U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
There are 82 members of the government and 132 undersecretaries
of state, while the parliamentarians are 122.

<HEADLINE> MII's Buy-Domestic Directive not Compulsory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The buy-domestic directive put
forward by the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) is not
compulsory, and performance/price ratio remains the overriding
principle in China's telecommunications sector, said an official w
ith MII here today.
</P>
<P>
This clarification came in response to the false impression
abroad that MII had required service providers to buy only
Chinese made telecom equipment.
</P>
<P>
Xie Linzhen, deputy director of the Administration Department
of Electronics Information Products and Equipment of MII, told
Xinhua during an exclusive interview that the Chinese government
encourages the development of national telecom equipment as any
other government does, and the procurement policy tallies with
international practice, and it is not compulsory to buy
domestically made equipment. Rather, the procurement should be
done according to the principle of performance/price ratio.
</P>
<P>
"Some overseas media and other organizations have been
over-sensitive about this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the 1999 China Information and Communications
Technology and Business Seminar, which was held on Jan 21-22 in
Honolulu in the United States, attracted many business executives
interested in China's telecom market.
</P>
<P>
However, the responses of those attending the seminar
demonstrates that China has not successfully made clear its
telecom policies, and there is indeed a need to have regular
opportunities to do so, said Xie, adding that the Hawaii seminar
was very successful.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by Associates &AMP; Wu, an
international market research and consulting firm, and Pacific
Trading Ventures of the United States, an international trading
company active in the Asian market assisting US-based companies
in exporting technology and developing business strategies in
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Third-Party Mediation on Kashmir Welcomed: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Friday expressed welcome to third-party mediation for
the settlement of the issues of Kashmir and Siachen between his
country and India.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media during his first visit to the Siachen
glacier, an active war front against India, Sharif described
Kashmir and Siachen as two main causes of tension between the two
South Asian nations, according to the News Network International.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has always been in favor of a negotiated settlement of
the disputes and welcomed third-party mediation in this regard,
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"Third-party mediation to resolve these problems would be
welcomed because without this the disputes with India could never
be resolved," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that the Kashmir issue must be
resolved "under the U.N. resolutions and in accordance with wishes
of the Kashmiri people."
</P>
<P>
"Without its solution, permanent peace in the region could
never be ensured," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said nuclear tests by the two rivals in 1998 had
given the world "a sense of awareness" about the Kashmir dispute,
adding that he wished 1999 would be the year of Kashmir
resolution.

DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Dhaka International
Leather Fair 1999 ended here Friday after business worth some 7.4
million U.S. dollars was transacted from spot orders in addition
to orders worth 10 million dollars expected within the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people visited the fair, which also attracted
more than 300 buyers, importers and agents from 19 countries and
regions, such as India, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, the United
States and Argentina, according to M.A. Satter Bhuyan, chairman of
the Bangladesh Finished Leather and Leather Goods Exporters
Association (BFLLGEA).
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one participants, including 14 foreign companies, took
part in the fair, the first of its kind in Bangladesh, which was
jointly organized by the Export Promotion Bureau and BFLLGEA.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh started exporting leather goods in 1990. The total
earnings from exports of leather and leather goods stood at 237.91
million dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year, accounting for 6.5
percent of the country's total export earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists will be able
to withdraw Chinese yuan in cash from local ATMs linked with VISA
during the World Horticultural Fair in Kunming, capital of south
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China Kunming Branch has decided to
connect its 230 local ATMs with the VISA global network to
provide foreign cardholders with easy access to cash from the
machines rather than having to go to the bank, said a general
manager in charge of VISA International's Chinese operations at a
news conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said his company plans to set up a service center inside or
near the site of the international fair to provide its users
quick and thoughtful service.
</P>
<P>
The manager pointed out that the city only has three ATMs
currently with yuan cash service for foreign card holders, but
these are inadequate to meet the demands of the expected 10
million visitors during the fair which will be held in May.
</P>
<P>
The extended service connection will help boost tourism in
Kunming and increase foreign currency earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, VISA International has distributed 20 million VISA
Interlink cards and 11 million credit cards in China, generating
a total of 295 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange
earnings.

<HEADLINE> NATO Steps up Military Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO on Friday stepped up its
pressure of military intervention on Yugoslavia after the
six-nation Contact Group issued its warning in London.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that the western military alliance was considering sending
one of its top officials to accompany British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Saturday to Belgrade to deliver the warning of the
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The official could be the NATO chief, according to sources
here.
</P>
<P>
The official said that though the Belgrade authorities and
ethnic Albanians were given three weeks to reach an interim
accord for a political settlement in the Yugoslav province, NATO
would not remain in "hibernation" during this time.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance, said the official, would step
up studies of the various operation options including the
dispatching of NATO ground troops to Kosovo to implement the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
NATO would resort to the use of force if after three weeks no a
greement on the interim accord was reached or no sign of full
compliance was within sight with the demand of the Contact Group,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
What in need in Kosovo, according to the official, is a
guarantee for the implementation of the peace process due to
start on February 6 at Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, with the
participation of the government of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, the leaders of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the
international community represented by France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France, Germany and Italy have expressed willingness
to send ground troops as the peace implementation force while the
United States stressed that their troops would only go if there
is a cease-fire in place in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO earlier this month has sent the chairman of its Military
Committee and its supreme commander in Europe to Belgrade to warn
the conflicting parties in Kosovo of the consequence of breaking
their commitments to NATO and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Confers With Cote d'Ivoire PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, January 29 (Xinhua) --Relations between China and Cote
d'Ivoire have been proceeding in a smooth and steady way since
they set up diplomatic ties 16 years ago, the visiting Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This relationship has earned attention of leaders of the two
nations and enjoyed efforts by both governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is here on a three-day official visit, said this in
talks with Cote d'Ivoire Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan.
</P>
<P>
The people-to-people friendship is growing with cooperation
areas continuing to expand and results obvious, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire has rich natural resources and good investment
environment, while China's experiences in technology and
management are suitable for the needs in Cote d'Ivoire, Hu said,
adding there exist wide prospects and great potential for mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two nations are actively exploring ways to expand new ways
and areas of economic and trade cooperation in line with the
principle of equality and mutual benefit, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The government-to-government cooperation is advancing in a
steady way, he continued, the cooperation between bilateral
enterprises is also given a big impetus.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to encourage its strong
and well- managed firms to explore ways to run joint ventures or
cooperative firms in Cote d'Ivoire, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries will score even greater achievements, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cote d'Ivoire government and people, under
the leadership of President Henri Konan Bedie, has upheld the
tradition of safeguarding national stability and unity, actively
promoted its national economy and continued to score satisfactory
results.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government appreciated Cote d'Ivoire
government's adherence to the "one China" policy and its just
stance of not having any official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Cote d'Ivoire, as developing nations, share
identical or similar views on many major international issues, and
have supported, sympathized and cooperated with each other in
international affairs, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany's Dresdner Bank Involved in Nazi Gold Deal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Dresdner Bank, one of
Germany's major financial institutions, purchased 5.7 tons of
gold stolen by the Nazis from Holocaust victims during World War
II, said a research group of Dresden Technical University in its
report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank achieved a profit equivalent to 2.4 million Swiss
francs from the gold deals between September 1942 and April 1944,
said the report by the university's Hannah Arendt Institute for
Research on Totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The gold in question came mostly from the central banks of
countries occupied by Nazi Germany. A small portion, estimated at
between 274 kilograms and 324 kilograms, was taken directly from
concentration camp prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that Dresdner Bank knew the origin of the
gold it had bought, though its employees may not have had full
knowledge of it.
</P>
<P>
Survivors of the Holocaust and their relatives have been
accusing banks and insurance companies in Germany and other
European countries involved in the gold deal of enriching
themselves at the expense of the Nazis' victims and demanding for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1998, some 10,000 Nazi victims and heirs
filed a class action suit against Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank
in a United States federal court for 20 billion dollars in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
They accused the banks of having profited from forced
dispossessions, dealings in stolen gold and bank accounts of Jews
murdered by the Nazis or who emigrated from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Claimants say the banks acquired, traded and sold personal
property, gold jewelry, coins and gold from tooth fillings taken
from concentration camp prisoners and other victims of Nazi
persecution.
</P>
<P>
Most of the gold was melted down into bars and sold by the
Nazi regime with help from the banks between 1933 and 1945.

<HEADLINE> BMW Reports Profits Drop for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- German automobile manufacturer
BMW Friday reported a drop in profits for 1998, blaming it on
losses suffered by its British subsidiary Rover.
</P>
<P>
The company said the reduced profit came despite a five
percent increase in turnover to a record 37.33 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
BMW said the group's overall car sales, including the Rover,
Land Rover, Mini and MG Marques, dropped 0.8 percent to 1.19
million vehicles in 1998, compared to the year before.
</P>
<P>
The fall was largely blamed on a 6.4 percent decline in Rover
sales. Total sales of BMW models were up 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A BMW AG spokesman in Munich said modernizing Rover production
accounted for the bulk of losses in Britain. "We have identified
the problem and already taken the losses into account," he said,
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said sales were expected to pick up in 1999 when
a number of new models come on stream. BMW hopes the new Rover 75
model due out later this year will help reverse Rover's
fortunes.

<HEADLINE> German Engineering Workers Strike for Pay Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of German engineering
workers downed tools Friday in support of a pay rise of 6.5
percent, according to reports of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Workers of Germany's powerful engineering union, the IG
Metall, launched the strike in several federal states after a
round of wage negotiations broke up on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The employers have offered a pay hike of 2 percent, together
with a one-off payment of 0.5 percent of annual wages linked to
the profits of individual employers.
</P>
<P>
At the Ford car plant in Saarlouis, central Germany, the
entire night shift of 1,700 workers stopped for a time. Similar
token strikes are planned at factories up and down Germany from
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Peters, deputy chairman of the IG Metall, one of the
world's largest worker's unions with 2.7 million members, urged
engineering employers to head off an all-out strike by continuing
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
He said the employers were provoking workers with their
"ridiculous" offer.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall has given the employers a deadline of February 11 to
reach agreement with representatives of workers, or will face
more widespread strikes.
</P>
<P>
In the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the city state of
Bremen, the union called on 100,000 workers to down tools in p
rotest and attend rallies. Staff were urged to leave work.

<HEADLINE> HK Court Ruling in Favor of Mainland-Born Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Court of Final
Appeal handed down a judgment here Friday, declaring that 81
mainland-born children who faced orders to be sent back can
become Hong Kong permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
Each of these 81 appellants was born in the mainland, with a
father who is a Hong Kong permanent resident. Some came to Hong
Kong with valid travel documents but overstayed; others were
brought here as unauthorized entrants.
</P>
<P>
These children all faced orders made by the director of i
mmigration for their removal to the mainland, as the director
contends according to the Immigration Ordinance 1997 that no
parent of any child had become a Hong Kong permanent resident
until after that child's birth.
</P>
<P>
However, each of the appellants resists such removal by
asserting the right of abode whether the parent became a Hong
Kong permanent resident before or after the child's birth.
</P>
<P>
The case was brought to the Court of Final Appeal after two
previous rulings. The one on January 26, 1998, was made in the
appellants' favor, but the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment
on May 20, 1998, and replied in the director of immigration's
favor.
</P>
<P>
In the Court of Final Appeal, Justice Kemal Bokhary quoted
relevant articles of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative region (SAR) and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
He explained Article 24 of the Basic Law, which lays down six
categories of permanent residents, including persons of Chinese
nationality born outside Hong Kong of those that are Chinese
citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a
continuous period of not less than seven years.
</P>
<P>
Justice Bokhary finally judged that each appellant can become
a Hong Kong permanent resident under Article 24 of the Basic Law
by virtue of a parent's Hong Kong permanent resident status
whether such status was acquired before or after the appellant's
birth.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that the words "if the parent had the right
of abode at the time of the birth of the person" in Immigration
Ordinance 1997 contravene Article 24 of the Basic Law and are
therefore unconstitutional and null and void.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Friday announced a
number of activities to celebrate the coming of the new millennium
with its climax in countdown parties on the eve expected to be
participated by more than 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"A vibrant and exciting line-up of the best that the nation has
to offer in entertainment, culture, music, arts, exhibitions and
lighting spectaculars will accompany Singaporeans and visitors to
toast to a new 1,000 years," Executive Director of the National
Arts Council Choo Thian Siew told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Working with over 20 agencies, including private
organizations, the Ministry of Information and the Arts is
coordinating the nationwide millennium celebration activities to
make this once-in-a-thousand years event the Celebrations of a
Lifetime," he added.
</P>
<P>
The projected activities fall into four categories, namely, fun
salutations, leaving a legacy, setting the mood, building the
momentum and sharing the memories.
</P>
<P>
Under the fun salutation headline, there will be five thematic
millennium countdown parties, entitled Parties for Everyone, on
December 31, 1999, the biggest parties for Singapore ever to be
attended by an expected crowd of more than 500,000. In conjunction
with this event, a specially-designed millennial countdown clock
by Swatch, a Swiss watch maker, will be launched in June.
</P>
<P>
The National Heritage Board will erect a national sculpture to
capture the cultural spirit of Singapore and a time capsule
containing artifacts reflecting significant milestones in
Singapore's past 100 years will be officially sealed on December
31, 1999, and will not be opened until 2050.
</P>
<P>
In addition to stamps and coins for millennium keepsake, the
Board of Commissioners of Currency will also issue a new series of
currency notes that will feature the country's first President
Yusof bin Ishak.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to set the mood, the millennium celebrations will kick
off with the unveiling of the Singapore Millennium logo and
website in March followed by the first Singapore Antarctica
Expedition, the Millennium Space Exploration Exhibition, the Asian
premiere of Saltimbanco and Wheelathon 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the celebrations spanning over 18 months, there will be
several pivotal events to stir interests and create new
excitement, including the Singapore Arts Festival 1999, National
Day Parade, Singapore Youth Science Festival, Food Festival and
Writers' Festival.

<HEADLINE> From Serfs To Masters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Only the broad mass of Tibetans
know the significance of the democratic reforms launched in the
Tibet Autonomous Region in 1959, which turned them from serfs, or
animals that could speak, into masters of their own destiny, of
their society.
</P>
<P>
"My experience before 1959 was nightmarish," said Raidi,
chairman of the regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Born into a poor herdsman's family in northern Tibet, Raidi
worked as a servant to herd owners, tribal chiefs, and living
Buddhas since he was six. He later fled from oppressive masters
and wandered around, begging for a living.
</P>
<P>
"The scars over my body are reminders of the unspeakably
miserable past," said the 61-year old chairman.
</P>
<P>
Basang, deputy secretary of the regional Communist Party
committee, said she is still plagued by her aching back, left by
kicks from the serf owners.
</P>
<P>
"Every former serf has wretched stories to tell of his or her
past," said regional government chairman Lhaque. "The old Tibet
might be the place where human rights were most wantonly
violated."
</P>
<P>
Democratic reform eradicated serfdom, and the liberated serfs
elected their first People's Congress in 1965. Since then, the
Tibetan people have participated in political, economic and
social affairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, over 1.2 million people in Tibet voted for more than
7,000 deputies to the People's Congress at county and city
levels, a turnout of above 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Puncog has kept all his voter registration cards, and though
he has difficulty walking long distances due to leg injuries left
by the serf-owners whips, he insisted on coming to the polling
place to cast his vote.
</P>
<P>
"Voting makes me feel I am really the master," the old farmer
said.
</P>
<P>
People airing their views and complaints by letters or visits,
and overseeing government work are other ways of practicing
democracy in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 20 Lhasa residents wrote a joint letter
complaining about urban pollution. The city environmental
protection department then demanded that polluting factories take
drastic measures to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has 48 lawyers, and 20 are native Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1980, the central government has exempted Tibetan
people from taxation, has allocated land to every household, and
has stipulated that farmers can keep and raise their own
livestock.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, per capital income reached 5,000 yuan (about 400 U.S.
dollars) for urban residents in Tibet, and 1,040 yuan among the
rural population, with total private savings amounting to three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some Tibetan people now own trucks and tractors, and
television and telephones have become almost commonplace.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Eight-Point Proposition on Reunification Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's non-communist parties
and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a
forum here today to mark the fourth anniversary of Jiang Zemin's
speech on reunification and the 20th anniversary of the publicati
on of the Message to Taiwan Compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Luo Haocai, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who is also chairman of the Central Committee of China Zhi
gong Party, said the Message to Taiwan Compatriots issued by the
National People's Congress Standing Committee on New Year's Day
in 1979 had a significant and far-reaching impact on China's
reunification process.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposition on the Taiwan question
fully reflects the sincerity and determination of the Communist
Party of China and the Chinese government to develop
cross-straits relations and promote reunification, he said,
noting that it has become a guiding document for solving the
Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic
Self-Government League, said cross-straits relations have
undergone great changes over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
As a party composed of Taiwan compatriots living on the
Chinese mainland and one that participates in state and
governmental affairs, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
League has been actively implementing the principle of "peaceful
reunification, and one country, two systems" and Jiang Zemin's
eight-point proposition, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The party has greatly increased exchanges with people from all
walks of life in Taiwan, and has boosted the development of
cross-straits relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Ganliu, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said his party
has maintained extensive ties with Taiwan, and has done a great
deal for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his party will further boost economic, trade,
scientific and cultural exchange between both sides of the Taiwan
Straits, fight against separatism and safeguard the unity of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Joint Arab Efforts for Inter-Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf has called for joint Arab efforts to
improve relations among Arab countries, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Sahhaf as telling the Iraqi Satellite Channel on
Thursday evening that the policies of many Arab countries are
very different from those of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of participating in
the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq by allowing them to use
their bases and airspaces to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf also accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of preventing the
Arab countries from creating a situation conducive to
fence-mending process among them.
</P>
<P>
He said that objective and frank dialogues between Arab states
will serve their interests and strengthen cooperation for their
welfare.
</P>
<P>
He said the final communique issued by the Arab foreign
ministers meeting held last Sunday in Cairo is not surprising to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The communique fell short of Iraq's demand to condemn the
four-day U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq in mid-December and to
call for lifting the United Nations embargo on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi minister, the Arab masses "were angry
not only at the United States and Britain, but also at those
pro-U.S. and Britain Arab governments."

<HEADLINE>   Toronto Bidders Expose Olympic Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 18 IOC members appeared to have cashed in first-class
plane tickets that the bid group provided and found cheap ways to
get to Toronto, if they came at all, organizers said. Many angled
for gifts of "cash, jewelry or other items easily converted to
cash," they added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the organizers made public a 26-page report in
which they made those charges in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was submitted to the Swiss-based committee after Toronto
finished third behind Atlanta and Athens in a 1990 vote on the
1996 host city.
</P>
<P>
The IOC thanked them for the report but never got back to them
about it, the group said.
</P>
<P>
The report named no names and the organizers refused to do so
Thursday as they handed out copies in response to charges that
they granted questionable favors to at least a few IOC members or
their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1991 report, abuses "associated with IOC
member visits" may have cost the group "some 700,000 Canadian
dollars (455,000 U.S. dollars) to 800,000 Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto group spent four years and 16.8 million Canadian
dollars (10.92 million U.S. dollars), trying to get the Games.
The cost of travel, entertainment and promotional items came to
more than 5.5 million Canadian dollars (3.6 million U.S.
dollars), said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China Fights Corruption Among Judges, Procurators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's courts and
procuratorates have achieved "good results" in cleaning up
corruption among judges and procurators during a year-long
self-disciplinary campaign, according to the country's top
judicial and procuratorial officials.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, and Han
Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
both reported to today's meeting of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, the country's highest legislature.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,221 unqualified court employees were fired, and a
group of judges who had violated the law were investigated and
punished, Xiao Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the highest-ranking official was Pan Yile,
vice-president of the Higher People's Court of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, who has been sentenced to 12 years
imprisonment on a charge of bribery involving 250,000 yuan
(31,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates across the country investigated 1,557
procurators and other employees last year, and gave 1,215 of them
Party and administrative punishment, and another 113 were brought
up on criminal charges, said Han Zhubin.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 436 courts were rectified and nearly 2,000
procurators and anti-corruption bureau chiefs were appointed.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court ordered local courts to stress
investigations of unjust activities, and accept open supervision,
Xiao Yang said. Similar measures were also taken by the
procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
However, the two officials admitted that China's courts and
procuratorates still have a long way to go to abolish graft.
</P>
<P>
The courts will fully implement the system of public trials
and improve the people's jury system in the future, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorates plan to educate and train all employees
before the year 2001, Han said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Educational Syllabus to Be Unified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen international
agencies working on the education system of Somalia have declared
the unification of their educational syllabus despite the
continuing political disintegration affecting many regions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at Hotel Shamow of south Mogadishu Wednesday,
these agencies who mainly get their assistance from the rich
Moslem countries and some western aid agencies said they had
unified their examination boards, the supervision and the training
of the teachers in their institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman of the newly established teaching
consortium, Ahmed Abdullahi Sheik Mohamed, the unification was
prompted by what he called difficulties met by their 21,500
students countrywide over the non-concurrent educational system of
their institutions.
</P>
<P>
Some of them chose the Gulf countries syllabus, while others
had worked on the Egyptian system, and still others took the foot
steps of the neighboring countries like Kenya and yet some more
had remained with the former system of Somalia, all confusing the
students whose parents are forced to change their places of
living, owing to the special circumstances of the country.
</P>
<P>
The new consortium which is called "Somalia's Private Teaching
Federation", was established by committees from the 14 education
agencies who worked on the issue for more than three months.
</P>
<P>
The consortium has elected a seven-member executive committee.
The consortium said that the doors are open for any other
educational organization that shows up in the future provided that
it should have at least three classes who were taught three years
time, the organization should also have an academic year not
shorter than 10 months and that it should teach at least four
hours per day with all the educational subjects being undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said that their consortium will in turn deal with the
achievement of obtaining an international recognition for their
certificates and diplomas, a goal never dreamed of by any of the
agencies that worked in Somalia since the civil war began in the
country in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The consortium which covers 14 international educational
agencies which include Irish Concern, Africa Moslems agency and
Al-Islah charity have 542 teachers from all sexes all together
and 253 other employees nationwide.

<HEADLINE> HK Official: No Sudden Influx of Mainland-Born Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Secretary for
Security Regina Ip said here Friday that there was no question of
a sudden influx of mainland-born children in the wake of a Court
of Final Appeal (CFA) judgment.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at a press conference held after the CFA
delivered a judgment Friday declaring that 81 mainland-born
children, each with a parent of Hong Kong permanent resident,
have the right of abode in Hong Kong. Accordingly, the children
will not be sent back to the mainland by Hong Kong's Immigration
Department.
</P>
<P>
Ip said the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government
welcomed the judgment, which reaffirmed that it was necessary to
have a system to verify the identity of the claimants of the
right of abode in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that it would be extremely unwise for
those claimants of the right of abode to cross the border by
clandestine means.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's disciplinary forces and their mainland
counterparts are well-coordinated and a series of preventive
measures have been put in place to guard against illegal entry
into Hong Kong, said Ip.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,950 right of abode claimants on recognizance in Hong
Kong, the government's assessment is that, pending verification,
a very considerable number will be able to stay, she added.

<HEADLINE> Sharon: Israel Ready to Reopen Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua)-- Israel is ready to reopen
peace talks with Syria, mainly on the issue of the Golan Hights,
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the European Union's peace-maker Miguel
Moratinos, Sharon said he has asked Moratinos to convey the
Israeli stand to the Syrians and asked the Syrian side to enter
into peace talks with Israel without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Sharon did not say how Israel will conduct the talks with
Syria and whether the current Israeli government has changed its
policy of restarting peace talks with Syria from the very
beginning instead of from where had been suspended by the former
Israeli Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 war and
the Labor government conducted talks with the Syrians before
1996, but did not find a final solution to this issue.
</P>
<P>
The European Union wanted to help Israel and Syria to enter
into direct talks to solve this problem, but no progress was made
so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said on many occasions in the past that it
wants to reopen talks with Syria, but in fact it does not
want to return the Golen Heights back to the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed the Golan
Law, requiring a majority of 61 members of the 120-seat Knesset
to pass any Knesset decision to give up land considered part of
Israeli territory, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Law also requires the drafting after the May election
of a new basic law, to be called the basic law on popular
referendum, by which any decision to give land will also be
approved by a majority vote in a referendum, in addition to the
required Knesset majority.

<HEADLINE> Forum Marks 100th Anniversary of Qu Qiubai's Birth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A forum marking the 100th
anniversary of the birth of Qu Qiubai, one of the major leaders
during the early days of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was
held here today by the CPC Central Committee in the Great Hall of
the People.
</P>
<P>
 Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee's Political Bureau, said in his address to the
forum that Qu was an important CPC leader, a great Marxist, an
outstanding proletarian revolutionary, theorist and publicist, as
well as a major contributor to literature in the cause of China's
revolution.
</P>
<P>
 Wei, also a member of the CPC Central Committee's
Secretariat, added that Qu made important contributions to
publicizing Marxism in China and the formation of the Mao Zedong
Thought. He called on the present to learn from Qu's
revolutionary spirit to make greater contribution to the country.
</P>
<P>
 Under the persecution of Wang Ming, one of the CPC's early
leaders, Qu was dismissed from his important posts in the CPC
Central Committee. But he soon took an active part in the
struggles launched by the left-wing cultural front, together with
Lu Xun, in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
 On June 18, 1935, Qu Qiubai was executed by Kuomintang
reactionaries in Changding County in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
 Li Tieying, a member of the CPC Central Committee's
Political Bureau, presided over today's forum, which was attended
by more than 300 people from all walks of life.

"However, nothing can be achieved if the stability in Tanzania
is not maintained like what have happened in other countries in
Africa which got bogged down in turmoil," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that Tanzania cherishes the brotherly bilateral
relations with China and hopes to boost cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that with traditional bilateral friendly relations,
China and Tanzania have cooperated well in all the fields and
explored the reform in political system and economic structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that as an evolutionary process, democracy does not
have a fixed style. A country can achieve the social stability,
economic development and improvement of people's living only when
it practiced a political system suitable to its conditions.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who is visiting the Tanzanian parliament here, said that
China admires Tanzania's choice of the multi-party system and
maintenance of social stability in the transform period that have
led to the economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival in Dodoma from a two-day visit to Uganda, Xu
has met with the Speaker of the Tanzanian Parliament, Pius Msekwa,
opposition leaders and leaders of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM) party.
</P>
<P>
They discussed in detail on the NPC system, the function of the
 political parties in the state affairs under the leadership of
the ruling Communist Party of China, expressing the desire to
further exchange views and visits.

Xu and his 12-member delegation are expected to depart for
Harare, Zimbabwe Saturday to continue their five-nation trip in

<HEADLINE> Israel Eager to Maintain Close Ties With Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel views its relationship
with Jordan as a matter of "supreme importance."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the prime minister telephoned Jordan's new
Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Talal, the eldest son of King Hussein,
and congratulated him on his appointment by the king as the heir
to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he will continue the policy of peace and good
relationship with Israel taken by his father, who is receiving
treatment in the United States for possibly a relapse of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, Jordan has played
an important role both in the Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking and
in the efforts to bring about stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few days, Israel has been watching closely the
situation in Amman as Jordan grappled with two simultaneous
shocks.
</P>
<P>
The first was the appointment of Abdullah in place of Hassan,
the king's brother who has served as the crown prince for 35
years. And the second was the rehospitalization in the U.S. of the
king just one week after he returned from six months of cancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held a two-hour meeting Thursday night with
security and intelligence personnel to discuss the recent
development in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that our peace relations with Jordan are part
of the strategic component of Israel's national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of congratulation to Abdullah Thursday, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon expressed his hope that Israel's good
relations with Amman will continue.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Sharon have said that all Israelis are
praying for the recovery of King Hussein, who reports said was
"feeling better" Thursday after spending his first night back at
the U.S. clinic.
</P>
<P>
While there is an uneasy mood in Israel over whether the young
crown prince can conduct a smooth succession and preserve the
stability, some analysts have sounded an upbeat note.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz quoted senior sources in the defense
establishment as saying that information they obtained has
indicated that Abdullah is well-equipped to take the throne and
the crown prince's internal standing in Jordan is strong.
</P>
<P>
Although having little political experience, the 36-year-old
crown prince is strongly backed by the army, in which he serves as
the chief of special forces, they said.
</P>
<P>
Another daily, the Jerusalem Post, quoted Jordanian analysts
Friday as saying that Abdullah will certainly get assistance from
elderly statesmen who have worked with his father.
</P>
<P>
But the report forecast that while Abdullah can be expected
to continue the strategy of peace with Israel, he may slow down
the pace of the ties.
</P>
<P>
"Crown Prince Abdullah knows the importance of Israel at the
regional level and will continue the good relations," the report
quoted an analyst as saying, adding that he might be more cautious
in the short and medium term.
</P>
<P>
"The key now for Jordan is to maintain good relations with all
the regional powers. Jordan cannot be seen as close to a single
regional power at the expense of others," the unidentified analyst
said.

BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A sand storm that swept
through north China early this week exacerbated the air pollution
in major cities of the area, according to the weekly report
issued by the China Environment Monitoring Center today.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the heavier pollution to the large volume of
suspended particles brought about by the sand storm.
</P>
<P>
The pollution indexes for ten cities, including Beijing,
Tianjin, Lanzhou and Jinan, were reported at over 300, with air
quality ranked V, the highest and most serious category of

BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi
told the nation's trade officials here on Friday that they should
make greater efforts to boost China's foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said in
a speech at the national conference on foreign trade and economic
cooperation, which wrapped up on Friday, that they should raise
their spirits and progress through the difficulties ahead.
</P>
<P>
"We should fully implement the decisions made at the Central
Economic Conference and properly handle the relationship between
enlarging domestic demand and expanding foreign trade and
economic cooperation," she said. "We should always consider
domestic demand and foreign trade and economic cooperation
together, and fully utilize international and domestic markets
and resources to serve China's modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
She urged the officials to take the overall national economic
situation into consideration and make the utmost efforts to
expand exports by every possible means, and to make active and
effective use of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade and economic cooperation encountered
unprecedented difficulties last year, she pointed out, as the
Asian financial crisis unexpectedly deepened and the nation was
hit hard by severe flooding last summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- An economic official in Macao
said here on Friday that the government has intensified efforts
to combat laser compact disc piracy and the production of fake
textiles.
</P>
<P>
Rosa Silva Chan, director of Macao Economic Department, called
on local manufacturers and residents to make concerted efforts to
safeguard Macao's image in trade with other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, textiles account for about
80 percent of Macao's exported goods, and 40 percent of textiles
go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In January of 1998, the United States government rebuked Macao
for CD piracy. And in June, Macao was written into a list of
trade sanction for infringing intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Makes Initial Debt Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) of the Philippines Friday permitted Philippine
Airlines (PAL) to pay 37.9 million U.S. dollars to its creditors
to ensure its continued operations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first payment PAL has made since June 19, 1998,
when it filed for receivership with the SEC, which extended PAL
protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
PAL's operational revenues and improving cash flow position
would enable it to make its initial payment, said Jaime J.
Bautista, PAL executive vice president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
"This will clear the way for us to prepare a new rehabilitation
plan for submission to the SEC on or about March 15," said
Bautista.
</P>
<P>
He said the senior management of the flag carrier will now sit
down with its advisers and creditors to draw up a new plan that
will take into account the creditors' requirements.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the SEC, PAL's Interim Rehabilitation committee
warned that, without an interim payment, some creditors may take
legal action to seize PAL aircraft in other countries.
</P>
<P>
As of June 23, 1998, PAL had a total debt of 2.24 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Academy of Sciences to Attract More Young Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) hopes to attract more young scientists to
participate in a project to widen the scope of science this year,
President of the CAS Lu Yongxiang said today.
</P>
<P>
"Recruiting young talented scientific staff is the key to the
success of this project," Lu told an annual working conference of
the CAS, which closed in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CAS is in need of both young researchers for
scientific development and young managers for high-tech
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that better jobs and working environments
should be provided for young scientists, especially in those
institutes where the research staff are becoming older.
</P>
<P>
The CAS plans to push forward several policies which are aimed
at attracting more young scientific staff, and is going to invite
hundreds of outstanding and superior middle-aged and young
scientists from at home and abroad to work in the academy this
year.
</P>
<P>
The academy has already seen its measures in providing more
opportunities for young scientific staff pay off during the past
year. Statistics show that scientific workers who are under 45
years old made up 60 percent of the total staff, while the number
of research professors who are under 45 years old increased by
five percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thirty outstanding young scientists were presented with awards
by the CAS at the closing ceremony of the working conference in
Beijing today.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed firmer Friday, but off a new all-time trading high on
technical selling as institutions squared books before the month
ended, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index surpassed the January 7
record closing high of 2897.3 in the morning session, buoyed by
Wall Street's 81-point gain overnight, before racing to a new
trading high of 2911.5 in the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the index was up 16.6 points, or 0.58 percent, at
2893.8, representing a gain of 2.33 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
The banks also contributed to the buoyant market, with both
National Australia Bank (NAB), which on Wednesday posted a robust
first quarter profit, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)
closing at new record highs after renewed interest rate cut
speculation.
</P>
<P>
NAB gained 10.9 cents to 26.689 Australian dollars, CBA gained
37.2 cents to 23.922 Australian dollars while Westpac bank rose
four cents to 11.00 Australian dollars and ANZ bank added 1.7
cents to 10.467 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index closed up 37.5 points at 5250.3 and
the all resources index closed down 2.5 points at 953.1.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 563.9 million shares valued at 1.394
billion U.S. dollars, with 740 rises outnumbering 548 falls and
420 steady.
</P>
<P>
Diversified miner BHP continued to drag down the resources
sector, losing 26.9 cents, or 2.25 percent, to 11.681 Australian
dollars after credit rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's Thursday
lowered its credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
This is likely to result in the company paying more on its
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto dropped 9.6 cents to 19.694 Australian dollars.

The gold index closed 13.4 points, or 1.27 percent, higher at

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar crept
higher Friday, supported by an uptick in a leading commodity index
and a late rally in gold overnight.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, treasury manager of Australia's Colonial State
Bank, said the Australian currency had recovered nearly half a
U.S. cent from its overnight low of 62.34 U.S. cents and ended the
day a touch stronger than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading in Sydney the Australian unit was at
62.82 U.S. cents from 62.73 U.S. cents Thursday, after spending
the day between 62.67 U.S. cents and 62.94 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index finished in New York
at 189.32, up 1.83 points.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 17 U.S. futures markets and although not
weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an indicator
for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Also in New York, COMEX gold for current delivery closed at
284.8 U.S. per ounce, up 0.14 U.S. dollars from Thursday's COMEX
close.
</P>
<P>
The two results prompted buying of the Australian dollar back
up to 62.60 U.S. cents and it had gradually edged higher during
the day, Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished trading at 0.5496 euro from
0.5479 euro, and was buying 72.80 Japanese yen from 72.52 yen.

<HEADLINE> China's Law Makers Examine Proposed Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's
highest legislative body, have unanimously agreed on the proposal
to make amendments to parts of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
After examining the motion on amending parts of the
Constitution submitted to the legislature this morning by the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), law
makers have reached the consensus that the NPC Standing Committee
should immediately work on the draft amendment so that it can be
deliberated at the coming NPC plenary session scheduled to
convene in early March.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng attended the panel
session this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mingshi, Yu Zhengwu and other members said it is "very
timely and appropriate" to write the guidelines of the 15th CPC
National Congress into the Constitution, "so as to translate the
Party's viewpoints into the will of the state as well as the
people."
</P>
<P>
Yu Yunyao and Tong Fu said that to include policies governing
China's opening up and reform in the last twenty years in the
Constitution "reflects China's commitment to further reforms and
open-up which is the aspiration of the whole people."
</P>
<P>
The law makers said they support the principles for the Co
nstitutional amendment which dictates that it is only necessary
to make changes to those parts that definitely need amending and
leave the rest alone.
</P>
<P>
They said the CPC Central Committee attaches great importance
to the issue and has widely solicited opinions from various
departments before making the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Following legal procedures for making changes to the
Constitution, the NPC Standing Committee will draw up a bill to
be submitted to the NPC for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The first Constitution of the People's Republic of China was
promulgated in 1954 and since then it has undergone three major
amendments, with the last one being made in 1982.

yuan in outstanding housing loans by the end of 1998, a jump of
117 percent from the previous year, according to the Shanghai
branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show a total of 10.4 billion yuan in new housing
loans last year. The increase shows increased awareness among
Shanghai residents of house ownership, analysts say, and predict
that financial institutions will compete more this year for a
share of the expanding housing loan market.
</P>
<P>
Current housing loan providers include the China Construction
Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the
Pudong Development Bank, the Shanghai Bank, the Everbright Bank o
f China, Huaxia Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, and the
Minsheng Banking Corp.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislator on Method of Electing Macao SAR Deputies to Ninth NPC (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao said Macao's deputies to the NPC should become members of
the electoral council, to ensure a smoothly run operation.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao's NPC deputies cannot become members of the
electoral council or join the Selection Committee if they run for
the Macao SAR's chief executive, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned method prescribed in the draft is only
applicable to the election of the Macao SAR's deputies to the
Ninth NPC, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the election procedure, Qiao cited the draft
which stipulates that the NPC Standing Committee will be
responsible for convening the first meeting of the electoral
council to elect a nine-member presidium that will be responsible
for chairing the electoral council.
</P>
<P>
The electoral council will then draw up a specific method for
the election, and each candidate can be recommended by at least
ten members of the electoral council, he said.
</P>
<P>
The election of the Macao SAR's deputies to the Ninth NPC will
be conducted by means of a secret ballot, and the number of the
candidates will be 20 to 50 percent more than the number of the
NPC deputies to be elected.
</P>
<P>
The presidium will announce the result of the election, and
report those elected to the qualifying monitoring committee of
the NPC Standing Committee for confirmation, Qiao said, adding
that the opinions of Macao's NPC deputies and members of the
CPPCC National Committee have been sought when the draft was
drawn up.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- An electoral council
responsible for electing Macao deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) will be established in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) after its return to China on December
20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee will preside over the election of
Macao SAR's 12 deputies to the Ninth NPC, according to a draft of
the method for electing the Macao SAR's deputies to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
At the Seventh meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee
that opened here today, the meeting of chairman and vice-chairman
of the NPC Standing Committee submitted the draft for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the document, Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy director of the
Commission of Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee,
said the election method takes into consideration the relevant
rule on the proportion of NPC deputies in ratio to population, as
well as the need of the Macao SAR to form its own delegation.
</P>
<P>
Macao's five NPC deputies elected by the Guangdong Provincial
People's Congress will become SAR's deputies to the Ninth NPC
after the establishment of the Macao SAR, and the Macao SAR will
then elect seven NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said Macao will have a broad representative Selection
Committee for the first government of the Macao SAR, so it is
appropriate to form the electoral council from the Chinese
citizens in the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Macao members of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
and members in the Macao's Legislative Council are also eligible
to join the electoral council, he said, but these Macao residents
must be Chinese citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese
economy should start to rise from the lowest point by the middle
of this year, although it will take some time for the economy to
fully recover, Japan's Vice-Minister of Finance said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum (WEF),
Eisuke Sakakibara said that the impact of Asia's financial crisis
last year, seen particularly sharply on global financial markets
in Autumn 1998," subsided after interest-rate reductions by the Fe
deral Reserve and others, and market have become somewhat
optimistic."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the 'financial panic' surrounding the state of
Japan's economy, which began to set in late 1997, is about to be
over."
</P>
<P>
However, Sakakibara added, "the complacency of the market is,
I think, unwarranted, because the basic causes of the market
crisis haven't been eliminated."

<HEADLINE> ADB Mission to Visit Pak to Firm Up Lending for 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) will visit Pakistan next month to firm up
lending of 800 million U.S. dollars for different projects during
the 1998-99 fiscal year (July 1-June 30).
</P>
<P>
Final approval of the loan would be given by the ADB board
after extensive meetings of the ADB area-specific mission with
government officials in different phases, the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mission, scheduled to stay in Pakistan for two weeks, will
hold detailed meetings with the Pakistani government on the
overall package of 800 million dollars for projects including
export, trade and industry, power sector and irrigation, APP said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will receive the second tranche worth 125 million
dollars of the on-going 250 million dollar lending program for
capital market reforms before the current fiscal year ending on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
Director of ADB's Programs Department Van Der Linden has
indicated that ADB will provide an 800 million dollar loan for
Pakistan, saying that half of the amount could be made available
shortly.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have
resumed their financial assistance to Pakistan. ADB is believed to
be on fast track regarding the release of funds for the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club meeting is also in process to consider the
restructuring of 2.3 billion dollar loan for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
By November 30 last year, ADB assistance to Pakistan had
totaled 487 million dollars, exceeding the target of 454 million
dollars for 1998.

<HEADLINE> CEOs Worldwide Optimistic About Economic Future in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of
the 800 chief executive officers (CEOs) questioned in a global
survey published here Friday said they are optimistic about the
future in Asia.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of them are optimistic about the growth
of their companies during the next three years, according to the
Second Annual Global CEO Survey conducted by consultancy Price
Waterhouse Coopers.
</P>
<P>
The survey was commissioned by the World Economic Forum (WEF)
annual meeting at the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, half of the respondents foresee threats to
their business from non-traditional competitors entering their
industries through electronic means, potentially "a 20-year-old
in a garage."
</P>
<P>
The survey found that CEOs are making more use of the
Internet. Thirty percent of the respondents rate their Internet
skills as good or excellent. Two thirds of them sign on for
purposes other than e-mail at least one day a month, and a fourth
more than 10 days per month, making use of the Internet to visit
competitors' sites as well.
</P>
<P>
Now that everyone has an abundance of knowledge, the survey
said, the major challenge is to convert it to intellectual
capital.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough area," said Price Waterhouse Coopers' CEO
James J. Schiro. "Successful managers need to find ways to create
information filters."
</P>
<P>
"Various vision and strategy setting mechanisms help, but this
is an individual challenge for every CEO," he added.

<HEADLINE> Boiler Explosion, Blame Attached to Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Investigations into the
recent boiler explosion in Yinchuan in which a worker died and
damage estimated at 350,000 yuan was caused have found factory
leaders and department heads responsible for the accident and
accused them of negligence.
</P>
<P>
A report by the inquiry team shows that the Yinchuan office of
the Shizuishan Mining Administration, northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, attached a fake approved seal on the
boiler without notifying the local labor administration unit.
</P>
<P>
It also revealed that oil used in the boiler was the wrong
type, the design and installation of the fuel tank was unsafe and
the worker on the earlier shift was not qualified.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the worker had left the post without
permission, allowing large amounts of oil to overflow so that
when the boiler was re-lit it simply blew up, resulting in a fire
which devastated the building and killing outright the worker
then on duty.
</P>
<P>
When news of the explosion was broadcast on television that
night Chinese President Jiang Zemin immediately telephoned Sheng
Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, insisting that action should be taken as such
accidents are serious matters, especially when loss of life is
involved.
</P>
<P>
The official investigators have warned that the government
will deal sternly with this matter, and others like.

red-crested cranes flying freely in the skies under the watchful
gaze of their trainers who can control their movements by a simple
 whistle call.
</P>
<P>
The red-crested crane is the most-endangered bird under the
state protection, and only a little over 2,000 are left, most in
China.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 cranes have been tamed by experts in this
northeast area of Liaoning Province because they also believe it
may help halt their decline.
</P>
<P>
Usually the only examples most people ever see of these rare
birds is in zoos where they are kept in cages or have their wings
clipped by zoo-keepers afraid they might fly away.
</P>
<P>
The training program was set up three years ago by
ornithologist Zhang Ping with a team of colleagues from two local
zoos who admitted that it is not easy and takes time and patience.
</P>
<P>
"But we believe it is better that they fly free even in this
limited way because keeping them in cages or clipping their wings
has affected the mating process." she said
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that most people are reluctant to hurt them since
the red-crested crane is regarded as a symbol of peace, happiness
and nobility in China and people here have been breeding them for
more than 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Her special training method involved picking out three cranes
who were obvious leaders and letting the others follow their
example.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang explained that there are also risks in
allowing the cranes freedom to fly.
</P>
<P>
"There is always the danger they might hurtle into trees or
electric wires if the wind blows too hard, and at least six have
already died from such accidents. Now we seldom fly the birds in
windy weather." she added.
</P>
<P>
The training program has now been extended all over Dalian
and zoos from other parts of the nation have sent staff to the
city to learn the techniques.

<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) - The Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia meet again in London on Friday, expected to urge both
sides in the warring Yugoslav province of Kosovo to hold peace
talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Britain, the United States, France,
Germany, Italy and Russia might issue a statement demanding
autonomy for Kosovo and making clear their decision not to allow
the region to descend into full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said before the meeting th
at the West was prepared to underpin an agreement on self-rule
for Kosovo by deploying ground troops, but only if the warring
parties signed up to a political process.
</P>
<P>
"We are only going to commit ground troops if there is a
commitment to a political process. Nobody is going to commit
ground troops in the context of a continuing war and a crumbling
ceasefire," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrivied London
earlier for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are very intent on getting this thing done," Albright told
reporters on her arrival.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the six nations met last Friday in London
to discuss the situation in Kosovo but failed to reach any fixed
agreement.

BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Qinghua University in Beijing,
known as the country's version of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, had its information and computer infrastructure
network accepted by the state today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Export, Capital Influx Goals for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital announced
today that it will try to have exports worth 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars and overseas investment worth 2.2 billion U.S. dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
The target is lower than for last year because of the Asian
financial crisis whose impact is expected to worsen this year,
said Wu Yutian, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
This will pose greater challenges for Beijing's efforts to
increase exports and overseas investment this year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today show Beijing approving 650
overseas-funded ventures last year, involving contracts worth
nearly 4.1 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 144 percent from
the previous year. Overseas investment actually used in the year
amounted to 2.87 billion U.S. dollars, up 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now home to 151 of the top 500 multinationals and
overseas businesses have 7,500 representative offices or branches
here.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the city's export increased 14.7 percent to 2.83
billion U.S. dollars worth last year, and imports increased 11
percent to 3.68 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asian financial crisis caused exports to Asian
nations to decrease and slowed the influx of capital from those co
untries, there has been an increase in exports to Hong Kong,
Europe, and the U.S. and increased investment from those
countries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will work to carry out all policies
the central government has adopted to increase exports, he said,
adding that it is working on policies to increase imports this
year and get more multinationals to move their regional
headquarters here.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect of Japanese Tourist Caught in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A man suspected of robbing,
raping and murdering a female Japanese tourist in southwest
China's Sichuan Province was arrested only several hours after
the case was reported, local police announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang Daming, a farmer of Yujing Village on the outskirts of
Leshan City, was accused of coaxing the Japanese victim out to a
suburban scenic spot and then murdering her in a secluded place
on January 22.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations showed that Tang pounded his victim on
the head with a rock until she lost consciousness and then raped
her. He also robbed some 900 yuan (about 100 U.S. dollars) in
cash and items including a credit card from the victim's pocket
before running away, while the victim later died from the fatal
wounds.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the 22-year-old victim was from Kyoto, Japan
and was studying Chinese language in the People's University of
China in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
University authorities today confirmed the victim's identity
but firmly declined to give her name, claiming that her family
wished it kept secret.
</P>
<P>
The incident was first reported at around midday on January 22
and the suspect quickly apprehended at 4:30 p.m. with the help of
police officers from the provincial public security department,
according to a spokesman for the Leshan police force.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 kilometers to the southwest of the provincial capital
Chengdu, Leshan is renowned for a gigantic statue of Buddha
carved out of a mountain in the suburbs of the city.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the Japanese girl traveled to Leshan alone
and met Tang in the city on January 21, who then volunteered to
be her guide on a tour of the Leshan Giant Buddha Statue the next
day.

<P>
XI'AN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a grain
warehouse in northwest China's Shaanxi Province was recently
halted following the discovery of damage to two ancient tombs
located nearby.
</P>
<P>
The construction site in Pucheng County sits near a graveyard
with several ancient tombs and a large number of stone horses,
lions, sheep and human figures.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the warehouse commenced earlier this month
without approval from the Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics
(PBCR). A bulldozer ripped the roof of a coffin off and
destroyed coffins and stone biers in two stone tombs dating back
to the Qing Dynasty. Construction workers reportedly pilfered
valuable funerary objects.
</P>
<P>
Local residents, PBCR employees and provincial public security
officers rushed to the scene to investigate the damages, and the
local government held an emergency meeting to determine
appropriate remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers were ordered to return funerary objects,
with only a gold hairpin recovered to date. The construction
company was also instructed to proceed in accordance with the Law
on Cultural Relics.

<HEADLINE> China Flies Endangered Cranes over City Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Accustomed to seeing cranes
behind steel bars in zoos, visitors to Dalian, a scenic coastal
city in northeast Liaoning province might enjoy the view of
red-crested cranes flying in the city sky.
</P>
<P>
But it is more than an eye attraction for tourists. The new
method was recently approved by the local authorities as a
feasible way to protect the bird on the edge of distinction,
which the bird scientists from two local zoos have experimented
with for three years.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 70 cranes, including 67 red-crowned, have
been tamed into close relationship with the tamers. At the
whistle or call of "their masters", the cranes will either dance
gracefully before the public or fly freely in the sky.
</P>
<P>
"Flying the cranes has many merits," Zhangping from the Dalian
Forest Zoo said, "to cite an example, it can lead to timely
discovery of bird diseases."
</P>
<P>
Red-crested crane is the most-endangered bird under the state
protection, and only a little over 2,000 such cranes are still
living nowadays, most of them in China.
</P>
<P>
"The zoo-keepers used to cage the cranes or break their wings
out of worries that the birds may fly away," said Zhangping, also
the leading researcher of the crane-taming program. She then
pointed out that broken wings are no good since they posed
difficulties for the birds in mating and bearing children.
</P>
<P>
Besides, people are reluctant to hurt the bird since
red-crested crane is regarded as a symbol of peace, happiness and
nobility in the nation, and the Chinese people started to breed
the bird as long as 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"But it's not easy to train the cranes, they just do not
follow your instructions at the very first." noted Zhang.
</P>
<P>
To tame the birds, Zhang and her colleagues focused on
training three cranes at the beginning, and then used the cranes
as leaders of the crane group.
</P>
<P>
Telling a story about the cranes getting lost in flying, Zhang
added that there are also risks in flying the cranes. "They might
fly into trees or electric wires if the wind blows too hard, and
at least six cranes already died from such collision. Now we
seldom fly the birds in windy weather."
</P>
<P>
The crane-taming program now covers all the cranes in Dalian,
and zoos from other parts of the nation also dispatched staff
members to the city to start similar taming program.

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Over 100 Israeli reserve pilots have gone on a sort of
wildcat strike, refusing to fly until arrangements have been made
to increase compensation for injuries or death on duty. Defense
Minister Moshe Arens has given the matter top priority and met
Thursday night with senior military officials to try to work out a
solution.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Knesset (Parliament) member Haim Ramon is once
again rethinking his future in the Labor Party, after the party's
central committee Thursday went back on last week's decision
regarding the party's primaries. He was outraged to learn that at
the behest of most top party officials, the committee was asked
to make changes to the primaries system approved only last week
at his demand.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A public opinion poll showed that in the May
elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will lead in the
first round of voting with 35 percent of the votes, the Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak will get 28 percent and the centrist
party leader Yitzhak Mordechai 18 percent. But in the second
round, Barak will beat Netanyahu with 45 percent of the votes
against 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Eager to Beat Host in Short-track Speedskating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China, which
topped the gold medal tally with 15 golds in last Asian Winter
Games, is modest about defending its title but eager to overpower
South Korea in the short track speedskating at the upcoming Wint
er Asiad, said a top official of the Chinese delegation Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We can lose any event but not in the short track speedskating
which is also the favorite sport for host South Korea," said Xiao
Tian, chef de mission of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
In the short track speedskating events, China and South Korea
won five gold medals each in the Third Asian Winter Games four
years ago in Harbin, China.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korea took home three golds in the short track
speedskating events at the Nagano Winter Olympics last February
while China won five silvers in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea was the best in the sport at the Nagano Olympics
and is still very strong now although several stars have retired
after the Olympics. But our skaters have improved since the Naga
no Games in the experience as well as skill. We are determined to
beat them at their home this time," Xiao added.
</P>
<P>
China has yet to make a historic breakthrough in the winter
Olympics by winning a gold medal but narrowly failed in past
three Games.
</P>
<P>
"To beat the host means a lot for our athletes," Xiao said.
"It can increase the confidence of our skaters to take the gold
for the first time for our country at the 2002 Winter Games.
South Koreans are good but our skaters are also good. We have
same chance to beat the other."
</P>
<P>
The Games, which open on Saturday in Yongpyong, Kangwon
Province, will have a total of 43 gold medals in seven sports of
the Alpine skiing, cross country, figure skating, speed skating,
short track speedskating, ice hockey and biathlon.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Japan, second and third respectively at the
medal tally in Harbin, are expected to battle for the first in
the Games to be held in the three venues of Yongpyong, Chunchon
and Kangnung under the slogan, "Asia, Shining, Brightly through
Everlasting Friendship."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ice and snow sports delegation aims to vie for
third at the medal tally with a haul of 10 golds because Japan
and Kazakhstan are fielding strong lineup than the last to the
week long Games.
</P>
<P>
"Though the Japanese will miss all their five Nagano Olympic
gold medalists they are still strong enough to contest for top
spot at the medal table with Kazakhstan," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"Either Japan or Kasakhstan must grab at least 13 if they want
to have the most golds."

<HEADLINE> China Records Breakthroughs in Seabed Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China has recorded new
advances in the exploration of seabed polymetallic nodules in the
eastern Pacific and planning for commercial mining in the next
century, according to the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research
and Development Association (COMRRDA).
</P>
<P>
China has explored the international seabed since the late
1970s. COMRRDA registration with the United Nations as a pioneer
investor in international seabed resources in 1991 raised the
country's exploration program to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
COMRRDA had carried out nine exploratory expeditions by the
end of last year. Related operations yielded extensive data and
information on the 150,000-sq.km. area in the Pacific. The UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea requires China to relinquish 50
percent of the aforementioned area by March 5 this year. However,
China will retain the right to explore for polymetallic nodule
resources in the remaining 75,000-sq.km. area.
</P>
<P>
"China has developed a complete set of deep-sea mining
techniques and will continue to develop new techniques,"
according to a COMRRDA spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Hit by Influx of S. African Criminals: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The influx of criminals
and organized crime syndicates from South Africa is distorting
Swaziland's economy and straining its social fabric, Business Day
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of farms in the northern Hhohho region grow
dagga which is sold to South African drug dealers, the paper
quoted the Council Against Substance Abuse as saying.
</P>
<P>
Copper wire thefts by a South African crime syndicate have left
about 15 percent of the nation without telephone services.
</P>
<P>
Taxis no longer operate at night in the city of Manzini after a
spate of taxi and mini-van hijackings by a South African
syndicate, the paper quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's worst jail break took place last year when a South
African gang used grenades to stop a police van transporting South
African and Swazi criminals.
</P>
<P>
When Colin Chauke, South Africa's most wanted man, was arrested
in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, last week, he was heading for Swaziland,
allegedly with a forged Swazi passport.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked kingdom of fewer than one million people is a
transit point for criminals and illegal goods, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Swazis, 62 percent of whom live below the poverty line, are too
poor to form a market for illicit goods. However, porous borders
and an under- staffed police force make life easier for criminals
moving a variety of illegal goods, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police have appealed for extra funding. Last month, the
army beefed up border patrols, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President to Discuss Iraqi Crisis With Turkish Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak arrived here Friday morning to discuss the latest
developments of Iraqi crisis with his Turkish counterpart Suleyman
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak came here for a stopover before flying to Davos,
Switzerland where he will attend the Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the two presidents held a phone discussion about the
tension on the Turco-Iraqi border as the United States warplanes
lately took off from Incirlik Air Base in Adana, southern Turkey,
to bombard northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said here on Thursday
that Turkey is worried about the U.S. bombardment of northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed a no-fly zone in northern Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, allegedly to protect the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of allied forces stationed at the
jointly-operated Incirlik base as part of the Operation Northern
Watch to patrol the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two U.S. F-15 fighter jets took off from Incirlik
and fired three precision-guided bombs on an Iraqi missile site in
Mosul, a city in the no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen U.S. warplanes set out in the previous day from the
base along with six tanker aircraft, four transport planes and one
AWACS plane to patrol the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 17 U.S. fighter jets flew from the base and
bombarded two radar units and one anti-aircraft system in Mosul.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on Wednesday that
Turkey will not allow the U.S. to launch attacks against Iraq by
using warplanes based in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. warplanes at Incirlik are solely commissioned
with reconnaissance flights over northern Iraq to deter Iraqi
government forces from attacking Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Central Region Faces Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A food shortage looms in
Kenya's Central Province due to failure of short rains this
season, according to the provincial director of agriculture
J.K.Odok.
</P>
<P>
More than four million farmers in the region are likely to
face"one of the worst famines in years", Odok was quoted by
Friday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maize production, which is the staple food crop in the region,
is expected to fall following the dry spell, Odok said Thursday,
adding that out of the 53,500 hectares of the planted crops only
17 percent will be harvested.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit areas, he said, are the marginal lower parts of
Kirinyaga, Maragua and Thika districts, and vast areas of Kieni in
Nyeri district in the region. The situation is worse as
residents need relief food supplies.
</P>
<P>
Odok noted that the food problems will be aggravated by poor
harvests of Irish potatoes which normally supplement the maize
diet. Only an average of 32 bags of potatoes per hectare is
expected to be harvested unlike the anticipated 60 bags.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected crops, he said, is the bean which is a daily
diet for the residents. Only nine percent of the 4,200 hectares
of the crop in the upper Thika and Nyeri are likely to survive the
dry spell.
</P>
<P>
Odok attributed the problem to the uneven distribution of rain
pattern with some areas experiencing almost no drop, due to the La
Nina phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Since earlier this year, a number of areas in eastern,
southwestern and northeastern Kenya have suffered severe drought,
causing food shortage. The Kenyan government has been taking
measures and sending relief supplies to the affected areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal held Friday a one-day
national seminar on Y2K to create awareness, make assessment and
recommendations to deal with the so-called millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the seminar, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
said that "though Nepal is not very much affected as we have not
developed computer technology, the millennium bug is a serious
problem which requires immediate attention."
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is very much aware about resolving the
problem with the assistance of donor countries.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to developing information
technology which will be helpful in reducing the high rate of
unemployment in the country, he said, adding that a committee has
been formed to formulate policies in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Prithvi Raj Ligal, vice chairman of the National Planning
Commission, told the seminar that though Y2K is not a big problem
for Nepal, it is necessary to generate awareness as even
policy-makers are not aware what problems will be created by Y2K
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has decided to establish a
technology park in Kathmandu and has invited investors home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, papers on assessment of Y2K problems and future
plans were scheduled to be presented respectively by the Nepal
Telecommunication Corporation, the Nepal Rastra Bank, the Civil
Aviation Authority, the Nepal Electricity Authority, the Ministry
of Science and Technology and other banks.
</P>
<P>
A CD-ROM containing advice on Y2K solutions was distributed at
the inaugural function.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the National Planning Commission
in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program, the
embassies of Britain and the United States in Nepal and the
Computer Association of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Reopen Embassy in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Australia will reopen its
embassy in the United Arab Emirates in May, the Dubai-based
Khaleej Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to build a strategic relationship with the UAE," the
English daily quoted Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
as saying in Dubai on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Downer, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day visit, told
reporters that John Hines, a veteran diplomat, had been appointed
ambassador to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Hines is currently Assistant Secretary of the Middle East and
Africa Branch at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
His appointment followed a decision by the Australian
government last year to reopen its embassy in Abu Dhabi some 13
years after it was closed because of a review of Canberra's
overseas resources.
</P>
<P>
"Australia and the United Arab Emirates enjoy long-standing
and friendly relations, underpinned by expanding defense,
education, sports and cultural exchanges," Downer said, adding
there are over 2,000 Australian nationals staying and over 50
Australian firms operating in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
He said the reopening of the embassy is part of Australia's
efforts to strengthen political and commercial relations with the
UAE and the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE opened its embassy in Canberra in 1997, which gave a
boost to relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Now the UAE is Australia's largest single trading partner in
the Middle East and the 22nd largest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Lashes out Media on Quotes on Mauresmo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- World No.1 Lindsay Davenport
lashed out on Friday at media treatment of her comments on the
physical appearance of Australian Open finalist Amelie Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who lost to the French teenager in a semi-final
here, said on Thursday there were times in the match when
Mauresmo played with the strength of a man.
</P>
<P>
But Davenport said on Friday she had been taken out of context
in reports that made front as well as back page headlines around
the world on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It has probably hurt a very nice girl," she said.
</P>
<P>
"She is an incredible player and I'm sorry all this happened."
</P>
<P>
When Davenport's comments were relayed to Mauresmo on Thursday
she appeared to take them as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by a comment from world No.2 Martina
Hingis, Mauresmo's opponent in Saturday's final, who said: "She's
half a man".
</P>
<P>
The powerfully-built Mauresmo, who said on Thursday she had
worked hard in the gym on improving her physical strength, won
the semi-final in three sets.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's defense of her comments does not sit easily with
the official transcript of the media conference held after her
loss on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis later denied she had labelled Mauresmo a "half man"
during an interview on Thursday in German, as reported.
</P>
<P>
But several German reporters at the interview took the same
notes: "Sie ist hier mit ihrer Freundin, sie ist ein halber Mann."
</P>
<P>
(She is here with her girlfriend, she is a half man).
</P>
<P>
After her doubles final win on Friday over Lindsay Davenport
and Natasha Zvereva, Hingis agreed she had referred to Mauresmo's
partner, but claimed to have then said "something about her being
a good player".
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo, meanwhile, avoided camera crews which had lain in
wait for her to practise at Melbourne Park.
</P>
<P>
She went instead to Kooyong, about 10 kilometers down the
road.

<HEADLINE> Deeply-Rooted Grass Helping China Control Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China has resorted to using
some grass with the longest roots in the world to deal with its
increasingly serious soil erosion along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Vetiveria zizanioides, a kind of such grass, has roots that
grow as long as five meters and is the best plant for holding
water and soil in tropical and subtropical areas, Xia Hanping, a
researcher with the Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS), said today.
</P>
<P>
The grass has been used, with World Bank support, in the
provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Zhejiang along the
Yangtze River and has got good results in controlling soil
erosion on sloping fields, in orchards, and along highways and
river banks, Xia told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Although China is building a large shelter-belt along the
Yangtze, trees have limited result in controlling soil erosion,
and need to be planted with bushes and grass to help fix the sand
and soil, according to Xu Liyu of the CAS Nanjing Institute of
Soil Science.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that the deeply-rooted grass can reduce soil
erosion by 93 percent and surface runoff by 60 percent, Xu said,
and can improve soil quality, rehabilitate the eco-system, and
control environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
It takes five to eight years to get good results by planting
trees, but only about two years with the grass, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding an eco-system like a natural forest requires
decades or hundreds of years, Xu said, but the leaves of the
grass, which is rich in protein, can be used for livestock to
graze on. So, it will be another resource for poor regions of the
upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Forests along the Yangtze have been disappearing rapidly this
century and an increasing amount of sand running into the river
every year. Last year's devastating floods pointed to the urgent
need for a solution to this pressing problem.

<HEADLINE> Arms Supply to Angolan Rebels Probed in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has said his government is investigating some individuals
who may be involved in the alleged supply of arms to the Angolan
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said if there was support to the Angolan rebel forces,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
then it was being channelled illegally without government's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on arrival at the Lusaka international airport from
Zimbabwe Thursday night, the president assured the nation that
investigations would continue until the government was satisfied
with the findings.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Zambia Daily Mail quoted Chiluba as saying, "we have
to prove the allegations, in case there is truth about the
reports. Investigations will continue."
</P>
<P>
Angola has threatened to take military action against Zambia,
Uganda, Rwanda, Togo, Burkina Faso and "some individuals of South
Africa's former regime" for allegedly providing military support
to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Zambia is concerned about the allegations made.
He reiterated that Zambia wanted peace with Angola, as far as it
was not involved in any activities against that country.
</P>
<P>
He also said the only money Zambia had was for development and
not for war.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day working visit, Chiluba and his Zimbabwean
counterpart Robert Mugabe also discussed the on-going war in the
Democratic Republic of Congo as a follow up to the recent peace
talks held in the Namibian capital Windhoek.

<HEADLINE> China's Legislature Draws Up Rule on HK Deputy's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Legislature is drawing
up a special regulation governing the resignation of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
At the seventh meeting of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee
that opened here today, a draft of the regulation was submitted
by the meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the NPC
Standing Committee for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, vice-director of the Commission of Legislative
Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee, explained the draft to
delegates.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral law, the NPC deputies from each
province, autonomous region and municipality can submit their
resignation to the local people's congress.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiao said, the people's congress system is not
applicable in the Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong SAR deputies
to the Ninth NPC were elected by an electoral meeting, which is
not a permanent organization and could not accept their
resignations.
</P>
<P>
The method for electing the Hong Kong SAR deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress, adopted at the fifth session of
the Eighth NPC, does not, in fact, provide specific guidelines
for the resignation of Hong Kong deputies.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the fact that the election of the Hong
Kong SAR deputies to the Ninth NPC was presided over by the NPC
Standing Committee, the meeting of chairman and vice-chairmen of
the NPC Standing Committee drew up a method whereby the Hong Kong
SAR deputies to the Ninth NPC can submit their resignation to the
NPC Standing Committee, which will then make the decision to
accept their resignation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the method is now regarded as feasible after being
studied by a number of relevant departments.

<HEADLINE> Kangwon Ready for Asian Winter Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 29 (Xinhua) -- All
preparations for the Fourth Asian Winter Games have been made and
the games are expected to be the most successful winter gala ever
held in Asia, said top officials of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Asian Winter Games will open on Saturday at an
indoor ice rink in Yongpyong, Kangwon Province, with the
participation of 806 athletes, coaches and officials.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 522 athletes from 21 countries and regions will vie
for 43 gold medals in seven sports.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the province's beautiful scenery and merits
as a winter sports site to Asia and the whole world by
successfully hosting the winter Asiad," said Kim Dong-ho,
secretary-general of the Kangwon Winter Asian Games Organizing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old also hoped the successful staging of the
Games, the final Asiad of the 20th century, will serve to boost
the chances of South Korea gaining the right for staging the
Olympic Winter Games in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Chonju and Muju in North Cholla Province, which hosted the
1997 Winter Universiade, have already expressed their intentions
to host the 2010 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
The Kangwon Winter Games, Kim said, to be held under the
slogan of "Asia, Shining Brightly through Everlasting
Friendship," will be an event symbolizing the unity and joint
advancement of three billion Asians in the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 personnel, including 565 volunteer workers,
will mobilized to ensure the smooth operation of the games, also
the largest ever in the history of the Winter Asiad since they
started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
About a total of 200 billion won has been invested in
preparation for the Kangwon Winter Asiad. Of the sum, over 140
billion won was poured in building sports and accommodating
facilities and the remainder in expanding roads linking sports
venues.
</P>
<P>
"Investment in the Kangwon Asiad can be understood as an
initial investment in preparation for a possible hosting of the
Winter Olympics," Kim was quoted as saying by The Korea Herald.
</P>
<P>
Kim was chosen to head the Organizing Committee of the games
because of his experience in successfully hosting international
events.

<HEADLINE> CPC Central Committee's Proposal on Constitutional Amendment (updated 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A proposal by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was submitted
here today to China's highest legislative body for discussion to
consider amendments to part of the Chinese constitution.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by the CPC Central Committee, Tian Jiyun, a member
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a member
of the CPC Central Committee's Group for Constitutional
Amendment, outlined details of the proposal at the seventh
meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) held today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be discussed at the current meeting of the
NPC Standing Committee before it becomes a bill of the NPC
Standing Committee, which will be submitted to the upcoming
Second Plenary Session of the Ninth NPC for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun said, "The principles involved here mean that we
will only consider amendments that are considered necessary,
anything not relevant will not be discussed."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Constitution of the People's Republic of
China, adopted in 1982, is a good constitution, which has a
vitally important role in the country's political, economic and
social life.
</P>
<P>
With the continuous development of China's reform, opening-up
and socialist modernization drive, China has made other
amendments to parts of the constitution, in 1988 and 1993
respectively.

<HEADLINE> CPC Central Committee's Proposal on Constitutional Amendment (updated-2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tian said, the 15th National Party Congress convened in 1997
held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, summed up
China's new experience under its reform and construction and
outlined all-round arrangements for the transcentury development
of the socialist undertakings with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee thus considered appropriate
amendments to part of the constitution on the basis of the report
made by the party's 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee has now formed a group to look at
the proposed constitutional amendments led by Li Peng, chairman
of the NPC Standing Committee, and it has drafted out the changes.
</P>
<P>
Approved by a meeting of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau and adopted by a meeting of the CPC Central
Committee's Political Bureau in principle, the proposals were
delivered to party committees at provincial level, ministries and
commissions, the General Political Department of the Central
Military Commission as well as members and alternate members of
the CPC Central Committee to seek their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
also presided over a meeting recently to find out the opinions of
various democratic parties and All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also chaired a meeting held by the group for
constitutional amendments to solicit opinions from law experts
and economists in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tian Jiyun said, the CPC Central Committee
considered the opinions of the other groups and revised some
parts of the initial proposals.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau and the Political Bureau respectively, the CPC's proposal
for constitutional amendment was finally drawn up, Tian said.

MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sluggish performance of
agriculture and
construction sectors pulled down the Philippines' GDP by 0.5
percent in
1998 but the GNP grew by 0.1 percent due to abroad incomes growth,
a
government official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, director of the National Economic and
Development
Authority, told reporters that the preliminary estimates show
drops of
1.9 percent in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.2 percent in
Gross
National Product (GNP) in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 6.6 percent decline of the agriculture outputs for 1998 was
caused
by El Nino dry spell in the first three quarters and the typhoons
in
October, Medalla said on releasing the country's economic
statistics of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industry was weighed down by the drop in
construction and
manufacturing, which contributed 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points,
respectively, to the fall in GDP.
</P>
<P>
Both construction and manufacturing were disadvantaged by the
market-
unfriendly factors like high interest rates and volatile exchange
rate
during the early 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, personal spending remained firm, growing by
3.5
percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is carrying out measures to ensure
economic
recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
These include speeding up passage of laws on the banking
sector,
easing up credit to farmers, releasing Miyazawa funds to the
private
sectors and stepping up export drive.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the prospects of 1999, Medalla said that the
agriculture
is expected to recover and the government's pump-priming
activities are
seen to boost aggregate demand.
</P>
<P>
The improvements in imports related to the industry sector and
in
investments also show signs of economic recovery, he said.

<HEADLINE> 13 Hotels Face Closure in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen hotels in Zambia have
been threatened with closure because of their poor services,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of Nkana hotel in Kitwe, northern Zambia, has
been summoned to appear before the Hostels Board of Zambia to
explain why the hotel has continued to offer poor services despite
several warnings.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted board secretary Michael Lengalenga as
warning that if the hotel managements do not change their
standards, the board will not hesitate to close them down.
</P>
<P>
Lengalenga described the hotels as in a terrible mess and
warned that tourism is being adversely affected because of poor
hotel standards.
</P>
<P>
He said investigations are still going on and should the hotels
fail to exculpate themselves from the offenses, they will
definitely be closed.
</P>
<P>
The board has received too many reports of most hotels in the
country serving their clients recycled food, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to protect the interests of the traveling public and
tourists. The situation is not very serious in other hotels but
most of the smaller ones are offering substandard services to
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on residents and tourists to be courageous enough to
give formal complaints to the board so that appropriate measures
are taken.
</P>
<P>
Southern province permanent secretary Miltone Chalimbana was
quoted as saying that he has personally eaten rotten food in some
of the hotels and proposed that officials from the board be based
tourism spots.

<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to the development of trade relations with South
Asia, Hu Chusheng, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said today.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks in today's press conference held by the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The eastern and southern parts of Asia are the key areas that
China attaches importance to in terms of trade and economic
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Sino-Indian trade relations have always been
given priority, he noted, adding that India has been holding an
advantageous position in software development, which has
attracted the attention of the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
As the negative impact of the southeast Asia financial crisis
fades away, China's trade relations with South Asia, including
India, will increase correspondingly, he said.

According to China's custom statistics, Sino-Indian trade
volume reached 1,922.3 million U.S. dollars in 1998, up five

<HEADLINE> Goods Train Breaks China Speed Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A trial run of a high-speed
goods train broke new records in China yesterday reaching speeds
of 140 km per hour on the Changsha-Miluo section of the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway.
</P>
<P>
The train was jointly developed by Zhuzhou Rolling-Stock Plant
in Hunan Province and Beijing Erqi Rolling-Stock Plant and can
run at an average speed of 120 km per hour which is at world
level.
</P>
<P>
Before this the highest speeds achieved by Chinese goods
trains stood at 80 to 90 km per hour. In practice, however, most
trains can only operate at a speed of 60 km per hour, because of
poor bogie quality.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Southwest Transportation University
helped the new train's manufacturers break through the previous
technological barrier.
</P>
<P>
Currently, French goods trains hold the world's speed record
in their field of 140 to 160 km per hour.

<HEADLINE> Oversupplied Commodities On Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Internal Trade
Administration predicts that there will be surpluses of 437 of
the 605 major commodities this year, 38.4 percent more than for
the latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
After a long period of shortages, for the first time China
reported supplies exceeding demand last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that industrial goods will be the most
oversupplied. Of 439 types of industrial goods, 382 are expected
to be oversupplied, 50 percent more than for last year. They say
that most of the oversupplied industrial goods are the result of
low-quality, repetitive production, and wasted resources.
</P>
<P>
There will be a greater excess of farm and sideline products
and farming materials, and 31 of 111 types of farm and sideline
products will be oversupplied, an 18 percent increase.
Difficulties in getting rid of these products might possibly have
a directly effect on farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
There may be excessive surpluses of as many as 20 of the 32
items may, up 46.9 percent, pulling prices down even further.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil is the only item out of 605 that is expected to be in
short supply.

<HEADLINE> Improvement of Exportable Animal Products Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Livestock and animal
products supplied by Ethiopia to the world market are facing tough
competition due to low quality standard, an Ethiopian official has
said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Abiotawi Democracy, organ of the ruling
Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, Ethiopian
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Getachew Tekle-Medhin said Ethiopia,
although possessing a wealth of livestock resources, is yet to
improve the quality of its exportable animal products including
livestock, hides and skin and meat, the Ethiopian Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He urged all concerned to ensure that exportable animal
products are competitive enough on the world market so that the
sector may generate considerable foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Getachew noted that in 1997/98, out of the 4.2 billion Birr
(600 million U.S. Dollars) foreign currency earnings, 409.2
million Birr (58 million Dollars) was obtained from export of
hides and skin, 17 million Birr (2.4 million Dollars) from export
of cattle and 35.2 million Birr (5 million Dollars) from meat
export.
</P>
<P>
Considerable foreign currency could be earned from this
sub-economic sector provided farmers, investors and the government
worked more concertedly together, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that work is well underway to establish
shortly a livestock and animal products marketing authority to
promote the sector, adding that the authority is currently being
equipped with materials and staff with manpower necessary to
enable it to become operational soon.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the largest livestock resources in Africa and its
foreign currency earning from livestock products export ranges
second only to coffee.

<HEADLINE> China Verifies Over 30 Million Tons of New Oil Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese exploration teams have
confirmed 30.59 million tons of new oil reserves and 1.43 billion
cu m of natural gas near the Dagang Oilfield in Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yongping, chief geologist of the Dagang Oilfield Group Comp
any, which carried out the exploration work, said they had
obtained high-yield oil gas flow in six of the 12 wells they had
sunk in three different strata.
</P>
<P>
Dagang Oilfield, China's sixth largest oil and gas producer,
now turns out 4.3 million tons of crude annually. But after three
decades of pumping oil its reserves were declining.
</P>
<P>
According to China's state development plan, the Dagang
Oilfield is expected to produce 4.6 million to 5 million tons of
crude annually by the turn of this century, which would require
proven reserves of 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Wu said oilfield workers increased exploration activities a
year ago and have found indications of commercially viable
reserves of oil and gas in the dozen wells sunk.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that approximately 59.84 million tons more
of new oil reserves will be discovered in the three-stratas being
drilled.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Civil Servants Required to Undergo HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
plans to screen new civil servants for HIV before their
employment, media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson Makwetta, Minister of State in the President's Office,
said that before a person is employed in the civil service, he or
she is required to undergo medical examination to know whether the
person will be able to manage the provided job.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament in the central city of Dodoma Thursday,
Makwetta said the government is only adding HIV to the list of
medical exam because in the past, HIV did not exist and therefore
was not listed.
</P>
<P>
Makwetta, who is responsible for civil affairs, said the move
is not aimed at isolating the workers who have been affected by
HIV, the virus that causes the deadly disease of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while answering questions by
Leonard Derefa, a member of parliament who wanted to know the
number of civil servants who have died of HIV and whether the
government will screen prospective employees for HIV.
</P>
<P>
He said when a civil servant dies, the announcement is made in
the government gazette but the cause is not explained as the
government feels that there is no need to explain.
</P>
<P>
Makwetta said his ministry had no records of civil servants who
have died of HIV so far.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, some 1.5 million of a total population of 30
million have been infected with HIV, official statistics
indicated.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Hits Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate in 1998 hit
a record high of 4.1 percent on a monthly average, posting the
sharpest year-on-year rise of 0.7 point, the Management and
Coordination Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rate is the worst figure since 1953, when the current
statistical formula for unemployment research was adopted, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Last year marks the fifth straight year that Japan's jobless
rate hit a record high, as its unemployment rate stood at 2.9
percent in 1994 and rose each year since then.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate steadily rose from 3.5
percent in January to over 4 percent in April, remaining above
that threshold for the rest of the year, with the November
reading hitting 4.4 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ratio of job offers to job seekers in 1998
dropped to 0.53 from 0.72 a year earlier, the worst since the
first survey in 1963, the Labor Ministry said in a report. That
means only 53 job offers were available for every 100 job hunters.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the male jobless rate was 4.2 percent, and that for
women stood at 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of the employed decreased by 430,000 to 65.14
million, while that of the unemployed hit a record high of 2.79
million, up by 490,000, the Management and Coordination Agency
said.

<P>
CHANGSHA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- An ancient tomb dating back
to the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) was recently
unearthed on the outskirts of Changde in central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, discovered 10 meters below ground, includes a cha
mber measuring 5.5 meters by 4.7 meters. The tomb reportedly
houses the remains of a high-ranking official in an ancient state.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 relics have been recovered, including lacquerware,
pottery and copper items, as well as other extremely rare pieces.
</P>
<P>
Two copper wine vessels are inscribed with 16 ancient Chinese
characters which archeologists believe represent the period long
before the introduction of standardized characters.
</P>
<P>
The location of the tomb was listed in an extensive survey of
China's historical relics conducted in 1980. Archeologists
determined that the tomb had been entered on two separate
occasions, with estimates indicating the earliest incident taking
during the Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Set up Safari Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has

<HEADLINE> Name Brand Assessment Recognizes Hai'er </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A recently released
authoritative name brand assessment showed that Hai'er, a major
brand name household electric appliance manufacture, has assets
of some 19.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The '98 Most Valuable Name Brands Assessment listed Hai'er as
the third most valuable Chinese brand name following Hongtashan,
a cigarette brand, and Changhong, an electric and electronic
appliance brand, according to today's Overseas Edition of
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er's total assets for 1998 were up a dramatic 7.4 billion
yuan on the 1997 figure. The assessment listed Hai'er's 1998
intangible/tangible assets ratio at 1.78:1, with the company
ranking first in China's household electric appliance industry.
</P>
<P>
The Hai'er Company based in the port city of Qingdao, east

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Plans to Harmonize Cosmetic Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are making plans to harmonize
cosmetic regulations enforced in different countries, industrial
sources confirmed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that the move was to economically
prepare for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement which takes
effect in January 2003.
</P>
<P>
The harmonization of the regulations would enable ASEAN
countries to export products within member countries more smoothly
and at a cheaper cost, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, to export a cosmetic product to Thailand, approval
of Thailand's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and labeling in
the local language are required, adding to the cost of the
product.
</P>
<P>
FDA Secretary-General Mongkhol Na Songkhla said the
harmonization of regulations would not require manufacturers or
importers to register their products again and again in different
countries.
</P>
<P>
He told an on-going meeting on harmonizing regulatory systems
for cosmetics that although ASEAN countries had different laws on
production, sales and protection of consumers' rights, he was
confident that regulations on cosmetics could be harmonized
because "there is one thing in common -- the state is the
administrator responsible for protecting the public."
</P>
<P>
He insisted on maintenance of safe marketing procedures and
sales of quality cosmetics, adding that the list of prohibited
substances would have to be standardized.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the list of prohibited substances differ from
country to country. While Vietnam has 419 substances in their
list, the Philippines has 413, Singapore has 12 and Thailand has
31. Lead and Ts compound is the only common item defined as
prohibited substance in those countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee Bansil, who works on the European Union Cosmetic Regulatory
Scheme, said the biggest hurdle was that national interests must
go along with international harmonization, despite the differences
in language and culture.
</P>
<P>
Pisarn Jantaritthirathasamee, president of the Cosmetics
Manufacturers Association of Thailand, said the drafting of a
common regulation was expected to be completed within this year
and the harmonized laws was expected to take effect by the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the harmonization of regulations was expected to
further increase the nation's cosmetics export market, adding that
Thailand is the region's production center of cosmetics
production, both of local and international brands.
</P>
<P>
He said despite harmonization of laws, manufacturers would
continue to maintain competitiveness which mainly depends on the
quality of the product, the distribution and the approach of
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GDP Down, GNP Up Slightly in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sluggish performance of
agriculture and construction sectors pulled down the Philippines'
GDP by 0.5 percent in 1998 but the GDP grew by 0.1 percent due to
abroad incomes growth, a government official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Medalla, director of the National Economic and
Development Authority, told reporters that the preliminary
estimates show drops of 1.9 percent in Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and 1.2 percent in Gross National Product (GNP) in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 6.6 percent decline of the agriculture outputs for 1998 was
caused by El Nino dry spell in the first three quarters and the
typhoons in October, Medalla said on releasing the country's
economic statistics of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industry was weighed down by the drop in
construction and manufacturing, which contributed 0.5 and 0.3
percentage points, respectively, to the fall in GDP.
</P>
<P>
Both construction and manufacturing were disadvantaged by the
market-unfriendly factors like high interest rates and volatile
exchange rate during the early 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, personal spending remained firm, growing by
3.5 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is carrying out measures to ensure
economic recovery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
These include speeding up passage of laws on the banking
sector, easing up credit to farmers, releasing Miyazawa funds to
the private sectors and stepping up export drive.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the prospects of 1999, Medalla said that the
agriculture is expected to recover and the government's
pump-priming activities are seen to boost aggregate demand.
</P>
<P>
The improvements in imports related to the industry sector and
in investments also show signs of economic recovery, he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Announces Stock Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest
computer chip maker, announced a 2-for-1 stock split Thursday,
making shares more affordable to investors.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara-based company said the split takes effect on
April 11. It is the 12th split since the company went public in
1971.
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, several other companies also announced a
2-for-1 stock split respectively. Among them were Microsoft, IBM,
McDonald's, Xerox, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
In a split, a company increases its number of shares
outstanding without increasing the total market value. A share,
for example, valued at 100 U.S. dollars is exchanged for two
shares valued at 50 U.S. dollars each, or three shares, valued at
33.33 U.S. dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
Investors usually interpret a split as an indication that a
company believes its stock price will continue to rise. So they
welcome it.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Worst Time is Over: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi has said the worst of the economic
and political crisis of the last 18 months in the country is over
and it is now on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with editors of Sabah newspapers Thursday, he
said Malaysia was heading towards better times and after 18 months
there were many positive indicators to show that the country was
recovering politically and economically, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Things will only get better from now," he said, predicting
that there could be recovery next year if the people continued to
provide full support to the government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also deputy chairman of the National Economic
Action Council (NEAC), said economic indicators such as increasing
reserves, continuing trade surplus, recovery of the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange composite index and a pick-up in foreign investor
interest indicated that the economic crisis had bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the political turmoil had abated and whether
"wounds are healing" after the sacking of former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim, Abdullah said: "from the states I have
visited, yes, the wounds are healing, people are becoming more
aware of the real situation."
</P>
<P>
He said while the government and the NEAC were working hard to
bring the country out of the economic crisis, the people's support
was also crucial in ensuring the success of the government action
in reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is on a three-day official visit to Sabah State in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Abortions Dangerous in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Illegal abortions Could be
dangerous in Sri Lanka where between 500 to 700 cases are reported
annually.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 percent of those who undergo abortions die as a
result while 60 to 70 percent suffer serious complications, health
experts told a seminar recently.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Health Education Bureau, the Ministry of
Health and Indigenous Medicine and the United Nations Population
Fund, the program was highlighted on the fatal effects of abortion
and the action that can be taken to prevent its occurrence.
</P>
<P>
They said globally over 55,000 abortions are performed daily,
of which 95 percent are rated unsafe.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lakshman Senanayake said although there was no way of
knowing the exact percentage or figures of the illegal termination
of pregnancies, Sri Lanka is rated as a country where the demand
for abortions is very high.
</P>
<P>
Most young women seeking abortions were unmarried. But there
was also a percentage of married women who wanted abortions for
personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Cultural and religious norms posed a problem in Sri Lanka for
legalizing abortions. However, abortions would not be necessary if
family planning measures were promoted, experts said.
