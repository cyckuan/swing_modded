<HEADLINE> Nepal Has 200,000 Hepatitis B Virus Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 Nepalese, or 1
percent of the country's total population, are hepatitis B virus
carriers, Nepal's official RSS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed at a two-day workshop on hepatitis which
began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
While hepatitis A is predominantly a disease of childhood in
Nepal where almost everyone gets infected by the age of five,
hepatitis E is a common cause of jaundice among youngsters,
according to information from the workshop.
</P>
<P>
About 20 to 25 percent of pregnant Nepalese women infected with
hepatitis E die of acute liver failure, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is aimed at assessing the situation of viral
hepatitis in Nepal and presenting prevention suggestions to the
government, the RSS added.

<HEADLINE> French PM Calls Africa "Mosaic of State and Partners" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said Monday that Africa is "a mosaic of states and
partners," rather than a monotonous entity.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio France Internationale in the wake
of his visit to Africa last week, Jospin said that from now on,
France should consider each African country as a partner which
should be given priority in certain fields of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Each (African) country arrives with its problems, its history,
its traditions, its model of development, so each time the
cooperation should be particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Morocco, Senegal and Mali, Jospin presented
France's new Africa policy, which is focused around three axis --
seeking "fraternity" with African countries, aiding micro-economic
projects, and playing no longer the role of "policeman" in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Most Canadians Want Curbs on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are growing
suspicious of the Internet and favor government regulation of
cyberspace, according to a poll published today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian women, especially mothers of young children, are
leading the call for Internet control, a year-end Citizen-Global
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six Canadians said yes when asked whether they favored
government passing laws to regulate the Internet. Among women in
the 35-54 age group, 80 percent favor regulation.
</P>
<P>
"We have gone beyond the trailblazers, or first wave of users,
who typically would not favor any regulation," said Duncan Mackie,
senior vice-president of POLLARA, the polling firm that conducted
the survey.
</P>
<P>
As the second wave is more likely to consist of families, they
are sensitive to such things as violence and pornography on the
Internet, Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
But David Jones, president of the anti-censorship group
Electronic Frontier Canada, noted that people will change their
minds about regulation the more they use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that most Canadians don't have access to
the Internet. Sixteen percent have access at work, 13 percent have
access at home and 10 percent have it in both places.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Activists Protest Outside Downing Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Disabled activists threw red
paint today over Downing Street's gate to protest against Prime
Minister Tony Blair's welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 demonstrators spent 90 minutes chained to the gates
of Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence. They
also chanted slogans and held placards against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The paint was thrown at the gate blocking public access to the
street from Whitehall, a street full of government organizations
and departments.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested around a dozen people, some severely
handicapped, putting them and their wheelchairs to a fleet of
vans.
</P>
<P>
No welfare changes have yet been decided, but the Labor
government's zeal for reform has provoked widespread alarm.
</P>
<P>
Blair has angered disabled groups by refusing to rule out cuts
in some benefits as part of what he sees as a major reform of
Britain's 50-year-old welfare state.
</P>
<P>
A government Green Paper on benefits is due to be published in
later January or early February, a government spokesman said
today. He stressed that Blair was "absolutely determined to drive
it through" despite widespread protest against the reform.

<HEADLINE> Effective Foreign Policy, a Must for Security, Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan Monday underscored the imperatives of an effective
foreign policy which can protect the country's national interests,
security objectives and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address at a seminar on Pakistan's Foreign
Policy for the Next Century, organized by the Institute of
Regional Studies, the foreign minister declared peace and
stability as prerequisites for the development and well-being of
the Pakistani people.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's geo-strategic situation has to be kept in
mind while developing a security doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy has to play a pivotal role in minimizing
external threats and in creating a conducive environment for
economic progress, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan noted that sanctions under the Pressler Amendment
imposed by the United States soon after the withdrawal of the
former Soviet troops from Afghanistan had a major implication for
Pakistan's defense.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced focus by the Clinton administration on South Asia
is encouraging and the two amendments initiated by the
administration are an indication that the United States realizes
that Pakistan has had a raw deal under the discriminatory
non-proliferation laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
For future relations with the United States, Pakistan will have
to enhance economic ties by promoting trade and investments, said
Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan's desire for maintaining a strategic
equilibrium in the region and tension-free relations with India
continues to be thwarted by the unresolved Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, the foreign minister said that Pakistan
has no favorites in Afghanistan and is only interested in a
broad-based representative government there.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The co-chairman of the
inter-party dialog, Mainza Chona, today urged opposition leaders
not to make premature public statements which may jeopadize the
arrangements for the meeting to be attended by party presidents
next month to discuss the contentious issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Chona, central committee member of the United National
Independence Party (UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda,
asked all opposition leaders to channel their concerns through
the secretariat set up during the preliminary meeting held early
this month.
</P>
<P>
He said although the first preparatory stage of dialog has
been successfully completed there are more difficult tasks ahead.
</P>
<P>
Chona, who was chosen co-chairman at the preliminary meeting,
said the inter-party dialog secretariat will hold a meeting on
Tuesday to review progress of the dialog process.
</P>
<P>
31 parties attended the preliminary meeting and drew an agenda
for the inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
The party presidents will follow the agenda, which includes
most contentious issues like constitution, electoral process and
voters' register and fresh registration.

<HEADLINE> Aid Agencies Concerned over Cholera Situation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The international aid
agencies operating in the Somali capital have expressed concern
over the cholera situation in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Committee for the Red Cross
(ICRC), the disease has claimed the lives of 65 people in
Mogadishu and in the neighboring town of Afgoie in a week time.
</P>
<P>
Verena Krebs, ICRC's health delegate in Somalia, said today
hundreds of cholera admissions have been made in an informal
quarantine posts in both towns.
</P>
<P>
Krebs told the journalists here that 313 cholera cases with 40
deaths were reported in the war-ravaged neighborhood of Bermuda,
central Mogadishu. For its insecurity, Bermuda still remains
isolated from the rest of the capital where the aid agencies can
operate.
</P>
<P>
A Mother and Child Health Care unit reports in Mogadishu
indicate that 20 people die of cholera every 72 hours in the
capital alone.
</P>
<P>
According to Krebs, 17 cholera fatalities were reported from
the town of Afgoie, 30 km south of Mogadishu on December 20. She
said both Mogadishu and Afgoie have no single quarantine facility
to cope with the epidemic disease.
</P>
<P>
Somalia is one of eight African countries recently confirmed
by the World Health Organization to be suffering from cholera.
</P>
<P>
"In the other countries, only one percent of the cholera
patients die, while the death rate is 20 percent in Somalia,"said
the ICRC health delegate. The lack of quarantine centers and the
poor sanitation have increased the cases and the easy spread of
the disease, she added.

<HEADLINE> Mayor From French Extreme-Right to Re-Arm City Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Chevalier, mayor
of the southern French port city of Toulon who was elected from
the extreme-right National Front (FN), has decided to re-arm 70
city policemen.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made after Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement presented a draft law on strictly limiting the
armament of city police forces.
</P>
<P>
The city government of Toulon will arm "as soon as possible"
the police with automatic pistols, which were used by the city
police of Toulon until 1986, the Agence France-Presse quoted city
officials of Toulon as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Three other French cities ruled by FN mayors -- Orange,
Vitrolles and Marignane -- have also expressed strong opposition
to the law on disarming city police.
</P>
<P>
FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said in the capital of French
Riviera Nice last Friday that he was "hostile to the disarmament
of city police forces."
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of city police forces has met with strong
opposition from the rightwing PRP government of Nice, a city which
has the largest city police force in France.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: All Sides Should Contribute to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today called for efforts by all
parties involved in the Middle East peace process to help push it
forward.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with his Israeli counterpart David Levy here, Qian
said peace is in the best interests of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qian, on the second day of his three-day official visit,
exchanged views with Levy on promoting bilateral relations and
ways to push forward the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qian told reporters after the talks that China is not playing
the role of a mediator or a coordinator, but it is concerned about
the peace process which has been stalled since last March.
</P>
<P>
He said he is glad to hear from Levy that the Israeli
government is committed to the peace agreements signed with the
Palestinians, and that peace is the only option for Israel.
</P>
<P>
But he urged the Israeli government to give a clear message to
the world that the commitments and agreements are still holding so
that people in this region would feel confident of the peace
process, and the process could move forward.
</P>
<P>
Levy said, "Israel believes that there would be no going-back
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The current government
respects commitments by the former government of Israel in dealing
with the process and will put forward new proposals to push
forward the peace march. Israel hopes to start the final status
talks with the Palestinians for an agreement in order to have a
lasting and overall peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
On resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, he said, "it is
misunderstood that Israel wants to resume talks with Syria from
square one, however, there has been no agreement between Israeli
former government and the Syrian side. Nevertheless, Israeli
government is willing to restart the talks with the Syrians on
basis of talks already had and understandings reached."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Chinese delegation quoted Qian as
highlighting during the meeting the importance of the Israeli-Arab
negotiations in the context of the decades of conflicts in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we believe the principle of 'land for peace' should
be adhered to and all sides should adopt a more flexible,
realistic and positive approach to make the peace process moving."
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China understands Israel's security needs and
opposes any violent actions from any sides, but peace and
security can not be separated from one another. The current
impasse of peace process is detrimental to both Israelis and
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, both sides expressed satisfaction,
saying that they should exchange more visits to further promote
the existing friendly ties and expand cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister arrived here Sunday night from
Syrian capital Damascus, the second leg of his current Middle East
tour which has also taken him to Lebanon. He is scheduled to meet
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu later today.
</P>
<P>
He is also going to visit the Palestinian self-rule area and
Egypt after concluding his visit here.

<HEADLINE> Unrest Surges in Kenya as Poll Day Approaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission (EC)
of Kenya today called on all political leaders to make efforts to
curb the surging election-related violence as the campaign for
the presidency is running to the top gear.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said two more people were killed in the
country's third-largest city of Kisumu over weekend following
clashes between supporters of the National Development Party
(NDP) and youths allegedly backing the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU).
</P>
<P>
Thus it has brought the toll of those dead since November 15
to about 10 with more than 80 injured and dozens arrested across
the country. The poll was scheduled for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
EC Chairman Samuel Kivuitu told a press conference today that
he has asked political party leaders to attend a meeting on
Wednesday to discuss how to avoid and stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
"I have invited the main political leaders to press on the
issue of violence. It is essential that we meet them since the
remaining days are of the greatest significance to the
sovereignty of Kenya," said Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that his commission received complaints on
violence from the NDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP),
another main opposition party over the weekends and "now consider
what action it will take".
</P>
<P>
There were also conflicting reports about turmoil involving
the opposition Safina party and KANU in Garissa, Northeastern
Province on Sunday, leaving 10 people injured.
</P>
<P>
However, the police reportedly claimed there was no violence,
only "angry words" between Safina and KANU supporters.
</P>
<P>
Later today, KANU spokesman Fallana Ogw strongly condemned the
recent violence behind which he said there is no KANU's hand.
</P>
<P>
The KANU always pursues peace, love and unity among Kenyan
people who should be ensured "the opportunity for free and fair
poll", he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the total 15 presidential candidates had requested and
been given round-the-clock security. Those who have not applied
include aspirants from FORD-People, Kenya, UPPK, FORD-Asili and
Umma.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kenyan President and KANU Chairman Daniel arap Moi,
73 and in power for 19 years, is widely expected to win his last
campaign with five-year more tenure largely due to the division
of the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Family Christmas Cost in Britain Goes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retailers are pinning
hopes of a recovery in December sales on the last several days
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the high street was slower than expected last week
and many stores and shops have already begun discounting in an
attempt to woo shoppers.
</P>
<P>
The bill for the average family's Christmas is 209.50 pounds
(335.2 US dollars), down nine pounds (14.4 US dollars) from last
year's total and the first fall in at least four years, according
to the Christmas price index.
</P>
<P>
However, another report published today forecasts spending in
the January sales on non-food products to be as high as 6.7
billion pounds (10.72 billion US dollars), equivalent to 9 percent
more than January 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that much of the 20 billion pound (32 billion US
dollar) windfall money from building society conversions has
already been spent on large electrical goods and holidays rather
than Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) forecast
up to 3 billion pounds (4.8 billion US dollars) of stock in the
non-food sector would be carried over into the January sales.
</P>
<P>
Douglas McWilliams of the CEBR said that five interest rate
rises since May, tax increases and uncertainty on the stock market
since the autumn had damped down trading activity.

JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The South African

increased traffic volumes expected on all major routes from
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Arrive Alive National Traffic Information Center (NTIC)
urged motorists to drive slower as rain and storms were forecast.
</P>
<P>
The center said the peak was expected to begin on Tuesday at
midday and would reach the highest numbers between 7:00 PM and

</P>
<P>
Traffic on Tuesday was expected to comprise travellers going

"They will not be travelling very far and accidents will occur
over short distances and in municipal areas," the center said.
</P>
<P>
The Weather Bureau predicted rain across the country on

and the Free State, and mist on the escarpment of Kwazulu Natal
Province, Mpumalanga Province and the Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
In its latest fatality report, the NTIC said high speed and
pedestrian jay-walking were the highest contributory factors to
the increasing fatality rate, currently standing at 427.
</P>
<P>
The NTIC urged drivers to rest before embarking on a long
journey and take sufficient stops along the way to stretch the
limbs and relax.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
well-known mining company Anglo American and Diamond Giant De
Beers announced today they had agreed to restructure their
business links to allow the latter to operate as a separate,
independently-managed company.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two groups said that the move would
help De Beers meet future challenges and opportunities of the
diamond industry with a fully independent and dedicated
management team.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, De Beers would become a self-administered
and free standing international organization with its own staff.
</P>
<P>
All employees in the diamond services division of Anglo
American would be offered employment with De Beers with effect
from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
De Beers would cancel its existing service agreements with
Anglo American against payment of a negotiated amount, and
establish its own service departments to replace the services
currently drawn from Anglo American.
</P>
<P>
After its independence, De Beers would remain the largest
shareholder in Anglo American. Its registered head office would
continue to be in Kimberley, Northern Cape Province.

<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The sports goods manufacturer
Adidas AG announced today that the German cartel office has
approved its plan to take over the French Salomon group which is
specialized in winter sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which will cost Adidas some 2.4 billion German marks
(1.4 billion U.S. dollars), would turn the company into the No.2
sports goods maker in the world with annual sales estimated at
about 8 billion marks (4.5 billion dollars), second only to the
U.S. Nike company.
</P>
<P>
Adidas already achieved sales of nearly 5.3 billion marks (3.0
billion dollars) in the first nine months of the current business
year. With its takeover of the Salomon group, whose sales in 1996
were about 1.46 billion marks (825 million dollars), Adidas wanted
to become "the best sports goods company in the world," the
company said.

<HEADLINE> Industries Minister Complains of Bureaucracy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Industries Minister
Gholamreza Shafei has complained of excessive bureaucracy in the
country, saying that it hinders the expansion of the country's
non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The government would not be able to achieve the 1.9 billion
U.S. dollar goal of non-oil industrial exports for the current
Iranian fiscal year starting on March 21 due to excessive
bureaucracy, Shafei was quoted by Iranian official IRNA news
agency as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate bureaucracy in the country. However,
foreign businessmen have complained of the complicated procedures
at the country's customs and ministries, and the banks.
</P>
<P>
They said that one must go to various state institutions to get
permissions and confirmations and the issue would be more serious
if one tries to import goods for Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran started a strict control on financial and monetary
affairs and obliged Iranian merchants to do their business
through the country's banking system after the country faced a
problem of repayment to foreign debts following the sharp fall of
oil prices in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Shafei expressed the hope that the country's
development would be accelerated with the expansion of industrial
sectors, saying that some 9,500 industrial units have obtained
licenses and started operations during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
At present 8,000 new industrial units are under construction,
he added, stressing that more efforts should be made to
improve the situation and to define priorities for industrial
sector such as electronics, car manufacturing, chemicals and
textile production.

<HEADLINE> Probe Into Foiled Coup Underway in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military said here
today that investigation into Sunday's coup plot involving the
country's second person Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya is underway.
</P>
<P>
A press release signed by the military spokesman Col. Godwin
Ugbo, said the coup attempt "to violently overthrow the present
administration" took place in early hours on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ddiya and 11 others, including one civilian, are the
"principal actors" and have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
"Further investigation has commenced," it said, adding that
the government would "strongly resist any attempt to undermine
the security and integrity of the nation and thereby derail the
on-going transition to a democratically elected government".
</P>
<P>
"With the just concluded elections to state houses of
assembly, the federal military government reassures that the
transition to a civil rule is very much on course and will be
pursued to a logical conclusion", it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release also gave a list of the "principal actors",
on top of which is Diya, chief of general staff and vice-chairman
of the ruling Provisional Ruling Council.
</P>
<P>
Diya, 53, reportedly escaped from a bomb blast last on
December 13 at the presidential wing of the international airport
of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The other coup plotters include former minister of works and
housing Major-general Abul-Karim Adisa and former minister of
communications Major-general Tajudeen Olanrewaju, both of whom
were sacked in the cabinet reshuffle last month.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested are also four colonels, one Lt.-colonel
and three majors, who are either close to Diya or the other two
major-generals.
</P>
<P>
The only civilian, identified as Professor Feimi Odekunle, is
the political adviser to Diya.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's announcement of the botched plot brought to two the
number of known attempts to unseat the administration of General
Sani Abacha who came into power on November 17, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The first took place in March 1995, involving former head of
state General Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired general now kept in
jail, and his deputy late Major-general Musa Shehu Yar'adua, who
died serving a 25-year imprisonment a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed five
successful coups and three aborted ones.
</P>
<P>
It seems that Sunday's foiled coup has not made great fuss in
Nigeria so far and the situation in the country is calm up to
now.
</P>
<P>
Although official announcement of the cause of the coup
attempt is yet to come, observers here said it might have
connections with last month's reshuffle of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In the 33-member reconstituted cabinet Abacha swore in last
Thursday, less than half of the former ministers are reappointed.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of attention goes to the fact that most of the
coup plotters belong to the tribe of Yeruba in the east, while
the power of the country is generally held by men from the Hausa
tribe in the north.

<HEADLINE> 20 People Die on S. African Roads Every Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- About 20 people were
killed every day on South African roads since the beginning of
the month, the National Traffic Information Center said today.
</P>
<P>
The death toll nationwide has climbed to 427 as for today,
according to the center.
</P>
<P>
The figure is much lower compared with the same period last
year. A total of 1,242 people lost their lives from December 3,
1996 to January 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most accidents were caused by speeding, traffic officials
said. Of about 770,000 fines issued for traffic offenses since
October when a nationwide "Arrive Alive" road safety campaign
began, some 481,000, or more than 60 percent, were for speeding.
</P>
<P>
The country sees most traffic accidents during the Christmas
and New Year season when more people drive long ways to their
holiday destinations.
</P>
<P>
Traffic volumes on major national routes are expected to
increase significantly. The N3 route from Johannesburg to Durban
and N1 to Cape Town are considered to be very dangerous during
this period.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed and several others were injured on
Sunday night when two minibuses in which they were travelling in
collided near Vereeniging, some 60 kilometers south of
Johannesburg, while road accidents in the Pretoria area claimed
five lives at the weekend, South African Press Association
reported today.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Favours Improved Greco-Turkish Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus favors all efforts
aimed at improving Greco-Turkish relations as well as Turkey's
European prospects, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides
said that Greco-Turkish friendship would imply a solution to the
Cyprus problem in the framework of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Christofides noted that the Cypriot government supports
Turkey's aspirations for getting a European Union membership,
pointing out, however, that Ankara should respect the
preconditions set by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's European prospect will also depend on the progress
achieved in the Cyprus problem, and on abandoning its policy of
trying to obstruct Cyprus' accession to the EU," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent meeting in Washington between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, Christofides expressed satisfaction because the Cyprus
problem was among the issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. has repeatedly stated that the
Cyprus problem ranks high in its list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
"A solution to the Cyprus problem would serve vital American
interests in the area," Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the prospects for a Cyprus settlement in the
coming year, Christofides said that many foreign officials have
described 1998 as "the year for Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"If all interested parties show good will, the Cyprus problem
will not take long to be solved," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Junta Dismisses Kabbah's Trip to S. Leone as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the military
junta in Sierra Leone today dismissed as a "cosmetic venture"
what he called the "flying visit of deposed president Tejan
Kabbah to Sierra Leone for the first time since he was overthrown
in May.
</P>
<P>
"He needn't have come sneaking into the country in which he is
a citizen and sought the help of Nigerian troops for this," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the (military) government has "always said
that Kabbah is free to return so that he, Sankon (the rebel
leader now detained in Nigeria) and Major Koroma can sit down and
work out a comprehensive plan for sustainable peace in Sierra
Leone."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, accompanied by a number of his ministers in exile in
neighboring Guinea including vice president Joe Demby and deputy
defense minister Hinga Norman who heads the Kamajors, addressed
Nigerian troops in ECOMOG at their base at the Lungi
International Airport, 10 miles across the Sierra Leone estuary
but did not visit the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Journalists from the mainland were prevented by Nigerian
securities from attending the ceremony and their dugout canoes
were intercepted by ECOMOG gunboats and ordered to turn away.
</P>
<P>
According to local residents at Lungi, Kabbah looked slightly
nervous as he spoke, thanking the Nigerian soldiers for "giving
adequate security" to the people in the area.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said his visit "is the beginning of regular
consultation with the people of Sierra Leone as he would be
coming from time to time for the people to know that he as their
leader has not forsaken them," one eye witness said.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to wait until April 22, 1998 because I have
already given my word to the international community and the
ECOWAS leaders as well," Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
According to one local chief, "Kabbah's visit came as a great
surprise as we have been expecting him since mid November when
the visit was called off without explanation."
</P>
<P>
Another resident said the visit "has pushed back speculations
about an ECOMOG attack on Freetown over the Christmas period."

<P>
NEW YORK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Property and casualty
insurers in the United States fared well in 1997 while a moderate
growth of the industry is forecast for 1998, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Earned premiums of property and casualty insurance are expected
to reach 272 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, compared to 263.4
billion dollars in 1996, according to the Insurance Information
Institute (III), an industry group.
</P>
<P>
Investment income of the industry is expected to amount to 41.5
billion dollars against 38 billion dollars in 1996, while capital
gains could go up to 9.9 billion dollars from 9.2 billion, the III
said.
</P>
<P>
The industry paid 3.5 billion dollars for catastrophe losses
compared to 7.4 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see "serious threats" to the industry in the long-term
and depression of rates because of continuing competition. They
expect premiums to grow modestly but capital gains and investment
income to fall next year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. insurance industry employs about 2.2 million people at
a payroll of 83 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Ends with Major Decisions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The three-day summit of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states ended here today with a
number of important decisions aimed at strengthening regional
security, stability and internal cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
In their final communique issued at the end of the summit, the
six Gulf leaders from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman expressed satisfaction with the
steps taken in all areas related to internal cooperation and
relations with regional countries during the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the leaders approved recommendations by
defense ministers on linking the GCC states' radar and
communications network, early warning system and military
training as part of security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "expressed satisfaction with the steps taken in
all areas of military cooperation" as described in the final
communique.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, projects of a proposed optic fibers cable
and the "Cooperation Security Belt" which links radar and air
warning networks of the GCC armies will be enacted within
two years. They are expected to pave the way for creating
a joint operation room able to deal with threats to any
member state.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Iran, the final communique expressed hope for
establishing good relations with Iran based on mutual respect and
the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders said in the communique that the coming era will
witness positive and concrete trust-building steps to establish
relations which guarantee security and stability in the region in
view of the positive statements by Iranian officials to start a
new era of relations with the GCC.
</P>
<P>
But the GCC leaders also reiterated their full support for the
UAE sovereignty over the islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and
Abu Musa now occupied by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The leaders urged Iraq to "fulfill all U.N. Security Council
resolutions without selection," especially those calling for the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
They said that Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions would
help end the U.N. sanctions "to ease the suffering of the Iraqi
people, a matter that draws the sympathy of the GCC countries."
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the leaders condemned
Israeli hard-line policy, categorically rejected the Israeli
government's actions and demand a full compliance with the
signed accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for the legitimate right of the
Palestinian people, including the right to establish an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders called on Israel to resume peace talks with
Syria and Lebanon from where they were suspended and called for
"an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
On the economic cooperation front, the leaders gave the
go-ahead to start the implementation of a project to link
the power grid of the six member countries into an integrated
network. The first phase which is expected to cost 2.2
billion U.S. dollars will complete in two years.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the banking cooperation, the leaders agreed to
allow Gulf banks to open branches in the six member countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to set up a Consultative Council,
approved environment protection systems and ratified a unified
civil code and a penal code as well as a number of other decisions
to push forward the internal cooperations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that the results and achievements of
the summit, whether the positive attitude toward improving
ties with Iran and a more reconciliatory stand to Iraq, or
the decisions in the fields of military and economic
cooperation, will for sure push the GCC countries into a
new and more forward-looking era.

processors and operating systems for all these new digital boxes,
and the cable industry appears to be a receptive customer.
</P>
<P>
Some experts agreed that "the world of the future is the world
of the network PC."
</P>
<P>
Although final technical specifications have not yet been
issued, the digital TV set-top devices will actually be powerful
computers. Unlike the conventional analog boxes in use today,
these new devices will be able to process high-speed digital
signals moving to and from the home.
</P>
<P>
They will enable cable companies to expand the number of
channels they offer. And they will also make possible new
generations of television-based interactive services, including
high-speed Internet access with E-mail, on-demand pay-per-view
videos, push-button electronic commerce, advertising that can be
aimed to specific homes, interactive games and eventually
high-definition video, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the speed of the deployment of these boxes
depends in large part on the cable companies' ability to upgrade
their existing analog systems. That can be a slow and expensive
process. To raise money to pay for new cable and optical fiber
networks and millions of the expensive new boxes, the companies
are actively looking for big investors.
</P>
<P>
The Microsoft Corporation, the nation's software giant, spend 1
billion U.S. dollars separately to buy WebTV and part of Comcast
to promote its cable TV system.
</P>
<P>
Nextlevel says it plans to sell the next-generation boxes for
about 300 U.S. dollars each, meaning the deal announced last week
could be worth as much as 4.5 billion U.S. dollars to the company
over the next three years. Tele-Communications, the largest
customer, agreed to buy 10 million of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that dozens of companies also joined the
competition for setting the standard for new digital services.
They include IBM, Sun Microsystems, Scientific Atlanta, Toshiba,
Cisco Systems, and Lucent Technologies.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Ready for Arab Reconciliation Except </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- While expressing its
readiness for Arab reconciliation based on clear understanding,
Kuwait today ruled out reconciliation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Arab reconciliation is in the interest of Kuwait and other
Gulf states," Kuwaiti Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser
Al-Sabah said at a news conference after the conclusion of the
summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council here today.
</P>
<P>
He described Arab causes as the main causes of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned of confusion in this respect. "Our position
toward the Iraqi regime is out of the reconciliation issue as it
is not a Kuwaiti (cause) but an international cause," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister said the Iraqi attempt to erase Kuwait
from the map is a lesson that must not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed Kuwait's sympathy for the Iraqi people
who have been suffering from the crippling economic sanctions
imposed by the United Nations after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We are the most concerned about the suffering of the Iraqi
people, they are our neighbors, we know them more than any other
Gulf state and we are the first to send relief aid to Iraqi
refugees in Iran," said Sheikh Saud.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Kuwait's objection to "any partition of Iraq."
Instead, he said, it supports the efforts to relieve the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Gulf Arab countries with Iran, he
commended recent statements by Iran's President Mohammad Khatami
as "positive and in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that "the differences (over three islands in
the Gulf) between Iran and the United Arab Emirates will be
settled."
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeated its call for improved relations with its Arab
neighbors and has been making efforts to achieve the goal. Khatami
said last week that he is willing to visit the UAE to discuss the
disputes of the three islands.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud said that he is convinced that there is the
necessity to set up a security system among the Gulf states,
including Iran, which he said is a regional power.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Statement on Somali Talks Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The National Salvation
Council (NSC) of Somalia today strongly condemned a statement by
the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson regarding the Somali
reconciliation talks in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Two NSC co-chairmen General Aden Abdullahi Nur and Col.
Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed dismissed it as irresponsible and
misleading to the international community.
</P>
<P>
A press release jointly signed by the two co- chairmen and
issued here today said, "it was irresponsible on the part of
Egypt to claim that a historic agreement had been reached at
Somali Cairo talks while the whole world knew that two
co-chairmen of the NSC left Cairo after an impasse on key issues
and lack of consensus even within NSC itself."
</P>
<P>
It added, "moreover, the Egyptian statement ignores the wishes
and participation of the people in the north of Somalia, thus
discrediting once again the impartial mediation by that
government among Somali political factions."
</P>
<P>
The press release pointed out that "the Egyptian government
has hijacked the Somali reconciliation process and as a result
has created more divisions within Somali factions, thus seriously
damaging the efforts and gains of seven years of reconciliation
among Somali faction leaders."
</P>
<P>
The NSC co-chairmen noted "the government of Egypt is biased
as it is not sincere in resolving the Somali crisis."
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement here by the NSC
spokesman, Somali factions meeting in Cairo failed to reach
agreement on a number of key issues, including the venue of the
national reconciliation conference, the fair representation of
clans in the conference and the withdrawal of Hussein Aideed's
militia from certain occupied districts of Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> S. African Teachers' Employment to Depend on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of teachers
employed by a province would in future depend on provincial
budgets and no longer on fixed teacher to pupil ratios, the South
African Department of Education said today.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the number of teachers employed by a province has
been determined by the National Edcuation Department.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said in Pretoria that the
new move was in line with the government's decision to terminate
its existing right-sizing process with effect from January 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of this process, which came into effect last year,
the department hoped to achieve teacher to pupil ratios of 1:35
for high schools and 1:40 for primary schools by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It aimed to do this by redeploying teachers at schools with an
abundance of educators to less fortunate schools, a process
already underway.
</P>
<P>
The changes themselves did not threaten the employment of a
single teacher. "The measures only provide a framework," Bengu
said.

the same period last year, the Jerusalem Post daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, a total

<HEADLINE> Floods Halting Tanzanian Railway Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian Railways
Corporation (TRC) will not risk resuming passenger train services
on the lines of Tabora-Mwanza and Tabora-Kigoma due to the floods
which have swept most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The TRC Director General, Linford Mbomba made the remarks here
today that the services have been halted by floods and will not
resume until the situation improves.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take the risk of operating passenger trains on the
two lines as requested by the Tabora Regional Commissioner,
Stephen Mashishanga," he maintained.
</P>
<P>
Mboma said the TRC authorities are afraid of causing problems
and incoveniences to passengers in case of any accidents.
Normally when an accident happens, the corporation will have to
compensate the passengers, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to run into trouble," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Tabora Regional Commissioner last Sunday appealed to the
TRC authorities to resume passenger services on the two lines,
saying that most of the roads in the region are not passable and
thus making movement of both people and goods difficult.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension of train services along the Central
railway line, thousands of passengers are being stranded.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Isidore Shirima
said 150 tons of relief food destined for Kondoa district are
stranded in Dodoma after a road section was destroyed by the
lasting rains.
</P>
<P>
TRC suspended train services along the Central railway line
mid-December after floods washed away several sections. After
repairs, it went into operation. But merciless floods damaged
more sections, forcing it to suspend services again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Kakindo Village in the northwest region of
Kagera, 789 families have been rendered homeless after heavy
floods swept away their houses, reports reaching here said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Again Urges Iraq to Cooperate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today issued a presidential statement, once
again calling on the Iraqi government to cooperate fully with the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The move came after Richard Butler, executive chairman of the
UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction,
briefed the council on his four-day visit to Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Butler said his talks
with Iraqi officials on dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction had yield little progress.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential statement, the council reiterated its
demand that the government of Iraq cooperate fully with the UNSCOM
in accordance with all relevant resolutions and the government of
Iraq allow UN weapons inspection teams immediate, unconditional
access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and
means of transportation which they wish to inspect in accordance
with the mandate of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed that the failure by the government of Iraq
to provide the UNSCOM with immediate and unconditional access to
any site and category of sites was unacceptable and a clear
violation of te relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated that the effectiveness and speed with
which the UNSCOM may accomplish its responsibilities was, above
all, determined by the degree to which the government of Iraq
cooperates in disclosing the full extent and disposition of its
proscribed programs and in granting the UNSCOM unimpeded access to
all sites, documents, records, and individuals.

fast development of Sino-Israeli relations in various areas.
</P>

Qian relayed greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Weizman, and he invited the president to visit China at a

the year end, has postponed his visit, citing domestic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Qian introduced to Weizman the current state of China's
economic and political development and their prospects. He pointed
out that it would take painstaking efforts for China to become
a developed country in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The minister refuted the claim that China will pose threats
to the world stability once it becomes developed. He noted
that only when China stays underdeveloped and poor will it
threaten the world stability, otherwise it will only contribute
to the world peace.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed satisfaction with the current state of
bilateral relationship, hoping they would be further developed.
</P>
<P>
Weizman explained Israeli positions on the Middle East peace
process, saying that he was still optimistic about the prospects

Expressing the belief that the 21st century should become a
peaceful century free of wars and conflicts, Qian stressed the
importance of achieving stability and peace in the Middle East,
which he said will help contribute to the world stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that in order to realize peace, stability and

PARIS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The president of France's
national Jewish organization CRIF, Henri Hajdenberg, said he was
"stunned by and indignant about" the statement made by a world
Jewish leader that France would be the next to be condemned for
keeping Nazi-robbed Jewish properties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Geneva-based daily Journal de Geneve

said that the French Jews should "recover without hesitation"
their properties robbed during the Nazi occupation period.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of Avraham Burg... is shocking enough," said
Hajdenberg. "We regret that once again the president of Jewish
Agency addressed to the leaders of the French Jewish community
through the media without even meeting them or getting their
views."
</P>
<P>
Burg, who is also president of the World Zionist Organization,
said that after Switzerland, France would be the "next target" for
recovering Jewish properties lost during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Many many things remain to be settled. Properties confiscated,
arts works, properties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized French Jews for failing to raise the issue
in fear of a revival of anti-Semitic feeling in France.

JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today called for Israelis and
Palestinians to take realistic and positive attitudes towards
pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu here which covered the Middle East peace
process and the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the whole peace process would only advance on
the basis of abiding by the relevant U.N. resolutions and sticking
to the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
He told Netanyahu that there will be no security at all if
peace is not realized. He expressed the belief that countries in
the region including Israel will enjoy real peace only after the
region achieves a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China hopes the Middle East peace process will be
resumed on all tracks at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Netanyahu explained Israeli positions on the
peace process, expressing his willingness to make peace with all
his country's neighbors under the condition that its security is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed satisfaction with the smooth development
of bilateral relations since the two countries established
diplomatic ties in 1992. Netanyahu said a solid basis has been
laid for the future development of such ties, especially in the
agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the increase in high-level contacts
and exchange of visits show that considerable achievements have
been gained in mutual cooperations in the spheres of politics,
economy, culture and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Beijing welcomes Israeli entrepreneures, businessmen
and Jews around the world to invest or do business in China.
</P>
<P>
Qian conveyed greetings from Chinese Premier Li Peng to
Netanyahu, and invited Netanyahu to visit China.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who arrived here Sunday from visits to
Lebanon and Syria, briefed Netanyahu on his meetings with Lebanese
and Syrian leaders.

Republic of Cyprus, stressing that "if we cooperate we can
gradually establish the federal, bizonal, bicommunal Republic of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Christofides also pointed out that both Denktash and Turkish
officials recently stepped up efforts to achieve recognition of
the secessionist entity unilaterally declared in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the international community does not and will
not recognize the Turkish Cypriot regime set up in the occupied
north.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
island following a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also dismissed Denktash's claims that the
European Union (EU) decision, taken in Luxembourg earlier this
month, to start accession talks with Cyprus in spring 1998 is
like "offering Greek Cypriots union (with Greece) on a silver
platter."
</P>
<P>
"The Luxembourg decision offers Greek and Turkish Cypriot
youth the chance to become Europeans," Christofides said, adding
that "we should take advantage of this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot community object to the
EU's decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot
government, insisting that Cyprus can join the EU only after a
political settlement on the island.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaians Reported Facing Acute Fuel Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaians, who are to suffer a
nationwide electricity rationing beginning next year, have come
to blows over the diminishing fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
Short supply of petrol in the capital Accra since the weekend
has led to thefts and injuries in fighting for fuel, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
As long queues formed on Sunday at the few filling stations
with fuel stocks, tempers flared and scuffles broke out,
prompting one dealer to call the police.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a filling station manager as saying that his
stock of 13,500 liters of petrol sold out in three hours.
</P>
<P>
Taxi drivers have increased their prices as signs reading "no
fuel here" appear at filling stations across the capital.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists hoping to travel to various destinations in
Ghana have been stranded in Accra.
</P>
<P>
The report said, Chief Executive of the Tema Oil Refinery,
William Parker, has come under fire for not taking appropriate
steps after a foreign fuel supplier failed to make promised
deliveries in November.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's electricity rationing plan
announced last Friday, non-essential industries and private
electricity consumers across the country will suffer a 12-hour
power cut three times a week beginning January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
But hospitals and other essential consumers will not be
affected.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Leaders Call for International Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) leaders today condemned all aspects of terrorism and
violence and called for international efforts to fight against
them.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique issued at the end of a three-day annual
summit here, the leaders expressed regret over the fact that "some
states are giving refuge to certain terrorist elements under the
pretext of human right protection."
</P>
<P>
They called for the "differentiation between human rights and
the acts committed by these elements against states and human
alike."
</P>
<P>
Without naming the states that are hiding terrorists, the
leaders appealed to them to act against the use of their lands and
laws by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the adoption of an international treaty to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981, the GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates in an economic and
political alliance.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the GCC leaders rejected and denounced
"European Parliament and other international organizations and
agencies' interference in the judicial system of GCC states."
</P>
<P>
They considered the move as "unacceptable interference in GCC
internal affairs which could encourage crime and terrorist acts
and accordingly affect security and stability."
</P>
<P>
On November 23, the GCC interior ministers rejected the
European Union allegations of "human rights violations in
Bahrain," where the authorities were able to contain a series of
subversive acts since the start of this year.

<HEADLINE> New York City Sees Growing Traffic Congestion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Booming tourism and strong
economy have added more traffic jams to the New York City,
especially its commercial heart of Manhattan area.
</P>
<P>
Total traffic from neighboring New Jersey State rose 5 percent
from 1996 to a record number of 85.2 million vehicle crossings
this year, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from Manhatan's 16,464 parking meters also saw a record
surge of 18.8 percent to 22.39 million U.S. dollars in 1997, plus
a revenue growth of 16 percent to 6.5 million dollars in the
city's public parking lots, not taking into account private
parking income.
</P>
<P>
The "too many cars for too few streets" scene has caused the
traffic congestion a worsening problem. Statistics show that
midtown city streets have seen an unprecedented slow traffic
averaging 6.2 miles an hour this year.
</P>
<P>
Traffic violations have soared with 20,437 summons issued and
755 cars towed since Thanksgiving this year.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, city transportation authorities have
made a number of proposals, such as engaging more use of railroads
and subways.
</P>
<P>
A new subway fare system was introduced early this month to
attract more public transport commuters and reduce the car traffic
volume.

JERUSALEM, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Facing an unemployment
crisis in the country, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
today promised more jobs for the unemployed workers when he
visited the town of Ofakim in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu presented a plan for the immediate employment of 300
jobless in Ofakim, the town with the highest unemployment rate in
the country, which was estimated at 20 percent, Israel Radio

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that the government will consider a series
of proposals to generate extra jobs for unemployed workers. Among
proposals being considered are expanding existing factories and
relocating factories from the center of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Israel's unemployment has
risen continually. And its third-quarter unemployment had jumped
to 8.1 percent, the highest rate in three-and-a-half year.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said today that the United States sees Turkey as an
important strategic partner, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remark upon his arrival at the Ankara
Airport following his official visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. clearly expressed that it regards Turkey as a
strategic partner and is aware of Turkey's importance in the
region," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this approach, the U.S. administration is
willing to cooperate with Turkey in the fields of politics,
economy, trade as well as defense, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister said that the two countries will
also join hands to transport the Caspian oil and natural gas
to the European markets.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the United States signed a memorandum of
understanding on cooperation on energy issues during Yilmaz's
visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other
senior officials on bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
A political consultation mechanism which deals with bilateral,
regional and international issues has been set up between the
two foreign ministries, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's visit to Washington came following the European
Union (EU) announcement that Turkey would not be included in the
present EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the Turkish government hopes that
the Clinton administration would exert pressure on the EU on
Turkey's membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
has been a close ally of the United States in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Sign Declaration of Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Warring factions of Somalia
today signed their most comprehensive ever peace deal to end the
six-year-old conflicts among them.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing Somali Declaration of Principles signed here
also envisages the setting up of a federal government.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed by leaders of the two most powerful
factions, namely Hussein Mohammed Aidid from the Somali National
Alliance, and Ali Mahdi Mohammed from the 26-faction National
Salvation Council, calls for Somalia's independence, integrity and
security and the formation of a federal government.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony at Egypt's Foreign Ministry was attended
by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid and a representative of the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to hold a National Reconciliation Conference
in the Somali central city of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The 465-member conference, which will be the biggest gathering
of the factions in years, is supposed to set up a 13-member
presidential council to select a president and a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Somali faction leaders began talks on November 12 to try to
find a solution to their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
If the declaration works, it will help form the first central
government in Somalia since the 1991 ouster of the late president
Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Since then Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected
by faction leaders to fight to expand their turfs. The factional
fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has claimed about 300,000
lives.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, PNA Condemn Israel's Claim for West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) today refuted Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's recent claim that the West Bank was part of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel had no right in deciding the fate of the West
Bank and changing the map of the occupied land because this
kind of practice was against all the agreements signed between
Israel and the Palestinians, according to a statement issued
after a meeting of top officials from Jordan and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's claim was adverse and rejected and no party was
eligible to do so, said Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Fayez Tarawneh after attending the meeting between Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali and visiting Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the Madrid conference and the Oslo
accords that no party could decide the fate of the occupied
land alone, Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
All sides should respect the terms of signed agreements and
this was the basis for Israel and the Palestinians to solve their
problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat confirmed that the Palestinians were keen on
putting the peace process back on track by applying all the
agreements signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's recent claim of the West Bank as part of
Israeli territory destroyed the peace process, said Erekat who
is here to brief Jordan on the recent development of the
peace process on the Israeli-Palestinian track.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1997 - a Gloomy Year for Thailand (1)  by Yu Zuncheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand got a "black"
Christmas present this year: its foreign currency credit rating
was downgraded from Baa3 to Ba1.
</P>
<P>
The new rating announced Monday by U.S.-based international
rating agency Moody's Investors Service means that Thailand's
foreign currency ceiling for bonds and notes is lowered to junk
bond status.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to reduce inflows of foreign capital into
the country and limit the chances of Thai banks and finance
companies to raise funds from foreign sources, prolonging the
country's liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
Although the downgrading was not something unexpected, its
timing will certainly make Thailand's money market and stock
exchange more bearish towards the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the outgoing year, things have been moving from bad to worse
on the economic front,
</P>
<P>
First, the property market showed signs of severe stagnation
because of a massive oversupply of office, business and housing
space. Property developers were unable to sell their buildings to
pay their debts which they had borrowed from banks and finance
companies.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers' insolvency has caused grave liquidity
crunch to banks, in particular finance companies. In the early
1990s, when property development was booming, many financial
institutions lent money to developers of risky projects because of
the attraction of high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity problems in the financial sector led to the
suspension of 58 finance companies in June and August by the
administration of Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The move affected the
livelihood and interests of thousands of white-collar employees
and depositors and clients.
</P>
<P>
Second, when foreign money speculators launched repeated
attacks on the weakening Thai currency, the Chavalit government
did not take any action early enough to prevent the assaults.
</P>
<P>
The Chavalit cabinet, which was forced to resign last month due
to failure to solve the country's intricate economic problems, was
much blamed for two blunders.
</P>
<P>
One mistake was that it allowed the central bank to spend more
than 430 billion baht (about 16.86 billion U.S. dollars) of public
money early this year to bail out, in vain, the struggling private
finance companies.
</P>
<P>
Of the 58 suspended finance companies, 56 were proved hopeless
and were ordered early this month to close down.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1997 - a Gloomy Year for Thailand (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another big mistake the Chavalit administration made was that
it failed to monitor the central bank's operation, which resulted
in the loss of 23.4 billion dollars in foreign reserves to defend
the baht, also to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, on July 2, the government had to announce that
the baht was allowed to float and find its own value against major
foreign currencies on the market.
</P>
<P>
But the floatation was too late, financial analysts said. If
the baht had been floated eight months earlier, the country could
have saved 40 billion dollars in international reserves and may
not have needed to seek assistance, under very strict conditions,
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which agreed in August
to arrange a 17.2 billion dollar bailout package for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
From August when IMF assistance was requested, Thailand will
need to draw 9 billion dollars from the package by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Since Chuan Leekpai became the new prime minister last month,
because of international and domestic factors, things have not
improved much: the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index has kept
falling, and the baht further depreciated.
</P>
<P>
The SET index fell about 50 percent from the beginning of the
year to hover around 370 points this week. And by Monday, the baht
had lost 78 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have been shut down; factories have closed;
workers have been laid off; production costs and consumer prices
have soared.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, which is known as "the land of smiles," the
grinning will not be natural as the new year is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai has promised to the nation that despite the
negative elements, the overall economic situation will begin to
improve in the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
He may have reasons to say so: the depreciated baht is expected
to help boost exports and attract more foreign tourists; the IMF
fund will help strengthen the country's foreign reserves and
restructure the financial and industrial sectors; austerity
measures have been adopted; the government budget has been greatly
axed and many short-term foreign debts have been rolled over.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chuan Leekpai and his party appear to be more
popular with the public, for their better images and stronger team
to tackle economic woes.
</P>
<P>
But given the present situation, the Chuan administration has a
rough way to go before confidence is restored in the local
economy.

<HEADLINE> China To Establish Investment/Fund-raising System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China will place priority on
restructuring its investment and fund-raising system in 1998, as
well as on establishing internationally accepted system which
accords with the socialist market economy and separates the
functions of government from that of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haoruo, vice-minister of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, made the remarks today during the
ongoing national economic restructuring conference.
</P>
<P>
The central government will further define the responsibilities
of governments, enterprises and banks in the projected system,
establish financial risk prevention mechanisms, cultivate the
capital market, allow more enterprises the right to raise funds
directly from society, and improve government macro-control and
administration over investment and fund-raising activities,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China continues to lag behind in reform of its investment and
fund-raising system. Therefore, Chinese leaders consider
establishing a system in this regard, which separates the
functions of government from that of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Henceforth, governments at all levels will mainly invest in
public welfare projects and infrastructure, but not in competitive
projects under most circumstances, said Zhang, adding that
government-funded projects must be financed by noncommercial banks
or state-owned investment companies in the form of holding shares.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises will be the major investors in competitive
projects, and will be responsible for feasibility studies,
fund-raising, construction, and operations. Enterprises will be
required to apply for bank loans or obtain funding directly from
the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Banks will conduct investment assessments, make ensuing
decisions and bear risk, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels will divert a certain portion of
state capital from competitive projects and infrastructure to the
projects in public welfare, science, technology, and
education. Non-governmental projects will need no approval of but
registration with governments.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to promote the major investor system and
invite consortia of major investors for projects.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that industrial policies and market information will
guide investment projects, and that governments at various
levels will regularly publish lists of which projects they are
encouraging, permitting, limiting, or prohibiting.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on UN to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz today called on the U.N. Security Council to lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq immediately, Iraq News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
This was Iraq's first reaction to a Security Council statement
passed Monday, which urged Iraq to fully cooperate with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and allow arms inspectors to
enter any sites at any time.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the statement reflected once again the blackmail
exercised by the U.S. with the aim of inducing the council to
adopt unobjective and unbalanced attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He accused Washington of seeking to divert attention from the
essential issue, namely lifting the embargo laid on Iraq, to a
minor issue forced by it in collaboration with some elements of
the U.N. arms inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Following UNSCOM's Chairman Richard Butler's recent visit to
Baghdad, Aziz said, American inspector Scott Ritter made over the
past few days 14 inspections of a number of sites, including some
previously inspected sites, without finding anything banned.
</P>
<P>
This exposed the falsehood of the UNSCOM's allegations that
Iraq conceals banned weapons, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi deputy prime minister called on the Security Council
to ask the UNSCOM about the source of its information which he

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ministers Take Inspection Tour of West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet ministers
led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a helicopter tour
of the West Bank today to review first-hand issues connected with
further redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy and Agriculture Minister Rafael
Eitan boycotted the tour for different reasons. National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who has presented his map
on the further redeployment and final settlement with the
Palestinians, served the tour guide.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, accompanied by senior army officers, flew in a
helicopter over the Jerusalem area, the Green Line (1949
armistice line) area and other strategic areas in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai showed the ministers areas
demarcated by his two maps presented to the cabinet, one on
Israeli military red lines and the other on Israeli national
interests.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret over boycott of the tour by Eitan who
protested what he called "political involvement" of the army in
drawing up a map on the further redeployment and permanent
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sided with Mordechai in countering Eitan's accusation
of the defense establishment for its role in drawing up the map. He
said the army only provided professional advice on the issues.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Sharon complained about outside pressure on
Israel to complete drawing up the map by January 15. He noted that
such crucial issues for Israel should not be dealt with haste.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the United States which has
demanded the Israeli government to come out with a credible
decision as soon as possible in order to advance the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sharon and Mordechai differed on the size of two planned
security zones to be built along the Green Line and the Jordan
Valley, which are designed to protect Israel's future
safety. Mordechai, supported by Levy, favors reducing the width
of the security zones in order to avoid rejection by the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, the ministerial committee, which comprises
Netanyahu, Mordechai, Levy and Sharon, reconvened to further
discuss the remaining issues concerning the further redeployment
and permanent talks. The committee has already held four
sessions, but failed to reach a final solution.

<P>
SHENZHEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-based Shenzhen
businesses were urged today to take an active part in the
international economic cooperation and market competition for the
sake of the city.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong, is the country's first special
economic zone and the city today called a conference on the work
of its overseas-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
This means that overseas-based companies should engage more in
international co-operation and market competition to speed up
economic development in this south China city, which will select
as many as eight large pilot companies to develop multinational
business and give them preferential treatment in funding,
export quotas, and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The city will also overhaul poorly-run overseas-based
companies, closing down those in the red.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has 212 overseas-based companies in 32 countries, that
are engaged in trade, industry, transport, real estate, tourism,
finance, and consultation.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shenzhen's businesses have opened companies in
emerging markets in Africa, the Common Wealth of Independent
States, South America, and Eastern Europe, to promote the export
of technology, equipment, and other products.
</P>
<P>
A local official predicts that it will have 43.3 billion US
dollars worth of trade this year, 11 percent more than last year,
or one-seventh of China's total.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreigners Confident About Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners in Hong Kong are
satisfied with the current situation and confident in the future
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half a year after it returned to China on July 1, Hong
Kong is still running as usual, foreign businessmen, diplomats,
scholars and journalists said in their interviews with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A representative of a major Japanese skin-care products
producer said that he likes to work in Hong Kong although there
exists keen competition among world known brands here.
</P>
<P>
Satoshi Hirota, chief representative of Japan's Shiseido
Company Limited, said that Hong Kong offers the fairest
competition environment in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy is as free as it was before, Hirota said.
Neither the collapse of Yaohan nor the expansion of Shiseido in
Hong Kong has anything to do with the handover, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hirota's view was shared by many foreign businessmen in Hong
Kong. Most of the member companies of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) plan to expand their business.
</P>
<P>
A recent AmCham Business Confidence Survey reflected a positive
outlook for the SAR's business environment against the background
of recent financial turbulence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Henk, chairman of the AmCham, said that the high-level
confidence is directly related to the smooth transition and
political stability, sound economic fundamentals, and an overall
improvement in U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He said there are five favorable factors of doing business in
Hong Kong -- geographic location, communications network,
infrastructure, free port and taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss people and enterprises express their strong
confidence in the future of Hong Kong in another way.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Swiss Consulate-General in Hong Kong organized
a month-long promotion entitled "Switzerland Greets Hong Kong,"
which showed the Hong Kong people Switzerland's business,
tourism, culture, gastronomy, arts and music.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Bodenmuller, Switzerland's consul-general to Hong Kong,
said that the current situation in Hong Kong is much better than
what people had expected nearly half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Henk and Bodenmuller, who have been in Hong Kong for 11
and three years respectively, said they saw no sign of
interference from Beijing in the operation of the government of
the SAR and people in Hong Kong are still leading their lives in
the way they are used to.
</P>
<P>
They are confident about Hong Kong's prospect though they
predicted that Hong Kong's stock market will continue to be
volatile for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Michael Degolyer, an American scholar at the Hong Kong Baptist
University, held similar views. He said that in the recent
regional financial turmoil, Hong Kong has done much better than
other Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Degolyer said that the good performance against the backdrop of
the regional jitters should be owed to a good system Hong Kong has
built up.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's system is a reforming system. Problems arise and
Hong Kong learns to solve the problems. This is the proper way of
doing things," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He was excited about the prospects of Hong Kong: "China is set
to grow and Hong Kong has a position of growth leadership in
China's economic development."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreigners Confident About Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Dodwell, who co-authored the influential book "The Hong
Kong Advantage" before Hong Kong's historic handover, said that
the recent Asia financial turmoil illustrated just how flexible
Hong Kong's economy is.
</P>
<P>
"It takes shocks very directly, deals with the shocks, absorbs
the shocks and repositions to where it's on. Much more quickly
than the other economies do," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The convincible study of the book "The Hong Kong Advantage"
dispersed doomsday myth that "Hong Kong is over." As the book
points out, Hong Kong's core strength lies in its immense
flexibility, a wide spread of economic activities, and a wide
spectrum of markets.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is luckily placed to have good strong business links
with the Chinese mainland to give it an extra area of business
activities to keep the economy robust," he reiterated a unique
advantage mentioned in the book.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Hayhoe, director of the Hong Kong Institute of Education,
looked at Hong Kong's return to China from a different angle.
</P>
<P>
Hayhoe, a Canadian who came to Hong Kong 30 years ago, said
that Hong Kong's young people now have a new opportunity to get to
know the remarkable civilization of China after Hong Kong returned
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the past the people in Hong Kong were largely restricted to
a small place with no national identity and they have a very
interesting task now to redevelop their identity, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hong Kong would have a very positive future
because it has demonstrated the economic and social vitality that
can result from an effective integration of aspects of Western and
Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sinclair, a columnist for the South China Morning Post,
said that Hong Kong's social outlook is good because Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa and his colleagues are determined to make
life better for the average person.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, who was born in New Zealand and came to Hong Kong in
1968, said that the determination and efficiency with which the
government officials have shown they will keep the peg with the
U.S. dollar has been very effective in stopping the economy from
suffering more.
</P>
<P>
"We have a marvelous team in our government and civil service,
all of them dedicated to making sure Hong Kong remains a wonderful
place to live," said Sinclair, who got his permanent Identity Card
of the HKSAR last month.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said he has decided to spend the rest of his life in
Hong Kong because there is a good future for his family and
himself here.
</P>
<P>
However, not all the foreigners want to stay longer in Hong
Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Shaver, a photographer of the Agence France-Presse
(AFP) Hong Kong bureau, who came to Hong Kong three years ago for
the handover, said that he has decided to leave Hong Kong because
the situation in Hong Kong is too stable to make any news.
</P>
<P>
Being stable is good for citizens and businessmen but not so
good for journalists, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientific Research Creates 100 Billion Yuan Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's State Science and
Technology Commission's (SSTC) scientific research programs helped
create nearly 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) in output
value in agriculture and industry in the first year of the ninth
five-year plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily said that since 1996, China's research
programs have focused on agricultural growth, and improving
industrial and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted an SSTC official as saying that more than 600
developments or products were patented in 1996, and that since
then, China has developed a hundred high-yield, high-quality
varieties of grain, and that computer-aided design has been
growing in use in 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese computers now have 50 percent of the

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Criticizes Investment Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Agriculture Minister
Issa Kalantari has urged investment in the country's relatively
backward agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Today's local daily Hamshahri quoted Kalantari as saying at a
ceremony for model farmers Monday that investment in the sector
showed a drop of 2.7 percent than that of eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the country's investors did not
involve in the agricultural sector effectively and conditioned
their investment in the sector on receipt of subsidies and credit
facilities from the government.
</P>
<P>
No one has the intention to put his investment on agriculture
unless the government pledges to compensate for half of the
losses, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He termed the situation of investment in agriculture as "very
serious," saying that because of shortage of necessary investment,
only one fifth of the country's tractor-manufacturing capacities
are in use, the aqueducts can not be revived and the drainage
system can not be put to use.
</P>
<P>
So it is necessary for the government and parliament to take
measures to ensure the security of the investment in the sector,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry is determined to improve the quality
and quantity of crops, he added.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural output constitutes about 30 percent of the gross
domestic product and only meets about 60 percent of the needs of
food in the country. About 40 percent of the country's 67 million
population are involved in agriculture.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday urged Bosnian leaders in
Sarajevo to do their part in creating peace in their war-ravaged
country. He then visited a military base in Tuzla and praised
American soldiers for their role as peacekeepers in an ongoing
mission which he intends to extend.
</P>
<P>
-- A new survey suggested that, despite the exhortations of
President Vaclav Havel, fewer than half of Czechs surveyed support
NATO membership for their country. The results, described by a
Clinton Administration official as "not helpful," showed 42.8
percent of citizens supporting membership in the western alliance,
26.7 percent opposed and the remaining 30.5 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Formerly classified film showing a parachutist with a
so-called Special Atomic Demolition Munition was among formerly
classified material concerning atomic weapons, including hundreds
of thousands of pages of documents, released Monday by Energy
Secretary Federico Pena as part of a Clinton Administration program
announced four years ago to introduce greater openness on atomic
matters.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Federal agents have arrested the president of a small
southern garment-manufacturing firm on alien-smuggling charges
after breaking up a ring that recruited workers inside Mexico,
moved them illegally across the U.S. border and delivered them to
factories in Georgia and Alabama, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council demanded that Iraq allow U.N. arms
inspectors into all suspected weapons sites, saying failure to do
so was "unacceptable." The statement mentioned no measures to
force Baghdad to allow inspections of Saddam Hussein's palaces.
Separately, Persian Gulf nations urged Iraq to comply with
inspections.
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey ordered a Greek diplomatic aide expelled on suspicion
of espionage, and Athens said it was responding in kind, further
worsening relations between the two NATO members. Separately,
Turkey, Israel and the U.S. said they would hold joint naval
exercises, their first, off Israel next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), meeting today with Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko, said the NPC places great importance on relations
with the Ukrainian Parliament, the Supreme Soviet.
</P>
<P>
Interparliamentary contacts are an important part of bilateral

<P>
China appreciates the Ukrainian government's efforts in
promoting relations with China, and the two countries have built a
system of trust, economic co-operation, and mutual support in
international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko said that Ukraine emphasizes relations with China

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Condemns Leftist Rebels' Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Tuesday accused leftist rebels of violating their own
ceasefire declaration and urged them to release 22 hostages they
have taken.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to the raids conducted by the New People's
Army (NPA) recently in two remote villages in the southern city of
Davao.
</P>
<P>
He called on the NPA "to respect their own ceasefire
declaration" and "not let the Christmas season be spoiled by their
offensive operations."
</P>
<P>
NPA guerrillas attacked two villages in Paquibato district,
some 60 kilometers from Davao city, and seized 22 members of the
Civilian Armed Force Geographical Unit last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has declared a ceasefire during the Christmas season
and the military has also announced suspension of military
operation for 30 days during the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the militiamen were in their localities observing
the ceasefire when they were seized by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Ramos ordered Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines, to pursue the rebels and "to make sure
that the communities are safe in that area."
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, this is the attack by the NPA group that did not
respect their own unilateral ceasefire," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has fought the government for more than three decades
and still has a presence in many hinterland areas in the country.

<HEADLINE> hke - German Real Estate Giant Sentenced Six Years' Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- German real estate tycoon Juergen
Schneider was sentenced by a Frankfurt court to six years and nine
months in prison Tuesday for fraud leading to the biggest real
estate bankruptcy in postwar Germany.
</P>
<P>
The term was exactly one year less than what the prosecution
had demanded last week for Schneider, 63, who was found guilty of
five counts of serious fraud.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the milder verdict, the judge said that Schneider's
conduct had been partly provoked and facilitated by the
"incredible negligence" of the country's lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
Schneider was found presenting faked documents to seek bank
loans before the multi-billion U.S. dollar collapse of his company
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the five cases of fraud he was charged with, Schneider
obtained 165 million marks (93 million dollars) in credits.
</P>
<P>
At the height of his business, Schneider was involved in
prime-location real estate projects in 14 cities, building luxury
hotels, office buildings and shopping arcades. His company based
near Frankfurt once owned 168 real estate properties.
</P>
<P>
Most of the assets has been sold, leaving some 2.6 billion mark
of the total 5.4 billion mark debts uncovered when Schneider and
his wife Claudia suddenly went missing in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
They were found living in Florida, the United States, 13 months
later and were extradited to Germany in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Besides the fraud case, Schneider and his wife are also facing
possible separate legal proceedings for fraudulent bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Will Continue in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ye Zhen, spokesman for
China's State Statistics Bureau, said that the strong economic
growth will continue next year and that China will realize its
overall economic development goal this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Ye said that basic industries and
infrastructure, which have been a bottleneck in the economy, will
not have a negative effect next year because of development in
the energy, transportation, telecommunications, and materials
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, China has become a buyer's
market for consumer products, and the supply of production goods
and materials has also topped the demand.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural products have been increasing this year, allowing
a stablizing of product prices while keeping economic growth high.
</P>
<P>
Ye told Xinhua that China's inflation rate and prices of
consumer goods will remain at the lowest level of the 1990s this
year, leaving much room to co-ordinate economic growth and stable
consumer products, which can improve China's macro-economic
control measures and readjust its economic structure next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the average growth of world
economies will be about 3.5 percent next year, which creates a
favorable external environment for China's economy.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has lowered its
interest rate three times since the beginning of last year, to
relieve the burden on state-owned enterprises, and stimulate the
market.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the interest rate cut has proven to be successful,
and suggests that the Chinese government is quick to respond to
market fluctuations with macro-economic controls.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Barred from Entering Iraq Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A much-expected Russian
attempt to break the flight ban on Iraq has been thwarted by the
Iranian authorities, reliable Iraqi sources told Xinhua News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
A airplane chartered by the Russian Liberal Democratic Party
and bound for Baghdad was barred by Iran from entering Iraq
through Iran's airspace.
</P>
<P>
The plane was due to arrive at the Saddam International Airport
Sunday with 20 LDP representatives in the State Duma (lower house
of the parliament) and some specialists on board.
</P>
<P>
Saad Qassem Hamoudi, chairman of the Arab and International
Relations Committee of Iraq's National Assembly (parliament), was
awaiting the plane's arrival Monday at the airport.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters the Russian flight came on an initiative made
by LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky during his visit to Baghdad
early this month.
</P>
<P>
Hamoudi described the Russian flight as a "courageous and bold"
move worth appreciation, and as a practical break of the embargo
laid on Iraq for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Commercial flights are banned to and from Iraq except with
U.N. approval. Hamoudi said that instead of asking the U.N. for
approval of the flight, the Russian party applied to Iran and
Azerbaijan, whose airspaces the plane would pass through, for
approval.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane, which belongs to a Russian non-governmental
company, was due to leave Russia on December 19 but its flight was
delayed because of the need to get approvals from Iran and
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky had strongly denounced the U.N. embargo
during his visit to Baghdad, affirming that his party stands by
the Iraqi people who are suffering from the sanctions imposed
following Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi sources, the Russian airplane is not
likely to arrive at the Saddam International Airport today, and it
is still unknown whether the plane is still in Iran or it has
returned to Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese auditors have saved
the state 92 billion yuan (about 11 billion US dollars) over the
past five years, State Councilor Li Guixian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li told an annual national conference on auditing that the
auditors turned over to the state 38 billion yuan (about 4.6
billion US dollars) collected from revenues and expenditures
against state regulations, saved six billion yuan (about 723
million US dollars) in state appropriation, and recovered 47
billion yuan (about 5.7 billion US dollars) from misappropriated
funds.
</P>
<P>
He urged auditing departments, having played an important role
in saving money for the state, increasing macro-economic control,
and promoting the campaign for a cleaner government, to better
carry out the Auditing Law and the Regulations on Carrying Out the
Auditing Law.
</P>
<P>
The regulations issued last October enhanced the authority of
auditing departments, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This is beneficial to auditing departments to do their jobs
independently and in accordance with law, and require a higher
standard for their work with a view to their increased
responsibilities defined by the regulations," he said.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Speed Skating
Federation said here on Tuesday it had appealed against a possible
lifetime ban on skater Svetlana Fedotkina who refused an
out-of-competition doping test in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Komarov, president of the Russian federation, argued
that no one could ask Fedotkina to undergo tests for it is against
the rules since she had been suspended and is not a competing
skater.
</P>
<P>
Fedotkina, the silver medalist in the 1,500 meters at the 1994
Lillehammer Olympics, has been serving a two-year suspension for
using anabolic steroids, which runs to January 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
She may face a lifelong suspension as her refusal is considered
a repeated offence under the rules of the International
Speedskating Union (ISU).
</P>

ISU spokesman Fabrice Prahin said earlier in Lausanne that the
union is in the process of reviewing the case.

efforts to earnestly implement existing agreements and actively
seek new spheres and avenues for cooperation.

<HEADLINE> License Required for Import &AMP; Export of CD Making Equipment in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The new requirement that
licenses are needed for the importation into or exportation from
Hong Kong of equipment for manufacturing optical disks including
compact disks will become effective from next Monday, it was
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new requirement under the Import and Export (General)
Regulations is aimed at preventing Hong Kong from becoming a haven
for the manufacture of pirated optical disks," said a spokesman of
Hong Kong's Trade and Industrial Bureau Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new measure will discourage the smuggling of optical disk
manufacturing equipment into or out of Hong Kong. It will also
enable Customs officers to better trace the origin and destination
of legally imported equipment and facilitate the development of
intelligence on suspected copyright piracy activities, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who imports into or exports from Hong Kong optical
manufacturing equipment without a valid license commits an offense
and will be liable to a maximum fine of two million HK dollars
(about 256,000 U.S. dollars) and an imprisonment of up to seven
years.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Declaration Wins Widespread Support in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo Declaration
reached by the main Somali factions last night has won widespread
support among the social groups and people in the streets of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohamed Moallim Hassan, the most prominent religious
leader in Somalia has welcomed the agreement with happiness and
joy, considering the results of the six-week talks as "the first
light of peace for Somalia."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan further said he would remind the factions that
all agreements should be based on the Islamic law or Sharia.
</P>
<P>
People of Mogadishu were today talking much about the
agreement. Newspapers gave a huge coverage to the historic event
in Cairo last night.
</P>
<P>
Xog-Ogaal Daily described the accord as "a great victory" via
unforgettable negotiations. Another weekly, The Horn of Africa,
which supports Hussein Mohamed Aidid, ran an article entitled
"you better be provoked instead of provoking," -- a Somali
proverb meaning that one should retreat from his desires for the
common good.
</P>
<P>
Hawo Mohamed Ossoble, chairlady of the Mogadishu-based Somali
Women's Democratic Organization, said the Somali mothers are
happy and confident of the "agreement of principles" issued in
Cairo last night.
</P>
<P>
"We'll get ready for the participation of the meeting in mid
February in Baidoa," she said, calling on the faction leaders not
to ignore the role of the Somali women in future administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the political leaders in Mogadishu have
expressed their strong support to the outcome of the meeting. For
example, the Secretary General of Osman Ali Atto's faction, Abdi
Hassan Awale Qeybdid, has also labeled the meeting as a gorgeous
one.
</P>
<P>
Qeybdid thanked the Egyptian government for its "brotherhood"
concern over the Somali crises. Cairo mediated among the factions
and sponsored the meeting to achieve reconciliation in Somalia
which is one of the Arab League members.
</P>
<P>
"I see this agreement as a solution in regaining the dignity
of Somalia," said the Information Secretary of Ali Mahdi's
faction, Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kadare. "I don't believe that any
reasoning mind would oppose this agreement," he added, "it's a
bridge for a better future."
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Agreement demands that a government with a 13-member
presidential council be formed with a president, and a prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed upon the formation of a 189-member
constituent assembly and an independent judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Although two Somali politicians have walked out of the meeting
in its last days, this agreement has the support of the vast
majority of Somalia. The quitters, General Adan Abdullahi Nur
Gabyow and Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf, were being represented by
their colleagues who signed the pact.
</P>
<P>
On February 15 next year, 465 delegates will go to the
southwestern town of Baidoa for a national reconciliation
conference where a future interim government will be announced, a
good final test for the faction leaders of Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Survey Bulletin of China's Township Industrial Polluters",
jointly released by the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA), the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and
the State Statistical Bureau, points to the fact that township
industrial pollution has emerged a major problem in environmental
protection efforts and an important factor affecting the health
and well-being of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Steps must be taken, management must be strengthened, and
spending must be increased to improve the country's pollution
control capacity," according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin points out that China has more than 1.2 million
township industrial polluters, mainly in the non-metallic mineral
products, textile, food processing, metallic products, chemical
and machine-building sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong and Guangdong provinces have the
vast majority of developed township industries.
</P>
<P>
Said enterprises discharged 5.9 billion tons of wastewater in
1995, in the level of organic pollutants hitting 6.11 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In terms of industrial waste gas emissions, the volume of
sulphur dioxide was 4.41 million tons, the figure for smoke and dust
stood at 8.5 million tons, and suspended particles in the form of
industrial waste was over 13 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The level of solid wastes stood at 180 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of organic pollutants in wastewater, smoke and dust,
suspended particles from industrial waste and solid waste
discharged by the township businesses accounted for over 50
percent of the national total, according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
China carried out a township industrial polluter survey from
January 1996 to December 1997, the most extensive survey of its
kind in history. Data obtained the survey covering 1995 will be
used as a criterion for the country's pollution control program.
</P>
<P>
China plans, by the year 2000, to maintain major pollutant
emissions around levels for the year 1995.

</P>
<P>
Uugbo promised to provide on a daily basis the latest
development in the investigation of the foiled coup involving
Nigeria's second man, Chief of General Staff Oladip Diya and 11
others.
</P>
<P>
according to the spokesman, a panel of security officers and
civilians is carrying out the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Director of Defense Information said that the
police has beefed up security throughout the country, but he
refuted allegations that heavily armed soldiers have been
deployed in barracks and other sensitive places.
</P>
<P>
The coup plot has become focus of talks among people in Lagos,
many of whom said the news came as shock to them.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when i heared it from the BBC Monday morning,"
said a driver in a Lagos car marketing company.
</P>
<P>
The driver said he could not understand why Diya, who as the
country's number two citizen is powerful and rich enough, would
do such thing.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper correspondant shared the similar view,
saying that he was puzzled with the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Coup is a serious thing. The government would not play with
it. But why Diya did it since he should know the result quite
clearly," the reporter said.
</P>
<P>
For diplomats, they are busy with getting details of the
happening and analyzing its implications toward to the country's
on-going transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
But under the government's firm information control, what is
generally accepted among them at the moment is that the event
must be the result of struggle for power within the military
government.
</P>
<P>
To avoid misinformation of the public, Nigeria has tightened
control of information, according to the country's new Minister
of Information and Culture, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who was sworn in along with 32 other fellow
ministers five days ago, said on Monday that the government would
not tolerate any action capable of disturbing national security.
</P>
<P>
Making it clearer to journalists, Ugbo told them to be
cautious in their reports on the coup plot.
</P>
<P>
Quoting from foreign media without confirmation is unaccetable
especially when investigations are going on, said the
defense spokesman.
</P>
<P>
As to Anthony Onyearugbulem, the military administrator of
Ondo State in southwest Nigeria, civil servants in the state are
not allowed to comment on the alleged coup plot for subversion,
the Punch newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "purely a military affair", the navy
commander threatened: "I will try you. I will crush you for
subservion, if you talk on what you don't know."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a top government officials at a meeting on Monday,
he also cautioned the state-owned media stations, urging them to
exercise restraint on airing people's views on the alleged coup
plot.
</P>
<P>
While some political parties rise to condemn the alleged coup
plot, human rights and pro-democracy groups are demanding for
more details of the event and fair, open trial.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission (embassy) also echoed the demand,
saying that "it is important those arrested are treated in
accordance with due judicial process."

<HEADLINE> Reactions Differ in S.Leone Concerning Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Reactions by both Nigerians
and Sierra Leoneans to the announced coup plot in Nigeria
gathered momentum in Freetown today due to Nigeria's intensive
political involvement in Sierra Lwone's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Nigerian troops are now in Sierra Leone and aided
by Nigerian air force Alfa jets and tanks, monitoring sanctions
and embargo imposed by west African leaders since July against
the military junta to return constitutional order to the deposed
civilian government by April next year.
</P>
<P>
"Abacha (the Nigerian head of state) is at it again to silence
all opposition to his one man, strong rule" said a Nigerian
trader, while a retired Sierra Leonean banker called the alleged
plot "a gimmick to divert attention from Nigeria's chronic
political and economic problems."
</P>
<P>
"The development is an attempt to forestall a return to
democratic rule according to Abacha's transitional program," said
a Freetown lawer.
</P>
<P>
Others said the development "is to throw dust into our eyes
while he (Abacha) goes on to snatch victory in next year's
presidential election as a civilian candidate."
</P>
<P>
A university lecturer back from a sabbatical at the University
of Lagos wonders whether "if the coup had succeeded, there would
have been an ECOMOG military build-up in Nigeria just like what
is currently happening in Sierra Leone ?"
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian foreign currency exchange dealer said he was
"totally disgusted" over the many coups and counter coups in
Nigeria and the "many military officers who would be facing the
firing squad or lengthy jail sentences" and wondered "what will
it all end up to."
</P>
<P>
Some Nigerians said frankly that "they would rather hold their
views privately fearing reprisals when they decide to return
home" while others shrugged their shoulders saying they are
"plainly not interested."
</P>
<P>
The military junta has so far not commented on the development
in Nigeria but the state run radio and TV continued to give the
news top priority.
</P>
<P>
The privately owned FM 103 radio station which is sympathetic
to the junta called the alleged plot "a forecast of doom to
Abacha's rule."

<HEADLINE> Nonferrous Metals Industry Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China's nonferrous metals
industry, the world's second largest in terms of output following
the United States, has had 15 consecutive years of growth.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released during the industry's national
conference held here today, China is expected to produce 5.3
million tons of 10 types of nonferrous metals in high demand,
including 1.05 million tons of copper, 600,000 tons of lead and
1.35 million tons of zinc.
</P>
<P>
Since May, subsidiaries of the China National Nonferrous Metals
Industry Corp., which operated in the red during the first four
months of the year, have reduced losses on a monthly basis,
according Yang Guang, assistant general manager of the
corporation. He also noted that the profitability of subsidiaries
has further improved.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries are expected to earn profits totaling 100
million yuan and pay taxes of over 2.7 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that progress has been made in enterprises reform and
noted that three enterprises which were listed on the stock
exchange earlier this year raised a total of 2.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the corporation's imports and exports for
the year to hit 1.8 billion US dollars, with exports ending the
year at 1.3 billion US dollars. The corporation won contracts for
18 overseas projects valued at 500 million US dollars during the
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the corporation invested over 200 million yuan in
prospecting projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, its proven reserves of copper reached 300,000 tons;
bauxite 23.6 million tons; gold 40 tons; silver 1,246 tons; and
stibium 68,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Relief Funds Total 4.4 Billion Yuan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Central and local governments,
as well as various social circles, provided over 4.4 billion yuan
(about 530 million US dollars) in disaster relief funds during 1997,
according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30-40 million people in areas struck by disasters
received assistance, according to Li Bengong, director of the
ministry's disaster relief department.
</P>
<P>
The central government appropriated 2.2 billion yuan for
disaster relief during 1997, with local governments providing 1.2
billion yuan, and people of various social circles donating cash and
materials valued at one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li announced the figures at a conference of directors of
provincial civil affairs departments held in Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
When compared to previous years, China suffered from a
relatively moderate scale of disasters during 1997, with the most
serious problems occurring in areas suffering from drought.
</P>
<P>
Between July and September this year, more than a dozen
provinces, including Henan in central China, Shandong in east
China, and various provinces in north China suffered from the
worst droughts in decades.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's precipitation levels for last fall were the lowest
since 1904. Drought conditions were even worse in coastal cities
such as Yantai, Weihai, Qingdao and Rizhao, all of which witnessed
plummeting grain harvests and withering fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, saltwater encroached on the underground water
table creating saline conditions affecting the land and causing
heavy losses.

"Local residents will most likely face a hard winter due to the
affects of meager autumn grain harvests," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be placed on disaster relief during the winter
season, according to Li. Central government disaster relief
allocations from November this year through March next year will
hit 710 million yuan, up 100 million yuan on last winter.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes were yet another source of major disasters this
year, according to Li. Seven quakes measuring over six on the
Richter scale hit China during 1997, with the vast majority of
quakes occurring in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The central government allocated 82 million yuan in disaster
relief funds for Xinjiang during 1997, with over half of the
funds going to people living in areas struck by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 300 million people throughout the country were
adversely affected by various kinds of disasters this
year. However, thanks to the efforts of governments at various
levels, people in disaster received timely and greatly appreciated
relief.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, civil affairs departments will place
priority on effectively distributing disaster relief funds in
order to ensure that local residents pass the winter season in
relative comfort, said Li.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Australia Soar to Record level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's car makers and
importers enjoyed boom times in 1997 as sales soared to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, 655,871 new cars and commercial
vehicles had been retailed across Australia, up 10 percent
compared with the 595,834 units in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Even with only moderate demand in December the full year result
was likely to be somewhere between 710,000 and 720,000, exceeding
700,000 units for the first time, the Australian Associated Press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ford Australia looked set to retain its market leading status
with a healthy lead by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The company had sold 119,504 vehicles compared with 114,403 for
Toyota and 110,785 for Holden, a General Motor-owned local car
producer. Toyota was the only one in the big three local car
producers which enjoyed an increase in total sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Holden's fortunes improved dramatically in the final quarter
following the release of the new VT Commodore which was also
expected to be the nation's top seller.
</P>
<P>
The long-term future of Australia's four vehicle manufacturers
also received a significant boost this year with the federal
government finally deciding to place a freeze on tariff cuts on
imported cars.
</P>
<P>
In a somewhat surprising decision, Prime Minister John Howard
went against a majority recommendation from the Industry
Commission and decided in June to freeze tariffs on imported cars
from year 2000 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, tariffs will continue to fall by 2.5
percent until they reach 15 percent at the turn of the century
when the freeze will be applied.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs will be lowered to 10 percent in 2005 when a
further review will take place.
</P>
<P>
Overall, vehicle and car component exports were expected to
grow to about 1.69 billion U.S. dollars compared with 1.36 billion
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the financial front, Australia's car makers also enjoyed
good times with Holden posting an after-tax profit of 157 million
dollars for 1996 and Ford 141 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Toyota did not release its results but was thought to have
enjoyed improved fortunes after several years in the red with its
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi plunged into a 39 million dollar loss last year
after a heavy investment for the launch of new model Magna, but
Managing Director Mike Quinn forecast a return to profitability
when the results for 1997 are released.
</P>
<P>
Of the leading importers, Hyundai was clearly the pick of the
bunch with sales jumping to 55,273 units by the end of November
compared with 46,103 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's distribution company, Astre Automotive, also posted a
record after-tax profit of 22.23 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the good times may be over with the specter of falling
exchange rates set to end the honeymoon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar slumped recently to a four-year low
against the U.S. dollar and also fell against other currencies
including the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
This prompted vehicle importers to warn of impending price
increases, something almost certain to turn away customers in the
coming 12 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz said on Tuesday the government's economic agenda
provides extremely attractive fiscal incentives and has opened all
sectors of the economy to the foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the fifth session of the Pakistan-Saudi Joint
Ministerial Commission here, Aziz said Pakistan's development
program offers vast opportunities for foreign investments
particularly in communications and petroleum sectors.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister for Commerce and head of the Saudi delegation
Osama Jaafar Faqeeh said on the occasion the government of Saudi
Arabia was keen to explore the new prospects for further expansion
of trade and investment, cooperation in technical education and
health services.
</P>
<P>
There are many other projects in the public and private sectors
which provide the opportunity for a productive partnership between
the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the achievements of the government, Aziz said the
economy has been rehabilitated, the business confidence has grown
and external resources consolidated.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the future program of the government, he said the
objective is to rapidly increase the economic growth through
modernization of industry and agriculture in an environment which,
he said, would also allow freedom to the private sector to play
its due role in an effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Aziz urged the Saudi government to secure greater number of
workers from Pakistan to cater for its requirement. He expressed
the hope that joint efforts during this session will be helpful in
further strengthening the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Faqeeh said the existing agreements between the two countries
reflect the eagerness to promote bilateral relations through the
identification of each other's potential and the utilization of
Saudi Arabia's resources for the mutual benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister said the private sectors of the two
countries can play a decisive and effective role in encouraging
bilateral trade and investment through mutual contacts and
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the current session would help in exploring ways
and means of advancing bilateral relations through full
identification of potential available in both the countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Hold First Free Municipal Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's parliament has
decided to elect municipal council members and mayors through
nationwide free elections next April, instead of appointment
proposed by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper reported today that by a majority
vote, the parliament late Monday night rejected the government
bill to appoint municipal council members and approved to hold an
open municipal and mayoral elections across the country.
</P>
<P>
But this does not apply in south Lebanon, which is being
occupied by Israeli troops, and villages whose displaced residents
have not returned, according to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
This decision is an apparent blow to President Elias Hrawi and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri government's support for a
controversial provision to appoint one-third of the councils,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
During the 1975-1990 civil war, thousands of Lebanese, mostly
the Christians, had to flee their villages to avoid the
fighting. About 500,000 have not been repatriated so far.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the president, a Maronite Catholic, favors
appointments under the pretext that the demographic change could
lead to drastic losses for the country's Christians in direct
public vote.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, a Sunni Muslim, agreed with the president,
stressing the appointment could preserve the country's sectarian
balance between Muslims and Christians, which has been established
since its independence in 1943.
</P>
<P>
But their position sparked strong criticism from members of
parliament and politicians, who argued that the appointment will
infringe on democracy.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Mine-Clearing Policy in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Julio Mapote, coordinator for
the Mozambican Anti-Mine Campaign, has called for a national
policy for the humanitarian mission of land-mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
It is very important to make such a policy so as to prevent
some enterprises from seeking purely for commercial interests in
land mine clearing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The local paper Noticias today quoted Mapote as making the
statement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mapote, all contracts for land mine clearing
should be signed after taking into account the internal and
external interests. The venue for mine clearing should be
decided first by the Mozambicans, instead of foreigners, from
whom the money comes.
</P>
<P>
Mapote revealed that some companies and enterprises only
remove the mines out of economic interests. Take World Vision
for instance, it cleared mines in a certain region in Nampula
province, northern Mozambique so as to make developments in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Mozambican armed forces should regard
mine-clearing as a priority, although peace has already
materialized in the country," noted the coordinator.
</P>
<P>
He urged parliament to approve the Ottawa Agreement on mines
before next June and take measures to further implement the
accord.
</P>
<P>
About two million land mines had been planted in Mozambique
during its 16-year-long civil war. So far only 100,000 mines have
been removed.
</P>
<P>
In the process of mine-clearing, there have been conflicts
between foreign companies and Mozambican engineers over payment,
as a result, more often than not the latter were sacked.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Consumer Price Inflation Eases in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The year-on-year rate of
increase for consumer price inflation in Hong Kong, as measured by
the Consumer Price Index (CPI)(A), was 5.1 percent in November,
lower than that of 5.5 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The CPI(A) covers the largest percentage of Hong Kong's
households.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI(B), at 5.4 percent
in November, was also lower than that of 5.7 in October.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding rate of increase in the Hang Seng CPI was 5.9
percent in November, the same as the increase recorded in October.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI, which is compiled based on the combined
expenditure pattern of households covered by the three
sub-indices, showed a year-on-year increase of 5.4 percent in
November, lower than that of 5.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first 11 months of 1997 together, the increases in
the CPI(A) and CPI(B) both averaged at 5.8 percent over a year
earlier. The corresponding increases for the Hang Seng CPI and
Composite CPI were 6.1 percent and 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier revised down the forecast for this
year's consumer price inflation from 6.5 percent to 6 percent as

<HEADLINE> Vietnam State Bank to Stablize Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV)
will do its best to constrain the fluctuation of exchange rates
when necessary, said Do Que Luong, the SBV's acting governor.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Vietnamese dong (VND) against the
U.S. dollar has climbed high over the past few days on the black
market, exceeding the ceiling rate permitted by the SBV by 8-10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate at Vietcombank (Vietnam Commercial
Bank) is 12,293 VND per dollar. However, on the free market the
rate last saturday soared to 13,650 VND in Hanoi and 13,450 VND
per dollar in Ho Chi Minh city.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government will adjust the exchange market
within a permissible frame which is advantageous to the national
economy, Luong said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the SBV has made continued
efforts to adjust the exchange rate of the vietnamese dong
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
In Mid-October, the SBV widened the band from plus or minus 5
percent of the official rate, fixed by the SBV, to 10 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Luong said since the exchange volume on the free market is just
about one-tenth of that of the inter-bank, there was no need to
worry about the fluctuations of exchange rates on the free market
since they are "not real."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for the greenback's price hike, Luong
said a segment of the population was worried about a possible
depreciation of the dong and tried to speculate the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The acting governor added that the devaluation of gold on the
world market also leads a lower value of the dong against the
dollar. Speculators, including some enterprises, have hoarded the
greenback to buy smuggled gold.

<HEADLINE> Top 10 Chinese News Events in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The editors-in-chief of 14
major Beijing-based newspapers and a news agency today selected
China's top 10 news events for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The following list is arranged in order of number of votes
received:
</P>
<P>
1. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform,
opening up and modernization drive, died of illness on February
19. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), called on the whole party, army
and people of all ethnic groups to carry out Deng's behest, and
promote the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
2. The Chinese government resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a number of other
senior officials participated in both the handover ceremony
and the ceremony marking the founding of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
3. The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
was held from September 12-18 in Beijing. The Congress elected the
Party's trans-century leading group with Jiang Zemin at the core,
adopted a resolution for amending the CPC Party Constitution, and
established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology for the
Party.
</P>
<P>
4. President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to the United
States from October 26 to November 3. Jiang's visit, the first US
visit by a Chinese head of state in 12 years, demonstrated that
Sino-US relations have entered a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
5. The Yangtze River was successfully dammed for the Three
Gorges Project on November 8, thereby marking completion of a
principal aspect in construction of the world's largest water
conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
6. Chongqing was approved as China's fourth municipality. On
March 14, the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress examined and approved the State Council's proposal for
establishing Chongqing as a municipality. The move was seen as an
important government measure for implementing the strategy of
developing central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
7. In his report to the 15th National Congress of the CPC,
Jiang Zemin announced the army will be down-sized by 500,000 men
over the next three years in order to accelerate China's military
modernization drive and take concrete action to safeguard world
peace.
</P>
<P>
8. The 1997 annual meetings of the World Bank (WB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) were held in Hong Kong between
September 23-25. Chinese Premier Li Peng presented a speech at the
opening ceremony. The meetings, the first WB and IMF annual
meetings held in China, were the largest international conferences
held in Hong Kong following the region's return to China.
</P>
<P>
9. The Chinese government reduced average import and export
tariff rates from 23 percent to 17 percent effective October 1, or
a decrease range of 26 percent. The reduction represented an
important measure China has adopted to deepen reform of the its
foreign trade system and open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
10. The Eighth National Games, the largest and most
comprehensive sports games held in China this century, opened in

<HEADLINE> Australian Wine Sales Reach Record Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian wine sales in the
financial year of 1996-97 reached record levels in both Australian
and overseas markets, an official report released here said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its Australian Wine and Grape Industry report, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that wine exports reached
a record of 154.4 million liters in the financial year ending on
June 30, 1997 up by 19 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The income from the wine exports also reached a record of 420
million US dollars, or an average of 2.61 US dollars per liter.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom was the largest importer of the Australian
wine, taking 72.8 million liters (47 percent of exports), followed
by the United States with 22.5 million liters and New Zealand with
16.4 million liters.
</P>
<P>
Australians also bought more Australian-produced wine, with
domestic sales reaching a record of 333.6 million liters in
1996-97, up eight percent over the previous year and one percent
higher than the record set in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
As Australians increasingly bought home-produced wines, wine
imports fell by 33 percent from the record high of the previous
year to 13.6 million liters in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Maruso Securities Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Maruso Securities Co., a
midsize brokerage house, filed a petition Tuesday with the Tokyo
District Court for permission to start voluntary bankruptcy
proceedings, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based brokerage went bankrupt after it failed to
improve its loss-ridden financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Maruso's unconsolidated pretax balance was in the red for the
third consecutive year when it closed its books in March 1997, with a
loss of 1.48 billion yen (about 11 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The brokerage's capital-to-risk asset ratio plunged recently to
near the "warning territory" despite efforts to boost the ratio by
taking out subordinate loans from affiliates, brokerage sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Subordinate loans are unsecured loans for which repayment is
secondary to other debts if the borrower goes under. Funds raised
through subordinate loans can be counted as part of a brokerage's
net worth.
</P>
<P>
The securities industry will make sure that all securities,
cash and other assets entrusted to the firm by customers be
returned through use of Compensation Fund for Safekeeping
Securities Inc. and other means, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese securities industry has been rocked by a series of
failures since the beginning of November, including Yamaichi
Securities Co. and Sanyo Securities.
</P>
<P>
Maruso, a regular member of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is the
fifth brokerage house to collapse this year.
</P>
<P>
The brokerage, which has a workforce of some 200 people, has
been facing business difficulties due partly to the losses it
incurred as a result of its sales strategy concerning foreign
government bonds, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> VAT Improves Zambian Government Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Value Added Tax (VAT) has
improved government revenue, a Zambian economist has said.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail today quoted Kangwa Lumbwe, an economist with
Zambia Revenue Authority (ZPA), as saying that as a stable means
to collect revenue, VAT is efficient because it is neutral.
</P>
<P>
VAT alone represents five to 10 percent of Zambia's gross
national product (GDP), said the local weekly.
</P>
<P>
Such a system of revenue collection works well for a country
like Zambia because its dependence on primary commodities like
copper and coffee cannot be guaranteed, Kangwa said.
</P>
<P>
"Primary commodities like copper and coffee may be volatile
and therefore not a good source of revenue for Zambia," said
Kangwa.
</P>
<P>
According to the economist, VAT's broad-based nature protects
revenue collection from fluctuation in the markets, which means
revenue collection remains stable even when there are
fluctuations in the markets.
</P>
<P>
The broader the tax base, the lower tax individuals pay, and
consequently, the less impact it has on them, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kangwa noted, ZPA has been expanding its tax base and
continues doing so under difficult circumstances to the extent
that the people are frustrating their efforts.
</P>
<P>
World over, an increasing number of countries are adopting VAT
and the World Bank as well as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) have encouraged countries opting to have a broad revenue
collection to apply it, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The system is spread all over Zambia and the trend is self
policing, said the economist, adding that it gives fuller relief
on exports, thereby boosts investment, avoids double taxation from
cascading as well as arbitrary valuation uplifts.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Little Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended a
 little weaker Tuesday in Sydney, weighed by concerns that the
domestic economy would suffer adversely from the ongoing economic
crisis in Asia,  particularly in the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 65.28 US cents, down from 65.38
 previously. During the day it traded between 65.12 and 65.40 US
cents.
</P>
<P>
The narrowness of the range reflected subdued market conditions
usual ahead of the Christmas holidays, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended today at 85.18 Japanese yen, from
84.91 yen previously, and at 1.1629 German marks, from 1.1660
marks.
</P>
<P>
Standard &AMP; Poor's (S&AMP;P) lowered South Korea's long-term foreign
currency rating to B-plus, from BBB-minus, and its local currency
rating to BBB-minus, from A-minus. South Korea's ratings remain on
CreditWatch with negative implications.
</P>
<P>
The news had sent the South Korean currency, the won, into a
downward spiral to 2,000 to the U.S. dollar, the first time in
history it has touched that level.
</P>
<P>
It also sparked a 13.7 percent appreciation in the Australian
dollar against the won, in one session. Against the won, the local
unit closed at 1,282.10, up from 1,105.48 previously.
</P>
<P>
South Korea accounts for about 9.0 percent of Australia's
exports while Malaysia accounts for 2.9 percent. Around 60 percent
of Australia's export output goes to the Asian region.

<HEADLINE> India Opens Highway Construction to Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Surface Transport
Secretary Yogendra Narain said Tuesday that the central government
has opened the construction of the entire 35,000 kilometer
national highway to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a conference on transport infrastructure organized
by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here, he said this
was a massive program for contractors and BOT (build, operate and
transfer) operators.
</P>
<P>
He added that such a program would give a fillip to the
country's economy and provide large-scale employment.
</P>
<P>
India's national highway is owned by the government and managed
by the state-owned National Highway Authority. With the
introduction of economic reforms in the country, infrastructure
including the national highway has become more and more important
in the economic development of the country. The National Highway
Authority itself could not cope with the emerging situation due to
shortage of money.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering developing expressways of
the American pattern and it has already given approval for
construction of two expressways in the country, the secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
While the Asian Development Bank has agreed to fund the
Mumbai-Baroda expressway, the Finance Ministry has gained adequate
support for another planned expressway between Kanpur and Agra, he
added.

<P>
-- When Lionel Jospin became prime minister, he began to engage
himself in the process of closing the nuclear power center of
Superphenix in the southeast department of Isere, as he had promised
the Green Party as a condition for the latter's participation in his
government. However, the 5,000 liters of sodium, a inflammable and
explosive liquid, within the nuclear center has obliged the
government to delay twice the annoucement of the program for closing
the center.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A silent march was organized on Monday in Duchere, Lyon, in
memory of Fabrice Fernandez, who was killed last Thursday by a
policeman. When the cortege of several hundred people arrived at the
mayor's office building in the nineth district of Lyon, some
troublemakers tried to prevent the Socialist mayor, Gerard Collomb,
from making a speech.
</P>
<P>
-- Four days after having announced that the GI would remain in
Bosnia after June 1998, President Bill Clinton, accompanied by his

<P>
TOKYO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Satoshi Iida of Japan floored
Thai Yokthai Sith Oar to take the junior bantaweight title of the
World Boxing Association in Nagoya on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scoring his first round knockout, Iida went to take the title
on a unanimous decision after a complete 12-round bout.
</P>
<P>
Judge Erkki Meronen of Finland scored it 115-112, Waldemar
Schmit of Puerto Rico 115-111 and Rodolfo Maldonado of Panama
114-113, all for Iida.
</P>
<P>
Iida, 28, who ranked second in the WBA category, knocked down
the 22-year-old champion with a left straight to the face late in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
Yokthai, in his fifth defense of the title won from Venezuelan
Alami Goitia in Thailand on August 25, began his comeback efforts
in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
But Venezuelan referee Enzo Montero penalized Yokthai one point
in the sixth and again in the ninth for low blows.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Tobacco Earnings Expected to Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Annual earnings for
Tanzanian tobacco are expected to reach a record of 60 million US
dollars in 1997, The Guardian said today.
</P>
<P>
Earnings were based on 1997 production estimates of 42.041
million kilograms of Virginia Flue Cured (VFC) tobacco and 9.054
million kgs of Dark Fire Cured (DFC) tobacco, the paper quoted
Frank Urio, Leaf Development Manager of the Tanzania Tobacco
Board (TTB), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Production in 1996 stood at 27.101 million kgs of VFC and
8.279 million kgs of DFC worth 56 million US dollars. Production
in 1995 was 23.415 million kgs of VFC tobacco and 5.183 million
kgs of DFC.
</P>
<P>
Urio believed that prospects for continuing strong growth in
the tobacco sector are excellent.
</P>
<P>
The massive jump in production from 1996 to 1997 reflects the
impact of private sector investment in Tanzania's tobacco
industry liberalized in 1995, Urio said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's three main tobacco buyers -- Universal Leaf
Tobacco, Diamond Leaf Tobacco and Standard Commercial Tobacco
Leaf -- are all U.S.- registered and listed on the New York stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Since market liberalization of the tobacco trade, we have
seen an era of closer cooperation between tobacco growers and
leaf dealers," Urio said, adding "This arrangement has given
growers assistance in receiving inputs in the right quantity and
right time."
</P>
<P>
As a result of liberalization, growers, mostly small holder
farmers, can sell their crop at optimum prices with prompt
payment guaranteed. Given good weather, production for 1998 was
forecast at 43 million kgs of VFC tobacco, he said.
</P>
<P>
VFC tobacco accounts for about 80 percent of total tobacco
grown in Tanzania, mostly in the central Tabora region, with the
balance made up by DFC.
</P>
<P>
According to Urio, the ongoing farmer education programs
stressed improved crop management which is aimed at obtaining
higher yields.
</P>
<P>
"Despite increases in production there are still a lot of
areas to be improved -- extended acreage is one. We (TTB) think
yields per acre could be increased. This is one area to be
addressed because yields are very low," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, one tobacco harvest per year normally takes place
from mid January to April.
</P>
<P>
The main harvest months are February and March. Tobacco
planting is normally from mid-November to mid-March. The
industry, including farmers and process workers, numbers around
440,000 people.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Reform of Fund-Raising Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- China will take effective
measures to expand its capital market during 1998, and will
encourage more enterprises to raise funds on the market in order
to meet the needs of ongoing state enterprise reform and adjust
the national economic structure.
</P>
<P>
"China expects to achieve new breakthroughs in expanding its
capital market during 1998," according to Zhang Haoruo, vice
minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy. Zhang made the remarks during a national conference on
economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include the selection of more efficient
enterprises to be listed on the stock market, expansion of the
issue quota for convertible bonds, permission of qualified
enterprises to issue financial bonds overseas, acceleration of the
formulation of regulations on investment funds, and pursuance of
conventional international fund-raising methods, according to
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that reform of the fund-raising mix continues to
lag behind and pointed out that indirect financing other than bank
loans still plays a major role in direct funding, as well as in
pooling funds by issuing stocks and bonds, and establishing
investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 800 Chinese companies are
currently listed on the nation's stock markets. During the
January-November period alone, 185 Chinese companies issued A
shares, 15 companies issued B shares targeted at foreign
investors, and 19 firms gained listings on overseas stock
market. The various forms of stock issues raised a total of 147.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that accelerated expansion of the Chinese stock
market is an inevitable trend manifested by the 30 billion yuan
stock issue quota for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also noted that China will strictly adhere to the related
procedures for listed companies, explore new approaches for
listing state-owned shares and legal person shares, and will
promote the transfer of stock rights in non-listed companies.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China will actively and steadily develop a
corporate bond market, and will issue additional convertible
bonds, while tightening supervision over the issuance, conversion
and redemption of related bonds.
</P>
<P>
He called for the redoubling of efforts to implement the
regulations on managing securities investment funds and for
continuing experiments in establishing investment funds.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes ICJ's Report on Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is in
resolute opposition to the act of the International Commission of
Jurists (ICJ) to interfere in China's internal affairs by issuing
a report on Tibet, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tang Guoqiang told a press conference this afternoon
that the authors of the report are extremely ignorant of the
history and present state of Tibet. It is apparent that they are
also extremely ignorant of the norms of international relations
and the international law, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tibet has been an inalienable part of China since
ancient times and Tibetan affairs are purely China's internal
affairs, he said that no international organization has the right
to put its hands on or meddle in these affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that the ICJ's report overlooks the territorial
sovereignty of China by advocating Tibet's self-determination and
accusing China of human rights violation in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly opposed to this," he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the ICJ should respect the general purpose and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and stop such
activities of interfering in China's internal affairs, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Chief Justice Sajjad's Appointment Held Unlawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A ten-member bench of the
Supreme Court on Tuesday held in an unanimous decision the
appointment of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of
Pakistan as invalid.
</P>
<P>
The bench headed by Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui in its short
order said that the appointment of Sajjad as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court is "invalid, unlawful and unconstitutional," and
asked the federal government to appoint Justice Ajmal Mian as the
Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
"He ceased to be the Chief Justice of Pakistan," Justice
Siddiqui read out the order in the jampacked Court Room Number two
in the Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
The bench said that all orders passed by Justice Sajjad after
November 26 were issued "without lawful authority" and hence are
invalid.
</P>
<P>
The two member bench of the Supreme Court at Quetta, capital of
Baluchistan province, had restrained Sajjad from acting as Chief
Justice of the country on November 26 because he was not the
senior most judge in the apex court when he was elevated to the
post three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had witnessed a worst-ever constitutional crisis
involving Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Justice Sajjad
during the past four months.
</P>
<P>
The crisis culminated in the resignation of President Farooq
Leghari on December 2, who refused to sign a reference against
Sajjad as required by the government.
</P>
<P>
Following Leghari's stepping down, Sajjad has applied for a
two-and-half-month long leave till February 16 next year when his
retirement is due. Ajmal Mian, the second senior most judge of
the Supreme Court, was then sworn in as the Acting Chief Justice.

<HEADLINE> South China City's Workers Pitching in Housing Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.02 million
workers and staff members, or 70 percent of the work force in this
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, have participated in
public accumulative fund for housing.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, these employees, most of whom are
working with the state- and collectively-owned businesses, had set
aside 1.7 billion yuan (205 billion US dollars) on the housing
fund.
</P>
<P>
The city implemented on a compulsory basis the public
accumulative fund for housing among the employees working with
state- and collectively-owned businesses in 1992. The fund is
aimed at pooling capital to build more apartment flats for the
workers who are without adequate housing.
</P>
<P>
Each institution and each employee working with that
institution are required to deposit seven percent of their
respective monthly salaries for the housing fund.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has accelerated the pace for drafting the
relevant managerial measures for extending the housing fund to to
be implemented in the overseas-funded enterprises where 400,000
Chinese employees are working and private businesses and
individual industrial and commercial households, where 550,000
workers are employed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the municipal people's congress has also published a
regulation governing the implementation of the public accumulative
fund for housing.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the construction of three major
residential quarters in the city has proceeded smoothly thanks to
the aid of the fund. It will make it possible for the city's
20,000-strong households with a per-capita living space of less
than five sq m to move into newly-built apartment flats, which
will be sold at 1,800 yuan per sq m at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning next year, the city will shift the focus of its
housing development to construction of comfortable-living housing
which will be sold at 3,000 yuan (360 US dollars) per sq m. It has
set forth a goal of increasing the city's per-capita living space
to 12 sq m by the end of this century, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes GCC Call for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed a call of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for better relations, saying
Tehran is ready to improve ties and cooperation with the Gulf
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio reported that spokesman of Iran's Foreign
Ministry Mahmoud Mohammadi was responding to a communique issued
at the end of the GCC summit in Kuwait Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that one of the priorities of Iran's foreign
policy is to expand friendly relations and cooperation with its
neighbors, the Gulf Arab states in particular, which would help
maintain peace, security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders on Monday expressed welcome to the recent
reconciliatory remarks of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami,
calling for better relations and cooperation with Iran in order to
establish mutual confidence and maintain regional security and
peace.
</P>
<P>
They also gave backing to any meetings between leaders of Iran
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to resolve their dispute over
the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The GCC announced UAE President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan has accepted the proposal of his Iranian counterpart
Khatami that the leaders of the two countries meet to solve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
However, they reaffirmed support to the UAE's sovereignty over
the three islands and "all positions, measures and means to
restore them peacefully." The islands are now under the control of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman reiterated the three islands belong to
Iran, saying that the UAE should hold bilateral talks with Iran to
remove the "misunderstandings" between them.
</P>
<P>
The islands are strategically located on the edge of the Strait
of Hormuz, the only gateway to the Gulf, through which much of the
world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the
islands despite their agreement to co-rule the islands in the Gulf
following the British withdrawal from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Failing to reach a settlement after protracted talks, Abu Dhabi
announced to resort to the International Court of Justice in the
Hague, while Tehran insisted on solving the dispute through
bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will pay an official
visit to the UAE after the summit of the GCC, which was founded in
1981 and groups the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and
Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Stays Firm in Regional Turmoil (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's
services-dominated economy has maintained its vigor over a
full-blown "Asian flu" which threw many of Asian economies into
jitters, and an overall good performance is expected in the year
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, overshadowed by the financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia, the "last domino left standing" entered into an adjustment
period in the last quarter of this year, which will probably last
until the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But a government-estimated 5.5 percent growth for 1997 is still
expected, as a 6.3 percent increase recorded for the first half of
the year offered some cushion.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), underpinned by robust domestic
demand, increased by 6.1 percent and 6.4 percent in the first and
second quarters respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, growth slowed down to a preliminary five
percent, and is likely to ease further in the last quarter as the
regional turmoil, which has yet to settle down, is taking its
toll.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a sour adjustment which seems inevitable, Hong Kong
will be the first to bounce back among the affected Asian
economies thanks to its sound fundamentals and historical
resilience, Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa told world
economic leaders in Canada last month.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of the chief executive and his fellow city folk
was underpinned by the fact that Hong Kong has withstood the
severe test, with its status as an international hub for finance,
trade and shipping intact.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the local financial
market was very active and the stock market, ranking the sixth
largest in the world in terms of market capitalization, was
particularly buoyant. The benchmark Hang Seng Index kept setting
new records and soared to over 16,000 points in early August.
</P>
<P>
In late October, international speculators, who had claimed a
victory in the currency and equity markets of Southeast Asia,
targeted Hong Kong. They mounted an intensive attack on the Hong
Kong dollar, reeling 1,438 points off the Hang Seng Index on
October 28, the largest single-day point retreat in the index's
history.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the dive with the 1987 crashdown, however, people
were quite relieved to find that Hong Kong's equity market had
been fledged. Shares changed hands in a smooth and orderly manner
with the help of advanced trading and settling mechanism, in
contrast to sheer chaos a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar has remained stable in the battle, with
the linked exchange rate successfully defended at the 7.8 level,
against the tumbling of other regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
During the troubled month of October, a continued double-digit
year-on-year growth was recorded with Hong Kong dollar deposits,
while Hong Kong's foreign reserves, the third largest in the
world, edged up 4.2 percent against a month earlier to stand at
91.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong economy paid a price for interest rate rises
made as part of the battle to fend off speculators. Along with the
plunge in the stock market, property market shrank by around 20
percent and retailing was also affected.
</P>
<P>
It was argued that a correction of property prices would
benefit Hong Kong's competitiveness as high rental costs have
always been cited by foreign investors as a most unfavorable
factor for doing business here.
</P>
<P>
Financial specialists believe that, given a sustainable
economic growth on China's inland area, there exists limitless
potential for Hong Kong's position as an international financial
center, well preserved after July 1 and tested by the regional
storm.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Stays Firm in Regional Turmoil (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The industry has been positive in predicting that the
mainland's restructuring of state-owned enterprises bodes well for
Hong Kong, which is a premier site for the enterprises to raise
funds.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hong Kong's status as a trading center has
also been maintained as the year has witnessed modest export
growth. In 1995 and 1996, Hong Kong was placed seventh in world
trade by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Government figures showed that the value of total exports in
the first 10 months of 1997 stood at 1,207 billion HK dollars (155
billion U.S. dollars), up 4 percent over the same period of last
year, while that of imports increased by 5.6 percent to 1,344
billion HK dollars (172 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland accounted for one-third of Hong Kong's
total trade.
</P>
<P>
In a trade outlook report for 1998, the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) projected a five percent growth in value
terms for next year's merchandise exports, one percentage point
lower than the estimated five percent growth for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will not be spared from the negative regional
environment, but the impact should be limited, said the TDC,
because Southeast Asia and South Korea, which were hit hard by the
financial turmoil, account for a relatively small share of Hong
Kong's exports, while a differentiation in product composition
means their direct competition on third markets is relatively
limited.
</P>
<P>
And the total trade picture for Hong Kong would be better than
what statistics indicate, because an increasing number of Hong
Kong companies are involved in offshore trade. The TDC observed
that the growth of total export business managed by Hong Kong
companies should be around one to two percentage points higher
than the value increase captured by trade statistics.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's export of services increased by 5.3 percent in the
first half of this year, compared with an 8.6 percent increase for
the whole of 1996, and the growth is likely to decelerate further
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in services export was caused by a major downturn
in the tourism industry, but partially offset by healthy
performance in the freight transport sector.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters, tourism receipts decreased by 9.2
percent, a result of a 6.5 percent drop in the number of tourists
and a 3.4 percent contraction in per capita spending.
</P>
<P>
In spite of moderate export growth, Hong Kong's transport
services benefited from soaring transshipment business, generated
by strong growth of exports from Hong Kong-invested firms on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, Hong Kong's total container
throughput reached 9.4 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units
(TEUs), up 9.2 percent from a year ago, with transshipment cargo
accounting for 21 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Air cargo throughput, at the overcrowded Kai Tak airport, has
grown at an even faster pace, up 15.5 percent in the first 10
months to reach 1.38 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The TDC expected services exports to pick up slightly next
year, fueled by a bottoming out of the tourism industry and a
steady growth in trade-supporting services.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate remained low, standing at a little over 2
percent in the first nine months while underemployment for the
same period moved between 1 and 2 percent, demonstrating a
tightened labor market out of good economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for this year's consumer price inflation was
revised by the government from 6.5 percent down to 6 percent as
inflationary pressures continued to ease.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Considers Laws to Counter Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Justice
Ministerr Dullah Omar said that the government is considering
legislation to counter the number of criminals escaping from custody
while being transported from jails to courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with local television on Monday
night, Omar said "We are considering a proposal which will enable us
to hold court at prisons in certain specific instances."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is also considering hearing in prisons bail
applications in prison from prisoners already in custody, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
"It may mean the amendment of the Criminal Procedures Act in
certain respects and we are looking at that," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent escapes from South African jails, the
Deaprtment of Correctional Services has issued directives for stricter
security measures to be implemented during festive season visits to
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Correctionsl Services spokesman for Gauteng Province Rudi
Potgieter said yesterday the measures were introduced specifically
to reduce prison escapes over this period.
</P>
<P>
So far this year 1,036 prisoners have escaped from prisons
countrywide. Last year, with a prison population of 118,731, there had
been 1,345 escapes.
</P>
<P>
There will be no more open days or sports days for the estimated
140,000 prisoners in South African jails, prison authorities said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there will be stricter searching of visitors when they
visit prisoners to prevent anything from being smuggled into them and
prersonnel dealing with prisoners will also be searched.

<P>
For the economic prospects of 1998, the International Monetary
Fund predicted a modest 4.1 percent growth for Hong Kong in its
latest World Economic Outlook report, which revised down earlier
estimates of global and regional growth.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng and Standard Chartered, two major banks in Hong Kong,
had earlier projected a real GDP growth of around four percent.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered said that the slowdown will mainly be felt
in the first half and a recovery may begin in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's chief economist for North Asia
Kwok-chuen Kwok, Hong Kong's competitiveness as a services center
is of prime importance as the services sector accounts for about
84 percent of Hong Kong's GDP. In this respect, Hong Kong's
proximity to the Chinese mainland where trade, business or
finance-related services are in great demand will help the city
maintain its niche as a regional business center.
</P>
<P>
It is highly notable that, even after the high volatility in
the market, the economic confidence of local people still remains
at a decent level. A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Economic
Times in mid-November showed that 69 percent of local investors
planned to enter the local stock market in the next half year and
expected a rebound of the Hang Seng Index within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The bullish sentiment is shared by foreign investors. The 1997
American Chamber of Commerce confidence survey released early this
month showed that 96 percent of American firms have a favorable or
very favorable outlook about Hong Kong's business environment over
the next five years, with the great majority planning to expand
operation here or conduct business as usual.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of the Heritage Foundation of the United
States, Hong Kong remains the world's freest economy for the
fourth year in a row. Its transition into a special
administrative region of China and the recent market fluctuations
triggered by the Southeast Asian financial crisis "have done
nothing to alter its status as the world's most open setting in
which to pursue economic activity."

<HEADLINE> EU Remains Biggest Market for Zambia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) remains
Zambia's biggest market for non-traditional exports (NTEs) this year,
accounting for 36.7 percent or 87.8 million U.S.Dollars of the NTEs
in the first ten months this year, Zambia's Financial Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total NTEs during the first 10 months amounted to 239 million
dollars, which can greatly help the country to improve foreign
currency earnings given that its earnings from copper are
expected to decline, said the weakly paper published today.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa absorbed the
second largest proportion of Zambia's NTEs, accounting for 29.7
percent or 71 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited information from the Ministry of Finance's real
sector data as saying that bilaterally, Britain and South Africa are
the two biggest markets for Zambia's NTEs with exports to Britian this
year reching 45.5 million dollars while those to South Africa reached
41.1 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other major export markets are Germany and the Democratic Republic
of Congo with exports amounting to 29.2 million and 26.2 million
Dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Asia is another emerging market for the country's NTEs with India
taking in exports worth 20.9 million Dollars, while Hong Kong only
accounted for 1.1 million Dollars, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Population in Zimbabwe Reaches 1,564 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is hosting 1,564
refugees from more than 20 countries with the largest group being
226 from Rwanda, the daily The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Neignboring Burundi, also engulfed in ethnic strife, ranked
the second with 138 refugees in the country, while Somalia, which
has not known peace for more than five years, is the third with
124 people taking refuge in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 284 are children, 130 of them girls who usually
face severe hardships under such conditions.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted acting director of the Social Welfare
Ministry Claudius Kasere as saying, "While the ministry provides
infrastructure and overall supervision or management of the
transit center, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) meets
the cost of all necessary needs for food commodities, clothing,
educational and health expenses."
</P>
<P>
Other non-governmental organizations complement UNHCR efforts
by providing educational and training services, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Other countries which contribute to Zimbabwe's refugee
population are Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Tanzania, Ghana, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Kenya,
Togo and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
Upon being granted refugee status, these people were taught to
become self reliant, said Kasere.
</P>
<P>
"If he is without marketable skills he is trained and given
start-up capital to undertake a self-reliant project in the
community. If he has skills that are in demand, he is assisted
to join formal employment to fend for himself and his family," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the acting director, the refugee population in
Zimbabwe is still increasing.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Expands Agricultural Cooperation With Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan-funded enterprises have
emerged as a driving force in the agriculture sector in Hainan,
China's southernmost island province, especially in terms of
applications of advanced agronomics.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Taiwan enterprises have invested 150 million US
dollars in developing agriculture in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has long been plagued by low-level agriculture, a fact
which local people attribute the insufficient use of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, only 28 percent of the agronomic research findings
were applied to production, with the hybrid seed coverage standing
at 70 percent, and the figure for hybrid animal husbandry and
aquatic products reaching only 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Yaonong Co. has opened five comprehensive
experimental development bases in the province and has helped more
than 3,000 rural households plant seedless watermelons and other
fruit on 1,100 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investors have introduced over 80 new varieties of farm
produce and by-products, with related products selling well on
the domestic market, as well as in Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, and Malaysia. Local farmers are in turn enjoying good
returns.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan enterprises have also held technical training courses
for farmers and grass roots officials.

<HEADLINE> Torrential Rains May Affect Tanzania's Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Cotton
Lint and Seed Board (TCLSB) has predicted reduced production of
cotton if current torrential rains continue.
</P>
<P>
Too much water brought by the rains have attracted pests and
fostered the growth of seedlings, posing threats to the crop
whose planting season is during November and December, said TCLSB
General Manager Ally Ngongolo here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Ngongolo did not disclose the amount of loss the board is
likely to incur if the crop fails, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
So far 24,000 tons of cotton seeds had been distributed to be
planted in 400,000 hectares of farmland in Mwanza, Shinyanga, Mara,
Kagera, Tabora, Singida and Mbeya regions.
</P>
<P>
On average, annual sales of the crop stood at 100 million US
dollars, Ngongolo said, adding that some 65 million US dollars
had been acquired from sales by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The above-average seasonal rains caused by El Nino weather
phenomenon could also jeopardize prospects for coffee production,
said Tanzania Coffee Board managing director Leslie Omari last
week.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Kilimanjaro region, a major coffee growing
area, if rains continue to pour down, the flowers will abort and
form leaves. Worse is that some farmers have reported cases of
coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust, as a result of
excessive moisture.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Declassifies Documents, Films of Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Energy Department
Monday released previously classified documents and films about the
nation's atomic blasts testing peaceful use of nuclear explosives
from 1961 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
Over all, the United States detonated 35 nuclear explosions in
27 peaceful tests. The tests were designed to use nuclear
explosives for construction of harbors, tunnels and canals as well
as for drilling and mining.
</P>
<P>
The first test was on December 10, 1961, at Carlsbad, New
Mexico, and the last on May 17, 1973, at Rifle, Colorado. Others
were at Farmington, New Mexico, and Grand Valley, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
The government for the first time released specific yields for
11 of the 27 test blasts for peaceful purposes, all but four at
the Nevada Test Site.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tests were contained under ground, ranging from
less than one kiloton to slightly more than 11 kilotons.
</P>
<P>
But one at the Nevada Test Site on July 6, 1962, was six times
the size of the bomb dropped at Hiroshima, displaced 12 million
tons of earth and released the seismic energy equivalent of an
earthquake with a magnitude of 4.75.
</P>
<P>
The department said that nuclear explosives for peaceful
purposes were never used by the United States though technically
successful.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, documents have been assumed to be born
classified. Starting today, that assumption is eliminated. Only
materials with a compelling national security interest will be
classified," said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, who previewed
the films with reporters.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Research Institute Issues Alert Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Agricultural
Research Institute (KARI) has issued an alert over an outbreak of
a disease hitting the flower industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted KARI's senior entomologist G.N.
Kibata as saying that more than 10 flower farms
had reported heavy losses as a result of the bacterial
crown gall disease.
</P>
<P>
He told a flower growers' meeting held at the KARI
headquarters that "the most recent problem in the 1990s has been
crown gall introduced with rose seedlings and is already taking
a heavy toll on rose production."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, J.C. Kedera, Managing Director of the
newly established Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services, said
that the disease could been traced back to the import of diseased
planting materials.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all consignments of rose seedlings arriving in the
country in the past two months have been found to be contaminated
with diseases or pests, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Plant Health Inspectorate has intercepted and
burnt at least 5,000 plants at the point of entry, excluding an
entire consignment seized and destroyed last week, according to
Kedera.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture is Kenya's fourth largest foreign exchange earner
and expected to overtake tea and coffee to become the second
largest foreign exchange earner in next two years.
</P>
<P>
Cut flowers have surpassed other horticultural products over
the past two years, earning the country 4.37 billion Kenyan
Shillings (about 70 million U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> India to Tighten Waste Disposal Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
constituted an experts panel to examine and suggest measures for
effective implementation of the existing toxic waste management
laws, said a senior official in the Environment and Forests
Ministry here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This complies with a Supreme Court directive on the issue,
which reflects the realization that further executive and
legislative measures are needed to protect the ecology from the
industrial toxic waste discharge.
</P>
<P>
The panel will examine the effectiveness of the present waste
management laws and suggest new legislative measures to make the
laws effective.
</P>
<P>
A major task before the panel is to identify new hazardous
wastes that need an immediate ban. These would be in addition to
those already banned under the Hazardous Waste (Management and
Handling) Rules of 1989 and the direction of the Basel Convention
on hazardous wastes, to which India is a signatory.
</P>
<P>
The panel has been particularly directed to study the import of
hazardous substances and suggested how their import could be
altogether stopped, or if such an import is unavoidable, then the
measures required to reduce their harmful effect.
</P>
<P>
The panel will make suggestions to promote production methods
which give out ecologically friendly products after eliminating or
reducing to the acceptable levels their toxic contents. It will
also make recommendations on the safe disposal of such wastes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai sugarcane planters are
demanding higher sugarcane prices to compensate for their higher
production costs, the newspaper The Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sugarcane production costs have risen significantly since the
baht was floated and the value-added tax increased earlier this
year, said Suphan Duangchampa, president of the Association of
Northeastern Sugarcane Planters.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have to pay higher interest rates on advances from
millers and high transport fees while fertilizer and labor costs
have also gone up.
</P>
<P>
Retail sugar prices in the country have been frozen for 17
years. About two months ago, the prices rose "unofficially" from
the controlled prices of 12-13 baht per kilogram to 15-16 baht.
But the planters did not benefit from the increases, Suphan said.

The local authorities decided to impose the ban in the resort

Besides the noise, jet ski racers also often venture too close

WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's car imports
 slumped by almost 20 percent in the year ending November,
Statistics New Zealand said in a press release received Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures contained in the release showed a 4.7-percent drop
in imports from Asia, largely because of lower level of car
imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, second-hand Japanese-made cars lost favor
among many New Zealanders following allegations that their
odometers had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
Imports from other parts of Asia, including Malaysia, Singapore
and Hong Kong, also fell.
</P>
<P>
However, imports from China rose by 23.3 percent on the annual
basis, the statistical office said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Current Account Deficit Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's current
account deficit worsened in the year ending September, rising to
6.4 percent of the gross domestic product from 6.2 percent a year
ago, according to figures released by Statistics New Zealand
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the deficit is not as bad as forecast by some
economists, it is still the worst since December 1986.
</P>
<P>
Bancorp economist Stuart Marshall was quoted by a press report
as saying the lower than expected figures were a relief for
everyone, but it also meant that New Zealand did not look as
attractive to overseas investors as it did one year ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the deficit had been worse, the New Zealand
dollar would have fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of money for goods and
services between New Zealand and its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Statistics New Zealand's figures show that the current account
data improved in the third quarter this year, standing at 2.22
billion NZ dollars (1.27 billion U.S. dollars) compared with 2.11
billion dollars (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
But on an annual basis, the deficit rose as a percentage of
GDP, it pointed out.

<HEADLINE> US-China Relationship Stablized, Roth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here on Monday that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit
to the United States has helped stablize the Sino-U.S. relationship.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs
Stanley O. Roth told a press conference that positive changes have
taken place in 1997 and the government mobilized "considerable
bipartisan support in the Congress" for its China policy.
</P>
<P>
"If you go back to last January, you'll remember there were
enormous predictions about how much difficulty MFN was going to be
in; at this time, the Congress might really reject it; that there
was a lot of concern about Hong Kong reversion on top of all the
traditional issues with China policy that had figured in the
debate in previous years, and a sense that the relationship could
be in for a rocky period," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
He said the administration managed the MFN issue rather well
with MFN passed by over 80 votes, a rather large margin.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made a tour of seven U.S. cities in eight
days, a milestone in the bilateral ties between the two countries.
One of the most important accomplishments is the agreement to
establish constructive strategic partnership for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Roth, who mostly was involved in the whole process, believed
that the state visit was a "major step forward in terms of
stabilizing the relationship" in spite of some still existing
problems
</P>
<P>
"I believe it set a different context for how we deal with
issues in terms of working towards a constructive strategic
partnership."
</P>
<P>
"I think there are many areas where we and the Chinese are
talking much more productively about substantive issues, whether
it's the Korean peninsula, South Asia, the Persian Gulf,
environmental issues or some of our bilateral issues," said Roth,
who accompanied Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during her
three visits this year to Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official was reviewing Washington's policy toward Asia
and the Pacific as a whole in the passing year. He claimed that the
better U.S.-China relationship is one of the most positive
changes in the region.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the development of bilateral ties will no
longer be tied to "the ups and downs in the political roller
coaster" as both sides agreed to progress wherever possible and
narrow or at least manage their differences.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Jiang and Bill Clinton agreed at their summit
meeting that high-level talks be held on regular basis. Clinton is
expected to return a state visit to China next spring, another
step to enhance the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Roth reiterated the U.S. One-China policy, saying there is no
effort to revise it.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the U.S. would like to play an important role
in helping solve the financial crisis in Asia, but he stressed
that the International Monetary Fund must take the lead.
</P>
<P>
On the region as a whole, Roth said that Asia and Pacific will
continue to be given high priority in the U.S. foreign policy, and
both the region and Europe are equally important to Washington.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 23 (Xinhua)-- The Associated Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) has appealed to all
political parties in India to delink economic policies from
politics so that economic development does not suffer on account
of political instability.
</P>
<P>
In an economic agenda prepared by ASSOCHAM for adoption by
political parties, which was released here on Monday, ASSOCHAM
President L. Lakshman noted that implementation of economic
reforms has slowed down because of political postures.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that political parties of all hues set for
themselves a common agenda to actualize the country's potential to
emerge as a global economic power," he said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of releasing such an agenda paper is to secure a
broad national consensus on economic policies so that economic
development does not suffer on account of political instability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The next government should target gross domestic product growth
averaging about 8 percent over the next five years while industry,
agriculture and service should grow by 11 percent, 4 percent and
10 percent respectively by the year 2003, Lakshman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the gross domestic savings ratio should reach 30
percent, fiscal deficit be reduced to 2.5 percent and aggregate
subsidies cut down to 5 percent of the GDP, he added.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Largest Automaker to Increase Sales in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's largest
automaker, Daewoo Motor Corporation, said Monday that it plans to
open 40 to 50 stores in the United States in 1998 to make their
low-cost small cars available to U.S. customers.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo's subsidiary in Ohio said the stores will be Daewoo
owned factory-direct stores where customers can buy cars, parts
and get service, quite different from standard U.S. franchise
dealerships which just sell cars.
</P>
<P>
Three models of Daewoo -- the midsize Leganza, compact Nubira
and subcompact Lanos -- are expected to be sold to U.S. customers,
with Lanos at prices between 9,000 to 12,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Lanos model is seen as strong competitor to its
counterparts manufactured by General Motors, Ford Motor and
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
They fear that South Korean and Japanese automakers will pour
exports into the U.S. market next year in response to economic
crisis at home and falling value of the Japanese yen and South
Korean won.
</P>
<P>
That will intensify price war that already has eaten into
sales by the Big Three, and has forced them to boost discounts to
more than 2,000 dollars per vehicle in the United States,
according to CNW marketing, a research firm in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, with a share of 2.5 percent of international market, is
expected to make 1.39 million cars and trucks in 1997, with a
total revenue of 16.7 billion dollars including 11.7 billion at
home and five billion overseas.
</P>
<P>
The company is aiming at raising its production to 2.5 million
cars and trucks by the year 2000 and increasing its total revenue
to 40 billion dollars in three years.

<HEADLINE> Effective Control on Pneumoconiosis In Yunnan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has scored remarkable progress in the control and
treatment of occupation diseases over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of pneumoconiosis, the disease which poses a
major threat to local workers, has dropped drastically.
</P>
<P>
A test conducted in the Kunming Iron and Steel Corporation, the
largest of its kind in the province, showed that the incidence of
pneumoconiosis has reduced from former 10 percent in 1986 to the
current three per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Only 350 patients of pneumoconiosis were found in the
metallurgical sector during the 1986-1997 period, representing a
drastic drop compared to the 2,000-plus in the 1976-1986 period.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan Province, which is a major metallurgical and coal
industrial base of China and its southwestern region as well, dust
produced by local mines and industrial enterprises is the main
cause for the disease.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts that have been made by local state-owned
enterprises to improve the working and living conditions of their
employees have contributed greatly to the control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some enterprises have established the health files
for their miners and other workers and conduct regular medical
examinations among them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ends Bosnia Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
left Bosnia Monday evening after a one-day visit to Sarajevo and
Tuzla where U.S. troops are based.
</P>
<P>
On a holiday mission to thank American troops and encourage
Bosnia's fragile peace, Clinton lectured the nation's three
presidents on Monday to set aside differences and rebuild their
government.
</P>
<P>
"You owe it to your country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the Bosnian leaders in a private meeting in Sarajevo
that U.S. peacekeeping help is not infinite and the world
"rightfully expects that you do your part."
</P>
<P>
"The future is up to you, not to the Americans, not to the
Europeans, not to anyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pledged that Americans would do their best to enforce
the 1995 Dayton peace accords, which ended the three and a half
year ethnic war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last week indefinitely extended the mandate of some
8,500 U.S. troops serving with the NATO-led peacekeeping force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also held a meeting with Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic, who asked Clinton for patience. "Slowly, one can
expect results, but certain things cannot be implemented quickly,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Analysts Not Surprised by Moody's Downgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai finance analysts are not
surprised when Moody's Investors Service further downgraded
Thailand's foreign currency credit for bonds and notes to junk
status, according to the newspaper The Nation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The international rating agency on Monday lowered Thailand's
foreign-currency bonds and notes rating to Ba1 from Baa3,
affecting all 11 major Thai commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The news of the downgrading only moderately affected the stock
exchange and money market as the downgrade had already been
discounted by the markets as expected.
</P>
<P>
A dealer of Bangkok Bank, which was also affected, said, "It
did not give us a big shock and the market reacted moderately to
the news. We have begun to get used to downgrades."
</P>
<P>
The baht dropped slightly on the news, with Bangkok Bank
quoting a high of 47.2, a low of 46.4, and a close of 47.2 to the
U.S. dollar. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index finished
8.3 points, or 2.15 percent, lower to close at 376.95 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers and analysts admit that amidst the persistent economic
slump, the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
However, they say the downgrade will affect outstanding and
future debt instruments issued by Thai corporations and state
agencies and will significantly increase the cost of new
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Reducing Thai foreign currency bonds and notes to junk status
may also limit the chances of local banks and finance companies to
raise funds internationally, they noted. For instance, because of
the higher risks, U.S. financial institutions are not permitted to
invest in junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
This will mean that foreign capital is not likely to flow back
into the country as earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
Moody's downgrading of Thailand's foreign currency credit
reflects foreign investors' continued concern over the country's
credit and financial fundamentals, the analysts said.

During the latest round of talks over the weekend in Panama
City, Panamanian negotiator Jorge Eduardo Ritter and his

Boyd said that negotiators also agreed on the U.S. military
presence at the MADC, saying that military personnel will be
working in the center in very specific tasks.

KIEV, December 22 (Xinhua) -- British Petroleum (BP) is
planning to invest 50 million U.S. dollars over the next 18 months
in developing a gas field in Ukraine's Dnipro-Donetsk Basin,
reports said Monday..
</P>
<P>
State Geology Committee Chairman Sergy Goshovsky said the
meeting between Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and
BP Managing Director Dick Olver had yielded an agreement over the
investment. Pustovoitenko anticipated the creation of a
Ukrainian-British gas extraction joint venture to develop the
field.
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum first started prospecting for gas in the
Dnipro-Donetsk Basin last March. Results of preliminary surveys
say the field holds 500 billion cubic meters of gas, with perhaps
more than twice that amount still unexplored.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted BP officials as saying that by 2015 the field
could be producing 50 billion cubic meters per year, more than
half of Ukraine's present annual consumption of gas.

The PLA soldiers started to plant trees when they moved

<HEADLINE> Another Group Suspected of Role in Sri Lanka Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A series of recent bomb
attacks on electricity transformers in Sri Lanka have alerted
police intelligence to probe whether another organized violent
group other than the LTTE was involved in these destructive
activities.
</P>
<P>
Police in Colombo said Tuesday they are carrying out
investigations to track down those responsible and government
analysts have been also called in to offer help.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been rocked by a spate of blasts targeted at
electricity transformers recently.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a main transformer of the Jayanthipura Power
Substation was bombed, cutting off power supply to Polonnaruwa
Town in North Central Province.
</P>
<P>
In Bandarawela, Uva Province, two heavy-duty transformers were
damaged last Thursday when two explosive devices went off
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Similar incidents have also been reported in Badulla, capital
of Uva Province in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Police had previously blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) for the attacks. But now they are also looking into
the possibility that the blasts were carried out by an unknown
violent group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police investigations into the explosion of fuel
tanks at a private gas station in Hatton, Central Province, early
this month have revealed that it was the work of a local gang and
not the LTTE.

<HEADLINE> Chile: Air Traffic to Grow 4 Times Heavier by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Expected to Slow Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian economy is
estimated to grow at a rate of less than 3 percent in 1998 due to
unstable regional economic growth following the currency turmoil
in Southeast Asia and Far East this year, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
The estimated growth is realistic enough because the worst
impact of the crisis will be felt in 1998, Mari Elka Pangestu,
executive director of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said at a seminar on economy here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia recorded an economic growth rate of 7.9 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country is still influenced by uncertainties affecting
regional growth and by the monetary turmoil in countries such as
South Korea and Japan, Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted Pangestu
as saying.
</P>
<P>
If the uncertainties were also experienced by China and Japan,
the impact would eventually spread to the United States and the
aftermath of the uncertainties would be felt all over the world,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She also predicted that inflation in the country this year
would exceed 10 percent, much higher than last year's 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country may see even higher inflation next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Anggito Abimanyu, an economic observer at Gajah Mada
University, said Indonesia's economic growth would be at the level
of 2-3 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the decline to a decrease in consumption,
investment and the state budget.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, has dropped
by more than 100 percent against the U.S. dollar since early July
this year following the monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Paying Attention to White Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Yao Tong, owner of a food shop
in the southern part of Beijing, saw a plastic bag waving in the
wind on the top of a tree in front of his shop, and found a pole
to pick it down, then threw it into a trash can.
</P>
<P>
Yao said, "Many TV programs are encouraging people to control
white pollution and lots of environmental protection officials and
policemen are cleaning the streets these days."
</P>
<P>
After the leaves falling down in the crisp winter, many plastic
bags can be found hanging on the trees along Beijing's main
streets. This year the municipal government decided to take
measures to control the white pollution including the rampant
quick food boxes thrown by people carelessly.
</P>
<P>
One of the city's aims is to reclaim 30 percent of the waste
boxes especially in the tourist areas and the commercial streets,
said an official.
</P>
<P>
The shops and markets are prohibited from offering the plastic
bags that can be used for only once, he added.
</P>
<P>
The city's media have strengthen their propagation efforts
among the residents to reclaim the plastic packages.
</P>
<P>
An official from Beijing Municipal Environment and Health
Administration said that the residents should not throw away the
plastic bags carelessly, which may cause difficulties for street
cleaners.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the cleaning work is done by the sanitation
workers. Only a few ordinary citizens do the cleaning work on
their own accord like Yao Tong.
</P>
<P>
However, "to Educate and mobilize the masses" has been one of
the nation's effective ways in doing everything well, including
the fight against white pollution, said the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy will provide 20 billion
lire (11.4 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Albania to help further
stablize the country which suffered widespread unrest triggered by
collapse of pyramid investment schemes earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The package, aimed at protecting women and children, creating
jobs and encouraging Albanians to stay in their own country, was
put forth by Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano and Social
Affairs Minister Livia Turoo.
</P>
<P>
Of the aid money, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
will get 3.4 billion lire (2 million dollars), the International
Social Service will get 1.5 billion (870,000 dollars) for programs
to help Albanian youths in Italy return home, and various
non-governmental organizations and local agencies will receive
14.5 billion (8.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The package contains measures that seek to create jobs for
women, thus protecting them from the prostitution rings, Turoo
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 children in poor families will also benefit from the
package, which will provide aid for their education and create
family centers for those minors most at risk, he added.
</P>
<P>
Programs to help alcoholics and drug addicts will also be
started.
</P>
<P>
A team of Italian and Albanian experts will monitor the aid
efforts and evaluate their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Italy led the international effort to restore order in the
troubled Balkan country. More than 17,000 Albanians fled to Italy
during and in the wake of the unrest.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Shanghai, A Paradise for Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has become a place
where foreigners think they can make huge profits and they have
actually done so.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shanghai Committee for Foreign Investment
show that during the first 11 months of this year foreign-funded
firms in Shanghai poured in 4.89 billion US dollars of additional
investment, accounting for 17 percent of the total foreign capital
flowing into the city.
</P>
<P>
"We have drawn benefit from investing in China, and Shanghai is
our first stop in China," said a senior executive of the
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago the company brought only five million US
dollars to began its adventure in Shanghai, a traditional paradise
for foreign investors since early this century.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors eyed the Squibb as a stone to test the
water on the Chinese market. To date, the successful company has
increased its investment by more than 20 million US dollars in
Shanghai alone, and its investment in the whole China has
ballooned to 100 million.
</P>
<P>
More companies have been following the road the Squibb
pioneered to increase investment. From January to September this
year, more than 10 Japanese companies have doubled their
investment in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Rhone-Poulence group from France has recently built a
technology park in Shanghai, involving a total of 24 million US
dollars. "This is just a beginning for us. We will continue to
expand our business in China," said Jean-Marc Bruel, deputy
president of the transnational corporation.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the fever to the good economic and
political situation in Shanghai, and in China as a whole, which
has made foreign economic giants to renew their China strategies.
</P>
<P>
Investment at a large scale and in a systematic way has become
the latest trend, economists say, with more capital flowing to
sectors of finance, insurance and trade.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that some investors from the US, Japan and the
European Community thought that Shanghai is a moderately developed
society and its comprehensive conditions are good for business
operation.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government's efforts in improving
investment environment, in addition to the central government's
policy of developing the Yangtze River valley with Shanghai at the
leading position, have also drawn foreigners' attention,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
They add that foreign investors are confident in Shanghai
because it has a 100-year-old tradition of developing modern
commerce and trade, and it is now the largest industrial city and
the centers of finance, commerce and shipping in China.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 80 percent of foreign-funded firms in Shanghai have
reported good results.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government has vowed to guarantee a
normalized market for foreign businessmen, and it says that the
added investment by those already operational in Shanghai will
account for one-fourth of the newly attracted foreign capital
around the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> New Plasterboard Production Line For Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese-designed
plasterboard production line started operation recently in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A panel from the State Administration for Building Materials
and other departments has just completed an appraisal of the line,
which is owned by Beijing New Building Materials Public
Ltd. (BNBM).
</P>
<P>
The production line, the second of its kind for the company, is
capable of producing 20 million sq m of plaster boards a year. The
operation of the new production line will reduce production cost
and improve competitiveness of the company's products on the
market, the company executive said.
</P>
<P>
BNBM is China's biggest base for producing new-type building
materials and at present, its products hold more than 50 percent
of the country's plaster boards market share.
</P>
<P>
Corporate sources say that two other technical upgrading
projects are being built in the company. A mineral wool acoustic
ceiling production line is under production and is expected to
start operation on July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the construction of the two projects will

The season turned an upside down in late October when Chinese
famous coach Ma Junren let his younger generation of "Ma's family
army" smash all the year-best marks from the women's 800m to
marathon at the Chinese National Games in Shanghai, a repeat
miracle Ma's troop displayed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Jiang Bo, 1995 world number one, ran 14
minutes and 28.09 seconds to set a new 5,000m world record.
</P>
<P>
Another incredible achievement came when Li Xuemei, a second
round qualifier in the 100m in Athens, hit the tape in 10.79
seconds, a time much faster than the world champion's clocking.
</P>
<P>
The sudden burst of excellence was a sharp contrast to China's
medal-free finish at the world championships, and this elicited
whispers again that the Chinese were taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the doping suspicion found no ground as all Ma's
soldiers and Li passed IAAF drug tests.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw a grotesque 150-meter race between Canadian
Bonovan Bailey and American Michael Johnson to prove who was the
world fastest human.
</P>
<P>
But sadly, it was a production in which the distinction
between good and evil were somewhat blurred.
</P>
<P>
The race, offering a record one million U.S. dollars for the
winner, turned out a great fuss, and disappointed the world TV
viewers and IAAF as well.
</P>
<P>
Bailey led the way off the curve with a visible lead, but
Johnson, the Athlete of the World last year, grabbed his left
thigh painfully in the wake, and limped to a stop.
</P>
<P>
"I felt the cramp grab, then it let go. I kept going, but I
felt it again and it was much worse," claimed Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't pull up, he's a chicken. I think what we should do
is run this race over so I can kick his ass one more time,"
retorted Bailey.
</P>
<P>
The race aimed to promote track and field profile, but created
madness instead.
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis of the United States, owner of nine Olympic golds,
bid farewell to the track and field after a glorious career at
age of 37.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Bubka, who has broken the world record for 35 times in
the men's pole vault, underlined his superiority by landing the
world title in a record six times at the Athens Worlds, which
marked a time of transition for the sport.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones of the United States, a Lewis style
sprinter-jumper and an outstanding leader of young rising stars,
won the world women's 100m title and the crown of the Woman
Athlete of the Year.
</P>
<P>
Just before the world championships, the biennial IAAF
Congress voted to amend doping bans. Despite the relative
lopsided vote, some Congress members believed that the new policy
would make it cheaper to cheat.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandr Bagach, who won the men's shotput world title at the
meet, was one of the five caught in Athens, and his gold medal
was stripped off.
</P>
<P>
Commending on the revised doping sanctions, Nebiolo said he
wanted to focus on what athletes did on the track or field,
rather than on what "turned up in their pee-pee."
</P>
<P>
IAAF also introduced a new Golden League including six elite
meetings for next season. The League will have a jackpot of one
million dollars to be divided equally amongst all athletes
winning his or her Golden League events and the Grand Prix final.
</P>
<P>
With a low key season looming in the year to come, IAAF will
trim off the prize money to 50,000 dollars for each world record
breaker in the League events.
</P>
<P>
Money is an effective incentive indeed, but sometimes it also
creates unpleasant odds and ends.
</P>
<P>
Is it a lesson IAAF has learned from this season?

BUENOS AIRES, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 Buenos Aires
dwellers have expressed this year their willingness to bestow
their organs, the Buenos Aires Provincial Health Ministry`s Center
of Ablation and Implants (Cubaiba) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Cubaiba`s report says that the will to donate organs and

From 1992 to 1996, ablations rose by 21 times and operations
performed by the Cubaiba increased by 13 times.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 only nine ablations were done, 81 were done in 1993;
115 in 1994; 165 in 1995 and 188 last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the increment in the donation of organs allowed
to hit the record amount of 14 donors per one million inhabitants

BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Designs for 82 major
architectural projects, including cultural facilities, squares and
office buildings in the Chinese capital city have been on display
here.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Architectural Design Exhibition has featured more
culture-related projects than the three previous ones, with
designs of museums, teaching and research facilities, and media and
publication programs accounting for one of third of the total.
</P>
<P>
On display are outstanding designs such as a 30,900-sq-m
Chinese Modern Literature Museum featuring the traditional Chinese
garden style, a cluster of buildings for the Science College of
Qinghua University which will be in perfect harmony with existing
buildings in the Qinghua campus, which is an established example
of good architecture among Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Three planned squares have caught the attention of architectors
and the public. Two of them, the Xidan Cultural Square and the
Yuyuantan Park Square, will be along the Chang'an Avenue -
Beijing's east-west thoroughfare - just like the Tian'anmen
Square, and the third in front of the Beijing West Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
The annual exhibition not only displays latest designs by local
architecture, but also feature a series of lectures and a
selection of the best designs. More important, it provides a
chance for public participation in the capital's designing.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi's Sugar Production to Hit 2.6 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region is expected to produce 2.6 million tons of cane
sugar this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the growing area of sugar canes has
amounted to 460,000 hectares in the region this year, a rise of
about 6,666 hectares over last year's comparable figure. Some 24
million tons of sugar canes will be harvested for sugar
production, up 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is a major sugar production base of China and has been
placed the first in the country for cane sugar output in a
succession of five years. It produced 2.35 million tons of cane
sugar last year.
</P>
<P>
To improve economic efficiency, different localities of the
region have expanded reform in sugar-making enterprises over the
past years, and many sugar-making factories have united to tap
business potentials.
</P>
<P>
The overall strength of the sugar-making industry has been
strengthened thanks to the implementation of a unified management
and marketing measures.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the state has also practiced a range of macro
control measures, including controlling sugar imports, cracking
down on sugar smuggling and initiating a special fund to support
implementation of a provisional sugar reserve system, making it
possible for sugar to enter the market in a balanced way according
to changing market demands.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Laid-off Workers Changing Unemployment Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Only a decade ago,
unemployment was still shameful in the eyes of common Chinese
workers, who believed that only people who made major mistakes
would lose their "iron rice-bowl".
</P>
<P>
"I was totally depressed in 1993 when the director of our
factory told me that I was being laid-off," recalled Zhang Shaoyi,
a 43-year-old vegetable salesman who used to work as head of the
general office of a medium-sized factory in Tieling City in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has done really well since then, however, and is proud of
his recent success. "Being laid-off was not something totally bad,
since it at least encouraged me to depend on myself and improve my
reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is not the only one of many workers who have had to
change their attitude toward unemployment, and who have had some
success in their new careers.
</P>
<P>
As China's old industrial base, Liaoning once had as many as
two million laid-off workers, but half of them have found new jobs
since 1994, and a recent study found that 90 percent of the
laid-off workers do not consider collectively-owned enterprises
being inferior to state-owned ones the way they used to. Many are
willing to become self-employed if they can make a fortune in
their new career.
</P>
<P>
Ding Chunlin, the secretary-general of the Re-employment
Research Association of Liaoning, said that, with the increasing
reforms, an increasing number of laid-off workers have come to see
that getting rid of redundant personnel is something that happens
in factories.
</P>
<P>
And, according to Dai Mingxun, the provincial labor
department's director, the changing attitudes have provided labor
departments with a good chance to find new jobs for laid-off
workers.

<HEADLINE> Big Money Creates Insane Results (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Money is not always a good
thing, at least this was somewhat true for world track and field,
in the year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
With prize money paved on the track of the Worlds for the
first time, Wilson Kipketer and a bunch of African gangling
runners plotted some cunning tricks to tarnish the world
championships, but salvaged an otherwise bleak season with a late
burst of record-cracking spree.
</P>
<P>
The year witnessed that the International Amateur Athletics
Association (IAAF) bent its obstinate head to the
boycott-threatening world elite by offering prize money to the
medal winners and world record setters at the Athens meet.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the championships a summit meeting of the
global best, a wild-card policy hastily set in motion by IAAF
president Prime Nebiolo to avoid the absences of American
superstars Michael Johnson, Gail Devers and other defending
champions.
</P>
<P>
IAAF even took a brave step to reduce the term of suspensions
for the use of steroids and other anabolics agents from four
years to two, and replaced the three-month punishment for less
serious drugs with a public warning.
</P>
<P>
After all these done, IAAF made the world believe that in the
birthplace of the modern Olympic movement, a new Athens' myth
would be created, and a number of world records would be
shattered.
</P>
<P>
But the whole thing ended like a hot joke.
</P>
<P>
No world records were set, an unprecedent shame in the meet
history, though an eye-popping cash of $100,000 offered right
there.
</P>
<P>
Only three world individual year best marks emerged during the
nine days, and only 10 of 44 Atlanta Olympic champions earned
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Nebiolo, who masterminded the revolution of the track and
field, smelt a rat in the matter, but dared not to show his fury
at the end of his rope. If money is not the right thing to boost
athletes morale, what else?
</P>
<P>
Soon, crazy things exploded, in a blitz speed and a bizarre
manner. In a spell of two weeks after the championships, five
Africans blasted away world records seven times in four track
events. A phantasmagoria the sport had never experienced.
</P>
<P>
And moreover, the conspiracy got what they wanted -- 100,000
dollars for each record equally offered by IAAF at the less
prestigious Grand Prix meets.
</P>
<P>
At the Zurich Grand Prix meet on August 13, three days off the
Athens meet, three scintillating world records obliterated in an
electrifying 70-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan-turned-Dane Kipketer, who had lowered the world indoor
800 meters world record twice and tied the outdoor mark earlier,
shattered the 16-year-old record in one minute 41.24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Then came the killing surge of Wilson Boit Kipketer in the
steeplechase. The Kenyan world champion, who is not related to
the famed 800m hero, flashed all the way to romp home in 7:59.08,
beating Moses Kiptanui's world record by 0.01 second.
</P>
<P>
"I hope my eight brothers and three sisters at home will
celebrate the record," beamed the 23-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, who set the 10,000m world
record in July, brought the packed crowd to their feet when the
tiny man with a huge heart crossed the line with another amazing
record in the 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as a terrorist on the track, the smiling dwarf murdered
world champion Daniel Komen of Kenya in cold blood with a late
relentless explosion, clocking 12:41.86.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie's smile frozen on the face nine days later when
he heard two heart-broken news -- his miraculous double records
were swept into a rubbish can by a pair of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Having left Zurich somewhat miffed at losing his 5,000m world
record -- and especially at how it was lost -- Komen wanted to
land a punch on his rival's smiling face, and he finally made it
at Brussels Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Komen's race was quite the antithesis of a Gebrselassie run.
For the Kenyan, the pace was quick but quite metronomic
throughout. Yet the result was just fabulous -- 12:39.74, more
than two seconds faster than the short-lived record.
</P>
<P>
Poul Tergat's 26:27.85 performance in the 10,000m dropped a
handful salt in Gebrselassie's fresh wound. The Ethiopian had
made a vow in Athens: "If someone beats my world record, I will

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq Acts Better than Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is quietly acceding to
the demands of the arms-monitoring teams despite Iraq's hard-nosed
rhetoric about limiting U.N. weapons inspections, a senior U.S.
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government says publicly that it did not let UNSCOM
(U.N. Special Commission) go to certain places, but it has not
blocked the teams from doing their job, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
On the ground, the inspectors "have not been refused access to
any site," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the inspectors had sought access to any site that Iraq
has declared off-limits, the official said: "The Iraqis have not
provided a list of what is off-limits, so it's hard to know what
those places are."
</P>
<P>
But he said Iraq's public stance on arms inspections was
"unacceptable," and predicted that the U.N. Security Council would
pass a resolution condemning it sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
Iraq briefly expelled U.S. members of the U.N. arms teams in
November on grounds they were spying, sparking a tense standoff
with the United Nations and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration insisted that it has not ruled out any
option while increasing diplomacy in addressing the dispute with
Iraq in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> German Police Ends Greenpeace Blockade of Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- German police has put an end to a
14-hour dramatic blockade of a plutonium shipment launched by
Greenpeace protesters early today in the northern German port of
Bremerhaven, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Ten German maritime police officers had spend several hours to
release the seven Greenpeace protesters who chained themselves to
the entry ramp of a ferry early this morning in a move to prevent
the plutonium from being loaded. The police operation was taken
after several hours of fruitless negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports a police spokesman as saying that the ferry had
already left Bremerhaven this evening for Scotland where its
59-kilogram highly radioactive cargo will be reprocessed.
</P>
<P>
The plutonium stemming from a nuclear research center in
Karlsruhe had been transported to Bremerhaven from a storage depot
in Hanau. The Greenpeace had demanded the nuclear materials be
sent back to Hanau and called on the port authorities to declare a
future ban on similar shipments to abroad.
</P>
<P>
Before the police moved in to end the Greenpeace blockade, the
plutonium shipment had to be secured in a container storage area
in the Bremerhaven port.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading German research
institute Monday said it expected Germany's unemployment to worsen
in the coming months in the wake of declining business confidence.
</P>
<P>
Ifo-Institute in Munich based the prediction on its November
survey results, which showed the business climate index in western
Germany slipped to 99.1 points from 99.7 points in October, while
that in the eastern Germany down to 102.9 points from 103.5
points.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the western part of the country are faced with
weaker foreign demand, and those in the eastern area see business
climate no longer as favorable as in past months.
</P>
<P>
The institute, one of Germany's six leading economic think
tanks, pointed out particularly dark prospects for Germany's
construction sector, expecting one third of building companies in
the west and 53 percent of those in the east to reduce jobs.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted job losses in the wholesale and retail
sector, saying that 12 percent of retailers in the west and 20
percent of those in the east were considering cutting payrolls due
to a drop in sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the institute revised its 1998 economic growth
projection down to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent it previously
forecast.

</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's major index sank 3.4 percent to its

Zagreb, December 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
told the leaders of Bosnia's three ethnic people Monday they must
safeguard peace and pledged to support those who were ready to
build a united Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On one-day visit to political leaders and U.S. forces serving
under the NATO-led peacekeeping force, Clinton made heartfelt
speech in the city's ornate national theater after walking through
the town.
</P>
<P>
"I come before you with a message for those in whose hands the
future of Bosnia lies-its leaders and its people. For in the end
future is up to you," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Bosnia's three ethnic factions had made a
"fateful choice for peace when they signed the Dayton peace
accords in Ohio two year ago, ending the country's three and a
half year war, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But this responsibility and yours did not end there on that
day. In fact it only began. Your responsibility is to turn the
documents signed in Dayton into a living reality."
</P>
<P>
"To make good on the pledge to bring Bosnia together in one
county with two multi-ethnic parts sharing a common destiny."
</P>
<P>
In a clear warning to those who have obstructed the peace
process, Clinton said,"those who rise to that responsibility will
have the full support of the United States and the international
community. Those who shirk it will isolate themselves."
</P>
<P>
"The world which continues to invest in your peace rightfully
expects that you will do you part," Clinton told the leaders."More
importantly, the people of this country expect results and they
deserve them."
</P>
<P>
He said the people of Bosnia had to make their desire for peace
and a common future clear" to their leaders and support them in
the hand decision needed for a common future.
</P>

The U.S. president and his entourage were flying this afternoon
to the northeastern town of Tuzla where he was meeting U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 22 (Xinhua) - British Agriculture Minister
Jack Cunningham announced an 85 million pounds (136 million US
dollars)aid package for its beleaguered livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
The move follows widespread protests by farmers who complain
their businesses are in danger because of the high value of
sterling and the European Union ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) welcomed the news of support
package to beef and sheep farmers, saying it is a "lifeline" to
some and bring relief to the beef sector.
</P>
<P>
But NFU President David Naish warned a level playing field
between UK and other EU farmers had not been restored.
</P>
<P>
The British government's call for a restructuring in the
European farming industry would continue, he added.
