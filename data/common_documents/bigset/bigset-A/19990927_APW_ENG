<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of revenge and  
wrongful imprisonment, did some solid time at the box office as the 
weekend's top movie earner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, ``Double Jeopardy''  
debuted with a three-day total of $23.7 million, according to 
industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue Streak'' dropped to No. 2 in  
its second weekend with $13.2 million. Eight weeks into its run, 
the Bruce Willis ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained in third 
place with $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's other major debuts opened weakly. The somber  
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams as a widower who cheers 
up fellow Jewish ghetto residents with fake reports of Allied 
victories over the Nazis, was eighth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mumford,'' an ensemble comedy about psychotherapy in a small  
town from ``The Big Chill'' director Lawrence Kasdan, took in $2 
million for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	With Judd as the wrongly accused suspect and Jones in his latest  
fugitive-hunter role, ``Double Jeopardy'' was an action movie that 
appealed to women and men, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd plays a woman whose husband faked his own death and framed  
her for the killing. Jones plays her parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount pitched the movie well to movie-goers, Dergarabedian  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a terrific marketing campaign. It was everywhere,''  
Dergarabedian said. ``This is a perfect case of a movie that was 
not going to fly in under the radar. It was positioned as a top 
fall entry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film takes its title from the legal precept that a defendant  
cannot be tried twice for the same crime -- meaning that since 
Judd's character already has been punished for her husband's 
murder, she can now hunt him down without consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea resonated with audiences in the same way the premise of  
Robert Redford's ``Indecent Proposal'' did, said Wayne Lewellen, 
distribution president for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?  
That's a simple, quick concept that's easy to grasp,'' Lewellen 
said. ``I think people were drawn to the concept that she could 
shoot her husband on Main Street and they couldn't do anything to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jakob the Liar'' was hurt by its grim subject matter and mixed  
reviews, said Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity 
for the movie's distributor, Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also was a tough sell coming on the heels of Roberto  
Benigni's Holocaust hit ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which won three 
Oscars, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a couple of films of similar subject matter and  
the second film out doesn't get as strong reviews, that's where 
you're hurt by it,'' Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' the summer's box office surprise, has taken in  
$225.1 million and moved ahead of ``Aladdin'' as Disney's 
second-highest grossing film behind ``The Lion King,'' which made 
$312 million. Edging past ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Sixth Sense'' also 
climbed into the top 20 all-time moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Blue Streak,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $8.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``For Love of the Game,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty, $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stigmata,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Stir of Echoes,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Jakob the Liar,'' $2.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mumford,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Runaway Bride,'' $1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Nike Links Up With Web Marketer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Can dot.com sales make the swoosh cooler?  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Nike's move to sell its full product line for the  
next six months at fogdog.com, a Web-only sporting goods retailer, 
might make it so. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's deal between Nike and Fogdog Sports is a strategic step  
into Internet commerce that could boost the shoe giant's image 
among cyber-savvy young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing is how do you tap into the youth market,  
become cool again and talk their language?'' asked Josie Esquivel, 
an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Certainly, this is one 
of the major ways of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Nike gave Fogdog the right to sell a wider  
range of products until March 2000. In exchange, it bought 12 
percent of the start-up's shares. That's nearly 6.2 million shares 
of Fogdog common stock at $1.03 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogdog, which filed for a public stock offering on Friday,  
expects to see the stock open at several times that price when 
shares begin trading in three months. The company, based in Redwood 
City, Calif., sells more than 15,000 athletic products, including 
about 160 Nike goods on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Nike has avoided selling its goods at Web-only  
stores. The company's turnaround comes as six major sporting goods 
retailers are about to go online. Global Sports is expected to 
launch e-commerce sites at the close of fourth quarter for Sports 
Authority, Sports and Recreation, Athlete's Foot, Sport Chalet, and 
MC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nike realizes that the fourth quarter will be a significant  
period for e-commerce in the sporting goods arena,'' said Bob 
McGee, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligencer, a national sports 
newsletter. ``They clearly wanted their position defined by then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nike chairman Phil Knight said Monday that it wasn't until last  
year that the company recognized the Internet as a meaningful 
source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web represents a true revolution,'' Knight said. ``Our  
reaction to that was to step back and try to understand it. We 
think we've got our arms around it a little better now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Fogdog is only 3 years old and has less than $10  
million in annual sales, Knight said he considers it a leader among 
online sporting goods retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogdog was founded in 1994 by three Stanford University  
roommates who wanted to design Web sites for sporting-goods 
companies. Four years later, Fogdog started its first Web site, 
SportSite.com, later changed to fogdog.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harrington, chief executive officer at Fogdog, said the  
partnership with a company of Nike's stature is yet another sign 
that online retailing is for real. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more than a partnership between two companies, it's a  
partnership in a different paradigm,'' he said. ``It's true 
recognition the Internet is a powerful channel for online retailing 
and a great move forward for the consumer.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks finished slightly lower today as hopes  
waned for Japanese central bank intervention to weaken the yen. The 
dollar fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 50.67 points,  
or 0.30 percent, to close the day's trading at 16,821.06. On 
Friday, the average closed down 454.03 points, or 2.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.14 yen, down 0.28 yen from late Friday in  
Tokyo and below its late New York level of 104.17 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices suffered in the absence of  
central bank intervention after a weekend economic meeting of the 
Group of Seven industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders had believed Japan's central bank would buy dollars  
today morning to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the expression of shared concern at the Washington  
meeting, Japan could still not get a clear pledge from other G-7 
members for joint action to weaken the surging yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials believe that the yen has strengthened too  
much and could derail a budding economic recovery. A higher yen 
makes Japanese exports less cost-competitive in global markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has bought dollars in its currency markets several times  
this summer to curb the yen's gains, but without success. As 
recently as May, the greenback bought more than 124 yen, but the 
dollar since has fallen about 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is disappointment that the BOJ acted as usual,'' said  
Kazunori Jinnai of Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed  
at 10,279.33 points, down 39.26, or 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.04 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,429.38. 
The TOPIX closed down 48.86 points, or 3.3 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 346.72 million shares, down from 640.35 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 665 to 525, while 141  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar met selling pressure by U.S.  
investors after the Bank of Japan decided against intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 103.90 yen and 106.00 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.13 yen, down  
from 109.55 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.6900 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7000 percent. Its price 
rose 0.08 points to 100.08.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall as Stock Prices Gain / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Monday as a mild rebound in the  
United States stock market caused investors to reverse course from 
last week's strategy of fleeing stocks for safer government-backed 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/8 points,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose above the psychological 6 percent 
benchmark to 6.01 percent from 5.96 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the 30-year Treasury's yield fell below 6 percent  
for the first time in nearly a month in the wake of several days of 
stock market losses. Investors tend to flee to the relative safety 
of the bond markets when the riskier stock market drops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.06 points Monday to  
10303.39, the first gain in five sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were down 1/16 to 1/8 point, while intermediate maturities rose 3/16 
to 13/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Monday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.85 percent, as the discount rose 0.07 percentage point 
from Friday to 4.72 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.99 percent 
as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.80 percent. 
One-year yields rose to 5.16 percent as the discount rose 0.03 
percentage point to 4.90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 percent from 5.25 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 to 113 3/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index rose to 5.85 percent from 5.83 percent.

<HEADLINE> Huskies at Home Against Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- With their Pac-10 season opening at home Saturday  
night, Washington coach Rick Neuheisel thinks his team is mentally 
ready to become a Rose Bowl contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is much easier to start a week off of a victory than it is  
with the alternative,'' the Huskies' first-year coach said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel got his first win in Seattle over the weekend when the  
Huskies beat Colorado, Neuheisel's old school, 31-24. That allowed 
Washington to avoid its first 0-3 start since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're feeling good about ourselves,'' Neuheisel said. ``If  
anything, the victory should lead to more urgency -- to wanting to 
turn up the heat even a little bit more on how we go about 
practicing and how we go about executing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what appears to be a wide-open Pac-10 race, Washington will  
open up with No. 25 Oregon (3-1). The Ducks started off their 
conference schedule with a triple-overtime win over Southern 
California on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel has a 2-0 lifetime coaching record against Oregon's  
Mike Bellotti, but he wanted to point out a different statistic: 
The Ducks have won four times in the past five years against 
Washington -- winning 27-22 in Eugene last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that our players get ready,'' Neuheisel said.  
``Certainly, they already have a healthy respect for Oregon given 
the state of events during the last five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In four seasons at Colorado, Neuheisel faced Bellotti's Ducks  
twice in bowl games. Colorado defeated Oregon 38-6 in the 1997 
Cotton Bowl and 51-43 in Honolulu's Aloha Bowl last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a little different in terms of preparation,'' Neuheisel  
said. ``So our studies were probably more thorough in those games 
because you've probably got more than a month to get ready for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Stanford leading the Pac-10 standings at 3-0 and preseason  
league favorite Arizona at 1-1, the Huskies are asking themselves: 
Can we win this thing? 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no one that can say they're not able to play with  
anybody else in this conference,'' Neuheisel said. ``It really is 
wide open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's Akili Smith was the third overall pick in April's NFL  
draft, but the Huskies have a lot of respect for his replacement, 
A.J. Feeley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oregon has done a great job of knowing who they are, of  
replacing their skilled athletes with more skill,'' Neuheisel said. 
``Feeley looks to be a guy who's getting better on a weekly 
basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies aren't expected to have their top tailback, Braxton  
Cleman, ready for the Oregon game. The sophomore is Washington's 
leading rusher with 130 yards on 17 carries this season. He injured 
his hip in the first quarter against Colorado, but X-rays were 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel listed him as questionable for the Oregon game.

<HEADLINE> More Baby Steps for Infant Browns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Expansion isn't the reason wideout Leslie  
Shepherd dropped two passes Sunday, and it can't be blamed for 
rookie quarterback Tim Couch getting sacked on his own 2-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Shepherd is concerned, the Baltimore Ravens didn't  
hand the expansion Cleveland Browns their third straight loss. The 
Browns did. 
</P>
<P>
	Expansion wasn't the culprit in the 17-10 loss, execution was.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think our quarterback is better,'' Shepherd said. ``I think  
our wide receivers are better. I think overall we've got a better 
team. We just didn't go out and play like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, for the second straight week the Browns did play like  
they belonged back in the NFL. That wasn't so certain following a 
43-0 embarrassment against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 1. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't win these last two weeks, but they had a chance to.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had our opportunities,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.  
``I think our team is continuing to grow and get better. It was our 
best game as a team. It just wasn't quite good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer did see signs of improvement on both sides of the ball.  
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland's defense, which had given up 438 yards per game,  
played much more aggressively despite dressing just seven defensive 
backs and finished with three interceptions and four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sixty offensive plays, more than doubling Cleveland's Week 1  
output, which finally gave the defense some rest. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Couch remained poised despite getting blitzed on nearly every  
snap and countered a rough day passing by scrambling for 49 yards -- 
twice for first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tried to make things happen,'' Palmer said of his young QB.  
``I'm not disappointed in how Tim's playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What did upset Palmer were two costly fumbles -- one by Couch on  
a sack near the Browns' goal line, and another by linebacker Lenoy 
Jones, who after making a beautiful pick deep in Baltimore 
territory, was stripped and gave it right back to the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	And without criticizing the officiating, Palmer pointed to a  
crucial pass interference penalty against Browns cornerback Ryan 
McNeil on a 45-yard pass to Raghib Ismail in the third quarter 
which set up the Ravens' second TD and gave Baltimore a 17-3 lead. 
TV replays showed Ismail pushed off on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Palmer isn't making excuses for his team. He knows the new  
Browns have a long way to go before they can compete with the NFL's 
elite, but before they can win they have to learn how to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team sees light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said. ``We  
just have to see more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Sunday's loss, Shepherd was down on himself for two  
balls he let slip through his hands, one which stopped a drive in 
the third quarter and killed momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, like many of the other Browns, came to Cleveland via  
free agency realizing the building process would be a slow one. But 
three games in, he thinks the first-year Browns should be further 
along than they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't buy into that expansion stuff,'' he said. ``You've  
just got to get out there and make some plays and execute better. 
I'm not going to blame expansion. What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all pros. We've all been in these situations before. You  
can't make excuses. You have to go out and execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, making his second pro start, did all he could to bring  
the Browns back. He shook off a dreadful first half -- 4-of-14 and 
four sacks -- by throwing an 11-yard TD pass to Kevin Johnson early 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch got the the ball back late, but with a chance to take his  
team downfield for a tying touchdown, he was intercepted trying to 
force a deep ball to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all out there trying to make plays,'' Couch said. ``I  
made some bad throws, and there were some drops, but that's where 
we are right now.''

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Sells Lender's for $275M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kellogg Co., the world's largest maker of ready-to-eat cereal,  
is jettisoning its Lender's Bagel business in another bid to revive 
its sagging stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	The Battle Creek, Mich.-based company said Monday it would sell  
the unit to the owner of Duncan Hines and Log Cabin syrup brands 
for $275 million -- 41 percent below what it paid for Lender's less 
than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is Aurora Foods Inc., a diversified $1 billion food  
company based in San Francisco with brands like Mrs. Butterworth's, 
Van de Kamp's, Mrs. Paul's, Chef's Choice, Aunt Jemima, and 
Celeste. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg had purchased Lender's in 1996 for $466 million. Chief  
executive Carlos Gutierrez, who formally took office in April, had 
said the division's future was questionable because it wasn't 
making money. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was shrugged off by Wall Street, where Kellogg stock  
closed down 31 1/4 cents to $36.68 3/4 in trading Monday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you've got to take a step back before you take one  
forward,'' said John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential 
Securities. ``Next to Quaker's purchase of Snapple, Kellogg's 
purchase of Lender's was one of the dumbest in the food industry in 
the 1990s. ... Kellogg got into the frozen bagel business just as 
everyone else was getting into fresh bagels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Griesemer of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, Inc. in St. Louis, said  
the financially troubled cereal maker still has a long way to go 
before returning to financial health. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still have a number of issues to confront and market  
share continues to shrink,'' Griesemer said. ``There's plenty of 
work to do on a more meaningful level, this is just a little bit of 
housekeeping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes Lender's plants in Mattoon, Ill., and West  
Seneca, N.Y., and is expected to be completed by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	For a limited period of time, Kellogg will supply Aurora with  
bagels from the Lender's plants in New Haven and West Haven, Conn. 
Kellogg is seeking to sell the Connecticut facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg, the maker of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies,  
announced that it expects to record a charge to earnings of 
approximately $170 million before taxes in the current quarter as a 
result of the sale. The company's third-quarter earnings are due 
out Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lender's is a strong brand, but it has not met our growth  
expectations,'' Gutierrez said in a news release. ``This 
divestiture will enable us to focus our resources on the best 
opportunities, both internal and external, to further expand our 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is the latest in a series of changes for Kellogg. In  
addition to Gutierrez' appointment, the company last month 
announced plans to cut 550 jobs by closing most of its Battle Creek 
cereal operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Aurora Foods chairman and chief executive Ian Wilson said he  
expects to grow Lender's sales through the introduction of new 
products and packaging, increased strategic marketing support and 
dedicated management focus. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Aurora about the status of the 650 workers at the two  
affected plants was not immediately returned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lender's number one market share position, strong brand equity  
and 'orphan' status within the Kellogg's organization makes this an 
ideal acquisition for Aurora,'' Wilson said in a news release. 
``Lender's is well suited to Aurora's strategy of acquiring and 
revitalizing undermarketed brands.''

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Wins 94 Percent of Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- President Hosni Mubarak will be sworn in for  
his fourth term, after a vote tally Monday showed he won 94 percent 
of the vote in a weekend referendum on his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	A close ally of the United States, the 71-year-old Mubarak was  
the only candidate in Sunday's yes-or-no vote. It was the first 
time the ``yes'' vote has fallen below 95 percent in a presidential 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Egypt's 24 million eligible voters, 79 percent cast ballots.  
</P>
<P>
	Opposition groups boycotted the vote. Their leaders want  
democracy, including direct, multiparty elections and the lifting 
of the state of emergency which has been in force since President 
Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981. They also want the freedom to 
form political parties and associations, which can only be created 
with the approval of a government committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that Mubarak has called  
for the parliament to convene on Oct. 5, when it is expected he 
will be sworn in for another six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak was quoted in Tuesday's editions of Al Gomhuria  
newspaper as saying there will be a ``major change'' in the new 
government he will form after his new term begins. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cairo was quiet Monday, a day after loudspeakers blared  
Mubarak's praises and busloads of men chanted his name. But 
thousands of banners and posters bearing the president's face still 
hung throughout the city 
</P>
<P>
	In previous referendums, Mubarak received more than 95 percent  
of the vote. In 1993, the last poll, he won 96 percent. During 
Sadat's presidency, the ``Yes'' vote was invariably 99.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak, who took office in 1981, issued a statement thanking  
the people for ``expressing their own free will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 18 years as president, Mubarak has significantly reduced  
Egypt's foreign debt, balanced the budget and cut inflation to 
about 3 percent, making the country one of the more diverse and 
open economies in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak has also played the role of international meditator,  
pushing forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and prodding 
Libya toward surrendering the two suspects wanted for the 1988 
Lockerbie bombing.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Flee Bombing of Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Terrified civilians tried to flee Chechnya  
by the thousands Monday, driven out by a Russian bombing blitz 
intended to crush Islamic militants in the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I were dead,'' mourned Tamara Aliyeva, 70, whose house  
in Grozny was destroyed by Russian bombs. ``I don't know what to do 
or where to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aliyeva joined tens of thousands of Chechens who headed for the  
neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia in hopes of finding 
refuge -- only to find the border closed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grozny, Russian airplanes were raining bombs and missiles for  
the fifth straight day. Witnesses said oil refineries in Grozny 
were ablaze, blanketing the capital in choking black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets also struck other cities and villages throughout  
Chechnya, targeting suspected militant bases along with oil 
derricks and other industrial facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed Monday that 300 people  
had been killed in Grozny alone. The figure could not be 
independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Chechen refugees trapped on the Russian border were in a  
state of shock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is my Mama?,'' 8-year old Liza Temirsultanova kept  
asking between sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandfather, Ayup Temirsultanov, said that Liza's mother,  
baby sister and two brothers had all been killed by Russian bombs 
in Grozny on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing is aimed at weakening Islamic militants, who have  
twice invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in 
recent weeks from their main bases in Chechnya. They also are 
blamed for a series of terrorist bombings in Moscow and other 
Russian cities that have claimed 300 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Monday that the bombing of  
Chechnya would continue ``until the last bandit is destroyed,'' 
according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes have rekindled fears about the possible introduction  
of ground troops into Chechnya, despite a disastrous 1994-96 war in 
which Russian troops were clobbered by a much smaller guerrilla 
force. Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto 
independence, but Moscow claims it is still part of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin tried Monday to allay nervousness  
about a possible repeat of the war, in which Russia often sent 
poorly trained troops into battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia will rely on air raids to knock out infrastructure and  
``patiently, methodically destroy (the militants) from the air,'' 
Putin said. If any Russian troops were deployed, they would be 
highly trained and used only for ``cleanup operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, who says his government is not connected to the  
militants, said in a televised address Sunday that he would exert 
all his efforts to avoid full-scale war and called for a political 
dialogue with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said the Kremlin was planning on a meeting between  
President Boris Yeltsin and Maskhadov, but it wouldn't take place 
until the Chechen leader had denounced terrorism in his republic 
and Moscow was sure the militants couldn't use a meeting to their 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to back away from meetings for the sake of  
meetings, from meetings for the sake of giving militants time to 
lick their wounds and carry out strikes on us from another side,'' 
Putin said after meeting with Yeltsin in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting Monday with Col. Gen. Konstantin Totsky, head of  
the Russian border service, Yeltsin said Russia's borders must be 
strengthened so that weapons or militants cannot enter the North 
Caucasus. The Border Guards are patrolling both Russia's external 
borders and the internal border separating Chechnya from other 
Russian regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, fleeing Chechens headed mostly for Ingushetia. After  
50,000 people had arrived, Ingushetian authorities closed the 
border Sunday. They allowed some refugees to enter on Monday after 
extensive identity document checks, Russia's NTV television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, refugees continued pouring out of Grozny and other  
Chechen towns Monday, camping out in an open field near the border 
village of Sleptsovskaya, 30 miles west of Grozny. Some were taken 
in by local residents, but most had to stay in tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Local authorities were delivering food, medicine, firewood and  
other emergency supplies. Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for 
emergency situations, said he would fly to the region Tuesday to 
assess needs.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Revenue Helps Boston Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Despite its image as a white-collar event played  
in a wealthy town before corporate titans, officials in Brookline 
and neighboring Boston say the Ryder Cup was a pot of gold that 
will benefit everything from local parks to youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
	As the tents came down at The Country Club, and the nation  
basked in the glow of Sunday's incredible U.S. victory, the Boston 
area was left to ring up its share of the profits from a week of 
golf mania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the region has seen an event of this  
magnitude,'' gushed Patrick Moscaritolo, president of the Greater 
Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Local merchants have yet to tally up exact figures, but  
Moscaritolo estimated the Ryder Cup generated $150 million in 
spending in the area as golf fans -- many of them spending corporate 
money -- packed local hotels, restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryder Cup attendees -- 30,000 of whom flocked to the course daily  
-- booked roughly 7,000 hotel rooms per night for six nights last 
week, he said. That's just under half of the Greater Boston area's 
total of 15,000 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues generated by hotel, meal and merchandise taxes also  
gave the local economy a shot in the arm, Moscaritolo said. And 
business was brisk for area workers, from waiters working longer 
hours to taxi drivers shuttling visitors around. 
</P>
<P>
	A Ryder Cup corporate event at Boston's Franklin Park raised  
more than $1 million for the city, to be set aside for Parks 
Department scholarships and children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the future rewards the city will reap after  
putting its best face forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our visitor industry could be cashing checks from Ryder Cup  
well into the next decade,'' he said, pointing to an audience that 
included many CEOs and managers of international companies. ``These 
are high-end decision makers. They can come back with family 
members and friends ... and bring conventions and meetings here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Brookline, where the storied Country Club will receive an  
estimated $5 million for playing host to the event, town officials 
had no complaints as they ticked off a list of improvements made 
possible by the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with The Country Club, the town will receive  
up to $3 million for use of town land for parking and hospitality 
tents, said Town Administrator Richard Kelliher. When it hosted the 
U.S. Open in 1988, Brookline received $146,000, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go into the town's treasury, and roughly $750,000  
is earmarked for the municipal Putterham Meadows golf course, which 
adjoins The Country Club and was shut down to provide parking and 
tents, Kelliher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the leftover money will be used for long-term capital  
improvements, he said.

<HEADLINE> Physician Convicted of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A doctor pleaded no contest to fraud Monday  
for treating dying cancer patients with injections of aloe vera, 
the plant extract used in skin creams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald MacNay, 62, could get up to 30 years in prison at  
sentencing Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNay and his assistant, Ronald Sheetz, treated more than a  
dozen people with an intravenous mixture of aloe vera and the 
chemical element cesium. They told patients the mixture would 
shrink tumors and effectively get rid of them, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment, for which patients paid up to $15,000 each, has  
not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The Virginia 
Board of Medicine said the treatments may have been a factor in the 
deaths of three people. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNay is an orthopedic surgeon with no known cancer training.  
His medical license has been revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheetz, 43, pleaded guilty to prescription fraud and other  
charges in May and was sentenced to six months of home 
incarceration.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Stable Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton expressed hope today that  
``stability and humane policies will be returned to Indonesia'' 
soon in the wake of political unrest in Jakarta and violence in 
independence-minded East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time of great instability and uncertainty for  
them,'' the president said. He spoke in response to questions in 
the Rose Garden after announcing that the U.S. budget surplus had 
climbed to $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. relations with Indonesia have been strained by a siege of  
militia violence, supported by the Indonesian military, in East 
Timor. The United States has suspended military aid and cooperation 
to Indonesia and is considering other steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that ``our relationships with them have to be  
dictated by the course of their conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We should stand against those actions which violate human  
rights and which are wrong, but we should also hope that both 
stability and humane policies will be returned to Indonesia as soon 
as possible,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Indonesia -- the world's fourth-most-populous country  
with 200 million people and the largest Muslim population on Earth 
-- is capable of playing an important, positive role in the future 
of Asia. ``And that's what I hope and pray will happen,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will require responsible leadership from Indonesia, as  
well as appropriate responses from the United States and others,'' 
the president said.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Rescind Galloway Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks on Monday withdrew  
their $35 million contract offer to Joey Galloway and told their 
holdout wide receiver he must play under terms of his existing pact 
if he wants to play at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks met last weekend in Pittsburgh with Galloway's  
agent, Eric Metz. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Seattle (2-1) beat the Steelers 29-10 in Pittsburgh,  
the team issued a terse statement from senior vice president Mike 
Reinfeldt, its top negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our repeated efforts to make Joey Galloway the  
second-highest-paid receiver in the National Football League, talks 
with his representatives in Pittsburgh were unsuccessful,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization has decided it is time to move forward and  
concentrate on the rest of the 1999 season. We formally withdraw 
all previous extension offers and bring to a close all negotiations 
on the issue. In the event Joey decides to honor his existing 
contract for the 1999 season, we would welcome his return. We wish 
Joey well with this very difficult decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the team's statement Monday, Metz said, ``That's  
consistent with what we discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metz, of Scottsdale, Ariz., declined to comment in a telephone  
interview on Galloway's future plans or why a contract agreement 
couldn't be reached, saying only that the Seahawks' decision was 
not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	No Seahawks officials were available to talk about the  
statement. Coach and general manager Mike Holmgren, who seemed 
optimistic last week that something could be worked out, ended his 
news conference Monday by saying a statement was upcoming. The 
short statement was issued a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Freeman of Green Bay became the highest paid receiver in  
the NFL this year when the Packers gave him a $42 million, 
seven-year contract, including a $10 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway was seeking a $25 million, five-year contract that  
would include a $10 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday, the Seahawks were offering him a $35 million,  
seven-year deal that included a $7 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinfeldt and Seahawks vice president of football operations  
Randy Mueller met with Metz in Pittsburgh three times last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren and Galloway did not attend the meetings.  
</P>
<P>
	Galloway caught 65 passes for 1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns last  
season. He was scheduled to earn $1.585 million from the Seahawks 
this season in the final year of a five-year contract that he 
signed as a rookie after the Seahawks made him the eighth overall 
pick in the 1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	His holdout has cost him $93,000 a game, which is 1-17th of the  
salary he was scheduled to earn this season. Holmgren also is 
fining him $5,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks play the Oakland Raiders on Sunday night in the  
Kingdome.

<HEADLINE> Dole Criticizes U.S. Military Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's reliability as an ally and global  
power has eroded under the Clinton administration, which appears to 
rely on opinion polls rather than leadership to craft foreign 
policy, Elizabeth Dole said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a foreign policy address prepared for delivery at South  
Carolina's College of Charleston, the GOP presidential hopeful also 
said Clinton seems to think that with the demise of the Soviet 
Union and the fall of communism in Europe, the United States no 
longer is faced with major threats to its national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ability to advance our interests with the world's major  
powers, and contain its rogue regimes, has waned,'' she said. ``The 
world remains a very dangerous place, and we Americans are today 
even more vulnerable to missile attack than we were seven years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also accused the Clinton White House of turning a blind eye  
to human-rights abuses in China and doing little about Chinese 
thefts of U.S. military secrets or threats to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, Dole said, government officials are enriching  
themselves by stealing billions of dollars of U.S. aid money. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we need to do more even here at home to protect the  
American people from the possibility of foreign attack,'' Dole 
said. ``Both China and North Korea can deliver nuclear bombs on 
Hawaii and Alaska. ... Iraq and Iran have very nearly achieved the 
same capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, in the third foreign policy address of her campaign, vowed  
all that would change if she were in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Dole administration, this era of wishful thinking,  
vacillation and equivocation will end,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would restore the nation's military and build a  
missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Dole said she would:  
</P>
<P>
	--End the United States' adherence to the Anti-Ballistic Missile  
Treaty, which she said is outdated and invalid; 
</P>
<P>
	--Oppose making the United States a party to the Comprehensive  
Test Ban Treaty, which she said is neither effective nor 
verifiable; 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve security at the nation's weapons labs;  
</P>
<P>
	--Work to forge new relations with other major powers. In China,  
she said, her administration would try to promote political reform 
while opening that nation's markets to more U.S. goods and farm 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	She also took a swipe at President Clinton for granting clemency  
recently to a group of Puerto Rican militant nationalists, saying 
she ``could not disagree more strongly'' with the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said her administration would treat ``authoritarian and  
totalitarian states, such as North Korea, as rogue regimes, not as 
our equals.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits 61st Homer, Ties Sosa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark McGwire moved into a tie with Sammy Sosa  
for the major league home run lead today, hitting his 61st off 
Cincinnati's Ron Villone in his second at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive landed in the upper deck in left field, only the 29th  
ball to reach that level in stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
	He got polite applause and a few boos from the fans after the  
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mark McGwire, reaching 60 was much tougher the second time.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the second player to hit 60 twice when he homered  
in the eighth inning Sunday. His solo shot off Cincinnati's Scott 
Sullivan added his name to a couple more categories in the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, McGwire became the third player to hit 400 homers in  
a decade, with his 60th. Babe Ruth had 467 in the 1920s and Jimmie 
Foxx had 415 in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	He also joined Sosa as the only players in the 60-60 club. Sosa  
beat McGwire to this record by hitting his 60th eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Reds rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 in 12  
innings Sunday, McGwire was appreciative and worn down at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a nice year,'' he said. ``Then again, it's been  
probably one of the most difficult years I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire rode an emotional wave last year when he hit No. 60 off  
Cincinnati's Denny Reyes and kept going, stopping at a record 70. 
Sosa reached the 60-homer mark after McGwire and finished at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	From his first day of spring training, McGwire has been asked  
about the chances of hitting 60 or 70 again. He said Sunday that 
the attention combined with the Cardinals' losing season made it 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 60 came in one of the Cardinals' most devastating losses.  
McGwire's homer started a comeback that sent the game to extra 
innings and the Cardinals went ahead in the 12th, only to lose it 
on Pokey Reese's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the field, McGwire lingered for a few moments and  
watched the Reds celebrate on the field. He wished the Cardinals 
could be doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd much rather be in that clubhouse,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to settle for the record book, something that's not  
nearly as appealing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all this stuff will hit me when I'm retired,'' McGwire  
said, sipping from a bottle of water in the crestfallen Cardinals 
clubhouse. ``Obviously it's very meaningful to me. When I'm retired 
I can sit back and think of all I've accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't think that another 60-homer season would be on the  
list. Like Sosa, he thought there was no chance for another 
neck-and-neck race past the 60-homer mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd get there again,'' McGwire said. ``To have  
two people do it in two consecutive years is pretty amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't think we could do it again -- myself  
included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After McGwire's 60th homer, two people who were not at the game  
phoned and bought game tickets as memorabilia. Joe Davis of 
Snellville, Ga., purchased 1,050 and Edmund Urquiza of Burbank, 
Calif., bought 500. The cheapest seat in the stadium is $4. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball landed behind the left-field wall, so the Reds were  
able to retrieve it and give it to McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	It was noteworthy that he got No. 60 in Cincinnati, the place  
where he's been more of a punch-and-Judy hitter than a home run 
king. He finally got his first career homer at Riverfront 
Stadium/Cinergy Field last July 22, connecting off reliever Danny 
Graves in the ninth inning.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Probe L.A. Shoreline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- It's another day at the prehistoric  
beach for Heidi Spenner as she scrapes up a layer of sand with a 
metal spatula, pinches some of the dark gray muck and rolls it 
between her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Geological Survey scientist is examining a patch of  
ancient shoreline, sandy dirt from 400 feet below the surface. It's 
one of many layers of soil that fill the Los Angeles basin and 
affects how violently the ground moves in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers like Spenner say data from a 1,000-foot continuous  
core sample extracted from the border of Long Beach and Los 
Alamitos could give them a clearer picture of how the ground 
shakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers plan to use the information to update seismic hazard  
maps, which can help emergency officials identify areas most prone 
to damage in a quake. Water managers also can use the data to 
understand how seawater intrudes into underground freshwater 
supplies and trace pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, water agencies and oil companies drilled into the  
basin, but they generally were not interested in the details of the 
first 1,000 feet. Oil is generally found at least 3,000 feet below 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazingly, the upper thousand feet of the basin is probably  
the least well understood,'' said Dan Ponti, a USGS geologist who 
is leading the project. ``What we're trying to is ... redefine our 
understanding of the overall framework of the basin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After strong earthquakes like Northridge in 1994, it became  
clear that damage is not evenly spread out from the epicenter -- 
that the soil between snapped rocks and the surface plays a role in 
magnifying or focusing seismic waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope the Long Beach coring project and several  
others planned for southern California can help them understand 
what is happening beneath the feet of the millions of people who 
live in the geologically active area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like not having all of the pieces to a large jigsaw  
puzzle,'' he said. ``We need to find a few critical ones to be able 
to put the puzzle together and see the whole picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of metropolitan Los Angeles sits on the basin, a giant bowl  
surrounded by mountains and ocean. Researchers once believed that 
in an earthquake the whole region shook uniformly like a cup of 
pudding. 
</P>
<P>
	But layers of soil affect earthquake waves differently. Loose  
sand -- like Spenner's sample -- amplifies shaking. Clays, on the 
other hand, tend to mute the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sediments were deposited by erosion and the rise and fall of  
the ocean, whose levels have changed drastically at least 20 times 
in the last million years during ice ages and warming trends. 
</P>
<P>
	The USGS teamed up with the Water Replenishment District of  
Southern California for the coring project. The hole was drilled on 
the agency's land, and a nearby trailer serves as a laboratory for 
the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The core samples are quickly moved to the trailer for analysis  
at a series of stations. At the first stop, a machine scans the 
soil and measures its density and how fast sound waves can travel 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
	The core is then sliced in half. The exposed side of one of the  
halves is photographed, packaged and shipped to storage. The other 
half moves to the other stations in the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	At Spenner's station a core sample is hand-drawn on the conveyor  
belt. By touching the sand, Spenner determines that the sample is 
from a time when the area was a beach about 300,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is document what we see,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Hillhouse, a USGS geophysicist, works at another station  
about 5 feet away studying magnetic properties of the sample -- an 
important tool in determining age. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hole was drilled, a series of groundwater monitoring  
wells and earthquake measuring instruments were installed and will 
be used for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has done this kind of detailed and integrated work in  
the shallow subsurface of the L.A. basin before,'' said USGS 
hydrologist Eric Reichard. ``When all of the analyses are complete, 
this will be the best described site in the region.''

<HEADLINE>  New Mariners Chair Makes Big Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Howard Lincoln got off to a fast start as  
chairman of the Seattle Mariners, saying the team had offered 
contracts to Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez that would make 
them the best-paid players in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Both stars have emphasized that their interest in remaining with  
the Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-79, hinges more on having 
a club that can make the playoffs than on their own contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking over Monday from John W. Ellis, chief executive of the  
franchise since 1992, Lincoln said the club's player payroll would 
be boosted to $65 million to $70 million, an increase of about 30 
percent after three years at roughly $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're operating on the assumption that that will be  
sufficient,'' Lincoln said. ``We are operating a business. We have 
to take into consideration revenues and costs... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're in good shape. I think this will put us, from a  
competitive standpoint, where we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without giving figures, Lincoln said the Mariners had made  
``definitive, written offers'' to Griffey and Rodriguez. Both 
players are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are long-term contract proposals which, if accepted,  
would make these two players the highest-paid players in the 
130-year history of major league baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mariners' 3-2 loss at Texas, however, Griffey said  
there had been no offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't done anything with me,'' the All-Star center  
fielder said. ``(Lincoln) was talking more about Alex than me. I 
talked to my agent today and he said it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``They've got a lot of  
people in this clubhouse to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said he'd spoken to the Mariners.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've talked to me about it a little bit. At the same time,  
I'm not concerned about an offer. I'm concerned about the face of 
the organization and where it's going to be. I want to see the 
direction of the organization,'' the shortstop said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told them I didn't want any contract offer until the  
season was over. So why get into that now? I would prefer to get 
the offer in October, when the season is over,'' he said. ``Right 
now it's a moot point. I've always said I want to stay here if the 
situation is right. I'll talk to my family in the off-season and 
see where it stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners president Chuck Armstrong will continue to direct the  
search for a general manager, a task Lincoln said he hoped would be 
completed by Oct. 31, when the resignation of Woody Woodward takes 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Chuck to make the final decision,'' Lincoln said.  
``Certainly it's an organizational decision ... I'm certainly going 
to interview the final candidates and all that but Chuck will make 
the final call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's job is safe, he stressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have great confidence in Chuck,'' Lincoln said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, 56, has held the post under three sets of owners and  
was the longest tenured general manager in the majors. He announced 
his resignation Sept. 17, saying he was worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Ellis, grinning his widest grin in months.  
</P>
<P>
	``That 1,000-pound gorilla is gone from my back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellis is staying on the Mariners' board as chairman emeritus and  
also remains the club's representative to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was told about the impending  
change a couple of months ago, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Lincoln was ``a wise choice,'' American League  
president Gene Budig said in a statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the move had been circulating since the mid-July  
opening of Safeco Field, the Mariners' new open-air ballpark with a 
retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' home attendance this season was 2.9 million,  
second only to the 3.1 million of 1997, the last year they made the 
playoffs. On a per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent 
higher in the new ballpark than in the club's old digs at the 
nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been dogged by controversy over the Mariners'  
demand for more funding from King County to help cover $100 million 
in cost overruns on the $517 million project. Public officials 
contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln did not rule out legal action to try to force the  
county's hand but said the Mariners would continue to negotiate for 
mediation, an approach rejected in June by the Washington State 
Public Facilities District board that oversaw stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Ellis said he believed the Mariners will  
remain in Seattle for the duration of their 20-year lease on Safeco 
Field because, unlike the old Kingdome lease, it contains no escape 
clause based on attendance.

<HEADLINE> Report: 4 Tenn. Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Four Tennessee redshirt freshmen  
football players have been suspended indefinitely as a result of an 
internal academic fraud investigation, ESPN reported Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	During a six-week investigation, ESPN said it obtained internal  
documents showing high-level administrators in Tennessee's athletic 
department were told of four tutors who may have done school work 
for at least five football players, possibly violating the 
university's honor code and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents date to 1995 and would include last year's  
national championship season if the redshirt freshmen are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	However, none of the information was passed on to the proper  
campus authorities charged with investigating possible rules 
infractions, said Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of those incidents should have been investigated and  
resolved,'' McInnis told ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules require member schools to follow school procedures in  
investigating and report any rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
	McInnis and Carl Asp, Tennessee's NCAA faculty athletic  
representative, say they didn't know about the documents until 
ESPN's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Tennessee officials suspended redshirt freshmen  
Leonard Scott, Reggie Ridley, Keyon Whiteside and Ryan Rowe before 
the seventh-ranked Volunteers' 17-16 victory over Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics director Doug Dickey said in a news release Saturday  
that the school would hold the players out of competition until 
officials complete their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Tennessee has received information which, if  
true, could affect the eligibility of four football players,'' 
Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said he was not notified of the  
situation until Saturday morning and wouldn't comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Asp said Tennessee's internal investigation is focusing on Ron  
Payne, a longtime tutor who has worked with hundreds of football 
players for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tory Edge, a former Tennessee receiver who graduated in 1997,  
said he was aware of players who had papers written for them by 
tutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not with every tutor,'' Edge said. ``But you get some guys who  
come up there just bleeding orange. They don't care -- they just 
want to be around the football team. You got some young ladies who 
come up there who just think these guys are the greatest. And you 
got hormones flying and you got everything else going on except for 
academics.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Religious Text Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A news magazine reported Monday it has been  
given excerpts of a purported 2000-year-old religious text related 
to the Dead Sea Scrolls that could shed new light on the origins of 
Christianity and Jewish mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jerusalem Report said it had no way of determining whether  
the text was an elaborate hoax or one of the most important 
archaeological finds of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of the ``Angel Scroll,'' describes being taken by an  
angel named Pnimea on a tour of heavenly gates, learning how to 
predict the future and being taken back in time to the creation of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-long document has been locked away at a Benedictine  
monastery on the German-Austrian border, according to three 
Israelis who told the magazine they had obtained a transcript. 
</P>
<P>
	Benedictine monks bought the scroll from an antiquities dealer  
in the Jordanian capital of Amman in the 1970s, The Report said, 
citing the three Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	The monks were sworn to secrecy, then assembled the fragments,  
photographed the scroll and deciphered it. One of the monks, 
Gustave Mateus, leaked the contents before his death in 1996, The 
Report was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Father Bargil Pixner, the Benedictine authority on the Dead Sea  
Scrolls, called the report ``a lot of nonsense'' and 
``sensationalism.'' He told The Associated Press that if the 
Benedictines were in possession of another scroll, ``I would know 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pixner also said Mateus was alive and well in Germany.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stephen Pfann, a leading Dead Sea Scrolls scholar who has  
gone over about a quarter of the text, said the language used is 
similar to that of the scrolls. If it is a forgery, said Pfann, 
``it's a very good one.''

<HEADLINE> Zuckerman Sells Atlantic Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Publishing magnate Mortimer B. Zuckerman is  
selling The Atlantic Monthly, one of America's most venerable 
magazines, to David G. Bradley, publisher of the National Journal. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuckerman, who has owned the Boston-based magazine since 1980,  
said in a statement Monday that he had ``very mixed emotions about 
turning over The Atlantic Monthly to new owners. It gives me more 
time to personally devote to my family and our other 
publications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to The Atlantic, Zuckerman also publishes U.S. News  
and World Report, the New York Daily News, and Fast Company. 
Zuckerman has asked The Atlantic's editor, William Whitworth, to 
stay on at one of his other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded 140 years ago, The Atlantic is one of the most respected  
general-interest magazines in the country, alongside The New Yorker 
and Harper's. It has won nine National Magazine Awards since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Journal, based in Washington, D.C., covers  
government and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, speaking of his new role as the Atlantic's owner, said:  
``I proceed here with two parts modesty for every one part 
confidence. The honest question is how to be worthy of The 
Atlantic's recent history and long tradition.''

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Hits 61st Homer, Ties Sosa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark McGwire moved into a tie with Sammy Sosa  
for the major league home run lead today, hitting his 61st off 
Cincinnati's Ron Villone in his second at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive landed in the upper deck in left field, only the 29th  
ball to reach that level in stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
	He got polite applause and a few boos from the fans after the  
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mark McGwire, reaching 60 was much tougher the second time.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire became the second player to hit 60 twice when he homered  
in the eighth inning Sunday. His solo shot off Cincinnati's Scott 
Sullivan added his name to a couple more categories in the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, McGwire became the third player to hit 400 homers in  
a decade, with his 60th. Babe Ruth had 467 in the 1920s and Jimmie 
Foxx had 415 in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	He also joined Sosa as the only players in the 60-60 club. Sosa  
beat McGwire to this record by hitting his 60th eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Reds rallied to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-5 in 12  
innings Sunday, McGwire was appreciative and worn down at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a nice year,'' he said. ``Then again, it's been  
probably one of the most difficult years I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire rode an emotional wave last year when he hit No. 60 off  
Cincinnati's Denny Reyes and kept going, stopping at a record 70. 
Sosa reached the 60-homer mark after McGwire and finished at 66. 
</P>
<P>
	From his first day of spring training, McGwire has been asked  
about the chances of hitting 60 or 70 again. He said Sunday that 
the attention combined with the Cardinals' losing season made it 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 60 came in one of the Cardinals' most devastating losses.  
McGwire's homer started a comeback that sent the game to extra 
innings and the Cardinals went ahead in the 12th, only to lose it 
on Pokey Reese's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the field, McGwire lingered for a few moments and  
watched the Reds celebrate on the field. He wished the Cardinals 
could be doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd much rather be in that clubhouse,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He'll have to settle for the record book, something that's not  
nearly as appealing right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all this stuff will hit me when I'm retired,'' McGwire  
said, sipping from a bottle of water in the crestfallen Cardinals 
clubhouse. ``Obviously it's very meaningful to me. When I'm retired 
I can sit back and think of all I've accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't think that another 60-homer season would be on the  
list. Like Sosa, he thought there was no chance for another 
neck-and-neck race past the 60-homer mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I'd get there again,'' McGwire said. ``To have  
two people do it in two consecutive years is pretty amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't think we could do it again -- myself  
included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After McGwire's 60th homer, two people who were not at the game  
phoned and bought game tickets as memorabilia. Joe Davis of 
Snellville, Ga., purchased 1,050 and Edmund Urquiza of Burbank, 
Calif., bought 500. The cheapest seat in the stadium is $4. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball landed behind the left-field wall, so the Reds were  
able to retrieve it and give it to McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	It was noteworthy that he got No. 60 in Cincinnati, the place  
where he's been more of a punch-and-Judy hitter than a home run 
king. He finally got his first career homer at Riverfront 
Stadium/Cinergy Field last July 22, connecting off reliever Danny 
Graves in the ninth inning.

<HEADLINE> Castro Honors Delegation to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro led thousands in greeting  
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque and other delegates returning 
from the U.N. General Assembly, where they demanded an end to 
nearly four decades of U.S. sanctions against their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro praised the ``glorious delegation'' and Perez Roque's  
``brilliant speech'' charging that the U.S. embargo was a criminal 
act of genocide committed against the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	After Perez Roque's speech, Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter  
Burleigh rejected the classification of the embargo as genocide, 
saying the sanctions were being applied to pressure Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro to respect human rights and enact democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering seemed to be aimed at stirring up patriotic  
support at home for the speech made last week before world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, the 1 1/2-hour political act held on the  
steps of the University of Havana was broadcast live on Cuba's 
government controlled television. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hours before the gathering, vehicles with speakers  
cruised through Havana areas to urge people to attend. Party 
leaders made the same exhortations at workplaces and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the evening, Castro greeted Russian Foreign Minister  
Igor S. Ivanov as he arrived for a two-day visit to Cuba, once 
economically dependent on Russia-dominated Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are to hold official talks on Tuesday and Ivanov will  
hold a news conference for Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	For three decades Cuba depended economically on the Soviet  
Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, Cuba was plunged into 
a severe economic crisis that forced it to become financially 
independent.

<HEADLINE> Shoney's To Close 72 More Eateries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Shoney's Inc. will close 72 struggling  
company-owned restaurants in 14 states by the end of October in a 
bid to strengthen its core operations and boost its share price. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoney's disclosed today that it also has agreed to sell nine  
Shoney's restaurants in Charlotte, N.C., to franchisees Graham 
Foods and Bud Foods as part of its effort to expand franchising 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shoney's stores to be closed are in Alabama, Arkansas,  
Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company closed or sold 104 restaurants last year and had  
already closed 53 and sold 10 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the sales and closings, Nashville-based Shoney's Inc. will  
operate and franchise 1,117 Shoney's, Captain D's, Pargo's and 
Fifth Quarter restaurants in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter ended Aug. 1, Shoney's announced a net  
loss of $17.5 million, or 35 cents per share, on revenues of $230 
million. That compares to a loss of $83.1 million during the third 
quarter last year, or $1.71 a share, on revenues of $277 million.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Underwood wound self-inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The neck wound that left Dimitrius  
Underwood of the Miami Dolphins bleeding on a downtown street was 
self-inflicted, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the player Sunday afternoon after getting calls  
that a man was yelling for help. He was covered with blood as 
officers approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Underwood apparently slashed his neck with a knife at  
the home of the mother of his twin 17-month-old children. No one in 
the home saw him cut himself, but several people in the 
neighborhood saw him running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Police took Underwood to Sparrow Hospital, where he was listed  
today in fair condition after undergoing surgery Sunday. No further 
information was released at the request of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going through a real rough time, like any family would  
at a time like this,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood had 
written a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old player cooperated with police when they found  
him around 12:45 p.m. Sunday and has spoken with police since, Hall 
said. He declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his 
actions, but said police are close to completing their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was arrested by Lansing police around 7 p.m. Saturday  
for nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted for him 
about three hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the jail 
for another hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no trouble arresting Underwood or taking him to the  
county jail in Mason, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings made Underwood their second first-round  
draft pick, and 29th overall, in April even though the defensive 
lineman had missed his senior season at Michigan State with a 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1 but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood explained his departure by saying he was torn between  
a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to support his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. He was claimed on waivers by  
Miami after 23 other teams passed on him. The Dolphins were 
expected to hold a news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State football coach Nick Saban spoke of Underwood  
today at his weekly news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dimitrius' behavior over a little bit of time here has  
been a little bit unusual,'' Saban said. ``We tried to help the guy 
last year; I know the Dolphins have tried to help him now, and I've 
talked to him on several occasions. ... Maybe now someone can help 
him and he can do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good person and a good guy and he's going through some  
hard times right now. If there's anything we can do to help him, 
we'd love to do it, and we just hope he gets better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings. He's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during preseason and was  
expected to begin working out again this week. The Dolphins did not 
play Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Blues Sign First-Round Pick Jackman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues signed first-round draft  
pick Barret Jackman, an 18-year-old defenseman, on Monday, and lost 
defenseman Jamie Rivers in the NHL waiver draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackman, the 17th overall pick in the June draft, showed the  
Blues his feisty side by getting into three fights in four 
exhibition games. He also had a power-play goal against Nashville 
before being reassigned to his junior team, the Regina Pats of the 
Western Hockey League, on Sept. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackman had 44 points and 259 penalty minutes in 70 games with  
Regina last season. In training camp he was paired with Al MacInnis 
or Chris Pronger at times, but general manager Larry Pleau said 
he's at least a few years away from playing in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great prospect for us,'' Pleau said. ``He's young, he's  
enthusiastic and he plays physical. But you don't see too many 
young defensemen break in. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got two more years of junior, and then we'll see what we  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Islanders made the 24-year-old Rivers the fourth of  
10 players selected in the waiver draft. Pleau said Rivers, who had 
two goals and five assists in 76 games last season, wouldn't have 
made the Blues' roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those things,'' Pleau said. ``I wish him  
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got a player back later in the draft, taking center  
Terry Yake from the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. Yake, who had gone 
in the expansion draft in June, had nine goals for St. Louis last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used him in a lot of situations and he was able to be  
successful,'' Pleau said. ``There was a comfort zone and we're 
hoping he can get back there. He's got quick feet and he's a pretty 
smart player.''

<HEADLINE> Six Scientists Win Lasker Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six scientists have been honored with  
prestigious Lasker awards for research on blood flow in the brain, 
the development of a heart drug and discoveries about electrical 
signals in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes have been awarded since 1946 by the Albert and Mary  
Lasker Foundation, based in New York. Sixty-one recipients have 
gone on to win Nobel Prizes. The awards will be handed out on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $25,000 award for achievement in medicine will go to Dr.  
Seymour S. Kety of McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	His contributions to neuroscience include the discovery of ways  
to measure blood flow in the brain, studies showing the genetic 
basis of schizophrenia and ``visionary leadership in mental health 
that ushered psychiatry into the molecular era,'' the foundation 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kety's studies showed how brain regions receive differing  
amounts of blood during certain psychological conditions. His work 
led to current brain-imaging techniques, the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $25,000 award for clinical medical research will be shared  
by David W. Cushman and Miguel A. Ondetti, both retired from the 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute in 
Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	They were honored for creating captopril, the first oral drug in  
a type called ACE inhibitors. The drugs are used to fight high 
blood pressure, heart failure and diabetic kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
	ACE, or angiotensin converting enzyme, occurs naturally in the  
body and creates a substance that can promote high blood pressure. 
Cushman and Ondetti found a way to block ACE molecules from working 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Lasker award honoring basic medical research, three  
scientists will receive $10,000 apiece: Dr. Clay M. Armstrong of 
the University of Pennsylvania, Bertil Hille of the University of 
Washington and Dr. Roderick MacKinnon of the Rockefeller University 
and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	They did pioneering studies of pores on the surface of cells  
that can open or close, either admitting or blocking electrically 
charged particles. These channels are key to producing electrical 
signals that serve as nerve impulses and control muscle 
contraction, heart rhythm and hormone secretion.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Check Atlanta Games Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee intends to  
investigate possible improprieties by its members during Atlanta's 
successful bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission, set up after the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal, said Monday it would study the report on the 
Atlanta bid submitted to Congress by former Attorney General 
Griffin Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed lavish gifts, travel, college scholarships,  
job assistance and other perks offered to IOC members and their 
families by the Atlanta bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report was sent last week to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch after he asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to 
provide details on any abuses related to the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the report showed there was a  
``culture of corruption'' in the bid process and that ``clearly, 
votes were for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in connection  
with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC members and their relatives received 
$1.2 million worth of cash payments, college scholarships and other 
inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the chairman of the  
eight-man ethics panel, IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, a former 
vice president of the World Court at The Hague, would examine the 
Atlanta report. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mbaye finds ``anything meaningful,'' he will submit the  
information to the full commission for review, Servan-Schreiber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the IOC is serious about reforms and the ethical  
practice of its members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IOC received a letter from Upton last  
Friday requesting Samaranch to testify at a House hearing on the 
Atlanta bid excesses Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The House commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation  
has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to appear 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at a Senate hearing in April  
prompted by the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said Samaranch was traveling and had not yet  
replied to Upton. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ethics panel dropped its inquiry into the conduct  
of Finnish IOC member Peter Tallberg related to Sydney's winning 
bid for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg, who denied any wrongdoing, had been under scrutiny for  
allegedly asking a Sydney bid official for help in getting his son 
a temporary job in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said the panel dropped the case on grounds that the  
Sydney official was a long-time friend of Tallberg's and the 
request was unrelated to the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel asked for more information on the only other  
pending case against an IOC member. The member, who has not been 
identified, was accused of making sexual advances toward a member 
of Cape Town's unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission, which also finalized its procedural rules  
Monday, is composed of three IOC members and five from outside the 
IOC. The outside members include former U.S. Senate Republican 
leader Howard Baker and former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez 
de Cuellar.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Urges School Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing outside one of New York's many  
crumbling schools, Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Republican leaders 
Monday to stop blocking a bond issue that would help rebuild the 
nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope this would not be a partisan issue,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said at a news conference outside P.S. 161 in Harlem, where 
she was joined by city politicians, education and labor leaders. 
``I do not believe the children of New York should become a 
political football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have refused so far to let the House vote on  
President Clinton's $25 billion School Modernization Bond, to 
provide federal tax credits to pay interest on bonds for renovation 
or construction of 6,000 schools nationwide over the next two 
years, many in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, considering a run for retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan's seat, urged Republicans to treat the bond proposal as a 
``children's issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't any more important obligation that we have as a  
community than to provide the best possible conditions so that our 
teachers can teach and our children can learn,'' the first lady 
said as. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of local residents, many mothers of schoolchildren who  
attend the 37-year-old P.S. 161, cheered her on. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton reported a recent ``shocking'' revelation that 170  
New York City schools still are heated by coal. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we are moving rapidly into the computer age,'' she said,  
``how do we expect our children to be ready for the 21st century 
when we still have 19th century technology in our schools, when we 
have too many schools literally falling down around our ears, when 
we do not have space for children to be taught?''

<HEADLINE> Big Trucks Facing Tougher Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is  
crafting new rules for tougher emission standards and cleaner 
burning diesel fuel to reduce pollution from large, heavy-duty 
trucks, according to interest groups briefed on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA plans to announce some interim steps within a few weeks  
and follow up by proposing regulations early next year that would 
dramatically reduce the amount of smog-causing chemicals and soot 
coming from truck tailpipes, according to these sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the EPA is preparing regulations that would cut  
sulfur in diesel fuel perhaps by as much as 90 percent, said the 
sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to give details beyond saying that some  
new proposals on truck pollution will be announced within a few 
weeks and that EPA Administrator Carol Browner is intent on 
reducing air emissions from heavy-duty trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the EPA announced it would complete regulations by the  
end of the year to sharply reduce smog-causing chemicals from 
automobiles, including popular sport utility vehicles and pickup 
trucks. And it proposed requiring low-sulfur gasoline to be sold 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar approach that would require cleaner vehicles as well  
as cleaner fuel is being developed as part of the agency's efforts 
to curtail pollution from large tractor-trailer rigs, dump trucks 
and other heavy-duty trucks, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tougher emissions and fuel standards for large trucks would  
begin to be phased in by 2007, according to sources familiar with 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	While the more than 5 million large trucks and buses account for  
only 2.5 percent of all vehicles on the road, they produce 26 
percent of the smog-causing nitrogen oxide from vehicles and more 
than half of the soot in urban air, according to the Clean Air 
Trust, an environmental advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the interim steps to be proposed in next few weeks, the  
EPA is expected to propose more stringent pollution requirements on 
medium-size trucks weighing 8,500 to 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	While most sport utility vehicles and pickups weigh less than  
that and will be covered by the EPA's automobile standard, there 
has been growing consumer demand for big pickups and giant SUVs 
that do not have to meet the stricter light truck or car emissions 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	To close this ``loophole'' as critics have called it, the EPA is  
expected to propose that these medium-size vehicles will have to 
meet new, stricter emissions standards recently enacted by 
California, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the separate regulation expected to be announced early next  
year, the EPA will require that by 2007: 
</P>
<P>
	--Smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions from trucks be cut by 75  
percent to 90 percent beyond what already is being required in 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	--Particulates, or microscopic soot, be reduced by 90 percent  
over what is required today. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sulfur content of diesel fuel be cut to less than 40 parts  
per million, compared with an average of 500 parts per million in 
diesel today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the EPA required that trucks meet tougher  
emissions controls beginning in 2004, but now there is widespread 
opinion within the agency that more stringent standards are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there is a great need to go further,'' agreed Frank  
O'Donnell of Clean Air Trust. ``These trucks are a huge source of 
pollution, and cleaning up the fuel is an integral part of the EPA 
plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Becker, who represents state and county air pollution  
agencies, said cleaner trucks and cleaner diesel fuel are needed 
for states and communities to meet federal air quality 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trucks emit huge amounts of diesel exhaust which adversely  
affects human health,'' said Becker.

<HEADLINE> Helmets, Shoulder Pads for Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Jesper Parnevik likened the Ryder Cup to  
playing golf in the middle of the Super Bowl. The only thing 
missing were goal posts for the Americans to tear down after their 
inspired, improbable victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In an event that has become the biggest in golf, equal in  
intensity and pressure to any other sports event, cheering and 
clapping doesn't cut it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, players, wives and caddies climbed over and piled on  
Justin Leonard as if he had just cracked the end zone, his 
astounding putt going from one end of the 17th green to the other 
and disappearing into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	It proved the final point the Americans needed to complete the  
greatest comeback in the 72-year history of the biennial matches. 
Trailing 10-6, they won 8 1/2 points from the 12 singles matches 
Sunday against Europe to win the Ryder Cup for the first time since 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darned if we didn't pull it off,'' captain Ben Crenshaw said.  
``It's unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, was the celebration that followed Leonard's putt at The  
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal was lining up his putt when the Americans  
stormed the green. 
</P>
<P>
	Once order was restored -- no small task -- the Spaniard missed  
from 25 feet and the Ryder Cup was official property of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy may drag on for months, and surely will be  
remembered in two years when Europe gets home advantage at The 
Belfry in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of behavior is not the one anybody expects,''  
Olazabal said. ``It was very sad to see. It was an ugly picture to 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard took the blame, saying he should have kept his cool the  
way Corey Pavin did in 1995 after chipping in on the 18th hole at 
Oak Hill -- although that was on Saturday afternoon, a crucial point 
but not the decisive blow. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw apologized. So did Tom Lehman, although his came with  
an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably wish we all have jumped up and down in place  
instead of running down the side of the green,'' he said. ``But I'm 
not going to apologize for being excited. It was a great day for 
the American team, and I guess memories are somewhat short. 
Valderrama wasn't exactly a cake walk for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the clash over celebrations was a rare occurrence in the  
Ryder Cup -- it finally will be remembered for a make instead of a 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The image that best symbolizes the gut-wrenching struggle of  
winning a 17-inch gold chalice is Bernhard Langer missing a 6-foot 
par putt at Kiawah Island in 1991. Two years later, it was 
Costantino Rocca missing a 3-foot putt on the 17th that turned the 
tide in his pivotal match against Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	At Oak Hill, Curtis Strange was vilified for missing par putts  
on the final three holes, any of which would have secured the cup 
for the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard's putt was about 45 feet, not much longer than the one  
he made two holes earlier to complete the comeback within the 
comeback -- he won four straight holes to even the match at the 15th 
and revive American hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard knew the score on the 17th. He was all square with  
Olazabal, needing only to stay that way for the cup to stay in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to make it, but I was also trying to get the ball  
close. That was probably my first goal,'' he said. ``It's a putt we 
had all as a team hit during practice rounds. Everybody knew it 
went right up the top of the hill. It was just one of those things. 
I think the ball was destined to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, destiny played a huge role in the U.S. victory.  
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club has been kind to Americans over the years.  
Francis Ouimet, the 19-year-old caddie who lived across the street 
from the 17th hole, made golf popular in the United States by 
winning the U.S. Open in 1913 over British legends Ted Ray and 
Harry Vardon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouimet made two pivotal putts on the 17th, in the final round  
and again in the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange also conquered the British in 1988 by winning the U.S.  
Open over Nick Faldo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, if you don't believe in fate ... I do,'' Crenshaw said.  
``I could feel it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critical to the American chances were for them to see it.  
Crenshaw knew Phil Mickelson and the rest of his players could 
start making putts if they could just start seeing the ball go in 
the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	And he knew the Americans could pull off an unlikely comeback if  
they could see the momentum swing strongly in their favor from the 
first six matches Sunday. Lehman, Hal Sutton, Mickelson, Love, 
Tiger Woods and David Duval all closed their matches before the 
17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out screeching,'' European captain Mark James said.  
``That's what you've got to do in this game, ride the streak. And 
they rode the streak tremendously well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only five teams in the 72-year history of the matches had  
trailed going into the final day and won, but none faced a deficit 
larger than two points. The Americans set a standard Sunday, in 
comebacks and in celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, as gracious in defeat as he was in victory at the  
Masters in April, made it clear that Leonard's rally and the 
Americans' play was worthy of winning the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	He also held out hope the Ryder Cup could become a Super Bowl  
only in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We congratulate the American team,'' he said. ``And the next  
time, I think it will benefit the game of golf if we manage to 
behave just a little better. Every one of us.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Criticized Over E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia's new plan to play a broader  
role in Asian peacekeeping is stirring criticism among its Asian 
neighbors and among politicians at home concerned by sneding 
Australian troops to lead the U.N.-backed peacekeeping force in 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard overturned decades of  
foreign policy principles last week when he outlined plans for a 
more assertive, militarily prepared Australia that will play a 
broader role in Asian peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia has long hesitated to play a vocal role in Asia,  
uncertain of its status in the region because of its ancestral 
roots in Europe and fearful of hurting ties with its giant 
neighbor, Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, ``we have stopped worrying about whether we are Asian  
... and got on with the job of being ourselves in the region,'' 
Howard told parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	That stance has rankled several Asian countries, and has fueled  
regional suspicions about his government's motivation in leading 
the force in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said  
Howard's stance lacked sensitivity toward Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not appoint Australia nor gave it such a role. To be a  
leader, one has to be appointed and recognized,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Australian Embassy in Jakarta today, dozens of  
Indonesian protesters burned an Australian flag, demanding the 
withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	After Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975,  
Australia was one of the few nations to recognize Indonesian 
sovereignty over the tiny territory. 
</P>
<P>
	But Howard's government exerted heavy pressure on the Indonesian  
government for East Timorese autonomy, and Indonesian President 
B.J. Habibie eventually agreed to hold a U.N.-sponsored referendum 
on the territory's future on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping force has also drawn criticism from Howard's  
opponents in Australia, with critics saying the Australian 
government should have foreseen the rampage by pro-Indonesia 
militias after the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy has also alarmed many at home because of suspicions  
it would make Australia an enforcer for American policy in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	A report interviewing Howard on his new plans in the current  
issue of the Australian magazine The Bulletin said he sees the 
country acting as a sort of ``deputy'' to the United States in 
regional peacekeeping. But today, Howard denied having said that 
word, saying only the interviewer had used it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make it clear that the government does not see Australia as  
playing the role of deputy to the United States, or indeed any 
other country in the region,'' Howard told Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Australia's opposition Labor Party, Kim Beazley,  
said Sunday in a television interview that the prime minister's 
policy reversed 40 years of efforts by Australian governments to 
convince the region that the country ``operated as an independent 
entity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about us being a deputy of the United States.  
Frankly I find this strategy foolish and bizarre,'' Beazley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The attitude and actions of Australia regarding the problem of  
East Timor have been really excessive and unhelpful to efforts to 
maintain bilateral relations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including Beazley, say the Australian government should  
have foreseen the rampage by pro-Indonesia militias after the East 
Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia responded angrily to the new Australian stance by  
canceling a 1995 security pact with the country. Habibie said last 
week that he ``deplored'' Australia's stance.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Up on Wet Harvest / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures pushed higher Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as substantial rains in the Midwest stalled 
the fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasts call for continuing showers in the region into Wednesday,  
with colder-than-average temperatures anticipated. That will slow field 
work, although Monday's gains were limited because of the strong harvest 
progress over a sunny weekend. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans closed up about 1 percent, nudged higher by a surge  
in wheat futures. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn climbed to a two-month high because of the harvest delays.  
</P>
<P>
        Wheat prices rose behind improving export demand.  
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 2 cents to $2.79 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.12 a bushel; December oats rose 
3/4 cents to $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to 
$4.84 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle rose .33 cent to 67.30 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle were unchanged at 80.02 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose 2 cents to 48.50 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies rose 
3 cents to 65.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 5 Transportation Projects Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Monday named the  
first five projects to receive innovative construction financing 
under the nation's 1998 federal highway bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects, located in California, the District of Columbia,  
Florida, New York and Puerto Rico, have a value of $6.5 billion. 
They are receiving $1.6 billion in credit assistance from the 
government, at a taxpayer financing cost of $61 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistance is being provided under the Transportation  
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, authorized under the 
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century. President Clinton 
signed that measure, the largest highway bill in the nation's 
history, into law in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``TIFIA is a new and better way of doing business,'' said  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. '' We are making possible 
major transportation investments which might otherwise not have 
received financing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The projects receiving funding are:  
</P>
<P>
	--State Route 125, San Diego, a $400 million, nine-mile segment  
of toll road connecting San Diego to the U.S.-Mexico border. It 
will receive a TIFIA loan guarantee of $90 million and a $37 
million TIFIA line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	--Miami Intermodal Center, next to Miami International Airport, a  
$1.4 billion project that includes a consolidated rental car 
facility, an automated people mover, strategic highway improvements 
and links to transit. It will receive two TIFIA loans totaling $436 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tren Urbano, San Juan, Puerto Rico, a project to complete a  
transit system already under construction. The $1.7 billion project 
will be assisted with a $300 million TIFIA loan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Farley-Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Project, New York, a  
$750 million project will convert the Farley post office building 
next to the existing Penn Station into an intermodal facility and 
commercial center serving Amtrak, commuter rail and subway 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will receive a TIFIA loan of $140 million and a  
TIFIA line of credit of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Metro Capital Program, Washington, which will help accelerate a  
20-year, $2.3 billion capital improvement program for the transit 
system in the nation's capital. The project will rehabilitate and 
replace vehicles, facilities and equipment on the 103-mile Metro 
system. It will receive a $600 million TIFIA loan guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	The TIFIA program is designed to provide federal credit  
assistance to major transportation projects. It provides three 
types of assistance: direct federal loans to project sponsors, loan 
guarantees and standby lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible, projects must also generally cost at least $100  
million or equal at least 50 percent of the amount of federal 
highway assistance funds apportioned for the most recent fiscal 
year to the state in which the project is located. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the projects must be supported at least partially  
by user charges or other dedicated revenues.

<HEADLINE> Musician Admits Killing Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A friend likened the proceedings to a  
tragic Chinese opera: An elderly Chinese-American musician, accused 
of an affair with a fellow musician, kills the woman's husband -- a 
man he said had threatened to expose the alleged affair in the 
Chinese community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed him,'' Timothy Chang, 74, of McLean, Va., said  
Monday. He was pleading guilty to the first-degree murder of 
51-year-old Tzeyang Jason Chou of Potomac, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Peter Feeney called the killing premeditated, saying  
Chang bought a revolver and went to target practice shortly before 
the May 18 shooting at the Rockville office of Imacom Inc., a 
medical imaging firm, of which Chou was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang walked into the office, sat down with Chou and shot him  
five times with a .38-caliber revolver, Feeney said. Then, he said, 
Chang told the receptionist to call police and waited quietly to be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Chang told them Chou had accused him of having an  
affair with his wife, Patricia, whom Chang knew through Chinese 
opera groups. Chang played a Chinese violin and performed 
nationally, his friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also said Chang told them that Chou had threatened to  
expose the alleged affair in the Chinese community if he did not 
pay him $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Benedict Hsu, a friend of Chang's, described Chang as a lonely  
widower with no children and said it was likely he regarded Ms. 
Chou as a ``surrogate daughter'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Hsu called the incident ``tragic from beginning to end -- someone  
should write a story about this for Chinese opera.''

<HEADLINE> Mookie Says Mets Can't Get Any Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mookie Wilson toted a rolling suitcase behind him as he strolled  
out of the New York Mets' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to catch a cab,'' said Wilson, whose harmless grounder  
produced the most stirring comeback in team history in the 1986 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, Mookie. The way the Mets are going, the cab almost  
certainly would be late. Or dispatched to the wrong stadium. Or 
parked on the roadside with a blown tire, a busted radiator and 
nothing but fumes in the gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
	This pretty much describes the state of the Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't get any worse, but I don't want to say that,''  
catcher Mike Piazza said after the Mets' collapse continued Sunday 
with their sixth straight loss, 3-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily for them, the Mets did not have to play another game  
Monday. If they had split the six games, they would be in a better 
position to qualify for the postseason, where they haven't been in 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Atlanta Braves won the division and the Mets are 1 1/2  
games behind the Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros for the 
wild card with six to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't explain baseball sometimes,'' said Wilson, whose  
ground ball through Bill Buckner's legs capped a miraculous 
comeback in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. ``Things happen. You 
don't know why they happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, the Mets' first base coach, had a great view of what  
transpired in the ninth inning against the Phillies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bases were loaded with one out. Wayne Gomes had just thrown  
12 balls in 13 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally would stay alive if Rickey Henderson, who had grounded  
into only three double plays all season, did anything but ground 
into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Henderson grounded into a double play, leaving the  
Mets stuck in what looks like a cruel replay of last season -- when 
they lost the last five games and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked enough,'' Henderson said. ``I got nothing to say  
about this crazy stuff going on right now. Ride it out. Let's go 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is where the Mets will be Tuesday, beginning their final  
stretch of three games against Atlanta and three against 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do or say about it,'' Wilson said.  
``You have to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were one game behind the Braves when they arrived in  
Atlanta last Tuesday and 3 1/2 in front of the Reds for the wild card. 
The Braves clinched the division title Sunday with a 10-0 victory 
at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' defense deserted them in the final game at Atlanta,  
where the best defensive team in the majors made two costly errors. 
At Philadelphia, the bats went silent. From the seventh inning 
Friday through the sixth inning Sunday, John Olerud was 5-for-8 and 
the rest of the Mets were 2-for-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed that we'd sweep them,'' said former Met Rico  
Brogna, who homered in each of the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, manager Bobby Valentine said he should be fired if  
the Mets don't make the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Protest Planned at Clintons' Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- The Clintons' soon-to-be new home in a  
New York City suburb is the site of a planned foreign policy 
demonstration Wednesday, even though the Clintons have not 
finalized the deal and the sellers still live in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demonstrating there will send a message,'' said Mark Jacobs,  
director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition. ``President 
Clinton will hear that the demonstration took place and he will 
hear why people were demonstrating there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition wants Clinton to act more forcefully against  
Indonesia for its alleged complicity in massacres in 
independence-minded East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Clinton's leadership on  
the issue ``is beyond question.'' He declined to comment on the 
decision to hold the protest in Chappaqua. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have agreed  
to buy a $1.7 million house in the town, which would satisfy New 
York's residency requirement should Mrs. Clinton decide, as 
expected, to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the demonstration would be a silent candlelight  
procession. It will follow a talk about East Timor by two recent 
visitors to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	But the home still belongs to Jeffrey and Cheryl Weisberg. ``It  
still our house. No one thinks about that,'' said their daughter, 
Emma, 22, when asked about a demonstration aimed at the president 
while her family still lived in the house.

<HEADLINE> Margaret Cho Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comedian Margaret Cho says she doesn't mind if  
successful women can't have it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want it all,'' Cho told TV Guide for the Oct. 2 issue.  
``I don't want kids and a family or to see the same boyfriend every 
day for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cho is currently touring the country in her one-woman show,  
``I'm the One That I Want,'' an autobiographical account of her 
turbulent experiences in show business. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she never worried about her appearance until she landed  
her 1994 ABC sitcom, ``All-American Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the network told me, 'We have a problem with the fullness  
of your face,''' she says. ``It's not really a body part you can 
easily minimize. I really don't know how I managed to hold my head 
up after that.''

<HEADLINE> Black Stuntworkers Claim Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Black stuntworkers said Monday that  
discrimination in Hollywood is keeping them out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling it,'' said Wayne King Jr., one of several  
stuntworkers at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	King doubled for Michael Jordan in ``Space Jam'' and did stunts  
in ``Amistad,'' Steven Spielberg's movie about a revolt on a slave 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the lack of roles for minorities on television  
has been a contentious issue, with advocacy groups criticizing the 
TV networks for largely white casting this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, black stuntworkers are voicing anger over ``paint downs,''  
in which white stuntworkers don dark make-up and wigs to stand in 
for such actors as Eddie Murphy, Samuel L. Jackson and Lou Gossett 
Jr.

	``When you have paint downs, you're taking jobs away from  
African-Americans,'' said Marvin Walters, a retired black stuntman. 
``I don't care what they say, this is discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters had no hard statistics, but estimated that of some 65  
black stuntworkers in Hollywood, only 15 work on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters is calling for a ``fade-out'' from Oct. 8 to 10 of all  
Viacom productions, asking viewers not to watch any of the products 
from the company that owns CBS, MTV, VH-1 and Nickelodeon, as well 
as the Blockbuster chain of video-rental stores.

	He alleged that a white stuntwoman has stood in for the female  
Asian lead of CBS' ``Martial Law'' and voiced anger over the hiring 
choices on Paramount's ``Shaft,'' a spin-off of the 1970s TV 
detective series starring Jackson that is in production in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaft'' director and producer John Singleton, who is black,  
said he simply ``hired the best people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Chris Ender said ``Martial Law'' star Kelly Hu has  
a regular Asian stuntwoman but that one time the woman didn't want 
to do a stunt where she had to fall off a cliff.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Chmura: 'I'm Not Retiring' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mark Chmura believes he will play  
football again, even though his season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not retiring, number one. Let's end all speculation,''  
Chmura said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers put their Pro Bowl tight end on injured  
reserve Saturday. After a bulging disc in his neck was discovered 
during training camp, Chmura experienced numbness in his arms and 
hands three times in six weeks, and played in just two games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura is currently being evaluated by a team of doctors. He  
said that with the delicate nature of neck injuries, the process 
will take months. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's saying I need surgery,'' he said. ``Once we get  
through the evaluating process, we'll know what I need to do to get 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura said he still doesn't have a full range of motion in his  
neck, and he will need physical therapy and rehabilitation as well 
as any possible surgery, he said. Chmura's wife and agent have 
urged him to retire, but the seven-year veteran said he barely even 
considered it. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura said his injury is different -- and less serious -- than  
the ones that ended the season of Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston 
and the career of Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm approaching it right now like I'm going to be ready to  
take snaps next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura has been selected to the Pro Bowl three times and ranks  
fourth in team history among tight ends with 188 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	A hit by Detroit rookie linebacker Chris Claiborne gave Chmura a  
concussion and a stinger in the first quarter of the Lions' 23-15 
win. Doctors are unsure whether Claiborne's hit, which some Packers 
thought was both dangerous and late, caused any additional damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have been a nicer fellow by tagging me down when I  
was on the ground,'' Chmura said. ``But that's football. I don't 
think it was a dirty hit, but I would probably still be playing if 
he just touched me down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Chmura's injuries, the Packers had depth at tight end.  
With the blocking skills of Chmura, the pass receiving ability of 
Tyrone Davis and the toughness of Jeff Thomason, Green Bay had 
perhaps the best three-man combination in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Davis and Thomason will be sharing time and will often be on  
the field together in some of offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis' 
sets. Neither tight end caught a pass in Green Bay's 23-20 win over 
Minnesota on Sunday, but Davis and Thomason both played critical 
blocking roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay also signed Lamont Hall as a third tight end last week  
after waiving him earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura is the third receiver quarterback Brett Favre has lost  
this season. Robert Brooks retired shortly after training camp 
began, citing a history of back and knee problems, while Derrick 
Mayes was traded to Seattle for a draft pick.

<HEADLINE>  Tenn. Probes Academic Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Defending national champion Tennessee,  
which in recent years has uncovered cheating in its advanced degree 
programs and a telephone card fraud scandal among its athletes, is 
now investigating whether tutors did schoolwork for football 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee President J. Wade Gilley, who started his job last  
month, said Monday the school is following ``normal procedure and 
has turned this matter over to the (university's) general counsel's 
office for review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this review is complete, the university will announce its  
findings and, if necessary, take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics Director Doug Dickey said the university also has  
reported the matter to Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy 
Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer declined to discuss the  
allegations, which he termed ``a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is anything about football, I will be glad to talk to  
you,'' he told about a dozen reporters who met him after practice. 
``The players are not going to allow it to be a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported Sunday that internal memos show high-level  
administrators in the athletic department were told of four tutors 
who may have done schoolwork for at least five football players, 
possibly violating the university's honor code and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the information was passed on to the proper campus  
authorities charged with investigating possible rules infractions, 
said Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents dated to 1995, and it was unclear whether  
any of the players were on the 1998 national champion team. Three 
of the five players have transferred, according to ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, four Tennessee redshirt freshmen, including kick  
returner and NCAA champion sprinter Leonard Scott, were held out of 
the Memphis game on Saturday and placed on indefinite suspension as 
a result of the school's internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is aware of the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty early at this time to know where any of this may  
go,'' NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said. ``Typically, in these 
kinds of scenarios it is very common that the university and the 
NCAA will be in touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what action might be taken by the school or the  
NCAA if the allegations are proven. In June, Minnesota coach Clem 
Haskins resigned under pressure amid accusations of academic fraud 
in the men's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has investigated allegations of academic fraud before.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the university rescinded advanced degrees to two  
University of Tennessee Space Institute graduates who provided 
government contracts to a professor who supplied them with 
plagiarized dissertations. All were later convicted of federal 
fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, the university found 41 athletes charged  
$26,000 in long distance telephone calls to a stolen university 
phone card. Two players were suspended for a season and others 
received lesser punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new allegations come less than a month after Tennessee  
touted a much improved graduation rate of 57 percent for all 
football players who enrolled in 1992. The graduation rate for 
players enrolled in 1991 was 11 percent -- one of the worst rates in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was there, I never ran across that problem,'' said Joey  
Kent, a member of the class that entered in 1992 who now plays for 
the Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course you have tutors that know different professors and  
their tendencies. They try to give you every type of advantage that 
they can to help you succeed. But when I was there, they didn't do 
anything over their duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey said the most pressing issue is to determine the  
eligibility of Scott and the three other players -- Reggie Ridley, 
Keyon Whiteside and Ryan Rowe -- before this week's game against 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have not done anything about longer-term problems  
that might be out there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	School investigators will want to determine how many current  
players might be involved, the ``failure to report'' the problem to 
higher-ups in the program, and the ``overall picture of who is 
managing what,'' Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Asp, Tennessee's NCAA faculty athletic representative, told  
ESPN that the internal investigation is focusing on Ron Payne, a 
longtime tutor who has worked with hundreds of football players for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Wright, the former coordinator for academic programs in  
the Tennessee athletic department, said she attempted to alert her 
bosses, Gerry Dickey and Carmen Tegano, to possible academic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, she sent a memo to Dickey -- no relation to Doug  
Dickey -- in which she said tutor Jenai Brown ``admitted to me that 
she had been `helping the guys with their papers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown denied doing any work for players she tutored.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lie, I can tell you that,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	According to memos obtained by ESPN, Wright cited five  
unidentified players she believed may have committed academic fraud 
-- a defensive lineman, a linebacker, a receiver, a defensive back 
and a center. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive back used an unapproved math tutor who admitted  
she had gone to his classes and taken notes, both ``clear 
violations of rules,'' Wright said in a memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who now runs tutoring programs for all students at  
Stephen F. Austin University in Texas, did not return a call 
seeking comment Monday.

<HEADLINE> Army Offers $6,000 Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is offering $6,000 to men and women  
who join up before Friday -- on top of other bonuses and 
scholarships -- as the U.S. military ends its most difficult 
recruiting year since the post-Vietnam 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army is about 6,300 recruits short. The Air Force, too,  
expects to fall short, by about 1,700, of the enlistees needed to 
maintain current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy expects to meet its needs after a big shortfall last  
year, but only after accepting more personnel who failed to finish 
high school and stepping up recruitment and bonus programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Marine recruiters, with flashy TV spots on shows featuring  
extreme sports, says their hard-line approach has quite 
successfully maintained ``product appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we know a kid really wants to be a Marine, then we can  
talk about college and everything else that's important,'' said 
Master Sgt. Richard Ecker, Marine recruitment spokesman in 
Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The other services are struggling, however, in a time of  
increased job opportunities outside the military, post-baby-boom 
reductions in military-age populations, and record college 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrinking the military services also has resulted in shrinking  
interest among young Americans in joining the 1.4 million-member 
all-volunteer forces. Close to 200,000 recruits are needed each 
year to maintain force levels set by Congress and military 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all relates to fewer dinner-table conversations about  
joining the military,'' said Master Sgt. Tom Clements, Air Force 
recruitment spokesman in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's made recruiting one of the military's toughest jobs,  
``comparable to sea duty,'' said Navy recruitment spokesman Cmdr. 
Steve Lowry in Millington, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Final recruitment figures for the fiscal year ending Thursday  
will not be out until next month, but officials of all four 
branches have been counting heads daily and know where they stand. 
</P>
<P>
	With new incentives and hundreds of new, younger recruiters,  
both the Army and Air Force have managed to boost recruitment in 
the year's final weeks. The Army, which at one time was projecting 
a shortfall of 8,000 recruits, still expects to miss its needs by 
the biggest number since 1979 when the force was much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is ahead of this month's goal but will end the  
year short, recruiters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, short by 6,900 last year, is within 100 of its goal  
for this year, and with three days to go expects to meet the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Marines would meet their goal was never in doubt.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army's final incentive, available since Aug. 17, is a $6,000  
recruitment bonus on top of up to $12,000 in bonuses and $50,000 in 
scholarships, depending on the recruit's chosen field and length of 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's almost too late to get the year-end bonus, because a  
recruit must report for training by Thursday to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the person came in with a birth certificate and a high  
school diploma, we might make it,'' Army recruitment spokesman Doug 
Smith in Fort Knox, Ky., said Monday. ``You'd practically have to 
have your toothbrush with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Army and Navy have added younger recruiters, closer to  
the age of the people they are trying to attract. And the Army has 
sent out more than 2,000 newly enlisted soldiers to talk to young 
people about ``what joining the Army has done for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The military generally accepts men and women from 18 to 34,  
depending on the job, and 17-year-olds are allowed with a parent's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy recruiter Lt. Steve Zip said factors contributing to the  
Navy's ability to overcome last year's shortfall include a variety 
of education and other incentives and the addition of 100 new 
recruiting stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has refused to lower its requirement that 99  
percent of recruits have high school degrees, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very technical force. Air Force needs are such that  
we have to retain our standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Air Force, too, has significantly increased incentives.  
One hundred of its 150 career fields now qualify for bonuses of up 
to $12,000, compared with just a dozen last year. To get the full 
bonus, an enlistee would have to choose training for combat or 
rescue fields and sign up for six years.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Wife Dismisses Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin's wife, Naina, has  
dismissed claims of corruption in her family, saying in an unusual 
television appearance that the allegations are upsetting even her 
school-age grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Yeltsin defended her younger daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko,  
who has been accused of receiving bribes from a Swiss company that 
won lucrative Kremlin construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts when all these fables are told about her,'' Mrs.  
Yeltsin said in an interview on Russia's state-controlled ORT 
television this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Kremlin staff members and Yeltsin's elder daughter, Yelena  
Okulova, reportedly have also been linked the kickback scandal. The 
Kremlin press service has denied any wrongdoing by the president, 
his staff or his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Yeltsin was the first family member to speak publicly on  
the allegations, which have been reported in the Russian media for 
months, though she did not discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
	The president ``has been dragged through the mud and his family  
too,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even my granddaughter says, Granny, what will I say in school,  
after what they wrote about us. I told her ... `You know we do not 
have any villas abroad or castles or yachts,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Yeltsin also said she was distraught over media reports  
about her husband's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I read the papers I sometimes find rubbish like he cannot  
lift a pen or move his tongue to speak. I take it all quite hard,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Yeltsin is generally well-regarded by Russians, while her  
husband's approval ratings have long been in the single digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin denied in an interview published  
in the Vremya MN newspaper that Yeltsin would step down before his 
term expires next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has been high that Yeltsin will step down early so  
that a hand-picked candidate like Prime Minister Vladimir Putin can 
replace him -- while not leaving Yeltsin's opponents enough time to 
mount a credible challenge in elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of political analyses and suggestions. But  
what I'm absolutely sure of is that the president isn't going 
anywhere,'' Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term as  
president, and he has said repeatedly he has no intention of either 
resigning early or prolonging his stay in office.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Wins 94 Percent of Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- President Hosni Mubarak will be sworn in for  
his fourth term, after a vote tally Monday showed he won 94 percent 
of the vote in a weekend referendum on his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	A close ally of the United States, the 71-year-old Mubarak was  
the only candidate in Sunday's yes-or-no vote. It was the first 
time the ``yes'' vote has fallen below 95 percent in a presidential 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Egypt's 24 million eligible voters, 79 percent cast ballots.  
</P>
<P>
	Opposition groups boycotted the vote. Their leaders want  
democracy, including direct, multiparty elections and the lifting 
of the state of emergency which has been in force since President 
Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981. They also want the freedom to 
form political parties and associations, which can only be created 
with the approval of a government committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that Mubarak has called  
for the parliament to convene on Oct. 5, when it is expected he 
will be sworn in for another six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak was quoted in Tuesday's editions of Al Gomhuria  
newspaper as saying there will be a ``major change'' in the new 
government he will form after his new term begins. He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cairo was quiet Monday, a day after loudspeakers blared  
Mubarak's praises and busloads of men chanted his name. But 
thousands of banners and posters bearing the president's face still 
hung throughout the city 
</P>
<P>
	In previous referendums, Mubarak received more than 95 percent  
of the vote. In 1993, the last poll, he won 96 percent. During 
Sadat's presidency, the ``Yes'' vote was invariably 99.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak, who took office in 1981, issued a statement thanking  
the people for ``expressing their own free will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 18 years as president, Mubarak has significantly reduced  
Egypt's foreign debt, balanced the budget and cut inflation to 
about 3 percent, making the country one of the more diverse and 
open economies in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Mubarak has also played the role of international meditator,  
pushing forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and prodding 
Libya toward surrendering the two suspects wanted for the 1988 
Lockerbie bombing.

<HEADLINE> Veba, Viag Boards OK Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German utilities Veba and Viag plan to  
merge in a $14.6 billion deal that will create one of Europe's 
biggest electricity suppliers -- and said they were looking for 
acquisitions outside Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisory boards of both companies approved the deal on  
Sunday, the companies announced today. Shareholders and regulators 
must also approve. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create Germany's biggest electricity supplier  
ahead of RWE and Europe's third largest after Electricite de France 
and ENEL of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger puts us at the vanguard of Europe's rapidly  
changing and increasingly competitive energy market,'' Veba 
chairman Ulrich Hartmann said in a statement. ``We're leading the 
consolidation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a later news conference, Hartmann underscored those ambitions  
by saying ``We've made our first contacts'' about possible 
additional deals. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whom the discussions involved.  
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerates said the combined firm would also become the  
world's biggest supplier of special chemicals. And they said they 
would expand their telecommunications and real estate activities, 
while shedding non-core activities at ``an opportune time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies predicted the merger would bring savings of at  
least $840 million a year by 2002, due to lower costs for capital 
investment and lower personnel costs -- an indication job cuts may 
be planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement calls for Viag shareholders to receive one  
Veba share for 2.8 Viag shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Veba were up 4 percent in Frankfurt after the  
announcement, while Viag shares slipped 3 percent, which traders 
said was due to profit-taking following gains ahead of the merger's 
official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan must still be approved by shareholders, including the  
Bavarian state government. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Bavaria sold Veba 10 percent of its 25.1  
percent stake in Viag for a base price of $1.7 billion -- a 23 
percent premium, Gov. Edmond Stoiber said. The state will keep its 
remaining stake -- about 5 percent of the merged company -- ``for 
awhile yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has said it wants to sell its Viag stake by 2003 but  
also wants to protect the 20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expected approval from antitrust  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	German utilities have been under pressure to consolidate to  
better compete in Europe's recently liberalized energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, which should running by summer 2000, will be  
based in Duesseldorf and headed by Hartmann and Viag chairman 
Wilhelm Simson. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy group of the new company will come from the merger of  
Veba's PreussenElektra with Viag's Bayernwerk. Energy operations 
will be based in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	The specialty chemicals unit will be based initially in  
Frankfurt, where Veba's Degussa-Huels is based, and in Trostberg, 
the home of Viag's SKW Trostberg.

<HEADLINE> Financial Leaders Pledge Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- World financial leaders have pledged  
accelerated reform to better manage future global economic crises 
while also approving a new initiative to speed easing poor 
countries' crushing debt burdens. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance ministers and central bank governors attending the  
annual meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank made the commitments after being criticized for 
mismanaging the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil that hammered 
markets worldwide over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	At weekend meetings the finance ministers also urged Russia to  
pursue economic reform and expressed concern that the Japanese 
yen's value against the dollar was moving too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials had hoped the statement would drive down the  
yen's value, something that Japanese exporters want to keep their 
goods competitive in world markets. But the yen actually ended the 
trading day in Tokyo at a higher value against the dollar than on 
Friday, before the weekend finance meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders felt free to bet against the dollar until  
financial leaders begin backing up the words' of support in their 
communique with joint intervention in currency markets to buy 
dollars and sell yen. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first-ever joint meeting Sunday of the policy-making  
committees of the World Bank and the IMF, officials pledged 
``deeper, broader and faster debt relief'' for 36 of the world's 
poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries are expected to spend the $100 billion the new  
initiative makes available on health and education projects instead 
of paying off loans to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let it be said of this historic meeting that those to whom the  
world's greatest wealth has been given are joined with those 
burdened down by the world's greatest debt,'' said British 
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, chairman of the IMF's 
policy-making Interim Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved a plan for the IMF to revalue up to 14  
million ounces of its gold reserves in transactions with central 
banks to partly finance the debt initiative. The World Bank also 
will contribute along with the United States and other creditor 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	After opposition from gold-mining countries and U.S. lawmakers,  
the IMF was forced to drop plans to sell gold on the open market, 
where there were concerns prices for the commodity would fall to 
new record lows. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further effort to bolster gold prices, central bank  
officials from 15 European nations pledged jointly Sunday they 
would hold their own future gold sales to limits already announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold markets responded with a vigorous vote of approval to the  
surprise news, with the price of gold up at one point by $16 an 
ounce on London markets, the biggest day-to-day increase in at 
least nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the reform front, the IMF adopted a new code of good  
practices that will be used to monitor countries efforts to provide 
markets with timely economic data such as central bank reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hopes these reforms will ease  
criticism of the IMF by congressional Republicans who plan to 
investigate allegations of money laundering of Russian money 
through accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``A changed IMF is needed for the changed world that we now  
have. We have made a good start in many areas, but much more needs 
to be done,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told IMF policy 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have said that no evidence has been uncovered so  
far that IMF money was part of the billions being investigated in 
the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Russian central bank, said he  
would comply with new IMF financial disclosure requirements but the 
data should not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make us perform a strip tease every quarter is a little  
stupid,'' Gerashchenko said. Recommending the data not be made 
public, he told reporters, ``It's like a health check between a 
patient and a doctor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another reform move, the United States and its six wealthy  
nation partners -- Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy 
-- decided Saturday to set up a new Group of 20 nations to focus on 
world financial reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which will include both wealthy and developing  
countries, will hold its first meeting in Berlin in December with 
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Group of 20, which was strongly pushed by the United States,  
is seen by the administration as a way to hold brainstorming 
sessions to come up with more far-reaching financial reform 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the unfolding Russian investigations, this year's IMF  
and World Bank meetings are taking place in an atmosphere markedly 
improved from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> London Fog Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	London Fog Industries Inc., one of the best-known names in  
raincoats, sought bankruptcy protection Monday and said it would 
close about 110 of its 140 retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings of factory outlets, specialty stores and  
stand-alone superstores will eliminate about 500 of the company's 
approximately 1,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  
Del., is aimed at halting the decade-long decline of the suburban 
Baltimore company, which has struggled against imported outerwear, 
towering debt and numerous management problems. It closed its last 
U.S. factory, a Baltimore sewing plant, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	William Dragon Jr., president and chief executive since March,  
said competing with department stores that also sell London Fog 
products was a poor strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Substantial resources of time, talent and money were expended  
on this retail strategy for the past four years,'' Dragon said. 
``We believe that a Chapter 11 proceeding provides an effective 
base for the restructuring of our debt and the elimination of 
unprofitable retail stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	London Fog sought to continue normal operations while working  
out a reorganization plan and negotiating payments to more than 200 
creditors, using a $130 million line of credit offered by Congress 
Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the filing, the company owes its 20 largest  
creditors more than $101 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Filing for bankruptcy protection along with the parent company  
were affiliates Clipper Mist Inc.; London Fog Sportswear Inc.; 
Matthew Manufacturing Co. Inc.; The Mounger Corp.; Pacific Trail 
Inc.; PTI Holding Corp.; PTI Top Co. Inc.; Star Sportswear 
Manufacturing Corp.; The Scranton Outlet Corp.; and Washington 
Holding Co. 
</P>
<P>
	London Fog, which is owned by a host of investment firms, blamed  
high interest rates and cheap foreign labor for its troubles in the 
early 1990s, when it closed five plants in Maryland and Virginia. 
Labor concessions and $1.8 million in state and city incentives 
kept the Baltimore plant open a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company struggled through a series of management changes and  
retailing mistakes, including stand-alone stores that have failed 
miserably, according to Mark Millman, head of Millman Search Group, 
a Baltimore-based retail consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time, London Fog had one of the best branded names in  
America. They were right up there with Pepsi and Coca-Cola. To be 
at that vantage point and have that kind of visibility and clout, 
and to lose your footing like that is a total disaster,'' Millman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	London Fog had sales of $296 million in its 1999 fiscal year,  
down 12 percent from $336 million a year earlier, company spokesman 
Bruce Crawley said. 
</P>
<P>
	London Fog began making raincoats in Baltimore in 1922 under the  
name Makover-Rhoten. Owner Israel Myers, a Baltimore lawyer, 
changed the company's name in the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, determined to make a lighter-weight raincoat, spent 15  
years experimenting with waterproofing materials before hitting 
upon Dacron in 1953. The new material revolutionized the raincoat 
industry and made Baltimore the raincoat production capital of the 
world.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox's Garciaparra Sits Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who  
leads the league with a .356 batting average, sat out Monday 
night's game against the Baltimore Orioles because of a bruised 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was hit by a pitch during Saturday's game. Although  
X-rays did not reveal a break, he said it was painful to play on 
Sunday and the wrist swelled up afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was Boston's final home game of the regular season. But,  
with a magic number of two, the Red Sox are very close to clinching 
the AL wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, the team will likely let him take as many of  
the season's last seven games off so that he can be ready for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming to the end here,'' said Garciaparra, who has 26  
homers and 102 RBIs. ``I don't want to be in pain every day.''

<HEADLINE> Tiny Village Gets Phone Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEDY MEADOWS, Calif. (AP) -- More than 123 years after the  
telephone was invented, this tiny village high in the eastern 
Sierra Nevada finally has phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents gathered around as the first official call was made at  
4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Gant, co-owner of Grumpy Bear's Tavern, picked up the  
receiver of an antique-style wall phone and began to dial as 
country music played in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	But all Gant got was an answering machine. She left a message at  
the Texas home of a former Kennedy Meadows resident, who later 
called back surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls were a long time coming. It has been more than four  
years since the California Public Utilities Commission approved 
phone service for the Tulare County community of about 70 people 
6,000 feet up in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Five residents are now hooked up to the phone system. With so  
few customers in Kennedy Meadows' 850 prefix, Ducor Telephone Co. 
has allowed residents to pick their last four digits.

	Among the proposals made Monday by John McCain as he formally  
launched his Republican presidential campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	--Repealing the tax penalty applied to married couples.  
</P>
<P>
	--Slashing the inheritance tax.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ending the earnings test penalty for senior citizens and  
increasing the number of Americans who qualify for the lowest tax 
rate of 15 percent. He would raise the eligible income to $70,000 
</P>
<P>
	--Paying teachers on merit and testing their competency.  
</P>
<P>
	--Conducting a nationwide test of school vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
	--Reform campaign finance laws. He was not specific, but the bill  
he is pushing in Congress would ban so-called soft money -- 
unlimited donations that corporations, labor unions and some 
individuals give to political parties. It also would limit the 
ability of unions to use compulsory dues taken from nonunion 
members to further political efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Veto wasteful spending in budget bills, including in Pentagon

<HEADLINE> Bride Fatally Shot by Ex-Boyfriend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- The limousine was waiting outside, and  
Gladys Ricart -- radiant in her wedding gown and tiara -- was posing 
for pictures with nine bridesmaids in their pale green dresses. Her 
fiance, the man she said ``gives love a new meaning,'' would be 
waiting at the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, a man appeared at the door Sunday, wearing a suit and  
carrying a briefcase. It was Agustin Garcia, Ms. Ricart's 
ex-boyfriend, who had been in a rocky relationship with Ms. Ricart 
for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming he was an invited wedding guest, he allegedly walked  
in, pulled a gun out of the briefcase and shot Ms. Ricart three 
times, killing her. Relatives pounced on Garcia and held him until 
the police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``She finally found happiness,'' friend Joseph Bongiovanni said  
Monday as he looked across the street at Ms. Ricart's empty house, 
its railings still decorated with white wedding flowers. ``I guess 
he wasn't going to let her go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bastard should rot in hell, I'm telling you. He took a  
beautiful life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, 47, described by his lawyer as a prominent  
Dominican-American community leader in New York City, barely looked 
up when he was brought into court Monday. Ms. Ricart's fiance, 
James Preston Jr., and several of her relatives sat in the first 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia pleaded innocent to murder and was held on $5 million  
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should have been one of the happiest days of her life,''  
Superior Court Judge William Meehan. ``Instead, it was the last day 
of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ricart, a 39-year-old New York City accountant, lived in a  
two-story house in this suburb with her mother and 20-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and authorities said Ricart had ended her relationship  
with Garcia about nine months ago. Garcia was abusive and violent 
and had been stalking her, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody liked him,'' said neighbor Janet Donnelly. ``The son  
absolutely hated him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything changed for Ms. Ricart, however, when she met Preston  
about four months ago, her friends said. The invitation to her 
wedding called their whirlwind romance ``a page out of a fairy 
tale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This day, I will marry the one who loves me without end, the  
one who brightens my life and gives love a new meaning,'' Ricart 
wrote on the invitation. ``The one who shares my dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, Bongiovanni said, Ms. Ricart kept in touch with  
Garcia, ``trying to turn him around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's attorney, Fernando Oliver, said Garcia and Ms. Ricart  
had spent last weekend together -- although he wouldn't elaborate -- 
and said Garcia was shocked when he learned she was marrying 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said Garcia ``was jumped by a lot of people'' when he  
entered Ms. Ricart's house and doesn't remember a gun going off. 
Oliver said he may argue that Garcia acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, Ms. Ricart, dressed in a wedding gown with a  
tight-fitting, lacy top and a shining tiara, had waved to Ms. 
Donnelly in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia fired twice when he walked in and then managed to shoot  
three more times after Ms. Ricart's relatives tackled him, police 
said. She was shot in the head, spine and arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looked absolutely gorgeous, radiant,'' Ms. Donnelly said.  
``Five minutes later, she's dead.''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Dan Quayle said Monday that he never envisioned  
his Republican presidential campaign ending this way, short on cash 
and before the first vote was cast. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, he said, this has been an ``unprecedented'' campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a time to stay and there's a time to fold. There's a  
time to know when to leave the stage. Thus today I am announcing 
that I will no longer be a candidate for president of the United 
States,'' Quayle said, ending a campaign that has been dogged by 
poor fund-raising and low poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure leaves eight major Republican candidates, and  
is bound to increase speculation about the financial and political 
health of the remaining contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at the Arizona Biltmore, near his Paradise Valley  
home, Quayle cited the juggernaut of GOP front-runner George W. 
Bush, who has raised more than $50 million thus far in the campaign 
and leads in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was facing a campaign where the front-runner would have up  
to $100 million to spend, and an unprecedented frontloading of the 
primary system made the task for me of winning the nomination of my 
party virtually impossible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president has raised only about $4 million, and  
has been unable to break out of the second tier of candidates in 
any of the key early states, finishing near the bottom in Iowa's 
nonbinding straw poll last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Quayle remained convinced he could fare well in the New  
Hampshire primary, citing a recent poll that ranked him second 
nationally behind Bush. He told reporters in Iowa last week that 
his conservative message not campaign millions would help him win. 
</P>
<P>
	But a concentrated primary calendar with 18 states voting within  
30 days of New Hampshire would have given him little time to raise 
enough money and capitalize on a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a decision that had to be made, but my heart hurt,''  
Quayle said in an interview. ``It aches because this is not 
something I thought I would have to do. I could see 50 ways that 
this would end, but this was not one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, said they plan to take a few days  
off and reorganize their lives before deciding what they might do 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is the fourth candidate to abandon the Republican  
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander folded their campaigns during the summer. Sen. Bob Smith 
of New Hampshire opted to pursue an independent presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the remaining candidates, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who  
has made inroads against Bush in New Hampshire, formally kicked off 
his campaign Monday with a speech at the Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting  
the GOP to seek the Reform Party nomination. Elizabeth Dole is 
aggressively trying to raise money to compete against Bush. Her 
situation may be even more precarious because she is courting the 
same moderate and establishment Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. Both moved to recruit Quayle's supporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promised to support his party's nominee and said he  
expects it will be Bush. ``I'm not making an endorsement,'' he 
said. ``I'm just stating the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Quayle's biggest obstacles was what one supporter labeled  
the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day the then-vice 
president misspelled the word in a classroom full of school 
children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch line 
for countless jokes, cementing for many Americans the perception 
that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut and portrayed himself as the best 
qualified potential commander-in-chief.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets slumped on Monday,  
spooked by last week's fall on Wall Street and by the rising 
Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 50.67  
points, or 0.30 percent, to close at 16,821.06. On Friday, the 
average closed down 454.03 points, or 2.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell in the absence of central bank intervention after a  
weekend economic meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized 
nations. Many traders had believed Japan's central bank would buy 
dollars Monday morning to stem the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the expression of shared concern at the Washington  
meeting, Japan could still not get a clear pledge from other G-7 
members for joint action to weaken the surging yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.14 yen, down  
0.28 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 104.17 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 271.61 points,  
or 2.1 percent, closing at 12,760.46. On Friday, the index lost 
182.37 points, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said many investors stayed on the sidelines on fears of  
further declines on Wall Street. On Friday, the Dow Jones 
industrial average fell 39.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 
10,279.33. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, share prices tumbled on the first day of trading  
after last week's massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key benchmark Weighted Stock Price Index  
fell 212.21 points, or 2.66 percent, to 7,759.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Sell orders outnumbered buy orders by a 6-to-1 margin, keeping  
volume extremely thin after the Taiwanese government scrambled to 
contain any panic selling by imposing temporary limits on how far 
shares could fall. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also plunged, hurt by declines on Wall  
Street and rising global oil prices, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 37.78 points, or 4  
percent, to 903.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore shares closed lower, with the index falling through  
the 2,000-point level in line with weaker regional markets. The 
Straits Times Index fell 28.63 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,990.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as  
international investors, spooked by concerns over the rate of New 
Zealand's economic recovery, stayed out of the market. The NZSE-40 
Capital Index fell 27.57 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,022.53, its 
lowest close since Dec. 18, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Selling in blue-chip stocks sent the main index lower.  
The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies fell 
13.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2057.04. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, helped by a surge  
in gold mining stocks. The benchmark All Ordinaries Index closed at 
2,911.1, up 17.7 points, or 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower. The Composite  
Index fell 14.70 points, or 2.1 percent, to 679.52. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed slightly lower as many foreign  
investors remained sidelined by political uncertainty. The 
Composite Index fell 2.475 points, or 0.48 percent, to 515.067. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares closed slightly higher on a technical  
rebound. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 0.13 points, or 
0.03 percent, to 382.14.

<HEADLINE> Fashion 2000 Combines Past, Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- A new millennium, a new beginning -- or just  
the same old hat? 
</P>
<P>
	The preview showings for Spring-Summer 2000 currently on the  
Milan runway are among the first fashion statements of the new era. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the heavy use of very young models sporting demure  
hairstyles and little makeup denotes a search for a fresh start, 
most of the styles are retro -- proving that there are just so many 
ways you can stitch together two pieces of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	For this round of the semi-annual Italian ready-to-wear  
presentations, designer inspiration ranges from ethnic to peasant, 
glitzy socialite to scruffy punk. 
</P>
<P>
	Short skirts -- which went from fashion statement to a way of  
life long ago -- abound, and low-waisted cropped pants are 
everywhere. Both are accompanied by little silk slip tops. 
</P>
<P>
	Demure replaces daring, with small ruffles adorning the hem of a  
skirt or the delicate contours of a silk top. This look was carried 
to its extreme Sunday at Philosophy by Alberta Ferretti, where 
peasant maidens walked the runway in ruffled outfits accessorized 
with rubber rain boots and checkered head kerchiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Evening wear tends to be romantic rather than raunchy, with  
chiffon gowns in soft pastels, reminiscent of ballet night at the 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
	For those into opulence, gold makes its umpteenth comeback in  
the past 2,000 years. Roman designer Guy Mattiolo, who also showed 
Sunday, used it for crocheted evening gowns, while London designer 
Antonio Berardi molded it into a fashionable bustier breastplate. 
</P>
<P>
	Giorgio Armani, showing his younger Emporio line Monday in the  
theater of his downtown Milan palazzo, combined current street 
fashion with ancient Asian themes. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-age models with colored punk strands in their hair marched  
down the runway to a trendy beat in ultra-soft embroidered silk 
clam diggers worn under sarong skirts, matched with micro tank 
tops, all in soft pastels. Half-cut boots in super-soft chamois 
completed the look. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Armani looks to the past for creative inspiration, his  
plans to expand his fashion empire (worldwide sales of $815 million 
in 1998) have a firm foot in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	He opens new showrooms Wednesday in a converted chocolate  
factory, with the presentation of his signature collection to be 
followed by a gala party to launch the latest Armani fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 2000, he will open a mega Emporio store just around  
the corner from his palazzo headquarters. The store will also carry 
Armani's new accessory line of bags, belts and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	While the look for the first summer of the new millennium is  
unfolding on the open runway, another fashion story is brewing 
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, Italian houses -- often begun as a family  
enterprise -- have acquired a corporate mentality. Several movers 
and shakers such as Gucci and Prada went public, then began looking 
around for other companies to increase their hold on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada recently acquired Jil Sander, the prestigious German label  
famous for its minimalist style. Prada is now looking to acquire 
Church &AMP; Co, the utmost in elegant British footwear, but equally 
stylish shoe manufacturer Diego Della Valle is rumored to be 
considering a rival bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the five Fendi sisters, who, it seems, wouldn't  
mind selling their multimillion dollar company, with its luxurious 
furs and coveted ``baguette'' handbags. Prada is very interested. 
So is Gucci. And so also is the luxury jeweler Bulgari. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that the sisters, sole owners of the company,  
can't agree on who the lucky bidder should be. 
</P>
<P>
	Could the business rift force the sisters to change their runway  
theme song: ``We're a Family''?

<HEADLINE> Titans No. 1 in AFC Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The NFL's master movers have a new  
challenge. Can the Tennessee Titans handle winning? 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans (3-0) are off to their best start since 1991, and  
their 20-19 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday gave 
them sole possession of first place in the AFC Central. The last 
time that happened for this franchise, it was the 1993 season and 
they were still the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	How big was the victory for a franchise that perfected the art  
of going 8-8 while switching from Houston to Memphis and finally 
Nashville the past three seasons? 
</P>
<P>
	``The team believes they can go out and play with anybody and  
win if they play well,'' coach Jeff Fisher said Monday. ``That's an 
expectation. There's nothing intimidating about the games that come 
up on a weekly basis anymore. That's the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans are one of only five undefeated teams in the NFL. Due  
to bye weeks for Dallas, Miami and St. Louis, New England is the 
only other team at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans have built their confidence by rallying in the fourth  
quarter for two one-point victories. They trailed by nine points 
before beating the Cincinnati Bengals 36-35 in the season opener, 
and they were down 17-7 to Jacksonville at the beginning of the 
fourth quarter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Tennessee would have curled up and died, said  
receiver Yancey Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out swinging and (matched) punch for punch, and we  
ended up coming up with the victory,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans are undefeated despite the fact that only three teams  
have been flagged for more than their 24 penalties. Pro Bowl 
running back Eddie George, the mainstay of the offense the past 
three seasons, has yet to rush for 100 yards. The rushing offense 
is 27th in the NFL, averaging just 74 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But George is using his hands as much as his feet so far this  
season. He is sixth in the AFC for total yards from scrimmage with 
100 yards receiving combined with his 196 yards rushing, and five 
of his 11 catches have come on critical third downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher insists he isn't worried about running the ball even  
though he would have liked to have seen George carry the ball 25-30 
times against Jacksonville. George finished with 57 yards on 18 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
	That is because the Titans are much better at passing the ball  
with the league's sixth-best passing offense. Neil O'Donnell has 
stepped in for the injured Steve McNair at quarterback, and the 
Titans haven't missed a beat while McNair recuperates from back 
surgery. O'Donnell, signed just before training camp to a one-year 
deal, is completing 66.7 percent of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher is more worried about his Titans becoming overconfident.  
The franchise has never started a season 4-0, and they blew their 
last chance at it by losing to New England in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have to be careful of is people saying you've got a  
chance to be 6-0 with the off week. You've got a chance to do this. 
You've got a chance to do that,'' Fisher said. ``What we've got a 
chance to do is go out and beat San Francisco. That's it.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Young Is Ousted by Rough Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco quarterback Steve Young was  
knocked out of Monday night's game against the Arizona Cardinals 
when he took a severe hit with 28 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who has taken punishment repeatedly this season behind a  
struggling offensive line, was hit by two Cardinals on a blitz as 
he let go of a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeneas Williams hit Young high and J.J. McCleskey hit him low  
and Young's head appeared to bounce off the knee of an offensive 
lineman as he fell to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless for a couple of minutes, before slowly  
getting to his feet and making his way to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, coach Steve Mariucci said Young did not have a  
concussion, but was woozy and would stay out of the game as a 
precaution. Team doctors said later Young did have a slight 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was 13-of-23 for 92 yards with a touchdown and an  
interception as the 49ers took a 17-0 halftime lead. He was 
replaced by Jeff Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was sacked five times and knocked down 16 more in last  
week's 28-21 come-from-behind victory over New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci's precaution goes back to his first game as 49ers coach  
in 1997 when Young was kneed in the head in the second quarter 
against Tampa Bay and returned to the game in the fourth quarter. 
That was Young's third concussion in a 10-month period.

<HEADLINE> Report: 4 Tenn. Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Four Tennessee redshirt freshmen  
football players have been suspended indefinitely as a result of an 
internal academic fraud investigation, ESPN reported Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	During a six-week investigation, ESPN said it obtained internal  
documents showing high-level administrators in Tennessee's athletic 
department were told of four tutors who may have done school work 
for at least five football players, possibly violating the 
university's honor code and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents date to 1995 and would include last year's  
national championship season if the redshirt freshmen are involved. 
</P>
<P>
	However, none of the information was passed on to the proper  
campus authorities charged with investigating possible rules 
infractions, said Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of those incidents should have been investigated and  
resolved,'' McInnis told ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules require member schools to follow school procedures in  
investigating and report any rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
	McInnis and Carl Asp, Tennessee's NCAA faculty athletic  
representative, say they didn't know about the documents until 
ESPN's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Tennessee officials suspended redshirt freshmen  
Leonard Scott, Reggie Ridley, Keyon Whiteside and Ryan Rowe before 
the seventh-ranked Volunteers' 17-16 victory over Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics director Doug Dickey said in a news release Saturday  
that the school would hold the players out of competition until 
officials complete their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Tennessee has received information which, if  
true, could affect the eligibility of four football players,'' 
Dickey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said he was not notified of the  
situation until Saturday morning and wouldn't comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Asp said Tennessee's internal investigation is focusing on Ron  
Payne, a longtime tutor who has worked with hundreds of football 
players for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tory Edge, a former Tennessee receiver who graduated in 1997,  
said he was aware of players who had papers written for them by 
tutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not with every tutor,'' Edge said. ``But you get some guys who  
come up there just bleeding orange. They don't care -- they just 
want to be around the football team. You got some young ladies who 
come up there who just think these guys are the greatest. And you 
got hormones flying and you got everything else going on except for 
academics.''

<HEADLINE> Heart Drug May Delay Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A heart drug has been found to delay blindness  
in mice with a condition resembling retinitis pigmentosa, raising 
hopes in the battle against the genetic disorder that afflicts up 
to 200,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, diltiazem, sold under such names as Cardizem and  
Tiazac, is approved for treating high blood pressure and angina. 
French scientists tested it in mice and presented their findings in 
the October issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are now trying to arrange for studies in humans.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the treatment could postpone the occurrence of blindness by  
a few years, it would be a big achievement, but this remains to be 
demonstrated in humans,'' said one of the study's authors, Serge 
Picaud of Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg, France, and 
INSERM, the French equivalent of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Picaud said RP patients should not start taking the prescription  
drug on their own in hopes of treating the eye disease. He also 
noted that the doses given to the mice were much higher than what 
people take for heart conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a milestone,'' Dr. Jerry Chader, chief scientific officer  
of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, said of the study. He said it 
shows that a drug known to be relatively safe might slow down at 
least some forms of RP. 
</P>
<P>
	But he, too, warned that RP patients should not flock to the  
drug because of the possibility of side effects. Interested 
patients could discuss the study with an ophthalmologist who 
specializes in RP, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is whether this is going to be effective in  
humans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	RP is actually a group of diseases that gradually destroy the  
eye's light-sensing cells, called rods and cones. No treatment is 
known to stop the progressive blindness, though doses of vitamin A 
can retard it slightly in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Defects in more than 100 genes cause the various types of RP,  
which strike at a variety of ages. Only a few percent of RP cases 
come from the defective gene duplicated in the mice, but the drug 
treatment might work in other cases as well, Chader said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in people, the kind of RP mimicked in the mice can  
be a particularly virulent form that is detected in childhood or 
the early teens and leads to early vision loss. So a protective 
therapy might have to start in early childhood, raising issues of 
safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects of diltiazem can include headaches, dizziness and a  
slowed heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Picaud said his study did not involve any money from the  
pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how diltiazem retarded blindness in the mice.  
The drug is one of a class called calcium channel blockers, 
so-named because they block charged particles of calcium from 
passing through pores on the surface of cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The mouse mutation would keep those pores open all the time on  
rods. So by plugging the pores, diltiazem might prevent an abnormal 
influx of calcium ions that would kill those cells, Picaud said. 
The protected rods might then help cones survive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, mice were injected daily with diltiazem, beginning  
nine days after birth. This prolonged survival of the rods and 
cones. By age 25 days, all seven treated mice showed evidence of 
functioning retinal cells, while none of the seven untreated mice 
did.

<HEADLINE> Vikes' Cunningham Plays Peacemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Randall Cunningham says he's not  
going to allow dissension in the Minnesota Vikings' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to accomplish something here, it's going to be  
with togetherness,'' Cunningham said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finger-pointing started Sunday after the underachieving Vikings  
(1-2) dropped below .500 for the first time in nearly four years 
with their emotional, last-second loss at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Moss, who was limited to two catches for 13 yards, was  
critical of offensive coordinator Ray Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cris Carter berated teammate Jimmy Hitchcock, who was burned  
by Corey Bradford for the game-winning catch with 12 seconds left 
in Green Bay's 23-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, who was chided by Carter as the Vikings walked off  
the field, dismissed the verbal undressing as a heat of the moment 
thing, but he, too, pointed the finger of blame -- right at himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take responsibility for it. I messed up. I thought they were  
going to go for the first down and they went to the end zone,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including John Randle and Ed McDaniel, came to  
Hitchcock's defense, saying nobody shoulders all the blame for the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said there should be no finger-pointing, period.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very simple for me. I'm called to do my job. And I'm just  
going to go out and do my job. I don't have time to point fingers 
or to say who's wrong, who's right,'' Cunningham said. ``For me, 
that would be the easy thing to do. But, there's no reason to get 
caught up in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not speaking for anyone else. Just for myself,''  
Cunningham added. ``I just know what I see in front of me, I know 
the talent we have and I know what we're capable of doing and I 
believe that we will do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a veteran leader, Cunningham said it was his duty to speak up  
and tell his teammates to zip it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we basically all do that. Robert Smith made the comment  
that we all do this thing together. And that's the only way we're 
going to do it,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham also vowed to stop defenses from taking away his  
favorite target. Moss has just nine catches for 123 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Oakland and Atlanta, the Packers only blitzed Cunningham  
once, but they double-teamed Moss on almost every snap with a 
cornerback and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss insisted his post-game frustration stemmed not from getting  
shut down but from losing. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he took a shot at Sherman, with whom the Vikings are  
averaging 18 points, about half of what they did last season under 
Brian Billick, the architect of the highest scoring team in league 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Moss had one catch for a meager 3 yards until his  
10-yard TD reception -- his first of the year -- in the waning 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just played a cover-2,'' Moss said of the constant double  
teams. ``When you look at film, that's what coordinators are for. 
We have to find a way to beat a cover-2. You can't be running up 
the sideline all the time. You can't really do the stupid stuff out 
there. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said the solution is up to the players, not the  
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to work harder in practice. If they're going to  
play a cover-2, we just have to work harder in practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The one time Cunningham tried to force the ball into Moss' hands  
Sunday, the pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by 
rookie Antuan Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cunningham insisted he wasn't going to shy away from a  
covered Moss anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to drop back and I'm going to throw the ball in that  
area. And I know he'll come up with it,'' Cunningham insisted. ``He 
might be covered, but still, I'm not going to let them take my 
weapons away for a whole season.''

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drug Being Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A medicine that blocks the AIDS virus from  
getting inside cells has shown promise as a last-ditch treatment 
for patients who fail to respond to standard AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, code-named T-20, is still in early-stage testing,  
but researchers said Monday that it could offer a reprieve for 
those who have run out of options. T-20 was discovered at Duke 
University. It is being developed by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and 
Trimeris Inc., a small biotech company in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is the furthest along of a new class of AIDS medicines  
called fusion inhibitors. They work by thwarting the virus's 
ability to fuse with blood cells and insert their genetic material 
into them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks quite good,'' said Dr. Michael Saag of the University  
of Alabama. ``We are looking at something with a totally different 
method of action. It is an important, potent new option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the treatment has one large drawback compared with  
other AIDS drugs: Instead of being a pill, it must be injected 
twice daily. Nevertheless, Saag said patients in advanced stages of 
AIDS are willing to give themselves shots, and they seem to 
tolerate the drug well. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were reported Monday by Dr. Jay Lalezari of Quest  
Clinical Research in San Francisco at a meeting of the American 
Society for Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Other AIDS drugs work principally by thwarting the virus's  
ability to stitch its genetic material into cells it has invaded or 
by blocking its ability to disperse mature copies of itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors gave T-20 to 55 people who had high levels of the AIDS  
virus despite trying many different combinations of AIDS medicines. 
While these standard drugs have proved to be life savers for many 
with AIDS, they do not work for all patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors administered T-20 in combination with other drugs, even  
though the patients' HIV was resistant to the older medicines. 
After four months of treatment, virus levels fell significantly in 
33 of the volunteers. In 20 of them, the virus fell to levels too 
low to be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Saag cautioned that the treatment is unlikely to work forever.  
But he said doctors hope it will delay rebound of the virus for 
perhaps a year. 
</P>
<P>
	T-20 is part of the protein that makes up the AIDS virus' outer  
coat. Ordinarily it comes into play with another peptide -- T-21 -- 
as the AIDS virus grabs onto blood cells and prepares to enter 
them. Scientists found that flooding the body with extra copies of 
T-20 gums up this attachment process.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Lack Zip in Ind. Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers are two games into the  
Mike Riley era, yet it looks like Kevin Gilbride never left. 
</P>
<P>
	While second-year pro Peyton Manning lit up the Chargers for 404  
passing yards -- breaking one of Johnny Unitas' franchise records -- 
San Diego showed no zip behind Jim Harbaugh in a 27-19 loss to 
Indianapolis on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Natrone Means' 1-yard run was San Diego's only offensive  
touchdown. Scoring one or no offensive touchdowns was something the 
Chargers did with regularity in the Gilbride era, which ran from 
1997 until the sixth game of last year. San Diego has now done it 
24 times in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
	In two games this season, the Chargers have scored three  
offensive touchdowns, one more than the defense and special teams 
have provided. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between the Colts and Chargers was evident from  
their first drives. 
</P>
<P>
	On Indianapolis' first play, Manning threw a 46-yard pass to  
Marvin Harrison, who tied the franchise record with 13 catches for 
a career-high 196 yards. On the Chargers' second play from 
scrimmage, Harbaugh's pass to the flat was knocked down at the line 
of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't stretch them early,'' said Riley, who lost the  
chance to become the first Chargers coach to win his first two 
games. ``We were a little tight and they were pretty freewheeling, 
I suppose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's pretty much how much it ended up. San Diego's only long  
completion was Harbaugh's 43-yard pass to backup tight end Reggie 
Davis that helped set up Means' scoring run. Means, who twisted an 
ankle and bruised a knee in San Diego's opening win at Cincinnati, 
finished with 59 yards on 19 carries and is averaging just 3.1 
yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh was only 15-of-37 for 188 yards and no touchdowns, with  
one interception. The Chargers ran just six plays in the first 
quarter and trailed 10-0 before rallying with Means' touchdown and 
Darryll Lewis' recovery of a blocked punt in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got to loosen people up,'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of them would have to be Harbaugh, who was acquired in the  
offseason because of all the turnovers committed by Ryan Leaf and 
Craig Whelihan last year. Harbaugh's only turnover in two games 
came on the last play Sunday, after the Chargers had reached the 
Colts' 24-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fine line between taking the ball and not making  
mistakes and just cutting it loose,'' Harbaugh said. ``I think I've 
just got to be a lot quicker and more aggressive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of the 43-yard pass to Davis, the Chargers  
didn't threaten the Colts deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where we have to get better first,'' said Riley, who  
expects the Chargers (1-1) to take some shots when they play host 
to AFC West rival Kansas City (2-1) on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers failed to build on the big plays made by the  
receivers in the 24-7 opening win at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we gave them a chance to show if they could  
have done it again,'' Riley said. ``That's a hard, disappointing 
thing to say coming out of a ballgame, but that's probably what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhael Ricks had four catches for 91 yards against Cincinnati,  
but only one catch for 9 yards against the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mikhael Ricks could have had the same kind of day,''  
Riley said. ``We want him to be able to have those opportunities 
every week to do that. The sad thing to say is that we didn't get a 
chance to do that yesterday. We left some of that stuff behind.''

<HEADLINE> Indy's Afternoon Newspaper To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis News changed with the times  
and reported the times over 130 years. But, in the end, time passed 
it by. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of its demise circulated for years as changing trends in  
demographics, mass media and lifestyles eroded the readership base 
of the city's oldest newspaper, its mainstay afternoon daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reporters say it was only heart -- and the love longtime  
publisher Eugene S. Pulliam had for the paper -- that kept the News 
alive until the brink of a new millennium. There were other 
loyalists who played a part. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter Skip Hess remembers editors who trusted his hunches and  
turned him loose for weeks and months at a time to work on 
investigative pieces. The News uncovered corruption along many of 
those trails. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess also remembers when subscriptions dipped below 100,000  
about a decade ago. ``No matter what we did and how well we did it, 
circulation didn't go back up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulliam died in January, and the official word came in July: The  
Indianapolis News would publish its last edition Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be the only ending that day for Hess.  
</P>
<P>
	``I agree 100 percent with what they're doing and I'm going to  
retire with it,'' he said. ``I thought, `You know, I've put almost 
32 years in and I love what I do and I'm happy,' but I thought 
maybe I should just leave with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis Star, sister publication to the News, lives on  
in the mornings. But Art Levin, a journalism professor at Butler 
University, says Indianapolis won't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the News covered the local community much better  
than the Star,'' Levin said. ``They set themselves out to be a 
little livelier, a little more audacious, and maybe they tried 
harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis has had several newspapers over the years. There  
were two morning dailies in 1869 when John Holliday, a 23-year-old 
who served in the Civil War, defected from one of them to start the 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1940s and '50s, a special edition with a headline  
proclaiming the winner of that day's Indianapolis 500 was rushed by 
helicopter to the race track in time to place it in the victorious 
driver's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	There was more to The News than sports, of course, and its scope  
sometimes reached beyond Indiana's borders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1909, the newspaper published a series of stories questioning  
behind-the-scenes dealings in the acquisition of the Panama Canal 
Co. from the French. The Justice Department, on the orders of 
President Theodore Roosevelt, indicted the editors of the News for 
alleged libel. 
</P>
<P>
	The editors resisted trial in Washington, D.C., and the federal  
government eventually dropped its action. The newspaper industry 
considered it a triumph for the American press. 
</P>
<P>
	The News won the Pulitzer Prize for a 1930-31 campaign to reduce  
government spending and educate readers about how city, county and 
state government worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoosier gangster John Dillinger was gunned down in Chicago one  
night in 1934. The morning papers had it first, but the News had a 
``today angle'' the following afternoon that surely led most 
readers to read on: ``John Dillinger lay on a cold slab in the Cook 
County morgue today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene C. Pulliam, who owned several newspapers including the  
Star, bought the News in 1948. His son, Eugene S. Pulliam, became 
managing editor that year and it has been in the family ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the younger Pulliam carved out a reputation as a  
champion of First Amendment rights and someone who loved his 
community and believed that newspapers played a vital role in its 
betterment. 
</P>
<P>
	The News often looked for interesting angles and stories with a  
twinge of the offbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were usually amused by the thrust of The News' coverage of  
our major events,'' said Fred Nation, press secretary to Evan Bayh 
during Bayh's tenure as governor from 1989 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mix of hard news and light-and-brite didn't spare the  
News from factors that have led to the demise of so many afternoon 
newspapers. In the past year, two other evening papers ceased 
publication -- The Chattanooga Times in January and The Evansville 
Press last December. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star and the News merged newsroom staffs in 1995, and the  
News' late-afternoon edition, dubbed the Blue Streak, ceased 
publication shortly after Pulliam's death on Jan. 21. Saturday 
editions of the papers were merged in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Pulliam, Eugene S. Pulliam's son and editor of The News,  
says the paper's demise is a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a business. Businesses respond to the market place and  
we are responding to the market place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although closing the newspaper will eliminate about 20 newsroom  
jobs, most are being absorbed through existing openings at The Star 
and voluntary severance. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter Hess was going to take a week of vacation before  
retiring, but decided to return to work for the last three days of 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I've got stories to do,'' he said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A standard heart drug delayed blindness in mice  
with a condition resembling retinitis pigmentosa, raising doctors' 
hopes in the battle against the genetic disorder that afflicts up 
to 200,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, diltiazem, sold under such names as Cardizem and  
Tiazac, is approved for treating high blood pressure and angina. 
French scientists tested it in mice and presented their findings in 
the October issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are now trying to arrange for studies in humans.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the treatment could postpone the occurrence of blindness by  
a few years, it would be a big achievement, but this remains to be 
demonstrated in humans,'' said one of the study's authors, Serge 
Picaud of Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg, France, and 
INSERM, the French equivalent of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Picaud said RP patients should not start taking the prescription  
drug on their own in hopes of treating the eye disease. He also 
noted that the doses given to the mice were much higher than what 
people take for heart conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a milestone,'' Dr. Jerry Chader, chief scientific officer  
of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, said of the study. He said it 
shows that a drug known to be relatively safe might slow down at 
least some forms of RP. 
</P>
<P>
	But he, too, warned that RP patients should not flock to the  
drug because of the possibility of side effects. Interested 
patients could discuss the study with an ophthalmologist who 
specializes in RP, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we don't know is whether this is going to be effective in  
humans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	RP is actually a group of diseases that gradually destroy the  
eye's light-sensing cells, called rods and cones. No treatment is 
known to stop the progressive blindness, though doses of vitamin A 
can retard it slightly in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Defects in more than 100 genes cause the various types of RP,  
which strike at a variety of ages. Only a few percent of RP cases 
come from the defective gene duplicated in the mice, but the drug 
treatment might work in other cases as well, Chader said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in people, the kind of RP mimicked in the mice can  
be a particularly virulent form that is detected in childhood or 
the early teens and leads to early vision loss. So a protective 
therapy might have to start in early childhood, raising issues of 
safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects of diltiazem can include headaches, dizziness and a  
slowed heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Picaud said his study did not involve any money from the  
pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how diltiazem retarded blindness in the mice.  
The drug is one of a class called calcium channel blockers, 
so-named because they block charged particles of calcium from 
passing through pores on the surface of cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The mouse mutation would keep those pores open all the time on  
rods. So by plugging the pores, diltiazem might prevent an abnormal 
influx of calcium ions that would kill those cells, Picaud said. 
The protected rods might then help cones survive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, mice were injected daily with diltiazem, begining  
nine days after birth. This prolonged survival of the rods and 
cones. By age 25 days, all seven treated mice showed evidence of 
functioning retinal cells, while none of the seven untreated mice 
did.

<HEADLINE> Blocking Enzyme Could Help Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an experiment that could point the way to a  
new approach to fighting cancer, scientists blocked the enzyme that 
most forms of cancer need to continue growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with laboratory cell cultures, researchers prevented  
cancer cells from producing the enzyme telomerase. That caused the 
cells to stop their reproduction and die. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't developed a ... therapeutic drug,'' stressed Dr.  
Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research 
in Cambridge, Mass., a member of the research group. He said the 
method used in the laboratory study is not practical in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Weinberg said, the findings being published in the October  
issue of the journal Nature Medicine point the way for 
pharmaceutical companies to search for drugs that do the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerry Shay of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical  
Center called the report ``very dramatic proof of the principle 
that inhibiting telomerase may in fact lead to the death of cancer 
cells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shay, a leading cancer researcher, was not a member of  
Weinberg's research team. 
</P>
<P>
	In normal human cells, structures called telomeres protect the  
ends of the DNA that codes the cell's purpose. Each time the cell 
reproduces, the telomeres shrink slightly, until they reach a 
critical length that stops the cell from reproducing and it dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have learned that 80 percent to 90 percent of cancer  
cells have developed the ability to produce the enzyme telomerase, 
which protects the telomeres, allowing the cell to keep reproducing 
indefinitely, growing into a tumor. These cells produce a chemical 
called hTERT that provides a template for the creation of 
telomerase. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg and his fellow researchers altered hTERT into a  
negative form that blocks telomerase production. In laboratory 
experiments, they inserted the so-called negative-hTERT into human 
colon, ovarian and two types of breast cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the negative-hTERT present, the cells stopped producing  
telomerase, their telomeres began to shrink with each reproduction 
and the cells eventually stopped reproducing and died. 
</P>
<P>
	When they injected mice with the treated cells, tumors failed to  
develop. Mice injected with untreated versions of the same cells 
developed cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg's team used a form of gene therapy to introduce the  
negative-hTERT into the cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is practicable in a culture dish, but it isn't  
practicable in a living animal bearing a tumor,'' he said. ``That's 
why it's not convertible to therapeutic potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe over the next several years one company or  
another will develop a chemical to interfere with this enzyme,'' he 
added. ``But one has to be very clear and explicit that such a 
chemical does not yet exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg added that if a telomerase-interfering drug were  
developed, it would need to be used in conjunction with other 
therapy because it does not always act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the colon cancer cells, which have short telomeres to begin  
with, reproduction stopped promptly. But the breast cancer cells 
continued to proliferate for 10 to 20 days before stopping and the 
ovarian cancer cells took 30 to 40 days to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, he said, it would be useful to remove the bulk of  
the cancer first and then use anti-telomerase therapy to clean out 
small remaining nests of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Weinberg, the research team included scientists from the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Dana-Farber Cancer 
Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

<HEADLINE> Dole Promises To Rebuild Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful  
Elizabeth Dole pledged Monday to rebuild the nation's military and 
develop defensive missile systems. ``We will be strong because 
peace and security can only endure through strength,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a standing-room only crowd of about 800 people at  
the College of Charleston, Dole outlined her foreign policy 
priorities and sharply accused the Clinton administration of 
turning a blind eye to human-rights abuses in China and doing 
little about Chinese thefts of U.S. military secrets or threats to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Dole administration, this era of wishful thinking,  
vacillation, and equivocation will end,'' she said. ``I will lead 
the United States firmly and resolutely. I will advance and defend 
our national security interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She gave no specifics, however, on how she would achieve her  
goals, which include rebuilding the military, safeguarding the 
nation's military assets, combatting terrorism and forging stronger 
relations with China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, she stressed the importance of strong U.S. leadership.  
</P>
<P>
	``I will pursue a simple principle: Our nation's peace and  
well-being depend on our leadership,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said America's reliability as an ally and global power has  
eroded under the Clinton administration, which she said has shown a 
lack of ``leadership, strength and resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When it is necessary to act, we will build coalitions with our  
friends and allies,'' Dole said. ``But, if necessary, we will act 
alone. In short, America will be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the themes were similar to those touched on by Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush during a speech last week across town at The 
Citadel, South Carolina's military college. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican hopefuls have been campaigning in the state in  
advance of South Carolina's first-in-the-South Republican primary 
on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's three-day campaign swing through the Carolinas included a  
Sunday night fund-raising stop in Myrtle Beach, a fund-raiser later 
Monday in Charleston and stops in Columbia Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole promised to rebuild the military and develop defensive  
missile systems that can be used to protect the nation or in battle 
areas. She would end the United States' adherence to the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which she said was outdated and 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said last week he would create an anti-ballistic missile  
system and spend an additional $20 billion on researching new 
weapons systems. Dole, however, did not mention specific spending 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have the money to do that,'' she said later. ``There are  
surpluses on the operating side. You've got to set your priorities 
as to what you feel is most important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said cutting wasteful government spending and privatization  
of some government services also could provide the needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole also promised to improve security at the nation's weapons  
labs and said she opposed making the United States a party to the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which she said was neither effective 
nor verifiable. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dole administration would forge stronger relations with major  
powers, open China to American trade and ``treat authoritarian and 
totalitarian states such as North Korea as rogue regimes, not as 
our equals,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked where she differed with Bush on defense policy, Dole  
replied, ``I think I would focus on where we differ with the 
Clinton-Gore administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 25-minute speech, she was given a copy of a book  
on cooking and entertaining written by Zoe Sanders, the wife of 
school President Alex Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's invited to the White House, right?'' Dole said as  
she held up the book up to applause from the students.

<HEADLINE> New Virus Detected in Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported  
in the United States -- not the St. Louis strain blamed earlier -- 
was the cause of three deaths in the city, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials reclassified the cases of 14 people who fell ill in  
the city-- three of whom died -- after retesting them. They are now 
believed to have had the less dangerous West Nile-like virus, Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani said today. Researchers are re-testing spinal 
samples from other patients to see whether they may also carry West 
Nile-like fever, which had never before been found in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a question of two very, very rare diseases, and there  
was some confusion about it,'' Giuliani said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Several additional deaths may be blamed on the West Nile-like  
encephalitis virus after testing is finished, said Dr. Neal Cohen, 
the city Health Commissioner. He declined at a news conference 
today to specify how many, but he told The New York Times that 
scientists were looking at the cases of seven or eight people who 
died during the outbreak and roughly 70 others who fell ill but did 
not test positive for St. Louis encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
	He said researchers could well find that St. Louis encephalitis  
never existed in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear that we're dealing with one virus,'' Cohen  
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection  
identified the ``West Nile-like'' virus in the victim on Friday and 
were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman 
Barbara Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have  
some more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the 
strain of West Nile or a new virus,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West  
Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region. 
Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and 
Europe, never before in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the  
United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying 
now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work 
against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain tissue from victims of the encephalitis outbreak has been  
undergoing analysis at the CDC and at the Emerging Diseases 
Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Ian Lipkin, the director of the Irvine lab, said his  
colleagues had identified either West Nile virus or a variant found 
in Australia, Kunjin virus, in the brains of the three encephalitis 
victims, all from the city's Queens borough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of this is that this particular agent has  
never been reported in North America,'' Lipkin said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Futures Hit 33-Month Highs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline futures pushed to 33-month highs Monday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange, nudged higher by a refinery shutdown in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	For once, crude oil did not lead the way; prices for oil and  
other energy products were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, a stunning $14-an-ounce rise in the price of  
gold futures prompted a surge by other metals, while hog futures 
advanced to a three-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have been marching higher for months as a result  
of continued unity by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries on production cuts that have lowered world supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, crude prices retreated slightly as investors took  
profits. But gasoline edged higher on continued bullish sentiments 
as well a shutdown of the Valero refinery in Paulsboro, N.J. The 
50,000 barrel-a-day unit was closed Sunday after a plume shot out 
from an expansion joint in its regenerator, according to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Buying and selling activity also was influenced by this week's  
expiration of the October gas contract. 
</P>
<P>
	As with oil, gasoline's rise is expected to continue largely  
unchecked for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is temporary,'' said Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst for  
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``Probably by the first of 
the year things will turn around and we'll see the price come down 
significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for American motorists who might be grumbling about soaring  
prices, O'Grady pointed out that it's all relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gas is going up but so many other things are going down,'' the  
analyst said, citing apparel and electronics in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude oil for November delivery fell 15 cents to  
$24.61 a gallon; October heating oil fell 1.5 cents to 62.12 cents 
a gallon; October unleaded regular gasoline rose .78 cent to 72.66 
cents a gallon; natural gas rose .2 cent to $2.632 cents per 
million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for November delivery rose 17  
cents to $24.07 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures leaped to their highest level in five months after  
the European and Swiss central banks announced they will cap gold 
sales at 400 metric tons a year over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you consider that gold consumption is 130 million ounces  
a year, that's a pretty hefty amount off the market,'' said J. 
Clarence Morrison, metals analyst for Prudential Securities. ``It's 
understandable that gold would move up accordingly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banks also said they would not expand gold leasing, which  
has been regarded as a key factor in keeping prices low. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts predicted a price of $300 an ounce isn't far away.  
</P>
<P>
	December gold rose 5.3 percent to settle at $283.80 on the Comex  
division of the New York Merc after hitting a five-month high 
overnight of $287.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, other precious metals are shooting up along with  
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	December silver rose 10 cents to $5.355 an ounce after hitting a  
1 1/2-month high of $5.40; January platinum rose $12.20 to $383.10 an 
ounce; December palladium settled up $5.20 to $363.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison said platinum's recent rise is largely due to problems  
the Russians and South Africans have had with timely shipping to 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures were sharply higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange based on a government report released last Friday which 
showed a shrinking breeding herd that means pork production will be 
down next year. 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs rose 2 cents to 48.50 cents a pound; February  
frozen pork bellies rose 3 cents to 65.42 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Who Needs Elway With Favre Around? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay coach Ray Rhodes had no idea  
what play was called on Brett Favre's 23-yard touchdown pass that 
beat Minnesota with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither did Corey Bradford, who caught the pass.  
</P>
<P>
	Favre?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I called anything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the essence of Brett Favre, who is to the NFL in 1999  
what John Elway was for 16 seasons until he retired last spring. 
That is, when a game is on the line, chances are that Favre will 
win it -- Green Bay's other victory this season came on a 
game-winning TD pass by Favre with 11 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone want to bet that the next time the clock will read 00:13?  
</P>
<P>
	Here's the bottom line on the Packers' 23-20 win over the  
Vikings: for the first 58 minutes and 4 seconds, there was one 
offensive touchdown scored, and that was by the Vikings after Green 
Bay twice prolonged a drive with penalties. Green Bay's only 
touchdown came on a rookie Antuan Edwards' 26-yard interception 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	But with 1:56 left, Randall Cunningham found Randy Moss with a  
10-yard TD pass to give the Vikings a 20-16 lead. Moss looked like 
a money player, too -- until then, he had one catch for 3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Was it, a Vikings official in the press box wondered, a little  
too early? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes it was.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 28-24 win over the Raiders the opening week, the Packers  
got the ball trailing 24-21 on their own 18 with 1:52 left. That 
was relatively easy -- all they needed was a field goal to tie. 
Favre got them a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they got it on their own 23 with 1:51 left. And it  
was a lot hairier. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem was clock management -- they had to burn two  
timeouts, and the Vikings managed to keep them in bounds on a 
couple of their completions. So now it was fourth-and-1 1/2 at the 
Minnesota 23, and the clock was counting down toward 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers lined up. ``I don't remember that,'' Favre said. ``I  
wasn't looking for the touchdown. I was just trying to get the 
first down and then maybe spike it so we could get in another 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instinct took over, as it does when Favre or John Elway is the  
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked right toward Bill Schroeder, and one of the safeties  
moved in his direction. Antonio Freeman had his customary double 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he looked right, and saw Bradford streaking by Jimmy  
Hitchcock, who was playing him to the outside. Favre released the 
ball, then turned around and started running in the opposite 
direction. The roar of the crowd told him what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, exhausted, he lay down on the bench, surrounded by  
teammates and trainers trying to cool him down with towels. 
</P>
<P>
	Half an hour later, Favre treated all this like it was routine.  
</P>
<P>
	It is, for him, and for maybe a dozen other quarterbacks in NFL  
history, the most recent of them Elway, without whom Denver is 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway had 47 fourth-quarter game-winning or tying drives in his  
16 seasons. This is only No. 12 for Favre, who is in his ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reason for that is simple.  
</P>
<P>
	When Favre began, the Packers weren't good enough to be in a lot  
of games late. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, in their division championships and Super Bowl  
seasons, they've usually been far enough ahead that there's not 
need for them. 
</P>
<P>
	But these are not your Super Bowl Packers -- too many parts of  
that puzzle are missing, the most recent tight end Mark Chmura, out 
for the season and perhaps his career with a neck injury. So the 
difference in a division race as well as the playoffs can be a 
quarterback like Favre, who can win a game by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no such thing as domination anymore,'' Favre said.  
``There are no more 38-7 games. Every game can come down to the 
wire, and you just have to get lucky to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell that to Favre's coaches or teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was awesome,'' said coach Ray Rhodes, whose last years in  
Philadelphia were spent with the likes of Rodney Peete, Bobby 
Hoying and Koy Detmer. ``I haven't been around that in a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A long time means since he was an assistant in Green Bay with a  
young Favre, and in San Francisco with Joe Montana and Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes has been around.  
</P>
<P>
	To Bradford, the 23-year-old second-year-man the Packers hope  
can eventually become another Robert Brooks, the whole experience 
was too awesome to describe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a dream and I figured some time I would wake up,'' he  
said. ``When I did, it was in the end zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Favre as your quarterback, that's where you often wake up.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Announces Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Co. announced a major  
restructuring Monday, including changes in top management and a 
corporate realignment. The defense contractor said it plans to sell 
eight businesses that employ 9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses to be sold include a New Hampshire firm that  
makes ``black box'' data recorders in airplanes and a Washington 
state firm that is cleaning up a nuclear reactor site. The 
businesses have combined annual revenues of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Wall Street analysts were disappointed that Lockheed,  
the No. 1 defense contractor in terms of sales, decided not to 
tackle problems in its aerospace business, which has experienced 
some costly setbacks and failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed, which had 161,000 employees and $26 billion in sales  
last year, will reorganize into four core businesses by the end of 
the year, replacing five semiautonomous sectors that often competed 
with each other, said spokesman James Fetig. The reorganization 
will result in an unspecified number of layoffs at Lockheed's 
Bethesda headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at a company trying to get its arms around what  
they own following the acquisition of several dozen companies over 
the last decade,'' said Christopher H. Mecray of Deutsche Bank 
Alex. Brown. ``This is one of the steps they're taking to flatten 
out a structure that has kind of gotten out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes were also announced at the top. Robert J. Stevens, vice  
president of corporate strategic development, will take over as 
chief financial officer, replacing Philip J. Duke, who is leaving

</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's reorganization effort, which was launched in June,  
comes in the hopes of restoring sagging profits and investor 
confidence. The company reported a second-quarter loss in July of 
$41 million, due in part to launch failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seemed generally pleased with the details of the  
reorganization. Lockheed's stock, which has been in a slump, rose 
$1.56 1/4 or 5 percent to $32.18 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, however, said the company's reorganization did  
not go far enough to stem the company's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line to our investors is it won't hurt, it might  
help a little, but it's not the solution to poor earnings 
performance,'' said Joseph Campbell of Lehman Brothers. ``While 
this was a major strategic review, a major strategic review isn't 
what's going to make the market go up.''

<P>
	Investors attracted to Lockheed's stable, modestly growing  
defense business don't like the risky space business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin suffered four launch failures between August  
1998 and last April. More than $2 billion in military and private

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Announces Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Co. announced a major  
restructuring Monday, including changes in top management and a 
corporate realignment. The defense contractor said it plans to sell 
eight businesses that employ 9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses to be sold include a New Hampshire firm that  
makes ``black box'' data recorders in airplanes and a Washington 
state firm that is cleaning up a nuclear reactor site. The 
businesses have combined annual revenues of $1.4 billion. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Couple Accused of Quad Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The mother of quadruplets went on trial on abuse  
charges Monday after being accused of beating and shaking the 
children and leaving one son deaf and blind. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Whittle, 25, is charged with 14 counts of child abuse  
and could face life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	She is being tried along with Anthony Perez, 23, her husband and  
the children's father, who is accused of knowing about the abuse 
and failing to report it or get prompt medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after being showered with gifts at the birth of her  
quadruplets in January 1998, Whittle was allegedly overheard making 
a chilling admission about one of her celebrated babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I shook it too hard this time. I may have broke its  
back,'' prosecutor Karen O'Connor said during opening statements 
Monday, recalling the words of a witness who will testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say she left her children with fractured skulls,  
broken ribs and other injuries. One child, Anthony, was left blind 
and deaf. 
</P>
<P>
	The abuse came as a shock to Arizonans who donated money,  
diapers and baby formula for the naturally conceived quadruplets 
born while the nation was still riveted with the McCaughey 
septuplets in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony's injuries were discovered April 5. The other  
quadruplets -- Robert, Megan and Damian -- were hospitalized four 
days later. Those three have mostly recovered, but authorities say 
they suffer from varying degrees of cerebral palsy and are prone to 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittle cried throughout O'Connor's statements, particularly  
when the prosecutor showed pictures of the injured babies hooked up 
to tubes and monitors and listed their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the babies' injuries were not accidental,  
O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said the state cannot prove who committed the  
abuse and that authorities failed to investigate other people who 
had contact with the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittle and Perez could not have abused Robert, Megan and Damian  
because Child Protective Services had taken them away and put them 
in the care of Whittle's mother, said Whittle's attorney, Norman 
Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys said the trial is expected to take six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Japan Branch Raps Parent Co. Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Executives at Princeton Economics International  
Ltd. and Republic New York Corp.'s securities division were named 
in a complaint filed Monday in Tokyo in connection with a 
securities fraud case that allegedly bilked Japanese investors out 
of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was filed by the Japanese branch of Cresvale  
International Ltd. Both Cresvale and Princeton Economics 
International are controlled by Martin A. Armstrong Jr., a market 
forecaster, based in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was arrested in New York on Sept. 13 for allegedly  
pouring funds from Japanese clients into risky investments that 
went awry, then hiding losses. He was released on bail, and has 
denied all accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Republic New York would not comment on the  
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The an official at Cresvale, who spoke with Dow Jones Newswires,  
declined to disclose the executives named in the complaint, but 
said they may be indicted by Tokyo prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale's Tokyo branch sold Armstrong's securities to Japanese  
corporate investors. Officials there say they were unaware of 
Princeton's alleged illegal dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale also named officials at Republic New York's securities  
division, which administered the securities Armstrong sold to 
Japanese corporations.

<HEADLINE> Some Banks Easing Loan Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some banks appear to have eased their lending  
requirements, creating an increase in shaky loans and showing that 
banks are counting too heavily on the economic boom continuing, 
Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer's cautiously phrased remarks, in a speech to bankers, were  
the latest in a series of recent warnings by government officials 
about standards of bank lending. Meyer himself made a similar 
warning this spring, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said 
last month it was keeping a watchful eye on banks and other 
financial institutions that lend to businesses affected by the 
slump in prices for farm and industrial commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to the Institute of International Bankers, Meyer  
cited ``a possible relaxation in credit discipline that our 
supervisory reviews have detected at some (U.S.) banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While noting that bank loans remain sound overall, he said shaky  
loans ``have been rising modestly at some banks'' in recent months, 
a trend the central bank director called ``troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, Meyer suggested, banks ``are relying too much on  
the continuation of good times. They're assuming a very optimistic 
view of their borrowers' operating prospects and that their 
borrowers always will have ready access to financial markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks sometimes are failing to put proposed loans through  
``stress tests'' designed to predict whether borrowers could 
withstand unexpected financial shocks. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers  
Association, acknowledged that potentially risky loans have been 
increasing but added, ``They're still extraordinarily low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators are paid to worry,'' Chessen said after Meyer's  
speech. He said bankers have been asking prospective borrowers more 
questions than they did a year or two ago because they realize that 
the economic boom may soon slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the bankers' group reported that the number of  
Americans overdue on their credit card bills fell to a four-year 
low during the April-June quarter. The delinquency rate -- the 
percentage of accounts 30 or more days overdue -- declined to 3.33 
percent in the second quarter from 3.58 percent in the first. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy and job growth have helped more consumers  
make timely payments, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Institute of International Bankers weren't  
immediately available for comment Monday on Meyer's speech.

	LYDENBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A bus carrying British tourists  
overturned when its brakes apparently failed on a steep hill 
Monday, killing at least 26 people and injuring 11, police said.

<P>
	The bus was heading into this provincial town 135 miles east of  
Johannesburg when it overturned, said Lydenburg police Inspector 
Gerrit Smit. He said the victims apparently were all British

failed, Smit said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth major crash in South Africa in less than two

<HEADLINE> Columbine Memorial Trees Cut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The fathers of two Columbine High School  
shooting victims chopped down two of 15 memorial trees to protest 
the inclusion of the gunmen's families. 
</P>
<P>
	The two 10-foot linden trees were cut down during a rally Sunday  
at the West Bowles Community Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 trees had been planted about two weeks ago by church  
members in an effort to pay tribute to the families of all who died 
in the April 20 massacre, including the parents of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher  
before committing suicide during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 sign-toting protesters gathered Sunday to place the  
names of the 13 shooting victims to the trees. They watched 
silently as Al Velasquez and Rich Petrone sawed down the two other 
trees. Cheers resounded as the trees fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me sick to even have to hear the names Klebold and  
Harris in the same sentence as my kid,'' said Velasquez, whose son, 
Kyle, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrone, stepfather of slain student Daniel Rohrbough, said the  
church ``can honor murderers, but they're not going to honor Dan 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests were made. Jefferson County authorities declined  
comment. Church youth group members propped the trees up after the 
protest concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, church officials had sent a letter to the Rohrbough  
family justifying their decision and saying that ``hate is our true 
enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the West Bowles congregation said the memorial was  
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't for the two students that perpetrated this,'' said  
Mark Albers. ``This is for their families. I don't think people 
understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, members of the Rohrbough family destroyed two of 15  
crosses erected in tribute to all who died at Columbine.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Pleas in Calif. Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A ship's owner has pleaded guilty to  
criminal charges and agreed to pay millions in fines and cleanup 
costs from the spill of 3,000 gallons of oil off Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard caught up with the ship off Central America by  
following the oily sheen in the tanker's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek company, Anax International Agencies, agreed to pay  
more than $9.4 million in fines, cleanup costs and environmental 
restoration damages. The captain, Dimitrios Georgantas, agreed to 
probation that will bar him from U.S. ports for three years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the plea agreement are subject to approval by Chief  
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, who has scheduled 
sentencing for Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberian-flagged tanker Command, which had been docked in  
San Francisco Bay for fuel tank repairs, left for Ecuador on Sept. 
26, 1998. Despite Coast Guard orders not to use a damaged tank, 
Georgantas ordered fuel transferred to that tank at sea, the plea 
agreement said. A hose broke loose and oil spilled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 170 birds, including some rare brown pelicans, were  
killed when the oil reached the San Mateo County coast, authorities 
said. Cleanup costs were estimated at $1.23 million.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drug Being Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A medicine that blocks the AIDS virus from  
getting inside cells is showing promise among patients who fail to 
respond to standard AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks quite good,'' said Dr. Michael Saag of the University  
of Alabama. ``We are looking at something with a totally different 
method of action. It is an important, potent new option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, code-named T-20, is still in early-stage testing,  
but researchers said it could offer a reprieve for those who have 
run out of options. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is the furthest along of a new class of AIDS medicines  
called fusion inhibitors. They work by thwarting the virus's 
ability to fuse with blood cells and insert their genetic material 
into them. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the treatment has one large drawback compared with  
other AIDS drugs: Instead of being a pill, it must be injected 
twice daily. Nevertheless, Saag said patients in advanced stages of 
AIDS are willing to give themselves shots, and they seem to 
tolerate the drug well. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were reported Monday by Dr. Jay Lalezari of Quest  
Clinical Research in San Francisco at a meeting of the American 
Society for Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Other AIDS drugs work principally by thwarting the virus's  
ability to stitch its genetic material into cells it has invaded or 
by blocking its ability to disperse mature copies of itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors gave T-20 to 55 people who had high levels of the AIDS  
virus despite trying many different combinations of AIDS medicines. 
While these standard drugs have proved to be life savers for many 
with AIDS, they do not work for all patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors administered T-20 in combination with other drugs, even  
though the patients' HIV was resistant to the older medicines. 
After four months of treatment, virus levels fell significantly in 
33 of the volunteers. In 20 of them, the virus fell to levels too 
low to be measured. 
</P>
<P>
	Saag cautioned that the treatment is unlikely to work forever.  
But he said doctors hope it will delay rebound of the virus for 
perhaps a year. 
</P>
<P>
	T-20 was discovered at Duke University. It is being developed by  
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Trimeris Inc., a small biotech company 
in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	T-20 is part of the protein that makes up the AIDS virus' outer  
coat. Ordinarily it comes into play with another peptide -- T-21 -- 
as the AIDS virus grabs onto blood cells and prepares to enter 
them. Scientists found that flooding the body with extra copies of 
T-20 gums up this attachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	Another AIDS study released at the meeting found that treatment  
very early in the course of an AIDS infection does not wipe out the 
virus entirely, as some had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martin Markowitz of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center  
in New York City reported on four patients who started treatment 
within seven to 90 days of catching HIV. All signs of their virus 
disappeared, and they chose to stop therapy after three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus reappeared within two to three weeks. One patient went  
back on treatment, but the three others stayed off. After shooting 
up, their virus levels fell again to low but detectable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the results raise the possibility that in such  
situations, the body's immune system may be able to keep HIV in 
check without completely eliminating it.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sigrid de Lima, who burst upon the New York  
literary scene in 1950 but withdrew from public life in mid-career, 
died Sept. 19 in Nyack. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1950 book ``Captain's Beach'' was met with mixed reviews  
that simultaneously proclaimed Ms. de Lima the next Hemingway, 
Dostoyevsky or Woolf -- and called her writing ``painfully studied 
and windy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, about threadbare survivors in a shabby New York  
rooming house, was the first published out of editor Hiram Haydn's 
prestigious workshop at the New School for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952 she published ``The Swift Cloud,'' about the murder of a  
disabled boy in a California town, and received the Prix de Rome in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
	After her next book, ``Carnival by the Sea,'' (1954) critics  
generally agreed on her skills. But after two more books, ``Praise 
a Fine Day'' (1959) and ``Oriane'' (1968), she stopped writing for 
publication to spend time with her family.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ann Gay Dodson, who made sure seven rooms at the  
White House were filled with flowers from Jimmy Carter's hometown 
when he was sworn in as president, died Thursday of cancer. She was 
87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dodson, a horticulturist and national flower show judge,  
made sure that familiar plants and flowers from Plains, Ga., 
surrounded the First Family on Inauguration Day 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to heading the White House Decorating Committee,  
Mrs. Dodson was an accomplished artist who specialized in china 
painting and oils. She was the owner and operator of a beauty shop 
in Plains for more than 40 years. Some of her paintings hang at the 
Carter Center in Atlanta.

<P>
	DUARTE, Calif. (AP) -- Judith Campbell Exner, a reputed mistress  
of John F. Kennedy who claimed to have ferried messages between the 
president and Mafia boss Sam Giancana, died of breast cancer 
Friday. She was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Exner made waves in 1977 with her autobiography, ``My  
Story,'' which included a description of her alleged affair with 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1996 issue of Vanity Fair, Ms. Exner said she ended a  
two-year affair because she hated being ``the other woman,'' and 
also claimed that she aborted Kennedy's child 10 months before he 
was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	She also claimed that during Kennedy's presidency she was  
Giancana's lover and carried messages between the president and the 
Chicago mob boss, including details of a plot to assassinate Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have doubted that story, including Giancana's daughter,  
Antoinette, who has said her father had ``utter contempt'' for 
Kennedy and never mentioned any contact with the president during 
his time in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1975 appearance before the U.S. Senate intelligence  
committee, Exner said she had an 18-month affair with Kennedy 
before and after he entered the White House, and that she later had 
an affair with Giancana. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she knew of no ties between the two. Her lawyer,  
James Lesar, said in a statement that Ms. Exner lied to the Senate 
committee because she feared she would be killed, as Giancana had 
been months earlier.

<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- Oseola McCarty, a onetime washerwoman  
who earned widespread recognition after she donated her life 
savings to the University of Southern Mississippi, died Sunday of 
complications from liver cancer. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, who lived and worked most of her life in a small,  
wooden-frame Hattiesburg house, saved thousands of dollars she 
earned washing and ironing clothes for others. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned acclaim in July 1995 when the university announced  
McCarty had willed $150,000 of her life's savings to Southern 
Mississippi to provide scholarships for deserving, financially 
needy students. 
</P>
<P>
	In donating the $150,000, McCarty said she wanted to give others  
the chance to get an education she never had. She said she had 
dreamed of becoming a nurse, but had to drop out of elementary 
school to care for sick relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Her life changed dramatically after the donation. The woman who  
had spent her entire life in Hattiesburg was honored by President 
Clinton, attracted international media attention and even wrote a 
book espousing her philosophy of simple living. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's gift, willed to the university in an irrevocable trust  
administered by the university foundation, led to a matching 
fund-raising drive that had raised more than $330,000 at the time 
of her death. Donations to the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship 
Fund have already provided scholarships for nine students.

nearly five years. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard-educated lawyer joined Disney in 1985 and worked as

unauthorized use of Disney's cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually became a Disney executive vice president, but left  
the company in 1994 when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins

establishing quality controls for the food and drug industries, 
died last Monday of complications from a stroke. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving his doctorate in food technology from the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he formed his own company,

</P>
<P>
	Over the next 40 years, the company became a leader in research  
and development of consumer products, specializing in product 
testing for the food and drug industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his company, Shuster also began quality testing and  
control of private label products, which are made for stores to 
sell in competition with national brands. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing helped small- and medium-size food manufacturers  
compete by raising their quality standards and product uniformity.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Tobacco Market Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILSON, N.C. (AP) -- The flue-cured tobacco market on Monday  
opened for the first time since Hurricane Floyd began its 
devastating run through eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of farmers and buyers packed Growers Warehouse, one of  
the many venues where tobacco -- one of the state's most important 
crops -- is auctioned daily from August to November. It closed when 
the storm loomed offshore and remained suspended for six days 
because of flooding and road closures. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Lewis was hoping to sell as much of his tobacco harvest as  
he could. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been drying five barns of the leaf when Floyd stuck Sept.  
16, wiping out his corn and soybean crops and leaving his peanut 
crop in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, like other farmers, was forced to switch to backup  
generators to keep the fans and drying units running for the 
tobacco. But he then ran out of generator fuel and moisture crept 
back in, reducing the leaf's salability. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Lewis' already-dried tobacco sold for between $1.85  
and $1.88 per pound, but he was unsure whether the moister tobacco 
would move at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is talking about loans. I've got all the loans  
I need. I can't pay back what I've got,'' said a teary-eyed Lewis. 
``If I don't salvage my peanuts, I'm looking at a $200,000 to 
$250,000 loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reopening of the tobacco trade was one of the few signs of  
recovery from Floyd, blamed for at least 47 deaths in North 
Carolina and losses that likely would surpass Hurricane Fran's 
record $6 billion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	State agriculture officials haven't yet assessed losses from  
damaged tobacco crops, although both ripe and unripe leaf prices 
were 20 cents or more per pound higher Monday than when the market 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and thunderstorms spread across the eastern half of the  
state Monday. More rain was in the forecast through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were still plenty of signs of economic ruin: destroyed  
homes with furnishings piled outside; businesses with merchandise 
heaped in the middle of Tarboro's Main Street; a long line at the 
unemployment office in Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	While the floodwaters continued to recede, about 2,100 people  
remained in 21 shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the water went away and we're OK. We're far from  
OK,'' said Donna Webb, owner of Webb's Office Supply in Tarboro. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest-hit community, Princeville, remained off-limits to  
its 1,900 residents. A special ``graves'' team began identifying 
bodies in about 130 caskets that floated from their final resting 
places there, and a hazardous-materials team searched for 
potentially dangerous waste. Law enforcement officials went from 
home-to-home Monday looking for flood victims. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 rescued dogs and cats were being housed at a temporary  
animal hospital in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates show Floyd caused $70.2 million in housing  
damage in eastern North Carolina, with more than 3,000 homes 
destroyed or heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 39,265 state residents have registered for state and  
federal assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it 
has approved more than $3.8 million to aid hurricane victims.

<HEADLINE> Shares Plunge on Taiwan Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's stock market felt the jolts of  
last week's killer earthquake when it reopened today, with the 
island's world-leading computer chip companies taking the biggest 
beating as they struggled to restore full production. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chips tumbled almost 2.7 percent in the first trading  
session since the Taipei Stock Exchange was closed last week by the 
tremor that rocked Taiwan, threatening its export-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors globally are most concerned about the quake's impact  
on Taiwan's vital semiconductor industry. Manufacturers here make 
10 percent of the world's chips and about 80 percent of the 
``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a week's worth of production has been lost, which could  
lead to supply glitches and higher prices in the global computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Big losers included the island's No. 1 chip maker, Taiwan  
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and Taiwan's top personal computer 
maker, Acer Inc., both falling as far as allowed under newly 
announced emergency measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Paul Chiu said late Sunday that shares could  
drop no more than 3.5 percent a day for the next two weeks, 
compared with the usual daily limit of 7 percent, to ``ensure that 
market order can be sustained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor companies did not suffer much physical damage  
at their plants, located mostly in northern Taiwan, far away from 
the quake's epicenter in the center of the island. But power cuts 
kept them out of business last week, and it remains unclear how 
soon they can be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,  
Taiwan's version of Silicon Valley, has returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	TSMC, the chip maker, said half of its production equipment was  
in operating order. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it takes time to recover to normal output,'' TSMC  
spokesman Y.C. Huang said in a statement. ``We will try our best to 
achieve this goal as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's second-largest chipmaker, United Microelectronics  
Corp., said it has repaired most of its damage and hopes to be back 
at full production capacity within days. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown will cost United Microelectronics about $430  
million in operating revenues this month, about 25 percent of what 
it would normally have brought in, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big industrial customers were getting 85 percent of their  
power, but many still faced temporary outages of four hours each 
evening, the state-run utility, Taiwan Power Co., said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Taiwan needing to rebuild many wrecked towns and  
cities, investors bought into companies that will be selling the 
necessary materials. Cement makers rallied by 6.8 percent, glass 
companies rose by 6.4 percent and steel manufacturers were up 5.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the rally by construction materials companies, there  
was ``virtually no buying interest,'' said Margaret Pan, a vice 
president at Capital Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Stock Price Index, a barometer of Taiwan's biggest  
listed companies, finished with a loss of 212.21 points, or 2.66 
percent, at 7,759.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since Taiwan was shaken awake Tuesday by the 7.6 magnitude  
earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people, traders have been 
trying to assess the inevitable damage to the economy and corporate 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has lowered its 1999 economic growth forecast to  
around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Court OK's Bilingual Education Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A state appeals court tightened  
California's voter-approved ban on bilingual education Monday, 
ruling that only parents, not entire school districts, can ask for 
exemptions from the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 227, which passed with 61 percent support and took  
effect last year, requires students to be taught ``overwhelmingly'' 
in English. 
</P>
<P>
	But it allows parents and students to seek waivers that would  
allow them to remain in bilingual classes and learn some subjects 
in their native language if their teachers and schools approve. To 
qualify, the students must be older than 10 or have special needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit by the Oakland, Berkeley and Hayward districts, all  
in the San Francisco Bay area, Alameda County Judge Henry Needham 
ruled last year that the state board must consider districtwide 
requests for Proposition 227 waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Gov. Pete Wilson said the decision could ``eviscerate'' the  
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeal disagreed with Needham, ruling  
3-0 on Monday that the intent of Proposition 227 was ``that English 
instruction will be provided in all cases except those where 
parental waivers are made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longstanding California law allows the state Board of  
Education to waive virtually any statewide educational law at a 
district's request. But the appeals court said the proposition 
could not be reconciled with such waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Schulkind, a lawyer for the districts seeking waivers,  
said the ruling is ``not good for kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... question the wisdom of making complex educational  
policy through an initiative process where the electorate can be 
misinformed through ballot statements,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw's Ryder Cup Strategy Works  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- When his players wanted to be paid to  
represent their country, Ben Crenshaw scolded them. Then he let the 
matter drop and welcomed them back into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
	When they struggled, he shuffled his lineup. And then, acting on  
nothing more than a hunch, he tweaked it one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup team never did,  
though, was give up on his golfers. Not when they fell behind 
Europe 6-2 on the first day. Not when they failed to close the gap 
and trailed 10-6 after two. Not ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how well these guys can play, and I know how determined  
they were, and I know how confident they felt under seemingly 
insurmountable odds,'' Crenshaw said Sunday after guiding the U.S. 
to an unprecedented comeback to take the Ryder Cup back from Europe 
14 1/2-13 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't describe it (Saturday) night. But when I left here  
I said, `We're in good shape.' I did feel good about it. I felt 
confident. Darned if we didn't pull it off. Unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No team had ever come back from more than two points to win on  
the final day. But Crenshaw combined an unwavering faith in his 
players with some deft strategy, and the Americans went 8-3-1 in 
the singles matches to cap off one of golf's greatest comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard sank a 45-foot putt on No. 17 to virtually clinch  
the Cup for the United States, setting off a celebration that 
traveled from the 17th green to the 18th, to the men's locker room, 
through a window and onto the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
	The players waved flags, sang patriotic songs, tossed souvenirs  
to the crowd and sprayed champagne on themselves, each other and 
the fans. But eventually the crowd called for their captain, and 
Crenshaw crossed the veranda until he was standing above the 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't stop believing,'' the champagne-soaked captain said.  
Then, with a pump of his fist, he yelled, ``Yes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The captain can't drive or putt for his players; he can't do  
much more than help them read the greens. And although much thought 
goes into finding complementary twosomes for the alternate shot and 
best ball matches over the first two days, everybody plays on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Crenshaw had to find a batting order that would  
create momentum while remembering to save some ammunition for the 
later matches that will certainly decide the Cup. Crenshaw decided 
to send his best six players out first: Tom Lehman, Hal Sutton, 
Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III, Woods and David Duval, and hope 
they could set a tone. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy paid off immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen such firepower going out in the first six  
groups. It ignited everybody,'' Crenshaw said. ``When we watched 
those four groups go out there, that's what we needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was making the turn in his match with Jesper Parnevik when  
he looked at the scoreboard and realized what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and every match ahead of me was at least 3-up,''  
Duval said. ``We were just trying to show them some American 
firepower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James had his own issues to worry about.  
He had seven players who played 72 holes already and three who 
hadn't played at all. That gave the Americans hope that everyone on 
the other side was either worn-out or rusty. 
</P>
<P>
	But James said he thought his team was outplayed, and nothing  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out screeching,'' he said. ``That's what you've got  
to do in this game, ride a streak. And they rode the streak 
remarkably well today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Country Club has been the site of several memorable events,  
none more historic than the 1913 U.S. Open, when unknown American 
amateur Francis Ouimet beat English professionals Harry Vardon and 
Ted Ray in a playoff. The victory is considered the founding moment 
of American golf. 
</P>
<P>
	It was right on No. 17 that Ouimet -- a caddie who lived right  
across Clyde Street from the hole -- made par to beat Vardon's 
double bogey and go two strokes up; Ray had already fallen back. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what was on Crenshaw's mind when he told reporters on  
Saturday night, ``I'm a big believer in fate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a good feeling about this,'' he said. ``That's all I'm  
going to tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he invited longtime friend George W. Bush to a team  
meeting Saturday night, and the Texas governor read a quote from a 
soldier who was at the siege of the Alamo. Finally, something 
seemed to strike a chord with the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't look like he was going to make it, but he was going  
to fight until the end,'' said Mickelson, who was one of four 
players who complained last month about not getting a share of the 
tournament's profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows what a number of Americans have done for this  
country,'' Mickelson said. ``We might not be soldiers who fight in 
wars, but this is something of its own and we need to fight as if 
we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Crenshaw sent his team out for the final day in shirts  
decorated with pictures of U.S. cup-winning teams from the past. 
Where will the picture of Crenshaw's team be if the next Ryder Cup 
captain chooses to follow suit? 
</P>
<P>
	How about above the heart.

<HEADLINE> MLS Teams Compete in Champions Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- D.C. United and the Chicago Fire take a break  
from their Major League Soccer schedules this week to compete in 
the 1999 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, the eight-team international 
tournament featuring teams from five countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's matches at Sam Boyd Stadium feature the Fire,  
the defending MLS champions, against Joe Public of Trinidad and 
Tobago, champions of the Caribbean, and Mexican champion Toluca 
against Alajuela of Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, D.C. United faces Central American champion  
Olimpia of Honduras, and Necaxa of Mexico will face Saprissa of 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
	The semifinals are Friday and the finals Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	With last Saturday's 2-0 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy,  
United clinched first place in the MLS Eastern Division, secured 
home advantage through the playoffs and won a club-record 11th 
straight match. 
</P>
<P>
	Under first-year head coach Thomas Rongen, D.C. enters the  
Champions' Cup with 23-7 record. They are the defending winners of 
the CONCACAF Champions' Cup for club teams. The winning team in Las 
Vegas will advance to the finals of the FIFA Club World 
Championship next January in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	United is led by all-star forward Roy Lassiter, the leading  
scorer in the MLS this year with 17 goals and 11 assists in 28 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the team with the bull's eye on the back of our  
jerseys,'' Rongen said, ``but it's a great position to be in going 
into this tournament. We rested seven of our first choice players 
against Los Angeles and three others only played in the second 
half. We're serious about winning another CONCACAF Champions' 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United marched through last year's tournament at their home  
field, Washington's RFK Stadium, scoring 11 goals while holding all 
three opponents scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago is the defending MLS champion, but at 16-14 is still  
looking to clinch a playoff berth.

<HEADLINE> California Overhauls HMO Oversight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has signed a package of  
health care bills that will affect millions of people and make 
California one of three states that let consumers sue HMOs for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	California's liability law will let consumers sue if they are  
substantially harmed by a health insurer's decision to delay, deny 
or alter necessary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new laws will also require managed-care plans and other  
health insurers to provide a second opinion when a patient requests 
it and cover contraceptives, cancer screening and treatment of 
diabetes and mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``These bills taken together will ultimately put medical  
decision-making back where it belongs: in the hands of doctors and 
patients,'' Davis said at Monday's signing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	California's debate -- particularly on whether to let patients  
sue HMOs -- mirrored deliberations in many other states and in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has been pressing for a ``patients' bill of  
rights.'' At the heart of his proposal is a provision that would 
let patients seek damages from health insurers that botch 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Georgia also have laws that let managed-care patients  
sue if the plan fail to exercise ``ordinary'' care in treatment, 
said Marla Rothouse, a health policy specialist with the National 
Conference of State Legislatures in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	California law will require HMOs to make decisions about  
physicians' referrals for surgery or specialized care within five 
days in most cases, and let only medical professionals make those 
initial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	To enforce the new laws, Davis approved a new state agency to  
regulate health care plans, taking the job from the Department of 
Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients affected by the changes include an estimated 15 million  
Californians covered by employer-purchased managed-care plans. Such 
plans limit patients' choice of doctors in exchange for lower 
premiums and lower fees for checkups and prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two measures form the centerpiece of the legislation, Davis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first would establish an independent review system for  
patients who contend a managed-care plan has unfairly denied, 
delayed or changed treatment. Doctors with no stake in disputed 
cases would help resolve them. 
</P>
<P>
	All patient-health plan disputes would go through the review  
system first when the law takes effect in July, except in cases 
where injury is imminent or has already occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who disagree with the outcome could sue under the new  
liability law for compensatory and punitive damages if they have 
suffered substantial injury as a result of the health plan's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2001, defines substantial  
harm as loss of life, loss or significant impairment of limb or 
bodily functions, significant disfigurement, severe or chronic pain 
or significant financial loss.

	Budget Surplus Grows to $115 Billion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today increased its  
estimate of the budget surplus, saying it should hit at least $115 
billion in fiscal 1999, the largest in American history. ``It is a 
landmark achievement for our economy,'' President Clinton said. The 
larger surplus likely will prompt new Republican calls for major 
tax cuts for Americans. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion tax cut bill 
last week and urged passage of a cut in the range of $250 billion 
to $300 billion. The president called on Republicans to work with 
the administration on fixing Social Security, Medicare and other 
problems. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Seeks Funds for Schools  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will be in New Orleans today  
to press Congress to approve funds for public school construction 
and raise money for Democrats. The president is scheduled to visit 
a local middle school and give a speech on ``the importance of the 
Congress moving forward on school modernization,'' White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Afterward, Clinton will address two 
fund-raisers for Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., before returning to 
Washington.

	Sony Walkman Will Download Music  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. will start selling a Walkman in December  
in Japan that fits into the palm of a hand and downloads music from 
the Internet while protecting copyrights. The ``Memory Stick 
Walkman'' is designed to fight the proliferation of illegal music 
exchanges on the Internet and to create a new standard for portable 
audio players, a Sony spokesman said. No date has been set for its 
overseas launch. The Walkman uses technology to protect the record 
industry from the illegal copying and distribution of music over 
the Internet.

<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers have  
effectively taken control of East Timor today as Indonesian troops 
ended an often brutal 24-year occupation. Peacekeeping mission head 
Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove said Indonesia will maintain security 
responsibility until a special assembly, comprised of Indonesian 
legislators and government appointees, ratifies the overwhelming 
pro-independence vote by East Timorese in an Aug. 30 referendum.

	Russia To Continue Bombing Chechnya  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military pledged to keep  
bombing Chechnya until Islamic militants in the breakaway republic 
are wiped out. Warplanes unleashed rockets and bombs on the Chechen 
capital of Grozny today for a fifth straight day, targeting oil 
derricks and industrial targets. According to eyewitnesses, several 
oil wells were ablaze. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed 
today that 300 people had been killed in the Russian airstrikes 
against Grozny.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jumbo jet struck construction equipment  
along a taxiway early today as it headed toward a runway at Los 
Angeles International Airport, damaging one of the aircraft's 
engines. No injuries were reported. The Boeing 747, flown by 
France-based Corsair, was carrying 317 passengers and crew members 
on Flight 942 to Tahiti, airport officials said. The plane struck 
two tractor-trailer rigs and a pickup truck at a construction site 
along the taxiway.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor is siding with Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani in attacking a museum's plans to exhibit a 
portrait of the Virgin Mary that features a clump of elephant dung 
and pictures of buttocks. But civil rights activists say the mayor 
is violating the First Amendment by pledging to withhold $7 million 
in city funds from the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The show 
``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' 
opens Saturday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as bargain-hunting  
and a strengthening dollar helped markets rebound from last week's 
selloff. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average 
was up 106.06 to 10,385.39. Advancing issues led decliners on the 
New York Stock Exchange 1,733-748. The Nasdaq composite index was 
up 42.20 at 2,782.61.

	49ers, Cardinals To Square Off  
</P>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Quarterbacks Steve Young of the San  
Francisco 49ers and Jake Plummer of the Arizona Cardinals will try 
to get their respective offenses untracked when the teams meet in 
prime time. San Francisco ranks 27th among the 31 NFL teams, while 
Arizona is 25th. Young was knocked around in last week's 28-21 
come-from-behind victory over New Orleans. And Plummer has thrown 
seven interceptions and just one touchdown pass for the Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> 'Double Jeopardy' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Double Jeopardy,'' a tale of revenge and  
wrongful imprisonment, did some solid time at the box office as the 
weekend's top movie earner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, ``Double Jeopardy''  
debuted with a three-day total of $23.7 million, according to 
industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Martin Lawrence comedy ``Blue Streak'' dropped to No. 2 in  
its second weekend with $13.2 million. Eight weeks into its run, 
the Bruce Willis ghost story ``The Sixth Sense'' remained in third 
place with $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's other major debuts opened weakly. The somber  
``Jakob the Liar,'' starring Robin Williams as a widower who cheers 
up fellow Jewish ghetto residents with fake reports of Allied 
victories over the Nazis, was eighth with $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mumford,'' an ensemble comedy about psychotherapy in a small  
town from ``The Big Chill'' director Lawrence Kasdan, took in $2 
million for ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
	With Judd as the wrongly accused suspect and Jones in his latest  
fugitive-hunter role, ``Double Jeopardy'' was an action movie that 
appealed to women and men, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of 
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd plays a woman whose husband faked his own death and framed  
her for the killing. Jones plays her parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount pitched the movie well to movie-goers, Dergarabedian  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a terrific marketing campaign. It was everywhere,''  
Dergarabedian said. ``This is a perfect case of a movie that was 
not going to fly in under the radar. It was positioned as a top 
fall entry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film takes its title from the legal precept that a defendant  
cannot be tried twice for the same crime -- meaning that since 
Judd's character already has been punished for her husband's 
murder, she can now hunt him down without consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea resonated with audiences in the same way the premise of  
Robert Redford's ``Indecent Proposal'' did, said Wayne Lewellen, 
distribution president for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?  
That's a simple, quick concept that's easy to grasp,'' Lewellen 
said. ``I think people were drawn to the concept that she could 
shoot her husband on Main Street and they couldn't do anything to 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jakob the Liar'' was hurt by its grim subject matter and mixed  
reviews, said Ed Russell, executive vice president for publicity 
for the movie's distributor, Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The film also was a tough sell coming on the heels of Roberto  
Benigni's Holocaust hit ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which won three 
Oscars, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a couple of films of similar subject matter and  
the second film out doesn't get as strong reviews, that's where 
you're hurt by it,'' Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' the summer's box office surprise, has taken in  
$225.1 million and moved ahead of ``Aladdin'' as Disney's 
second-highest grossing film behind ``The Lion King,'' which made 
$312 million. Edging past ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' ``Sixth Sense'' also 
climbed into the top 20 all-time moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Double Jeopardy,'' $23.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Blue Streak,'' $13.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $8.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``For Love of the Game,'' $6.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``American Beauty, $6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stigmata,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Stir of Echoes,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Jakob the Liar,'' $2.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Mumford,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Runaway Bride,'' $1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Prepare for Cardinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Refreshed physically and revived mentally,  
the Dallas Cowboys returned to practice Monday to start preparing 
for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, though, weren't even thinking about the Cowboys.  
They were too busy Monday night playing the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at an advantage because we're resting right now,''  
Cowboys linebacker Dexter Coakley said. ``They have to play Monday 
night, then turn around and play again Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coakley and the other linebackers always watch the Monday night  
game together and this week was no different. However, they were 
watching a little more closely than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Troy Aikman said he's not sure how much can be  
gained by watching Arizona on television -- but he said he would be 
tuned in anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to get a whole lot out of it on television,'' Aikman  
said. ``You're not able to see the entire coverages or fronts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Mark Stepnoski has a different approach. He figures  
there's no point in watching the Arizona-San Francisco game live 
because he's going to have to watch it on film all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to ruin the spontaneity,'' he said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' in-season vacation came at a good time because it  
allowed several players to get over injuries that have been 
lingering since training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Deion Sanders is likely to play for the first time since last  
season and he could be joined by fellow cornerback Kevin Smith. The 
right side of the offensive line -- Erik Williams and Everett McIver 
-- are healing after being injured in last week's victory over 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The only downside is that the Cowboys lost the spark that came  
from their first 2-0 start since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're anxious to get back out there,'' Coakley said. ``The bye  
week kind of took a little bit out of us. We're expecting to keep 
that momentum going like we have. We're just looking forward to 
this 14-game stretch.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Y2K Readiness Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers and health care experts said Monday  
they were concerned that doctors, hospitals and other Medicare 
health insurance providers will not be prepared to handle the Y2K 
computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook is alarming,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee monitoring the 
year 2000 computer issue. As of last week, he said, less than 2 
percent of the 230,000 hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other 
health care providers who submit claims to Medicare had tested 
their computer systems with Medicare contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Christoph, chief information officer for the Health Care  
Financing Administration, which oversees the Medicare program, told 
Horn's panel that the HCFA has fixed its internal computer systems 
and sees no interruptions from its end in servicing the 39 million 
senior citizens eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	But he agreed that ``we now see our greatest risk to the program  
as the uncertainties in the readiness of our partners; namely, our 
Medicare providers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has worried those monitoring the health care industry is  
the low level of response to surveys seeking information from 
doctors and hospitals about Y2K compliance, and how few of those 
responding have actually tested to ensure their computers are ready 
for the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Until tests are carried out, said Joel Willemssen of the General  
Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress, ``the 
ability of these entities to process Medicare claims in a future 
date environment is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said the HCFA is carrying out an extensive outreach  
program involving an 800-number, a Web site (www.hcfa.gov/y2k), 
year 2000 ``jump start kits'' and mailings to its 1.1 million 
Medicare providers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all Medicare managed care organizations are required to  
certify that their systems will perform into the new millennium, 
but reviews of the contingency plans for national chains indicate 
that while 50 percent are reasonable or in need of minor 
improvements, the other 50 percent need major improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 7 million in Medicare HMO programs require  
preauthorization for speciality care, said Joseph R. Baker of the 
Medicare Rights Center, and computer breakdowns could mean that 
these people can't get authorization for the care they need, ``with 
potentially devastating consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Whitney Addington, president of the American College of  
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, said there is a 
high level of Y2K awareness among doctors and many have taken 
corrective measures. But many haven't tested their systems, he 
said, and this could lead to a ``last minute 'debugging' demand 
that could overwhelm available resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Senate panel following Y2K developments, in a  
report on the status of Y2K compliance 100 days before the new 
year, also pointed to the health care industry as an area of major 
concern. It concluded that while large hospitals and federal 
agencies such as the HCFA are in good shape, there was a real 
possibility of disruptions at the local doctor and rural or small 
inner-city hospital level. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits of the year,  
and will not be able to differentiate between 2000 and 1900. That 
could cause computer systems to malfunction or break down.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Education Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With his veto of the GOP tax cut behind him,  
President Clinton turned his attention Monday to a congressional 
spending bill that he said demonstrates Republicans' low regard for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton chose a hard-luck brick middle school in downtown New  
Orleans for a renewed attack on GOP spending priorities. He said 
the education spending bill passed by a House subcommittee last 
week would gut school reform plans and halt desperately needed 
programs to repair or replace damaged and outdated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House favor ``an education budget that was $3  
billion below what I asked for,'' and ignores his plans to hire 
more teachers and modernize 6,000 schools, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to blame the kids and it's wrong not to give the  
schools a chance. And we know these schools can be turned around if 
they have the resources and a good plan and they work the plan,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations subcommittee bill was passed Thursday,  
the same day Clinton vetoed the GOP's $792 billion tax cut package, 
which he called bloated and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophie B. Wright Middle School, where Clinton spoke on a  
platform erected over a badly cracked, uneven asphalt basketball 
court, was built in 1912 and has not had a significant renovation 
since the 1950s, principal Charlotte Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's 564 students are packed 32 or more to a classroom.  
Nearly all of them read far below grade level when they arrive, Ms. 
Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the school's students come from poor families, and  
nearly all of them are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted some of the school's academic and structural  
problems, but he also congratulated one child who performed among 
the best students in the country on a national standardized test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never met a child that couldn't learn, or a school that  
couldn't do better or turn around,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a visit to Norfolk, Va., days before that veto, the president  
urged Congress to ``leave politics at the schoolhouse door'' and 
embrace his plan for tax breaks to help school districts repair, 
expand and upgrade schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, about 25,000 school buildings -- roughly a third of 
the nation's public schools -- need extensive repairs or must be 
replaced altogether. The GAO estimated that simply repairing 
existing schools would cost $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's one-day trip to New Orleans also included two  
fund-raising appearances for Rep. William Jefferson, a Louisiana 
Democrat running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you want in a governor is somebody who is smart,  
committed, with a good heart, who is passionate about what he or 
she believes, but is not particularly partisan,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three speeches in one day, plus rounds of handshaking and small  
talk with Jefferson supporters did not further the White House goal 
of rehabilitating Clinton's badly strained voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The President has been hoarse, sometimes painfully so, since a  
trip to New Zealand earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's regular physical exam Saturday, doctors  
diagnosed swollen vocal cords and recommended 10 days of voice 
rest.

<HEADLINE> Liberians' Deportation Deferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday issued a one-year  
deferment of deportation for Liberian refugees who fled their 
war-torn homeland, saying he felt other countries would deport 
Liberians if the United States did. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 Liberians live in the United States under a  
temporary protection program first granted in 1991, when large 
numbers of people fled civil war in the African country. Roughly 
4,000 live in Rhode Island alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The protected status, extended six times, was set to expire  
Tuesday. Liberian citizens would have had to receive a new visa, 
become permanent U.S. residents or return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said even though conditions in Liberia have improved  
since the civil war ended in 1996, the political and economic 
situation remains fragile. If the United States began deportations, 
he said, West African nations would deport Liberians in turn, which 
could lead to instability along the Liberian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would severely burden Liberia and threaten the fragile  
peace that has been recently achieved in West Africa,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president issued the deferment during a fundraising trip to  
New Orleans. It takes effect Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Targets China in Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Gary  
Bauer said Monday that the United States should revoke normal trade 
status for China and adopt a foreign policy that ``embraces our 
most basic human values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing his foreign policy platform, the conservative  
activist and former undersecretary of education under President 
Reagan said Americans have been given the impression that China is 
a ``big, bustling capitalist Disneyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this portrait is willfully delusional,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he would break ties with China if elected president  
and increase support for the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States should not be doing business with an  
``authoritarian, autocratic, one-party dictatorship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized China's human rights record, its ongoing  
aggression toward Taiwan and the Chinese espionage scandal that has 
led to new security measures at U.S. nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot be faithful to our principles at home and be  
unfaithful to them abroad,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience at the Commonwealth Club in downtown San Francisco  
was largely supportive, cheering Bauer's stance against China, as 
well as his proposal for a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer last week unveiled plans for a 16 percent flat tax, along  
with a 20 percent reduction in the payroll deduction for Social 
Security. He also would end all tax deductions except those for 
home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, former chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, a  
conservative lobbying group, trails challengers Steve Forbes, 
George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his fourth-place finish in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll  
last month was encouraging although his campaign chairman, Charles 
Jarvis, later joined the Forbes camp, proclaiming that Bauer 
``cannot win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bauer predicted that followers of former Vice President Dan  
Quayle -- who dropped out of the race Monday -- would gravitate 
toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe we're going to get a lot of his support,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, Quayle, Forbes, Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan -- who may  
quit the GOP to seek the Reform Party's nomination -- are courting 
the same bloc of conservative voters.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers welcomed  
agreement between the International Monetary Fund and Colombia on a 
$2.7 billion loan package. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's implementation of economic measures that accompany  
the program ``should help lay the basis for sustained economic 
growth and financial stability,'' Summers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also welcome Colombia's commitment to strengthen the social  
safety net in the context of its three-year program,'' he said, 
referring to measures intended to make sure the country's rising 
ranks of unemployed and poor people do not suffer more misery. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the IMF money, Colombia will receive $4.2 billion  
from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Virus Detected in Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported  
in the United States is to blame for at least one of three deaths 
in the city, federal health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection  
identified a ``West Nile-like'' virus in the victim on Friday and 
were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman 
Barbara Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have  
some more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the 
strain of West Nile or a new virus,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West  
Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region. 
Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and 
Europe, never before in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists earlier thought St. Louis encephalitis killed three  
and sickened 15 other people in the city and neighboring 
Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible the numbers could go higher. Spinal fluid samples  
from 77 people who fell ill but tested negative for St. Louis 
encephalitis would be re-examined for the West Nile or Kunjin 
virus, city Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen told The New York 
Times. Seven of those 77 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the  
United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying 
now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work 
against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain tissue from victims of the encephalitis outbreak has been  
undergoing analysis at the CDC and at the Emerging Diseases 
Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Ian Lipkin, the director of the Irvine lab, said his  
colleagues had identified either West Nile virus or a variant found 
in Australia, Kunjin virus, in the brains of three encephalitis 
victims from the city's Queens borough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of this is that this particular agent has  
never been reported in North America,'' Lipkin said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> New Crew Haunted by Ferry Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Every time the Regina Baltica sets sail,  
the crew has haunting memories of the night five years ago when the 
ferry Estonia went down in the Baltic Sea with nearly 1,000 people 
on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant reminder of one of Europe's worst maritime  
disasters inspires them to make their ship, which replaced the 
fated Estonia, as safe as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most crews can't imagine that accidents can happen. We can  
imagine it very well,'' said Peeter Tees, technical director on the 
Regina Baltica. 
</P>
<P>
	The Estonia sank in a storm off the Finnish coast on Sept. 28,  
1994, killing 852 of 989 people on board. Some of Regina Baltica's 
crew were among the Estonia's 137 survivors; most had close friends 
who perished. 
</P>
<P>
	The lessons learned have made the Regina Baltica one of the  
safest passenger ferries in the world, according to Capt. Alar 
Kask, who worked on the Estonia just two days before its final 
voyage between Tallinn and the Swedish capital, Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of accident that happened to the Estonia can't happen  
on this ferry,'' Kask said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fateful moment on the Estonia occurred at the halfway point  
in its 217-mile journey when huge waves ripped off the visor-like 
bow door, which led to the car deck. 
</P>
<P>
	As it fell off, the 56-ton door flung open an inner door, the  
last barrier to the open sea. The car deck flooded, the ship listed 
sharply and capsized in about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Slot machines, couches and whole bars slid across restaurants  
and dance floors, crushing people. Sea water swirled up stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
	Hallways became jammed with terror-stricken passengers clawing  
to get past. Some tried to scale tilting floors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who got out of the ship couldn't find life  
jackets. Stormy waves overturned life rafts in the pitch-black 
night. Many froze to death waiting for rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the accident, speculation has been rife about why the ship  
sank, including theories of explosions and sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	An international commission, appointed by the governments of  
Sweden, Finland and Estonia, blamed the Estonia's German builder, 
Meyer Werft, saying its bow door locks were poorly made. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer Werft said poor maintenance of the locks was the cause,  
then claimed it might have been a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the commission ruled out an explosion on board.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only theory missing now is that the accident was caused by  
a UFO,'' commission chair Uno Laur was quoted as telling Estonia's 
Postimees daily. 
</P>
<P>
	According to maritime experts, new passenger-car ferries have  
been made safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Regina Baltica's bow is reinforced. The inner door was  
repositioned further from the main bow door, and watertight doors 
were installed that can't leak from the car deck to the rest of the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	New safety measures include heat-generating life jackets, rafts  
that right themselves and an advanced passenger evacuation system. 
</P>
<P>
	But some say such vessels are fundamentally dangerous.  
</P>
<P>
	With car decks the size of football fields and doors at both  
ends, cars can roll on and off quickly. But this also enables water 
to build up dangerously, slam against the hull and possibly capsize 
the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a joke among seamen about roll-on roll-off ferries,''  
said Regina Baltica's Chief Mate Vahur Sostra. ``Easy to get on, 
easy to get off, easy to go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Regina Baltica crew will lay wreaths on the water  
above the wreck to mark the fifth anniversary of a catastrophe that 
still stirs strong emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' relatives express anger that no one has been held  
legally responsible. Some believe there is a conspiracy to cover up 
the accident's true cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cannot come to terms with the tragedy because they haven't  
been able to bury their lost ones. Only 94 bodies were recovered. 
Most remain entombed in the Estonia.

<HEADLINE> Liberians' Deportation Deferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted Liberians in the  
United States a year's reprieve from deportation, one day before 
they were to lose their temporary status as protected residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Monday by the White House, Clinton said he  
directed Attorney General Janet Reno and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to defer deportations for one year in order 
to promote stability in Liberia and West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was worried that deportations could spur  
countries in West Africa to also expel the thousands of Liberians 
who fled there because of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would severely burden Liberia and threaten the fragile  
peace that has been recently achieved in West Africa,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the longest-running immigration sagas of its kind,  
10,000 to 15,000 Liberians have been living in the United States 
under a temporary protection program first granted in 1991, when 
large numbers of people fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Temporary protected status allows for a stay of six to 18 months  
for people whose homeland is hit by natural disaster or war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberians were granted extension after extension as civil  
war raged. But with the fighting officially over since 1997, some 
in the U.S. government believe the country is now becoming safe for 
repatriations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Clinton administration announced that the  
Liberians would get a reprieve. But details weren't announced until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Clinton approved a one-year ``deferred enforced  
departure'' for Liberians. It differs from another extension of 
temporary protected status but the practical impact for Liberians -- 
staying for another year -- is the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking with great anxiety to the end of this month,''  
said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a leading advocate for Liberians in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing deportation, ``Families would have had to make some very  
difficult and, indeed, cruel choices: whether they would leave 
children behind who are American citizens, whether they would go 
underground .... '' Reed said. ``All of those decisions have been 
spared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island has about 12,000 natives of Liberia, the largest  
population of any state. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, roughly 3,000 to 5,000 are under temporary protection  
and could have been deported without the reprieve. Others are 
naturalized citizens or permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Liberian communities are in Massachusetts and areas around  
Washington, the Bronx, N.Y., Los Angeles and the North Carolina 
cities of Raleigh and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in Liberia from 1989 to 1997 shattered the nation  
founded by freed American slaves in 1822. It killed 200,000 and 
forced half the country's 2.6 million people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The war and the flight of business people disrupted the economy  
and left in shambles the infrastructure of a nation that even in 
prewar days had only one phone line for every 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for Liberians say the country lacks electricity and  
sewage and is unsafe because of roaming paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation would be intolerable if they were to go back to  
a country with 75 percent unemployment and an infrastructure that 
can't cope with their safe return,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, 
D-R.I., who pressed the White House to grant an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending in Congress is a bill by Kennedy and Reed to grant  
permanent residency to Liberians who were eligible for temporary 
protected status on or after the outbreak of civil war and have met 
other eligibility requirements for immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Reed is trying to amend a fiscal 2000 spending bill  
for the Commerce, State and Justice departments to give Liberians 
temporary protected status for the year. Although that's not 
unnecessary given Clinton's action, Reed argues that it would put 
Liberians on firmer footing to get a future reprieve, if needed. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Tuesday  
in Tokyo, while Japanese stocks rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.26 yen, up 2.12 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 106.00 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 367.11  
points, or 2.08 percent, to 17,188.17 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Tuesday, the average closed down 50.67 points, or 0.30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar continued to rise on hopes for  
joint action against the yen's rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had gained ground against the Japanese currency in  
New York on Monday after the meeting of G-7 central bankers and 
finance ministers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said in a statement Saturday that it shared Japan's  
concern about the yen's strength and that it would ``continue to 
monitor developments in exchange markets and cooperate as 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Japan failed to obtain a clear pledge from other G-7  
members for coordinated action. The G-7 includes the United States, 
Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials are worried that the yen's surge could  
smother the nation's budding economic recovery by making Japanese 
exports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 111.26 yen, up from  
109.13 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started sharply higher Tuesday on a  
rise in the dollar against the yen as well as a rebound on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo market was an advance in Nikkei  
Futures prices in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying fundamentals for Japanese stocks are still  
good,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded  
24.06 points at 10,303.29. U.S. stocks were led higher by some 
high-technology and consumer issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 28.91 points, or 2.02 percent, to 1,458.29. 
The TOPIX closed down 1.04 points, or 0.07 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7150 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6850 percent. Its price 
fell 0.26 point to 99.87.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Offer Free Housekeeping Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The head of a high-tech business believes  
he's found a way to retain employees in a tight job market: Do 
their housekeeping and give them company money for vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February, Gary Quick, president and chief executive  
officer of 8-year-old Quick Solutions Inc., has been giving out the 
perks as a way of hiring and keeping high-tech talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had lots of people tell me that when they come home and  
see a clean house, it makes them feel the company loves them and 
boosts their morale and that of everyone in their family,'' Quick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At most companies, pay raises and other forms of compensation  
are the main retention tool. But at a small but growing number of 
companies, mainly in the competitive computer industry, ``lifestyle 
perks'' -- from concierge services to new cars -- are being offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some areas, such as computer consulting, demand is great  
and even good lower-level people are much sought after, so the 
perks are (trickling) down,'' says Helen Axel, a senior fellow at 
New York City's Conference Board, a nonprofit research group. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Quick Solutions said it's too early to tell whether  
the new benefits will help retain workers. Only 20 of the company's 
285 total employees were eligible for the perks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Quick is hoping that his strategy will give the small  
software development company an edge in hiring and keeping good 
workers. The company has revenues of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of its workers are in Columbus, but the company in the last  
two years has also opened small offices in Chicago and Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick's previous work experience as a recruiter taught him how  
important it is to have happy employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a chance to sit down with probably thousands of people  
and hear their likes and dislikes about their jobs, and their 
biggest complaint usually was that the company they worked for 
didn't care for them and saw them as nothing more than an item on 
the balance sheet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, he established the program that gives employees  
who've worked for the company for three years free housecleaning 
once a month and a $1,200 annual voucher for personal travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been using a housecleaning service before this, anyway, so  
this is saving me a good bit of money,'' says Jane Barker, who has 
worked for Quick for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1,200 travel allotment, which must be used as a lump sum  
once a year, gives employees the chance to take the kind of trips 
they might otherwise be unable to afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Hines, who has worked for Quick for 3 1/2 years, used his  
allotment to help pay for an anniversary cruise to Alaska he and 
his wife already had planned. ``We were taking the cruise anyway, 
but this made it a lot less expensive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While still rare in the corporate world, Quick's efforts are  
already winning kudos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most companies have figured out that money alone isn't the  
answer,'' said Howard J. Klein, an associate professor of 
management and human resources at Ohio state University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of perks that Mr. Quick is offering are likely to  
become more common because they encourage worker loyalty and reduce 
employee stress,'' said Klein. ``So the benefits they provide in 
the long run are worth the expense.''

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid's  
things-to-do list is getting frighteningly long and too familiar in 
a season that is just three games old. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought in before the season to jump-start the offense, he's  
getting pathetic results. The new, West Coast-style attack hasn't 
generated a touchdown in 11 quarters, managed just 22 rushing yards 
in a 26-0 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, and is getting 
little protection from an offensive line that Reid says must play 
with more emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say we're not playing as physical as we need to play,''  
rookie left guard Doug Brzeznski said Monday. ``But he's the boss 
so whatever he says goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the team is listening to Reid, it isn't showing on the field  
or in the standings, where the Eagles are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a defense that had been playing admirably the first two  
games of the year struggled against the Bills, producing little 
pressure on Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie as the Eagles' top 
defensive player, end Hugh Douglas, watched from the sideline with 
an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defensively, we've got a ways to go,'' cornerback Troy Vincent  
said. ``We've got to change peoples' attitudes, not just here but 
with the rest of the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Priority No. 1, Reid says, is getting the ball into the end  
zone, something the Eagles haven't done since scoring three TDs in 
the first quarter of their season-opening loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are receivers open, and the receiver has an  
opportunity when it is 9-0 to score a touchdown, you must score a 
touchdown. They are way too hard to come by in the NFL. And to be 
wide-open and not do that, that cannot happen,'' said Reid, 
referring to the pass an uncovered Torrance Small dropped against 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said he was undecided if Small, signed as a free agent  
during the offseason from Indianapolis, would start against the New 
York Giants on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of even more pressing concern to Reid is the state of his  
offensive line, which starts a rookie (Brzezinski) at one guard 
spot, rotates two free agent pickups (Jeff Dellenbach and David 
Diaz-Infante) at the other, and has lost two starting right tackles 
(rookie Jon Wellbourn and veteran Jermane Mayberry) to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo took advantage of some of our younger players,  
particularly on the offensive line. When a group of players does 
not play with emotion, those players have to evaluate themselves,'' 
Reid said. ``I'm not going to say it's more a lack of effort than 
it is a lack of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something happens wrong, continue to push, continue to play  
aggressive ... that's what I'm going to teach and continue to 
teach,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys have to take it on themselves to be ready to play. I  
don't think you need somebody to get you to push your button to get 
ready to play. It's an emotional game,'' said quarterback Doug 
Pederson, who threw for 137 yards but lost two fumbles against 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're killing ourselves offensively right now. Turnovers,  
penalties, things like that are hurting us.''

<HEADLINE> Malkovich Breaks Up Street Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- John Malkovich broke up a street fight to  
the cheers of passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
	Driving through Madrid on Sept. 20, the actor noticed that two  
drivers had left their vehicles and were punching and shoving each 
other over who had the right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
	Malkovich, 46, got out of his car, took off his coat and dragged  
the two apart, the El Pais newspaper reported Monday. People 
recognized him and cheered, with one shouting: ``You're my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later told reporters he has broken up several fights, many in  
England, where brawls are worse because ``people go for the kill,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malkovich was in Madrid to work on ``The Dancer Upstairs,'' his  
directorial debut. The movie deals with the Peruvian guerrilla 
group Shining Path.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Ready for Yankees, Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Heading into their third postseason in  
four years, the Texas Rangers insist things will be different this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	They surely can't do any worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas has won just one of seven playoff games, losing its last  
six. They scored just one run in three games last October. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year the Rangers believe they have the right mix of  
pitching, hitting and confidence to beat anyone -- even their 
nemesis, the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody in this room knows we have the talent to do  
it, and the way we've played all year against the good teams, I 
think we all realize that we have the mental makeup to do it,'' 
third baseman Todd Zeile said. ``Now it's a matter of putting those 
two things together at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers did that over the weekend, rebounding from a  
weeklong slump to take three straight from second-place Oakland. 
Their bats came alive to score 12, 10 and 10 runs, and their 
starter won each game. 
</P>
<P>
	With three outs to go in the clincher Sunday, Texas already was  
looking ahead to the playoffs and a likely first-round matchup with 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Sinatra's ``New York, New York'' was played over the  
loudspeakers and ``Bring on the Yankees'' was flashed on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a bold attitude for a team that has been eliminated by New  
York in its only two postseason appearances, 1996 and '98. The 
Rangers have lost six straight playoff games to the Yankees, and 
they scored just one run in a three-game sweep last October. 
</P>
<P>
	But Texas players keep saying they look forward to the chance of  
going to the Bronx and confronting their playoff demons head on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' slugger Juan Gonzalez said. ``Because we're a  
better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three probable playoff scenarios have the Rangers and  
Yankees meeting in the first round. The only way around it is if 
Texas ends the regular season with the same or better record as 
Cleveland, which would bring likely wild-card team Boston to The 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas beat Seattle 3-2 Monday night for its fourth straight  
victory. The Rangers improved to 93-63, going 30 games over .500 
for the first time in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers are two games behind Cleveland for the top record in  
the AL. Texas only has to tie Cleveland because it holds the 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to being in the playoffs again and  
seeing how far we can go,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``We 
think we match up against the other playoff teams better than ever 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers always have had lineups filled with bashers, but  
this year's collection is their best ever. Six guys have at least 
20 homers, four players have scored 100 or more runs and there are 
three 100-RBI men. They will have five triple-digit run producers, 
which would tie a major league record, if Zeile and Rusty Greer 
each knock in two more. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest reason Texas is closing in on the team record of  
94 wins is because of an improved pitching staff, which includes 
one of the best bullpens in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also have shown a knack for playing their best when  
they needed it the most, which is what the playoffs are all about. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has won 15 of its last 18 games against teams with winning  
records. That includes going 9-3 against Cleveland, New York and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers' ability to get up for big games contrasts a  
tendency to lay down against bad teams. Over the last five weeks, 
Texas has had three three-game losing streaks to teams below .500 
and a stretch of three losses in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's time really strap it on and go up against big  
competition, we rise to the occasion,'' Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro's grand slam capped Sunday's victory and added  
to his storybook return to Texas after five years in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to stop here,'' he said. ``The goal is to get  
to the World Series and we're on the right track.''

<HEADLINE> FedEx Opens Hub Outside Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Federal Express on Monday opened its new $200  
million hub at the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris as part 
of a plan to speed up package deliveries within Europe and from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx, based in Memphis, Tenn., chose Paris in 1996 as its  
principal European sorting and distribution center, citing the 
city's central location, economic potential and stable weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hub, FedEx's largest outside the United States, will be  
able to process 24,000 packages and 30,000 documents per hour, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a general expansion, FedEx also plans to replace its  
fleet of six Boeing 727 planes with five larger Airbus A310s in the 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris hub, financed jointly by FedEx and Airports of Paris,  
is expected to create about 2,000 jobs in the next 6 years, 
according to a company statement. FedEx also has signed an 
agreement with France's Defense Ministry, promising to hire some of 
the ministry's retired employees.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries To Finish Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Disputes over everything from family planning  
to NASA have dashed any hope Congress' Republican leaders had of 
keeping their pledge to complete spending bills before Friday's 
start of fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Already planning to violate a second promise to honor 2-year-old  
spending limits, Republicans are using accounting gimmicks to claim 
they are holding to a third promise: that they will not use Social 
Security surpluses to pay for federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Though most Americans pay little attention to the government's  
fiscal calendar or spending limits, polls show they are attuned to 
both parties' pledges to protect Social Security's huge trust 
funds. Violating these promises can be particularly harmful to the 
GOP because its core conservative supporters care deeply about 
their party's efforts for fiscal austerity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Republicans have most to worry about is losing their  
credibility on fiscal responsibility,'' said Marshall Wittmann, the 
conservative Heritage Foundation's director of congressional 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders insist they will not spend Social Security funds.  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said on television Sunday 
that that is the GOP's ``intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make that claim, Republicans are relying on gimmicks such as  
postponing billions in spending into 2001 and beyond, and changing 
the official spending estimates used by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But moderate Republicans eager to protect some programs and for  
Congress to turn its attention to other issues want party leaders 
to cut a spending deal with President Clinton, even if it means 
eating into Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will have to sit at a table and talk to one another,''  
said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill. ``Both sides are going to have to 
share the blame for that, if and when it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by Friday, the House voted 327-87 Monday to approve a 
final version of a $21 billion measure financing energy and water 
projects. Senate approval -- expected Tuesday -- would make it the 
fifth spending measure for 2000 that lawmakers have shipped to the 
White House. Clinton is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill's completion demonstrated the GOP's eagerness to  
complete whatever work they can. To finish, Republicans agreed to 
drop language from the measure that would have let developers or 
local governments file earlier court appeals when the Army Corps of 
Engineers blocks them from building on wetlands. The White House 
opposed the provision on environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee also  
approved a $324 billion measure for health, education and labor 
programs for the coming year. The Senate measure would add $500 
million to Clinton's $34.7 billion request for education, but it 
reduces his proposals for hiring new teachers, adult education and 
several other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has already threatened to veto a more austere House  
version of that bill because it provides less than he wants for 
after school, worker safety and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to blame the kids and it's wrong not to give the  
schools a chance,'' Clinton said in New Orleans on Monday, 
referring to GOP cuts in his education budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced that he now expects the surplus for  
fiscal 1999 -- which ends Thursday night -- will be at least $115 
billion, $16 billion than the last White House projection. But that 
will have little effect on the fight over next year's bills, unless 
the surplus projection for 2000 rises when it is updated in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slow pace of work and the seven veto threats the  
administration has issued, no federal shutdown is imminent. 
Congress plans to send Clinton legislation as early as Tuesday 
keeping agencies functioning through Oct. 21 while work on 
remaining bills continues. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew said Monday that Clinton  
would sign the stopgap measure, but warned that Republicans should 
be under ``no illusion'' that he would sign numerous short-term 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the eight unfinished spending bills, many are mired in  
disputes among Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These include battles over the Cuba trade embargo and regional  
milk prices that have slowed the $68 billion agriculture bill; over 
the Air Force's planned purchases of F-22 stealth fighters, which 
has delayed the near $270 billion defense bill; and over federal 
aid to groups that lobby foreign governments to ease their abortion 
restrictions, which has hampered the $13 billion foreign aid bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A $97 billion measure cuts Clinton's plans for NASA, environment  
and housing while boosting health-care programs for veterans. The 
$14 billion bill financing the Interior Department contains 
provisions affecting oil and mining companies that use federal 
lands that the White House opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 billion transportation bill is hindered by an internal  
GOP fight over whether surplus federal gas taxes should be used for 
road projects or distributed to the states. And fights persist 
between Congress and the administration over hiring police 
officers, legal aid for the poor and other issues in a $38 billion 
measure financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State.

<HEADLINE> NYC Exhibit Becomes Political Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Art fused with politics Monday as an exhibit  
including elephant dung on a painting of the Virgin Mary became the 
latest issue in the duel between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani -- who like the first lady is an all-but-declared  
candidate for the Senate from New York -- has threatened to cut $7 
million in funding to the Brooklyn Museum of Art if it goes ahead 
with the show on Saturday. He has called the exhibit, which also 
features bisected animals and a topless woman in the place of Jesus 
at the Last Supper, ``sick'' and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, a City Hall source speaking on condition of  
anonymity said the museum agreed to pull the dung-decorated 
painting as part of a tentative deal with the mayor. But the museum 
issued a statement saying no deal had been reached and that the 
exhibit was going to open as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Mrs. Clinton declared that the museum shouldn't  
lose its funding -- money that makes up a full third of its budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to penalize and punish an institution  
such as the Brooklyn Museum,'' Mrs. Clinton said during an 
appearance at a Harlem school. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, she said she shares ``the feeling that I know  
many New Yorkers have that there are parts of this exhibit that 
would be deeply offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not go to see this exhibit,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who is Roman Catholic, accused the first lady of  
supporting the use of public money ``to attack and bash the 
Catholic religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the works in the exhibit: ``The Holy Virgin Mary''  
painting, which depicts Mary with dark skin, African features and 
flowing robes. It includes shellacked clumps of elephant dung and 
dozens of cutouts of female private parts from pornographic 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The work -- part of the British ``Sensation'' exhibit -- has  
fueled a debate about freedom of expression and public support of 
the arts. It has also brought both financial peril and publicity to 
a museum used to operating in the shadows of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and other Manhattan attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has sided with the mayor,  
while civil rights activists have said that pulling the museum's 
funding would violate the First Amendment. The New York Civil 
Liberties Union was planning a rally to support the exhibit, and 
conservative Republicans were planning one against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virgin Mary'' artist Chris Ofili, who is noted for using  
elephant dung in his works, has refused interviews -- a stance that 
has done nothing to halt the furor. 
</P>
<P>
	Art critic Jeffrey Hogrefe of the New York Observer said: ``They  
wanted to get some publicity and they got it. ... I think it was 
pretty calculated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn Museum's director, Arnold Lehman, has been silent.  
But elsewhere, opinions about the work -- even from those who 
haven't seen it -- abound. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, O'Connor said  
he was ``saddened'' by what appears to be an attack on the Virgin 
Mary. And Gov. George Pataki said he was grateful that no state 
money was involved in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor dodged the question of whether Giuliani should cut  
off vital funding to the museum. But Mrs. Clinton argued that 
personal reactions ``should not lead to the penalization and 
shutting down of an entire museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other works in the exhibit include a series of Siamese-twin type  
mannequins, some with sex organs in place of noses and mouths; a 
work consisting of two halves of a pig, sliced from snout to hoof, 
suspended in two formaldehyde tanks; and ``Wrecked,'' an up-to-date 
version of the Last Supper with a topless woman standing in for 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts real life in art,'' Village Voice critic Jerry Saltz  
said of the exhibit, which has made stops in London and Berlin. 
``Some of it is atrocious. Some of it is pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Posts Chat-Room Web Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viewers who tuned in to ABC's first-ever  
Internet news broadcast to chat electronically with anchor Sam 
Donaldson had more than their names and comments posted to the Web 
site for the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also disclosed the unique four-numbered Internet address for  
each person who wrote a comment Monday, a decision that helps 
anyone trace a viewer's real-world identity. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, ``Mark from DC'' turned out to be an employee  
at the Justice Department who pressed the chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission: ``When will the telecommunications 
industries begin addressing the increasing gulf in the 
inaccessibility of the Web to (the) poor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman William Kennard was among Donaldson's guests on the  
debut of his Web-only broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Gershon, general manager for the ABC News Web site,  
couldn't be reached to explain the network's decision to publish 
each viewer's ``Internet protocol'' address. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said earlier that the site will collect only a person's  
name and e-mail address when a viewer asks to subscribe to a 
regular newsletter that Donaldson will write. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's Internet privacy policy, published elsewhere on its Web  
site, warns viewers that some chat boards ``may display IP 
(Internet protocol) addresses along with the message poster's name 
and message.'' It urges people to ``please review each service 
prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are 
comfortable with sharing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a bit of cluelessness that should be fixed,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``There's no reason to do it, and a number of reasons not to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department referred questions about its employee's  
participation in Monday's broadcast to its 1997 Internet policy, 
which urges that employees ``making personal use of Internet e-mail 
should make it clear, when appropriate, that his or her e-mail is 
not being used for official duties.''

<HEADLINE> Auburn's Leard Out at Least 4 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn quarterback Ben Leard will miss at  
least four weeks with a separated shoulder and could require 
season-ending shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Leard said Monday that Auburn's trainers will wait until the  
swelling goes down before deciding whether or not he needs surgery. 
He separated his shoulder during Saturday's 24-17 loss to 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another hurdle I have to overcome,'' Leard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Leard, ranked second in the nation with a passing efficiency  
rating of 175.5 percent, had resurrected his career this season 
under new coach Tommy Tuberville. He was the starter last year for 
Auburn, but lost his job to Gabe Gross midway through the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross beat him out in the preseason to start this year, but  
Leard replaced him in the third quarter of the season opener and 
never looked back. He is 56-of-78 for 729 yards with six touchdowns 
and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Leard said he wasn't sure how seriously he was injured after the  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a real bad bruise, but I tried to take my  
mouthpiece out and couldn't pick my arm up to take my mouthpiece 
out,'' he said. ``I knew something was wrong so I called a timeout 
and couldn't pick my arm up then, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leard said as the trainers tried to examine him on the sidelines  
he could ``feel a popping'' underneath his shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when they told me what they thought it was, a  
separation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's doctors have decided to treat the injury  
conservatively, hoping Leard will be able to come back in early 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Klein will start Saturday at No. 7 Tennessee. He will be  
Auburn's third starting quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross last week quit the team to concentrate on playing baseball  
and Tuberville said Monday that had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving up the depth chart as Klein's backups are walk-on Jacob  
Allen, who has been Auburn's holder, and freshman Allen Tillman. 
Tillman said he would rather be redshirted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jacob knows 50 percent of the offense, and Jacob knows 50  
percent more than Allen knows,'' offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein replaced Leard against Ole Miss and was 10-of-16 for 112  
yards and a touchdown.

	The increase of more than $16 per ounce was the largest  
day-to-day rise in gold prices in at least nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold jumped to a high of $285.00 an ounce in the wake of the  
announcement Sunday by 15 central banks that they would cap their 
combined gold sales to 400 tons per year for a total of five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices settled back in midday trading to $283.00 an ounce, still  
up sharply from Friday's closing price of $268.60. Much of today's 
increase stemmed from purchases by traders who had bet on a slide 
in gold prices but who then rushed to buy futures contracts to 
hedge their short positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebounding price marked a dramatic turnaround from recent  
pessimism about gold's long-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the group of central banks acted to restore  
stability to gold prices by removing the uncertainty that a central 
bank might suddenly sell some of its reserves and drive prices down 
further. The central banks also agreed not to increase their 
leasing of bullion. 
</P>
<P>
	John Slater, an economist at National Westminster Bank Group,  
said their decision ``obviously puts a floor now under the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World gold prices had declined markedly since May, when  
Britain's Treasury announced its intention to sell much of its 
reserves and replace them with securities denominated in dollars, 
yen and euros -- assets that offered a better financial return. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England auctioned 25 metric tons of gold last  
Tuesday, its second such sale of reserves this year. Switzerland's 
central bank and the International Monetary Fund also had expressed 
an interest in selling off some of their gold holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear in the market that the Bank of England's sales would  
lead to further banks' selling is very much reduced now,'' Slater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhona O'Connell of T. Hoare Canaccord, a London-based brokerage  
specializing in precious metals, said she expected the central 
banks' strategy to help push gold up to $320 an ounce by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's increase was the largest rise from one trading day to  
the next since Aug. 10, 1990, when the price for gold in London 
shot up by $14.95 an ounce, according to Gold Fields Mineral 
Services Ltd., a London-based precious metals research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, traditionally a haven for investors in times of turmoil,  
peaked at $875 per ounce in January 1980 -- a time when U.S. 
inflation rate was in double figures, oil prices were rising 
rapidly and Soviet troops were entering Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Royals 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Robert Fick's first career grand slam helped  
Detroit close Tiger Stadium with an 8-2 win over the Kansas City 
Royals on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Polonia and Karim Garcia also homered for Detroit. Mark  
Quinn homered for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler (10-16) gave up two runs and nine hits in six  
innings. Jeff Suppan (10-11) was tagged with the loss, allowing 
four runs and eight hits in 5 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonia gave Detroit a 1-0 lead with a leadoff home run in the  
first. The Royals tied it when Quinn opened the second with a 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Damion Easley doubled and scored on Fick's sacrifice fly in the  
second. Joe Randa's RBI single made it 2-all in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Fick, wearing the No. 25 of the late Norm Cash, a Detroit  
favorite, hit his grand slam off Jeff Montgomery in the eighth with 
Easley, Garcia and Gabe Kapler on base. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the team will play in Comerica Park, a state-of-the  
art stadium about a mile away. But Monday was a time for 
remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's players all wore numbers of Tigers who played through  
the years. The starters wore the numbers of the Tigers' all-time 
team. Center fielder Gabe Kapler wore a uniform without a number, 
honoring Ty Cobb -- the greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in 
an era before uniforms were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game with the Royals was the 6,873rd regular season  
game at the stadium, which also has played host to 35 postseason 
games and three All-Star games. Special baseballs were used, and 
the bases were changed after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes*: Polonia's homer marked the sixth time in his career he had  
led off with a homer and third time this season. ... Hall of Famers 
Al Kaline and George Brett exchanged lineup cards. Both wore their 
familiar uniforms, Kaline with his No. 6 on the back, Brett with 
No. 5.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Pleas in Calif. Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A ship's captain and operator pleaded  
guilty to criminal charges Monday and agreed to pay millions in 
fines and cleanup costs from the spill of 3,000 gallons of oil off 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard caught up with the ship off Central America by  
following the oily sheen in the tanker's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek company, Anax International Agencies, agreed to pay  
more than $9.4 million in fines, cleanup costs and environmental 
restoration damages. The captain, Dimitrios Georgantas, agreed to 
probation that will bar him from U.S. ports for three years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the plea agreement are subject to approval by Chief  
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, who has scheduled 
sentencing for Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberian-flagged tanker Command, which had been docked in  
San Francisco Bay for fuel tank repairs, left for Ecuador on Sept. 
26, 1998. Despite Coast Guard orders not to use a damaged tank, 
Georgantas ordered fuel transferred to that tank at sea, the plea 
agreement said. A hose broke loose and oil spilled into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 170 birds, including some rare brown pelicans, were  
killed when the oil reached the San Mateo County coast, authorities 
said. Cleanup costs were estimated at $1.23 million.

	Aftershock Fears Persist in Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Fears of further death-dealing aftershocks  
persisted just as hope dimmed for finding more survivors today, 
nearly one week after a devastating earthquake killed more than 
2,000 people in Taiwan. The Central Weather Bureau, which had 
earlier predicted aftershocks would decrease in intensity, was 
caught off guard Sunday when a new jolt -- measured at up to 6.8 
magnitude -- shook the island, killing at least three persons. 
Nearly 8,000 aftershocks were registered by today, with 20 to 50 
tremors occurring each hour since the major earthquake struck in 
the early hours last Tuesday.

today, handing over control to international peacekeepers and 
leaving only a token force behind. Peacekeeping mission head Maj. 
Gen. Peter Cosgrove met behind closed doors with Maj. Gen. Kiki 
Syahnakri, commander of Indonesian forces in East Timor, who 
planned to leave later in the day. Col. Geerhan Lantara, who served

the command for security in the territory was officially handed

never materialized. Lightning-sparked fires have burned more than 
60,000 acres of northern California's Trinity Alps Wilderness in

earthquake. Researchers r say data from a 1,000-foot continuous 
core sample extracted from the border of Long Beach and Los 
Alamitos could give them a clearer picture of how the ground 
shakes. Researchers plan to use the information to update seismic 
hazard maps, which can help emergency officials identify areas most

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- US Airways has ordered its pilots to fly the  
Boeing 737 faster during takeoffs and landings to avoid the type of 
rudder malfunction that is believed to have caused the crash of 
Flight 427 near Pittsburgh in 1994, according to a report. Citing 
US Airways memos dated this month, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
reported yesterday that the airline told its pilots to fly 20 
knots, or 23 mph, faster during certain phases of takeoffs and 
landings. Pilots say the added speed gives them more time to 
recognize and correct rudder problems that cannot be fixed at 
slower speeds.

<HEADLINE> Miami University Won't Let Band Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- Miami University barred its band from  
playing during halftime of Saturday's game against Marshall because 
some members were drinking, watching pornographic movies and 
mooning people during a trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The band will be allowed to play before and after the game  
because it is on Parents' Day, spokesman Richard Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	The band also was banned from playing at halftime of an upcoming  
Cincinnati Bengals game, and other discipline is possible after an 
investigation, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members on one of six chartered buses to a Sept. 11 game  
against West Virginia were mooning people on the bus and passersby 
while drinking, Little said. Other band members complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The university also is investigating complaints that there was  
drinking in a lodge where the band stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Consuming alcohol while on a band trip violates university  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will spend several weeks trying to determine  
how many of the band's nearly 300 members were involved, but those 
who complained said only a handful took part, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under school policy, students found guilty of alcohol violations  
must pay for a mandatory course on alcohol education. Students with 
three violations -- or fewer, if disruptive behavior is involved -- 
are automatically suspended or expelled.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Memorial Trees Said Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Parents of Columbine High School  
shooting victims chopped down two of 15 memorial trees to protest 
the inclusion of the gunmen's families, according to two 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The felling of the two 10-foot linden trees occurred during a  
rally Sunday at the West Bowles Community Church, The Denver Post 
and Denver Rocky Mountain News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 trees had been planted about two weeks ago by church  
members in an effort to pay tribute to the families of all who died 
in the April 20 massacre, including the parents of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher  
before committing suicide during the rampage at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 sign-toting protesters gathered Sunday to affix 13 of  
the trees with names of the shooting victims. Then they watched 
silently as the two trees left nameless were cut down by Al 
Velasquez and Rich Petrone, whose son and stepson, respectively, 
were killed in the massacre, the newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheers resounded as the trees fell.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me sick to even have to hear the names Klebold and  
Harris in the same sentence as my kid,'' said Velasquez, whose son, 
Kyle, was killed in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrone, stepfather of slain student Daniel Rohrbough, said the  
church ``can honor murderers, but they're not going to honor Dan 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests were made. Jefferson County authorities declined  
comment. Church youth group members replanted the trees after the 
protest concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, church officials had sent a letter to the Rohrbough  
family justifying their decision and saying that ``hate is our true 
enemy,'' the Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the West Bowles congregation said the memorial was  
misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't for the two students that perpetrated this,'' said  
Mark Albers. ``This is for their families. I don't think people 
understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, members of the Rohrbough family destroyed two of 15  
crosses erected in tribute to all who died at Columbine.

<HEADLINE> Domingo Sings Met Opening Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tenor Placido Domingo sang his way into the  
record books Monday night at the Metropolitan Opera, opening the 
season for the 18th time -- with a stirring performance as the 
tragic clown Canio in Leoncavallo's ``Pagliacci.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo, 58, eclipsed the previous mark of 17 openings sung by  
the legendary tenor Enrico Caruso, ``a record many thought could 
never be broken,'' as Met General Manager Joseph Volpe said in 
congratulating his star after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish-born tenor was greeted with enthusiastic applause at  
his first appearance, prolonged cheers after his showpiece aria, 
``Vesti la giubba,'' and a standing ovation when he came out for 
his final bow, dressed in his clown costume and his face covered 
with greasepaint. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief speech, he paid tribute to everyone at the Met ``from  
the pit to the public,'' especially thanking the audience, saying, 
``If you come and fill the theater, they will let me open it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that as the big day approached he had become  
increasingly nervous. ``I think, am I going to do it or not, 
because you never know, you can catch a cold,'' Domingo said. 
</P>
<P>
	He needn't have worried. Domingo gave a riveting performance  
that grew in intensity as Canio, leader of a troupe of strolling 
players, became obsessed with jealousy at his wife's 
unfaithfulness, eventually murdering both her and her lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo appeared in the second half of a twin bill pairing  
``Pagliacci'' with another short opera, Mascagni's ``Cavalleria 
Rusticana,'' which served as the debut for the Argentinean tenor 
Jose Cura. 
</P>
<P>
	No tenor since Caruso in 1903 had had the honor of making his  
Met debut in a leading role on the first night of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Cura, 36, came to the Met on a wave of excitement over his  
recordings and live performances. But based on his initial 
appearance here, the jury is still out on whether he can become an 
heir to Domingo and the other leading tenor of the last 20 years, 
Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Cura's acting ability and charisma, there is no doubt. With  
his good looks and smoldering stage presence he brought the 
character of the reckless peasant Turiddu vividly to life. His 
voice is powerful and dark-hued, but the sound often seemed to be 
produced at some cost. His high notes were mostly on the mark, but 
noticeably pushed up from below. Even in the lower register he 
sounded constricted at times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met surrounded both tenors with outstanding casts. Domingo's  
faithless wife, Nedda, was sung beautifully by soprano Veronica 
Villarroel, and her lover, Silvio, was performed with distinction 
by baritone Dwayne Croft. Veteran baritone Juan Pons took the part 
of the villainous Tonio. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Cavalleria,'' mezzo Dolora Zajick lent her powerhouse voice  
to the role of Santuzza, the woman Turiddu has betrayed. Baritone 
Nikolai Putilin was unusually sonorous as Alfio, the jealous 
husband who eventually kills Turiddu in a duel. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Rizzi conducted both operas with fervor, although with  
occasional miscues between the orchestra and the singers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cav'' and ``Pag,'' as the two operas are popularly known,  
premiered two years apart, in 1900 and 1902, but are now almost 
always performed together. They are the chief survivors of the 
style known as ``verismo,'' or naturalism, that flourished early in 
the century. Both are set in southern Italy and deal with adultery, 
jealousy and murder among ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
	The role Domingo chose for Monday's opening is indelibly linked  
to Caruso, whose most famous photograph shows him dressed in a 
baggy clown costume, grinning pathetically and waving his right 
arm, invisible inside the sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo's Met opening nights have been spread over 29 years,  
starting with his first in 1971, when he sang the title role in 
Verdi's ``Don Carlo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso's career was far shorter. Between his Met debut in 1903  
as the Duke in Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' and 1920, when he appeared as 
Eleazar in Halevy's ``La Juive,'' Caruso missed only one opening 
night, in 1906. He died in 1921 of pleurisy at age 48.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Sign Pooh Richardson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons have signed free  
agent guard Pooh Richardson, who spent the past five seasons with 
the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers bought out the remainder of Richardson's contract  
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Pistons nor his agent, Arn Tellem, would release  
terms of the one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's excited about the opportunity,'' Tellem said. ``I think  
he'll fit in well there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson entered the NBA in 1989 as the first-round pick --  
10th overall -- of the Minnesota Timberwolves. After three years in 
Minnesota, Richardson played for the Indiana Pacers for two 
seasons. He was acquired by the Clippers in a 1994 trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson has career averages of 11.1 points and 6.5 assists.  
He was hampered by an ankle injury last season and expressed 
frustration playing for the losing Clippers.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleading Guilty in Vt. Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A man has agreed to plead guilty to  
sending a pipe bomb that killed a teen-ager last year after their 
Internet deal for CB radio equipment went sour. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plea agreement, federal prosecutors said Monday  
they will seek a life sentence and not the death penalty for Chris 
William Dean, 36. He was to enter the plea Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean also must apologize in person and in a letter to Sheila  
Rockwell, who was seriously injured in the explosion that killed 
her son, Christopher Marquis, after he opened a package from Dean 
in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rockwell did not want Dean to get the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Dean, a truck driver from Indiana, and Marquis,  
a 17-year-old high school dropout from Fair Haven, Vt., frequented 
Internet sites where radio equipment is bought and traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean allegedly believed the teen-ager had cheated him in some  
deals. Apparently he wasn't alone: United Parcel Service had 
investigated Marquis after receiving several similar complaints 
about him.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Flood Waters Finally Receding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- From a newspaper box coated with mud,  
the headline on the front page of the Sept. 15 edition of The Daily 
Southerner presaged what was to come: ``Edgecombe hunkers down for 
Floyd hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This town founded by ex-slaves prepared as best it could. But  
sandbags piled along an earthen dam did nothing to stop the swollen 
Tar River from spilling its banks, swallowing Princeville under 23 
feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 days, the water finally receded enough Sunday to allow  
a small group of reporters to tour part of the town that has come 
to epitomize the devastating flooding that Hurricane Floyd caused 
in eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Princeville's 1,800 residents, who have been homeless  
since Sept. 17, were anxious to survey the damage for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go back in,'' said 16-year-old Dazzala Knight,  
standing outside one of Edgecombe County's 10 shelters. ``My 
artwork is in there, and it's probably ruined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More showers and thunderstorms spread across the eastern half of  
the state today; up to an inch fell in some areas but less fell on 
areas where rivers remain above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's tobacco market in Wilson, about 50 miles east  
of Raleigh, reopened for farmers and buyers today for the first 
time since Hurricane Floyd struck. Doug Lewis of Edgecombe County 
said he lost everything to Floyd except his tobacco and peanuts. 
``If I don't salvage my peanuts, I'm looking at a $200,000 to 
$250,000 loss,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates show Hurricane Floyd caused $70.2 million  
in housing damage in eastern North Carolina, with more than 3,000 
homes destroyed or seriously damaged. The storm is being blamed for 
47 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 35,000 state residents have registered for state and  
federal assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it 
has approved more than $2 million to aid hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the region, about 2,100 people remain in 21 shelters,  
their homes either inundated with water or simply unsafe. While 
some have been allowed to move into camping trailers, those in 
shelters for well over a week are getting edgy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say they wish they were dead,'' said Robert  
Moody, among the shelter residents. Musicians and other 
entertainers planned performances today to cheer up shelter 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Princeville, authorities searched for more victims as some  
neighborhoods remained under at least 4 feet of water, which had 
moved some houses and mobile homes to the middle of the street. 
Residents won't be allowed back until the town is deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the Civil War in 1865, newly freed slaves created  
the community then called Freedom Hill or Liberty Hill on the south 
side of the Tar River. By the time it was chartered in 1885, the 
town was known as Princeville, after Turner Prince, a carpenter who 
was one of its early leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane LeFiles, a spokeswoman for the Edgecombe sheriff's office  
and county school system, walked through the streets Sunday for the 
first time since the flood. She paused on the sidewalk of 
Princeville Montessori School, which was being renovated, and 
pointed to what appeared to be a pond. 
</P>
<P>
	``There used to be a ball field right there,'' she said, tears  
rolling down her cheeks. ``That's where the kids played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Pitt County, some people were allowed to return to  
their homes to inspect them and collect belongings for the first 
time since flooding forced them out more than a week ago. 
Elsewhere, inspection teams were going door-to-door to make sure 
homes were safe. Some carried body bags as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one person has been accused of trying to take advantage  
of the misery left by Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Scott L'Hommedieu, 33, was arrested Friday after he  
allegedly tried to charge $2,980 to clean flood-damaged carpets. 
The work should have cost about $650, said Ted Carlton of the state 
Alcohol Law Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The carpets belong to the Topsail Beach Police Department.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan chipmakers Nosedive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Makers of computer chips and other  
semiconductors took a beating on Taiwan's stock market Monday, as 
trading resumed for the first time since the killer earthquake shut 
their factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductors stocks fell 3.5 percent -- the maximum allowed  
under emergency curbs imposed by regulators -- and analysts 
predicted they will keep falling, even though the companies say 
they are getting closer to restarting production. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan produces 10 percent of the world's chips and about 80  
percent of the ``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. The 
quake on Sept. 21 brought Taiwan's chipmaking to a standstill, and 
experts fear supply shortages could spread throughout the global 
high-tech industry, driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor  
Manufacturing Co., said Monday that half of its production 
equipment was in operating order, adding it has sold some chips 
that were in the pipeline before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it takes time to recover to normal output,'' said  
TSMC spokesman Y.C. Huang. ``We will try our best to achieve this 
goal as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 Taiwanese chipmaker, United Microelectronics Corp.,  
said it has repaired most of its damage and hopes to be back at 
full production capacity within days. It didn't specify how many 
days, though. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown will cost United Microelectronics about $430  
million in operating revenues this month, about 25 percent of what 
it would normally have brought in, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Taipei Stock Exchange reopened, all eyes were on the  
chipmakers. Taiwanese officials, fearing panic-selling throughout 
the market, introduced emergency measures to stop any stock from 
falling by more than 3.5 percent per day, half the usual limit, for 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	While big chipmakers went limit down Monday, shares in cement,  
glass and steel manufacturers rallied on hopes that they can cash 
in as Taiwan rebuilds many shattered towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the rise by construction material stocks, there was  
``virtually no buying interest,'' said Margaret Pan, a vice 
president at Capital Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Charts of the main stock index looked like the heart monitor on  
a hospital patient who died -- a line that dropped sharply then 
moved straight across the computer screen with no up or down 
fluctuations. The index finished 2.7 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor companies did not suffer much physical damage  
at their plants, located mostly in northern Taiwan far away from 
the quake's epicenter in the center of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	But power cuts kept them out of business last week and it  
remains unclear how soon they can be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,  
Taiwan's version of Silicon Valley, has returned to normal and the 
companies are scrambling to get their equipment fine-tuned and back 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake killed almost 2,100 people and left analysts wondering  
how bad the island's export-based economy will be hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The government slashed its 1999 economic growth forecast to  
around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent. Interest rates and unemployment could rise, too.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Hits Trucks Along Taxiway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jumbo jet with 321 people aboard smashed  
into three trucks on a taxiway shut down for construction work, 
forcing the trucks' drivers to dive for safety before their 
vehicles were struck Monday. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 4 engine of the Tahiti-bound Corsair Boeing 747 slammed  
into two big-rig dirt haulers and a pickup at Los Angeles 
International Airport early in the morning, said airport 
spokeswoman Nancy Castles. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision cut a huge gash in the outboard engine on the  
jet's right wing as it sliced through the big trucks and flattened 
the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment from the French airline. Numerous calls to  
Corsair in Los Angeles rang busy. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no fire and no fuel leak. It was not known why the  
aircraft was on a closed taxiway. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers were taken to a hotel to wait for later flights.  
</P>
<P>
	Danny and Jamie Hambarian, married on Saturday, were looking  
forward to their honeymoon when the trip ended before the plane 
ever got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane skidded sideways,'' said Mrs. Hambarian. ``We just  
felt it. We didn't know what it hit. It was scary.''

<HEADLINE> Man Says He OK'd Bush for Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The former speaker of the Texas House of  
Representatives acknowledged Monday that he called the head of the 
Texas Air National Guard in 1968 to recommend George W. Bush for a 
pilot slot during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ben Barnes, who later was lieutenant governor, said the  
request for his help came from a Bush family friend -- not Bush or 
his father, who then was a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner,  
meanwhile, insisted again that neither he nor his father sought 
such assistance when he joined the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you what happened. Nothing happened. My Guard unit  
was looking for pilots and I flew for the Guard,'' Bush said at a 
campaign appearance south of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my service and any allegation that my dad asked  
for special favors is simply not true. ... I didn't ask anybody to 
help get me to the Guard either,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, a Democrat, has been at the center of questions about  
Bush's Vietnam-era service for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His name surfaced in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas  
by the former executive director of the Texas Lottery. Lawrence 
Littwin has sued GTECH Corp., the lottery operator, alleging that 
the company is to blame for his firing in 1997, after four months 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Littwin's lawyers wanted to question  
Barnes, who used to lobby for GTECH, about whether GTECH was 
allowed to keep its lucrative state contract in exchange for 
Barnes' silence about the Guard matter. 
</P>
<P>
	That theory has been dismissed as unfounded by GTECH, Barnes and  
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes testified for several hours Monday in a deposition in the  
case. Afterwards, his lawyer issued a written statement saying 
Barnes had been contacted by the now-deceased Sidney Adger, a 
Houston oilman and friend of the elder Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barnes was contacted by Sid Adger and asked to recommend  
George W. Bush for a pilot position with the Air National Guard. 
Barnes called Gen. (James) Rose (Texas Air Guard commander) and did 
so,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush  
family asked Barnes' help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor 
Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes' recommendation,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also said he met in September 1998 with Donald L. Evans,  
a longtime friend and chief fund-raiser for Governor Bush. Barnes 
told Evans about Adger's request, and ``Governor Bush wrote Barnes 
a note thanking him for his candor in acknowledging that Barnes 
received no call from any member of the Bush family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Evans said he met  
with Barnes on his own initiative, without informing the governor 
in advance. At the time, he was Bush's gubernatorial campaign 
chairman and was concerned only about that contest, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joined the National Guard in 1968, at the height of the  
Vietnam War, serving until late 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor has said for several years that he  
received no special treatment. Both he and his father, the former 
president, have said they didn't ask for help in finding the Guard 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if Ben Barnes did or not -- but he was not asked  
by me or my dad,'' Bush said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are relying on whether a man who is deceased (Adger)  
tried to help. I can just tell you, from my perspective, I never 
asked for, I don't believe I received any special treatment,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush indicated that he wasn't concerned about Barnes'  
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody ought to tell the truth when they're being  
deposed. I'm confident he will,'' Bush said. ``I'm not sure what 
Ben Barnes is going to say. But I know what the facts are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he considered questions about his National Guard  
service a personal attack, Bush replied, ``I think it's just 
politics.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Up on Rainy Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices opened higher  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, as rainy weather appeared 
likely to slow down the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain is expected in the Midwest into Wednesday and temperatures  
are forecast to be lower than normal through the week, hampering 
the soybean and corn harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains for both soybeans and corn were expected to be limited  
following a big harvest weekend for both crops across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced slightly, extending a rally from Friday  
and also supported by strong prospects for U.S. exports. Taiwan and 
Algeria are both in the market for U.S. wheat, which has become 
more attractive with both the dollar and wheat futures prices 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1/4 cent to $2.78 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.09 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 
cent to $1.13 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 cents to $4.82 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures were sharply higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while beef futures also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .65 cent to 67.62 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .35 cent to 80.37 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose 2 cents to 48.50 cents a pound; February frozen pork 
bellies rose 2.68 cents to 65.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> States Probe Improper Bank Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Authorities from a group of states are  
investigating whether it is legal for banks that issue credit cards 
to sell data on customers' spending habits and creditworthiness to 
marketing firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this stage we're in the process of gathering information,''  
Julie Brill, an assistant attorney general in Vermont and a leader 
of a national task force on the issue, said Monday. ``We're going 
to assess what the banks are doing. We'll be making decisions on it 
later down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brill would not name the other states involved or the banks  
targeted. But Marc Violette, spokesman for New York Attorney 
General Eliot Spitzer, said dozens of states have joined the probe. 
Aside from Vermont, New York, Illinois and California are said to 
be taking lead roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating,'' said California Attorney General Bill  
Lockyer. ``It's not clear yet whether there is adequate law to 
prosecute criminally or civilly for the sale of private financial 
information from customers. If the law is inadequate, it ought to 
be strengthened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violette said banks ``may be breaching the trust of their  
customers by selling information about their customers' buying 
patterns, their credit limits and other personal data.'' The 
information is sold to marketing companies that use it ``in an 
effort to generate sales and then pay the banks a percentage from 
any new sales they make based on the information the banks provided 
them,'' Violette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kelly, vice president at Bank One Corp. of Chicago, said  
that company's First USA credit card division sometimes uses a wide 
range of data to generate lists of customers who might be 
interested in a specific product or service. It then hires a 
direct-marketing firm to make calls to a list prepared by the 
banking company. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are talking about us sharing confidential  
information,'' Kelly said. ``Here's what we share: name, address 
and telephone number.'' He said customers have a chance to ``opt 
out'' of receiving phone calls, mailings or e-mails containing the 
sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the  
Consumer Federation of America, said even in the scenario described 
by Kelly, ``they used information you gave the bank for a purpose 
other than the one for which you gave it, without your 
permission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the ``opt out'' provision should be an ``opt in,''  
in which consumers make the affirmative choice to have information 
used about them for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill now before a conference committee on Capitol Hill would  
bring extensive deregulation to the financial services industry, 
allowing banks, insurance companies and securities firms to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said this raised the possibility of a customer's bank  
turning down a mortgage request because of something the bank's 
insurance division saw in the customer's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	She said people should demand that their congressional  
representatives ``stop this wholesale trafficking in consumers' 
private information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brill said the task force grew out of an investigation by the  
Minnesota attorney general's office into direct marketing practices 
of U.S. Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Donn Wagge, senior vice president with that company, said Monday  
that his bank agreed to pay $500,000 to the state of Minnesota and 
$2.5 million to charities to settle that case.

<HEADLINE> Fans Overdose at Bucs-Broncos Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Four men overdosed on drugs during Sunday's  
game between the Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers game but 
were expected to survive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, who were attending the Buccaneers' 13-10 victory at  
Raymond James Stadium, were believed to have overdosed on gamma 
hydroxy butyrate, or GHB. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug can be taken in liquid or powder form and often is used  
with alcohol or other drugs. It has a serious depressive effect on 
the central nervous system and can cause loss of consciousness and 
interfere with breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	The identities of the men, ranging from 22 to 32 years old, were  
not being released.

<HEADLINE> Statements on System Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Personal computer software developers seem to have one  
overriding mantra: ``More! We need more!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As in more system memory, more video memory, more hard disk  
space -- which is fine, up to a point, but it's starting to get out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	A good example is Mob Rule, a fine simulation from Simon &AMP;  
Schuster Interactive. A ``medium'' installation asks for 120 
megabytes of hard disk space and a ``full'' installation gulps a 
walloping 480 megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
	On a lot of systems that otherwise meet the system requirements  
-- Pentium 166, 16 megabytes of ram, Windows 95 two megabyte PCI 
graphics card with Direct X support, and quad speed CD-ROM drive -- 
the ``full'' installation would gobble anywhere from a quarter to a 
half of the hard drive, which, with other applications, might not 
have that much available space in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	True, you can do a minimum installation which requires ``only''  
50 megabytes. But even that's a lot for some systems, which will 
inevitably miss out on a fine simulation of entrepreneurial 
organized crime in the 1930s, designed for teens or older, very 
fairly priced at around $40. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not alone. A puzzle-and-maze affair from Lucas Learning,  
Star Wars Pit Droid, requires at least 200 megabytes of disk space 
on a PC or Mac, and 300 megabytes is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney Interactive's Magic Artist Studio chomps off 70 megabytes  
from either PC or Mac, and Microsoft's Pandora's Box puzzle 
collection snarfs up 120. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which may not seem like a big deal to a developer working  
on a new PC with a 20-gigabyte hard drive. But it becomes quite a 
big deal to those of us who have systems a couple of years old and 
wrestle with a measly two gigabytes of storage. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the obvious solution from the developers' standpoint  
would be to get a new PC, it's not so obvious to those of us whose 
budget and marriage might not be able to stand the strain of a new 
$1,500 toy every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another irritating software habit that seems to be getting worse  
is the minimum-recommended hustle, in which the product box says 
something under ``requirements'' like: ``120-megahertz Pentium 
required, 200 megahertz with MMX recommended, or 16 megabytes of 
RAM required, 32 recommended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running the software on a system with only the requirements  
almost always generates less-than-pleasing performance. Take the 
assumption that the consumer wants the software to work well, not 
just barely, and be upfront about flatly saying what that will 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, developers who ship software without its own  
uninstall module ought to be fined like pet owners who don't clean 
up after Rover. It's the same principle. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Quayle Decides To Quit GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle, the former vice president who  
hoped to overcome long odds and ridicule to step up to the 
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, is giving up his White 
House dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials said Sunday night that Quayle planned to drop  
out of the race today during a Phoenix, Ariz., news conference. 
They called Quayle the latest victim of George W. Bush's GOP 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure winnows the GOP field to eight major  
Republican candidates, and will increase speculation about the 
finance and political health of the remaining contenders. There is 
already turbulence within the nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has made inroads against Bush in  
New Hampshire, formally kicked off his campaign today. Conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting the GOP to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, who traveled the world when she headed the  
American Red Cross, was planning a speech today to outline her 
foreign policy views. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. They are most likely to pick up Quayle supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's advisers said the former vice president decided to quit  
this weekend after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and campaign 
manager Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The braintrust determined that Quayle could not raise enough  
money to compete deep into the primary season, even if he fared 
well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. Bush, 
a two-term Texas governor and GOP front-runner, has topped $50 
million -- five times that of his nearest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush said he wished Quayle well. ``I know it's a tough  
decision for him to make,'' he said. ``I think any time you have 
your heart set on a race and it doesn't go well, it's got to be a 
tough call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, has been running a debt since early in the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reality just hit home that this wasn't to be,''  
said former Sen. Dan Coats, a fellow Indiana Republican and Quayle 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he won in New Hampshire, where to you go from there?''  
asked Coats. ``You don't have the funds ... and you're up against a 
candidate who can outspend you 100-to-1 if he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reality was harsh for the resilient conservative.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 
1992, the former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of 
political gaffes and controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day 
the then-vice president misspelled the word in a classroom full of 
school children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch 
line for countless jokes, cementing for many American the 
perception that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said during his April announcement speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Already Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire have dropped out of 
the GOP primary contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president is not expected to endorse a candidacy  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their October finance statements, which will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time competing with 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is aggressively trying to raise money to compete against  
Bush. Her situation may be even more precarious, given the fact 
that she is courting the same moderate and establishment 
Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Quayle has no regrets about his campaign and leaves  
buoyed by a recent national poll that showed him with 9 percent of 
the vote -- a distant second to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been unable to break out of the second-tier of candidates  
in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, however. Also in 
those ranks are radio host Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
He is still convinced he could fare well -- even win -- the New 
Hampshire primary. Despite that, the concentrated primary calendar 
would give him little time to raise enough money to capitalize on a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income 
families. He also portrayed himself as the best qualified potential 
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils.

<HEADLINE> Man Says He OK'd Bush for Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The former speaker of the Texas House of  
Representatives acknowledged Monday that he called the head of the 
Texas Air National Guard in 1968 to recommend George W. Bush for a 
pilot slot during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ben Barnes, who later was lieutenant governor, said the  
request for his help came from a Bush family friend -- not Bush or 
his father, who then was a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner,  
meanwhile, insisted again that neither he nor his father sought 
such assistance when he joined the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you what happened. Nothing happened. My Guard unit  
was looking for pilots and I flew for the Guard,'' Bush said at a 
campaign appearance south of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my service and any allegation that my dad asked  
for special favors is simply not true. ... I didn't ask anybody to 
help get me to the Guard either,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes has been at the center of questions about Bush's  
Vietnam-era service for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His name surfaced in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas  
by the former executive director of the Texas Lottery. Lawrence 
Littwin has sued GTECH Corp., the lottery operator, alleging that 
the company is to blame for his firing in 1997, after four months 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Littwin's lawyers wanted to question  
Barnes, who used to lobby for GTECH, about whether GTECH was 
allowed to keep its lucrative state contract in exchange for 
Barnes' silence about the Guard matter. 
</P>
<P>
	That theory has been dismissed as unfounded by GTECH, Barnes and  
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes testified for several hours Monday in a deposition in the  
case. Afterwards, his lawyer issued a written statement saying 
Barnes had been contacted by the now-deceased Sidney Adger, a 
Houston oilman and friend of the elder Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barnes was contacted by Sid Adger and asked to recommend  
George W. Bush for a pilot position with the Air National Guard. 
Barnes called Gen. (James) Rose (Texas Air Guard commander) and did 
so,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush  
family asked Barnes' help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor 
Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes' recommendation,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also said he met in September 1998 with Donald L. Evans,  
a longtime friend and chief fund-raiser for Governor Bush. Barnes 
told Evans about Adger's request, and ``Governor Bush wrote Barnes 
a note thanking him for his candor in acknowledging that Barnes 
received no call from any member of the Bush family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Evans said he met  
with Barnes on his own initiative, without informing the governor 
in advance. At the time, he was Bush's gubernatorial campaign 
chairman and was concerned only about that contest, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joined the National Guard in 1968, at the height of the  
Vietnam War, serving until late 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor has said for several years that he  
received no special treatment. Both he and his father, the former 
president, have said they didn't ask for help in finding the Guard 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if Ben Barnes did or not -- but he was not asked  
by me or my dad,'' Bush said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are relying on whether a man who is deceased (Adger)  
tried to help. I can just tell you, from my perspective, I never 
asked for, I don't believe I received any special treatment,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush indicated that he wasn't concerned about Barnes'  
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody ought to tell the truth when they're being  
deposed. I'm confident he will,'' Bush said. ``I'm not sure what 
Ben Barnes is going to say. But I know what the facts are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he considered questions about his National Guard  
service a personal attack, Bush replied, ``I think it's just 
politics.'' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With his veto of the GOP tax cut behind him,  
President Clinton turned his attention Monday to a congressional 
spending bill that he said demonstrates Republicans' low regard for 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton chose a hard-luck brick middle school in downtown New  
Orleans for a renewed attack on GOP spending priorities. He said 
the education spending bill passed by a House subcommittee last 
week would gut school reform plans and halt desperately needed 
programs to repair or replace damaged and outdated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in the House favor ``an education budget that was $3  
billion below what I asked for,'' and ignores his plans to hire 
more teachers and modernize 6,000 schools, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to blame the kids and it's wrong not to give the  
schools a chance. And we know these schools can be turned around if 
they have the resources and a good plan and they work the plan,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations subcommittee bill was passed Thursday,  
the same day Clinton vetoed the GOP's $792 billion tax cut package, 
which he called bloated and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophie B. Wright Middle School, where Clinton spoke on a  
platform erected over a badly cracked, uneven asphalt basketball 
court, was built in 1912 and has not had a significant renovation 
since the 1950s, principal Charlotte Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school's 564 students are packed 32 or more to a classroom.  
Nearly all of them read far below grade level when they arrive, Ms. 
Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the school's students come from poor families, and  
nearly all of them are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted some of the school's academic and structural  
problems, but he also congratulated one child who performed among 
the best students in the country on a national standardized test. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never met a child that couldn't learn, or a school that  
couldn't do better or turn around,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a visit to Norfolk, Va., days before that veto, the president  
urged Congress to ``leave politics at the schoolhouse door'' and 
embrace his plan for tax breaks to help school districts repair, 
expand and upgrade schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, about 25,000 school buildings -- roughly a third of 
the nation's public schools -- need extensive repairs or must be 
replaced altogether. The GAO estimated that simply repairing 
existing schools would cost $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's one-day trip to New Orleans also included two  
fund-raising appearances for Rep. William Jefferson, a Louisiana 
Democrat running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you want in a governor is somebody who is smart,  
committed, with a good heart, who is passionate about what he or 
she believes, but is not particularly partisan,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three speeches in one day, plus rounds of handshaking and small  
talk with Jefferson supporters did not further the White House goal 
of rehabilitating Clinton's badly strained voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The President has been hoarse, sometimes painfully so, since a  
trip to New Zealand earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's regular physical exam Saturday, doctors  
diagnosed swollen vocal cords and recommended 10 days of voice 
rest.

<HEADLINE>  Bengals' Carter May Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- For the third time in his five pro seasons,  
Ki-Jana Carter may have suffered a season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the Cincinnati Bengals' No. 1 draft choice in 1995,  
dislocated his right kneecap Sunday at Carolina. He was injured 
with 7:27 left in the first quarter of the Bengals' 27-3 loss and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals trainer Paul Sparling said it appears Carter will need  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was injured as he planted his feet while trying to tackle  
Carolina's Damien Richardson, who had intercepted Jeff Blake's 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt a pop,'' Sparling said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter has had repeated injuries since the Bengals drafted him  
from Penn State. Three carries into his first exhibition game, he 
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and missed the 
rest of his rookie season in 1995. He shattered his left wrist in 
last year's season opener and was out for the rest of that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals running back Corey Dillon, Carter's roommate, said the  
latest injury came as a shock. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was in his position, I don't know what I'd do,'' Dillon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Carter is judged to be through for the season, the Bengals  
could promote rookie running back Michael Basnight from the 
practice squad.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Scrutinize Stewart's Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- They hired a new offensive coordinator,  
drafted a wide receiver and gave their quarterback a $27 million 
vote of confidence. Almost every off-season move by the Pittsburgh 
Steelers was geared toward restoring Kordell Stewart's confidence 
and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a disastrous 29-10 loss at home to Seattle, which  
brought back memories of last year's 7-9 record and season-ending 
five-game losing streak, the Steelers are wondering: Did they throw 
too much cash at Slash? 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since he became a starter in 1997, the  
Steelers are questioning whether Stewart can regain the playmaking 
skills and confidence he displayed in leading them to the AFC title 
game in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for the first time, they're doing it publicly.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher, who previously deflected all criticism at  
Stewart, was unusually critical of him Sunday. Stewart was 7-of-14 
for 61 yards and three interceptions before being yanked at 
halftime, the third time in six starts he has been pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	The first interception, a badly underthrown ball to Will  
Blackwell, resulted in Merton Hanks' 23-yard interception return 
touchdown. On the last interception, by Jay Bellamy, there wasn't a 
Steelers receiver within 10 yards of the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our quarterback's performance was very poor,'' said  
Cowher, usually very protective of Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher, who brought in coordinator Kevin Gilbride especially to  
reshape Stewart's game, also said Stewart should have scrambled 
more to duck the Seahawks' blitz. Stewart was critical last season 
of former coordinator Ray Sherman's reluctance to let him take off 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to move around a little,'' Cowher said. ``He  
doesn't have to be planted in the pocket. He's got to be able to 
improvise. I was disappointed he didn't respond that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bad game seemingly wouldn't be enough reason for the  
Steelers to question if they erred by giving him a $8.1 million 
signing bonus in May -- part of $27 million contract extension that 
was pushed by Cowher. 
</P>
<P>
	But a pattern of inconsistency, interceptions, poor reads and  
poor decision-making set in last season, and it wasn't corrected 
even in the season-opening 43-0 victory at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Stewart threw three interceptions in the AFC championship  
game against Denver in January 1998, he has 13 touchdown passes and 
24 interceptions. The numbers are worse over a stretch of six 
losses in the past eight games: 147-of-290 for 1,467 yards, five 
touchdowns and 12 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse still are his last five games: one touchdown pass and  
eight interceptions. The Steelers haven't seen such woeful 
statistics since Terry Bradshaw threw six touchdown passes and 24 
interceptions as a rookie in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	All the more puzzling, Stewart had 21 touchdown passes and 11  
scoring runs only two years ago. So where is the quarterback who, 
before Sunday's game, said he was much more comfortable in 
Gilbride's system than Sherman's offense? 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me a chance to do what I need to do,'' he said. ``And  
it makes me feel relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This won't: the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1), the defending AFC  
Central champions, come to town Sunday off a home-field loss to 
Tennessee.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Defeat Cardinals 24-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Monday night usually belongs to the San  
Francisco 49ers, even these not-so-awesome 49ers, even with Steve 
Young knocked woozy just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco shined in prime time again.  
</P>
<P>
	These might not be the 49ers of old, but they were good enough  
for a 24-10 victory over the young Arizona Cardinals on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a step forward,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``We beat  
a playoff team on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Phillips' 68-yard touchdown run with 1:42 left in the  
fourth quarter added the exclamation point to Mariucci's seventh 
victory in as many tries on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get touched,'' Phillips said. ``Anybody could have  
scored that ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young staked San Francisco (2-1) to a 17-0 lead before being  
knocked out of the game with a mild concussion with 28 seconds left 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Plummer, the quarterback San Francisco passed up in the  
1997 draft, has rallied Arizona to victory 10 times in his 29 games 
with the Cardinals. But this one fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Young threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice before he was  
knocked out of the game by the blitzing Cardinals, the 85th time 
the two combined on a scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Young thought he could have gone back in the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Young said of the hit he took. ``At first, I  
didn't know what happened. I hear boxers talk about `the flash.' I 
sat for a second, got my wits, and actually felt pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after talking to team doctors, Mariucci decided not to play  
Young in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (1-2) rallied with 10 points in the fourth quarter, but  
Chad Stanley's 49-yard punt pinned the Cardinals on their own 
3-yard line with 9:17 to play. Arizona moved the ball down the 
field, but Adrian Murrell lost 6 yards, then Plummer was sacked for 
the fifth time and the Cardinals chose to punt on fourth-and-11 at 
the San Francisco 40 with just over 2 1/2 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fourth-and-11 and we'd been playing very well  
defensively,'' Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. ``They had their 
quarterback in there. We felt if we pinned them back, we'd get the 
ball back with two minutes or so to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But instead, the 49ers got a first down, then Phillips broke  
three for the biggest play of his troubled brief NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, given a chance by the 49ers after a big season in NFL  
Europe, burst through the line and raced to the end zone for the 
game-clincher with 1:42 to play to make Mariucci 7-0 on Monday 
nights. Phillips finished with 102 yards on nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, sacked five times and knocked down 16 more in last week's  
28-21 victory over New Orleans, was hit by Aeneas Williams and J.J. 
McCleskey as he let go of a pass. His head hit the knee of an 
offensive lineman as he fell to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless for a moment before he slowly got to his  
feet and walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to come back,'' Rice said of Young, 13-of-23 for 92  
yards. ``He's a warrior. He'll be there next Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Garcia, who led Calgary to the Grey Cup in the Canadian  
Football League last season, replaced Young, and though he wasn't 
spectacular, he was good enough until Phillips finished things off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff did a good job and our defense did their job of giving us  
a chance to run time off the clock,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was 5-of-6 for 30 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals took the second-half kickoff and went 80 yards in  
11 plays in a 5-minute, 15-second drive that ended with Mario Bates 
leaping over from the 1 to make it 17-7 with 9:45 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Murrell gained 50 yards in six carries on the drive. Chris  
Jacke's 43-yard field goal made it 17-10 with 1:09 left in the 
third quarter, and the packed house at Sun Devils Stadium went 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was 16-of-31 for 176 yards and two interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
	Turnovers ruined what was only the third Monday night game for  
Arizona since the Cardinals moved from St. Louis in 1988 as the 
49ers scored twice in 54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it kind of overwhelmed us,'' said Cardinals' defensive  
end Simeon Rice, one of many Arizona players appearing in his first 
Monday night game. ``These are virgin grounds for us. We just 
didn't do what we needed to do in this spectacle of an event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie David Boston muffed Stanley's punt and Joe Zelenka of the  
49ers recovered at the Cardinals' 37 to set up Rice's first 
touchdown catch of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays later, Plummer threw his eighth interception of the  
season. The pass, intended for Rob Moore, was knocked away by 
Darnell Walker into the hands of Lance Schulters, who returned it 
18 yards to Arizona's 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Garner, carrying a couple of would-be tacklers with him,  
scored on the next play to make it 14-0 with 5:41 left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore aggravated a sore hamstring in the first quarter and did  
not play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Richey's 33-yard field goal made it 17-0 with 9:01 left in  
the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona threatened late in the second quarter, but with  
first-and-goal at the 6, Plummer completed a short pass to Frank 
Sanders, who fumbled at the goal line. Mark McDonald of the 49ers 
recovered just inside the end zone for a touchback.

<HEADLINE>  49ers Defeat Cardinals 24-10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Monday night usually belongs to the San  
Francisco 49ers, even these not-so-awesome 49ers, even with Steve 
Young knocked woozy just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco shined in prime time again.  
</P>
<P>
	These might not be the 49ers of old, but they were good enough  
for a 24-10 victory over the young Arizona Cardinals on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a step forward,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``We beat  
a playoff team on the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Phillips' 68-yard touchdown run with 1:42 left in the  
fourth quarter added the exclamation point to Mariucci's seventh 
victory in as many tries on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get touched,'' Phillips said. ``Anybody could have  
scored that ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young staked San Francisco (2-1) to a 17-0 lead before being  
knocked out of the game with a mild concussion with 28 seconds left 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Jake Plummer, the quarterback San Francisco passed up in the  
1997 draft, has rallied Arizona to victory 10 times in his 29 games 
with the Cardinals. But this one fell short. 
</P>
<P>
	Young threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice before he was  
knocked out of the game by the blitzing Cardinals, the 85th time 
the two combined on a scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Young thought he could have gone back in the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Young said of the hit he took. ``At first, I  
didn't know what happened. I hear boxers talk about `the flash.' I 
sat for a second, got my wits, and actually felt pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after talking to team doctors, Mariucci decided not to play  
Young in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona (1-2) rallied with 10 points in the fourth quarter, but  
Chad Stanley's 49-yard punt pinned the Cardinals on their own 
3-yard line with 9:17 to play. Arizona moved the ball down the 
field, but Adrian Murrell lost 6 yards, then Plummer was sacked for 
the fifth time and the Cardinals chose to punt on fourth-and-11 at 
the San Francisco 40 with just over 2 1/2 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fourth-and-11 and we'd been playing very well  
defensively,'' Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. ``They had their 
quarterback in there. We felt if we pinned them back, we'd get the 
ball back with two minutes or so to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But instead, the 49ers got a first down, then Phillips broke  
three for the biggest play of his troubled brief NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, given a chance by the 49ers after a big season in NFL  
Europe, burst through the line and raced to the end zone for the 
game-clincher with 1:42 to play to make Mariucci 7-0 on Monday 
nights. Phillips finished with 102 yards on nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, sacked five times and knocked down 16 more in last week's  
28-21 victory over New Orleans, was hit by Aeneas Williams and J.J. 
McCleskey as he let go of a pass. His head hit the knee of an 
offensive lineman as he fell to the turf.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 73 points  
in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
hold a 2-1 lead over decliners. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Up After Last Week's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose broadly today as traders returned to  
Wall Street looking for bargains following the Dow industrial's 
biggest weekly point loss ever. Technology shares led the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.06, or by 0.2 percent,  
to close at 10,303.39 after being up as much as 123 points this 
morning. Even with the selloff last week, the Dow is up more than 
12 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indicators also rose on volume that was below Friday's  
heavy pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing an oversold market, and bargain-hunting taking  
over,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason 
of Baltimore. He said investors seem to be going back to technology 
stocks, which were big catalyst for the market before the past 
week's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in the dollar also helped support stocks. World finance  
ministers this weekend expressed concern for the sharp rise in the 
Japanese yen against the dollar in recent months, raising 
expectations that the dollar would regain some of its lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York trading today, the dollar leaped to a late rate of  
106.00 yen from 104.17 yen late Friday and a 3 1/2-year low of 103.20 
yen on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak dollar has hurt U.S. stocks on several fronts. When the  
dollar falls, imports are more expensive, adding to inflation. In 
addition, when other currencies are more attractive, international 
traders may pull money out of dollar-denominated assets, such as 
stocks, to invest elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, markets were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's key stock indicator dipped 0.3 percent, and in Hong  
Kong, stocks fell 2.1 percent, as the dollar continued to struggle 
against the yen in Asian trading. There is concern that if the yen 
gets too strong, it will derail Japan's recovery from a deep 
recession, slowing growth throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But stocks in Europe got a lift as the dollar gained ground  
later in the day and as Wall Street opened higher. Major stock 
indexes closed with a jump of 2.4 percent in London and were up 1.2 
percent in Paris and 1.0 percent in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell a total of  
524.30 points, tumbling more than 200 points in two separate 
sessions. The plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, or 9.2 percent, 
below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators also fared poorly. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which lists most of the world's leading technology 
companies, lost 129.21 points over the course of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The tumble surprised few Wall Street analysts. In recent weeks,  
even as the Dow and the Nasdaq hit new records, many market 
watchers remained troubled about signs of ill health in the market. 
Above all, analysts worried that the strong performance of the 
Dow's blue-chip stocks and technology leaders like Intel and 
Microsoft wasn't shared by the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the market lost its last bastion of strength.  
Semiconductor stocks tumbled Wednesday, a day after an earthquake 
hit Taiwan, a major production center for the chips and components 
used in computers. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Thursday, Microsoft president Steve Ballmer sent the  
market spinning by telling reporters he believes technology stocks 
are too pricey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is such an overvaluation of tech stocks that it's  
absurd,'' he said at a conference of the Society of American 
Business Editors and Writers. ``I would put our company and I would 
put most companies in that category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economic factors that drove stocks lower last week haven't  
disappeared. The dollar lingers near its lowest levels against 
Japan's yen since 1996. Investors also remain worried that the 
Federal Reserve at its Oct. 5 meeting will raise interest rates for 
the third time this year to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate  
profits as borrowing costs escalate. That can make bonds, with 
their guaranteed rate of return, more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	The calendar could be another menace. Some of the worst market  
declines in history have come in October, from the 1929 crash that 
launched the Great Depression to the 554.26-point drop on Oct. 27, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary time of year,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief  
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co in Kansas City. ``By 
September or October, you know where a company's fundamentals are 
for the year, and a lot of investment managers make their buy and 
sell decisions based on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts see at least two potential benefits from last  
week's sharp selloff. Some economists feel the market's decline 
could convince the Fed that an interest rate increase isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This past week's stock market slide has virtually ensured the  
Fed will not move in the direction of another rate hike,'' said 
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has voiced concern over the lofty  
levels of the stock market, and said last month that the Fed would 
keep an eye on the market. Last week's selloff, some analysts 
reason, could convince the Fed that the stock market, at least, has 
not reached inflationary levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors could seize the chance to buy stocks at their  
new, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an overdue opportunity to shake out some of the  
market's excesses,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist 
at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York.

<HEADLINE> Cablevision Focusing on New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cablevision said Monday it is putting its cable  
systems in Boston, Cleveland and Kalamazoo, Mich., on the market to 
focus on New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision Systems Corp. hopes to sell the systems, which serve  
a total of 714,000 customers in the three states, by mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Concentrating on one market -- New York -- where Cablevision has  
live and televised sports and entertainment offerings backed by a 
state-of-the-art broadband network will allow the company to 
execute an aggressive, competitive strategy,'' said Cablevision 
President and CEO James L. Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
	Cablevision hopes the sale will improve its balance sheet by  
reducing the level of debt, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cablevision's key objectives in the New York region include  
the aggressive deployment of new digital, Internet, telephone and 
video services, and the creation and expansion of live and 
televised local content,'' which it said would help it compete 
against existing local telephone providers in the nation's largest 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its telephone and Internet services, the company  
serves 2.8 million cable customers throughout New York, New Jersey 
and Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Despite Injuries, Title for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- For the Atlanta Braves, this might have been  
their most surprising season since the one that began their decade 
of division dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Braves made a worst-to-first run to the seventh  
game of the World Series. On Sunday, they clinched their eighth 
straight NL East Division title even though cancer took away their 
top hitter and injuries sidelined their All-Star catcher and best 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Few teams could have withstood the loss of Andres Galarraga,  
Javy Lopez and Kerry Ligtenberg -- plus pitchers Rudy Seanez and 
Odalis Perez, also out for the season -- but the Braves thrived 
under adverse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, with the best record in the majors, is one victory away  
from its third straight 100-win season. The New York Mets spent 
nearly $164 million on contracts to close the gap in the division, 
only to get swept by the Braves in a critical three-game series 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	New York lost three more games at Philadelphia while the Braves  
were clinching the East with a sweep of Montreal, including a 10-0 
victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played well against the Mets at our place and came out of  
it with a sweep and gave ourselves some breathing room,'' said 
Chipper Jones, a leading candidate for MVP with a .319 average, 45 
homers, 107 RBIs and 24 stolen bases. ``A one-game lead with 12 
games left, you certainly don't expect to clinch with six games 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final week of the regular season will be spent trying to  
secure home-field advantage throughout the league playoffs. Atlanta 
held a 3 1/2-game lead over the West champion Arizona Diamondbacks, 
who played Monday night against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, anything less than a World Series ring would leave the  
season lacking. The Braves have captured only one World 
Championship during the 1990s, falling short the past two years in 
the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a ring,'' pitcher Greg Maddux said. ``I've got plenty  
of division titles. I don't have enough rings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what happens during the playoffs, though, this has  
been a remarkable season for the Braves, who got an indication of 
things to come when Galarraga was diagnosed with cancer in his back 
shortly before spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is worth celebrating because of all the obstacles and  
adversity we've had to overcome all year,'' said Brian Jordan, 
soaked with champagne after Sunday's victory. ``I don't believe 
anybody, once Javy Lopez got hurt, believed that we could do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121 RBIs last season,  
missed the entire season, as did Ligtenberg (30 saves in 1998) 
after sustaining a partially torn ligament in an elbow during 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan took over the cleanup role and had a career-high 110  
RBIs, even with a sore right hand that has taken away his home run 
power. John Rocker moved into Ligtenberg's spot and did even 
better, with 37 saves in 44 chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, a two-time All-Star catcher who had 34 homers and 106  
RBIs in 1998, hobbled for a couple of weeks on a sore right knee 
before succumbing to season-ending surgery in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	At the July 31 trade deadline, Atlanta acquired shortstop Jose  
Hernandez and pitcher Terry Mulholland from the Chicago Cubs. 
Hernandez (19 homers, 61 RBIs) brought a strong bat to the lineup, 
while Mulholland has been a help both starting and relieving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' Big Three -- Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine --  
struggled through the first half of the season. Only Maddux (19-8) 
managed to put up his expected numbers in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Kevin Millwood (18-7, 2.69 ERA) became the  
team's most effective starter. 
</P>
<P>
	The nondescript bullpen also has been surprisingly effective,  
with Mike Remlinger (10-1, 2.23 ERA) setting up for Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing above everyone else has been Jones. He rebounded from  
personal turmoil -- he admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock 
and divorced his wife -- to have the best season of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones seems likely to become the first player in major-league  
history to hit at least .300 with 100 runs, 100 RBIs, 40 homers, 40 
doubles, 100 walks and 20 stolen bases. He also came through with 
Reggie Jackson-like fashion during the biggest series of the year, 
homering four times in three games against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP right now,'' Maddux said.

<P>
	HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- George Anstead gazed at the ruins of  
his uninsured home of 47 years Monday and wondered if he should 
have stayed behind and tried to save it from the grass fire that 
swept though the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Anstead and at least 36 other residents of the semirural Happy  
Valley area lost their homes to the blaze that pushed through a 
five-mile swath of modest houses, ranchettes and mobile homes 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here a long time and it just makes me sick to wonder  
if I did the right thing,'' said Anstead, 81, a retired Teamster 
who fled with only a few shirts and his travel trailer. 
</P>
<P>
		   The fire began Sunday morning when a pickup truck pulling a  
trailer with the loading ramp down was dragging on the road and 
shooting sparks, which started several fires that merged into one, 
said Kevin Colburn, a spokesman for the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Another motorist told the two men in the truck that the ramp was  
down but they did not fix it, Colburn said. Investigators believe 
the fires started accidentally but they are looking for the men and 
may seek reimbursement from them for firefighting costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire rushed over shallow canyons covered with oaks and  
brittle grass to scorch 2,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 500 to 700 people were ordered to leave their  
property Sunday. The fire was contained early Monday, and 
firefighters spent the day searching for hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters were injured, one with smoke inhalation and the  
other dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	Dazed residents returned to their homes Monday, marveling that  
some were hit while others were spared. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames destroyed David Redlich's mobile home, where he has  
lived with his family for eight years, and his mother's home of 20 
years behind it. But between the two, his children's pink bicycles 
and swing set sat on a patch of green grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Redlich, 32, was home with two of his three children Sunday when  
he saw the smoke. His wife and daughter were in Pennsylvania 
visiting relatives. He gathered the boys, two pet dogs and a pet 
rat and fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Their cat, Hope, is missing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the cat we're hoping is still alive. My wife's going to  
kill me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central California coast, two groups of fires had burned  
across 44,700 acres, and with temperatures rising to 94 degrees 
Monday on Big Sur's steep slopes, the firefighters were taking a 
beating, spokesman Mark Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Happy Valley, Anstead said he's not sure what he'll do  
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good question,'' Anstead said. ``Probably get a loan  
and put in a new house.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus Reaches $115 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal budget surplus is now expected to  
hit a record $115 billion for the fiscal year that ends this week, 
President Clinton said Monday. He called the estimate ``proof that 
we're on the right road to prosperity'' and urged Congress to work 
with him to shore up the retirement system and invest in education. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do all that and still have an affordable tax cut for  
the middle class and pay down our debt so that by 2015 we are 
debt-free for the first time since 1835, when Andrew Jackson was 
president,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration increased its estimate of the rapidly growing  
budget surplus, saying it should hit at least $115 billion in 
fiscal 1999, the largest in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a landmark achievement for our economy,'' Clinton said  
in a Rose Garden announcement, scribbling the new administration 
figure on a chart for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a $792 billion tax cut bill last week as ``too  
big, too bloated'' and urged passage of a cut in the range of $250 
billion to $300 billion -- so long as needed investments were made 
first in Medicare, Social Security, education and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are struggling to adjourn Congress by Oct.  
29. They suggested Clinton's veto had killed chances for sweeping 
tax reductions this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``More surplus money for Washington means less money for  
families and workers across our country,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Since President 
Clinton killed tax relief, Republicans will guard these funds to 
protect Social Security and Medicare and pay down the debt -- and 
stop Washington from spending them on a smorgasbord of government 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was not daunted by the prospect of political  
deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I think if the past is any measure, one way or the other,  
the taxpayers are going to be all right, because we can do pretty 
well by conflict, I suppose, and eventually drag this out to where 
we have at least got a decent education budget, we're still paying 
down the debt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus is consumed by payments on the federal debt, and the  
estimate has no direct bearing on the wrangling over the fiscal 
2000 budget. Still, Clinton used the good news to urge Congress to 
not ``throw in the towel'' and put budget matters aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pessimistic,'' the president said. ``We've still got  
plenty of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the budget deficit was $290 billion when he took  
office, Clinton argued that the rapidly growing budget surplus was 
evidence his economic vision was working. ``Our nation has come a 
long way in a short time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the administration had estimated the surplus  
for fiscal 1999 -- which ends Thursday -- at $99 billion, but the 
booming economy and larger-than-expected tax revenues pushed the 
figure higher. The $115 billion figure would far surpass the record 
$69 billion surplus last year. In July, the Congressional Budget 
Office predicted a $120 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after adjusting for inflation, the administration figure  
still represents the largest surplus in American history, the 
administration said. The 1999 surplus would be about 1.3 percent of 
the gross domestic product, the largest on this basis since 1951.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Mobley Set for Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos linebacker John Mobley was  
scheduled to have surgery Tuesday to repair a torn knee ligament 
that ended his season 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley, Denver's leading tackler the past two seasons, tore the  
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee when he fell awkwardly 
during the first quarter of the Broncos' 26-10 loss to Kansas City 
on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have had several significant injuries in the  
season's first three weeks. Wide receiver Rod Smith (groin strain) 
and defensive end Alfred Williams (back spasms) missed the Kansas 
City game because of injuries. Both returned Sunday against Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver will be without offensive lineman K.C. Jones this week  
against the New York Jets. Jones tore knee cartilage Sunday and was 
scheduled for surgery Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some good news Monday. A magnetic resonance imaging  
test on linebacker Glenn Cadrez's neck was negative. An MRI on 
offensive lineman Mark Schlereth's back also was negative.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Decides To Quit GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle, the former vice president who  
hoped to overcome long odds and ridicule to step up to the 
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, is giving up his White 
House dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials said Sunday night that Quayle planned to drop  
out of the race today during a Phoenix, Ariz., news conference. 
They called Quayle the latest victim of George W. Bush's GOP 
juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure winnows the GOP field to eight major  
Republican candidates, and will increase speculation about the 
finance and political health of the remaining contenders. There is 
already turbulence within the nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has made inroads against Bush in  
New Hampshire, formally kicked off his campaign today. Conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting the GOP to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, who traveled the world when she headed the  
American Red Cross, was planning a speech today to outline her 
foreign policy views. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. They are most likely to pick up Quayle supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's advisers said the former vice president decided to quit  
this weekend after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and campaign 
manager Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The braintrust determined that Quayle could not raise enough  
money to compete deep into the primary season, even if he fared 
well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. Bush, 
a two-term Texas governor and GOP front-runner, has topped $50 
million -- five times that of his nearest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush said he wished Quayle well. ``I know it's a tough  
decision for him to make,'' he said. ``I think any time you have 
your heart set on a race and it doesn't go well, it's got to be a 
tough call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, has been running a debt since early in the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reality just hit home that this wasn't to be,''  
said former Sen. Dan Coats, a fellow Indiana Republican and Quayle 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he won in New Hampshire, where to you go from there?''  
asked Coats. ``You don't have the funds ... and you're up against a 
candidate who can outspend you 100-to-1 if he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reality was harsh for the resilient conservative.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 
1992, the former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of 
political gaffes and controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day 
the then-vice president misspelled the word in a classroom full of 
school children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch 
line for countless jokes, cementing for many American the 
perception that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said during his April announcement speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Already Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire have dropped out of 
the GOP primary contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president is not expected to endorse a candidacy  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their October finance statements, which will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time competing with 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is aggressively trying to raise money to compete against  
Bush. Her situation may be even more precarious, given the fact 
that she is courting the same moderate and establishment 
Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Quayle has no regrets about his campaign and leaves  
buoyed by a recent national poll that showed him with 9 percent of 
the vote -- a distant second to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been unable to break out of the second-tier of candidates  
in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, however. Also in 
those ranks are radio host Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
He is still convinced he could fare well -- even win -- the New 
Hampshire primary. Despite that, the concentrated primary calendar 
would give him little time to raise enough money to capitalize on a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income 
families. He also portrayed himself as the best qualified potential 
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils.

<HEADLINE> Heat Hampers Firefighting in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters were hampered by heat and  
dry brush as they battled a string of fires still burning in the 
state, but the feared wind gusts that had been forecast Sunday 
never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning-sparked fires have burned more than 60,000 acres of  
northern California's Trinity Alps Wilderness in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had expected wind gusts of 30-40 mph Sunday to  
further fan the flames, but fire information officer Joe Mazzeo 
said Sunday afternoon that the wind hadn't become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of holding our breath up here waiting to see what  
will happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One firefighter suffered a concussion Saturday when he was  
struck by a branch that fell from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central coast, fires that have burned 42,454 acres of the  
Los Padres National Forest near Big Sur were about a quarter 
contained Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Sur-area fires alone have cost more than $27 million to  
fight since they were sparked by lightning strikes Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in Happy Valley destroyed at least 37 homes and forced  
more than 200 people to evacuate Sunday in rural Shasta County. By 
late evening, the fire had slowed, but dozens of evacuees from the 
rural community planned to spend the night in the cafeteria at 
nearby Anderson Union High School as firefighters continued 
battling the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began as three separate blazes around 11 a.m. Sunday  
and burned at least 2,000 acres about 150 miles north of Sacramento 
when it merged into one, said Kay McQuade of the California 
Department of Forestry.

<HEADLINE> Annual Flu Shots May Be Eliminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An experimental vaccine that might help  
eliminate the need for annual flu shots is showing early promise in 
mice, Belgian researchers report in the October issue of the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 million people a year get flu shots in the United  
States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the standard flu vaccine is altered every year to  
keep up with changing virus strains. The vaccine focuses on protein 
targets on flu viruses, and these targets vary a lot from one 
strain to the next. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental vaccine uses a different target, one that is  
virtually identical across strains. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is reported by Walter Fiers, a retired professor of  
molecular biology at the University of Ghent, with colleagues. In 
interviews, Fiers and American flu experts cautioned that the work 
is preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine focused on the so-called M2 protein of the virus.  
Researchers immunized the mice with three injections at three-week 
intervals, and exposed them three weeks later to a large, 
potentially lethal dose of flu virus. 
</P>
<P>
	In one round of the experiments, the vaccine saved eight of 12  
mice in one vaccinated group and all 12 in another, while only two 
of 11 unprotected mice survived. Researchers got about the same 
results when they squirted the vaccine into the nose rather than 
injecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiers said that with the far lower doses of virus that people  
normally encounter, he would expect the vaccine to protect people 
against flu infection, or at least from developing a full-blown 
case. But it will take studies in people to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	The standard vaccine is aimed at two categories of influenza  
virus, called A and B. The study focused on influenza A, which 
poses the biggest threat to people and forces scientists to change 
the standard vaccine every year. The influenza B portion of the 
standard vaccine doesn't have to be altered annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Edwin Kilbourne, a flu expert at the New York Medical  
College in Valhalla, called M2 vaccines promising but said much 
more research is needed. Scientists are pursuing other promising 
approaches for universal flu vaccines too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that protection from a flu shot lasts only a year  
or two.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Prevents Flu Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Junior got the flu? Bad enough for the kid,  
but parents also know they may inevitably be the next to contract 
the sneezes and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it appears there is something they can do about it.  
</P>
<P>
	A study released Sunday shows that a new variety of prescription  
flu drug is the first ever proven to keep family members from 
getting sick when someone brings home the bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, an inhaled powder called Relenza, is due on  
drugstore shelves on Friday. A similar competing medicine in pill 
form is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are a major step forward,'' said Dr. Frederick  
Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. ``The 
latest data show that they clearly work for prevention, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His study, conducted during last winter's flu season, showed  
that taking Relenza cuts the chances of catching the flu from an 
ill relative by up to 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not all the good sniffles news. Hayden released  
details of a second study Sunday of the first anti-viral medicine 
that appears to reduce the duration of the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden described the results at the annual scientific meeting of  
the American Society of Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza reduces the duration of a bout of flu by a day or two.  
Unlike the earlier generation of flu drugs, which are powerless to 
prevent the disease, it works against both major strains of the 
disease, known as influenza A and B. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
last summer and is made by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. The company says 
the wholesale cost for a dose to treat one bout of flu will be $37. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the  
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is still 
the best way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help 
when people fail to get shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, youngsters bring home the flu to their parents and  
siblings from school and day care. The latest experiment was 
intended to see if family members could be protected by taking 
Relenza at the first sign of flu in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 975 families with school-age children volunteered to  
participate in the study. Between December and March, 337 of these 
families actually had a case of flu. The sick person and the rest 
of the family were randomly assigned to get either the drug or a 
look-alike dummy spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 4 percent of the folks in getting Relenza came down  
with the flu, compared with 19 percent in the untreated comparison 
families. Even when they did get sick, their disease appeared to be 
far milder. Flu in the Relenza-treated family members typically 
lasted three days, compared with about six days in the comparison 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important aspect of the drug that could reduce the  
burden of influenza,'' said Dr. William Craig of the University of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza will be the first of a new class of flu medicines known  
as neuraminidase inhibitors to reach the market. However, 
Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, a similar medicine in pill form, is 
expected to be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to these medicines is that they must be started  
within the first day or two of symptoms to have any effect on the 
disease. Most people don't call their doctor at the first twinge of 
flu's body ache, and they probably could not get an instant 
appointment, even if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said drug companies will have to convince both physicians  
and patients to look at flu differently, now that medicines are 
available to both treat the disease and prevent it. For instance, 
he said doctors may eventually become willing to prescribe the 
drugs over the phone without seeing patients if they report typical 
flu miseries during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report to the conference, Hayden described the  
results of a study of pleconaril, an experimental medicine for the 
common cold. The medicine was developed by Viropharma Inc. of 
Exton, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested it on 1,024 people and found that it shortened  
the length of a typical moderate-to-severe cold from 14 days to 
10 1/2. They looked at various measures of a cold's severity, 
including the number of tissues used. Their count: Pleconaril 
reduced the number of tissues needed by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCain Launches Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
is issuing a ``new patriotic challenge'' for America, promising to 
return dignity to the White House, strength to the U.S. military 
and honesty to a government that is now ``a spectacle of selfish 
ambition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formally opening the campaign he began nearly 10 months ago, the  
war hero and Senate maverick also pledged today to protect Social 
Security, cut taxes, veto pork-barrel spending, improve access to 
the Internet and test the merits of spending government money in 
private schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	His top issues: reform political campaign laws and improve  
America's national security. McCain said both issues are examples 
of how he wants to challenge Americans to champion a ``cause 
greater than self-interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a draft of his announcement provided by campaign officials,  
McCain said, ``It is because I owe America more than she has ever 
owed me that I am a candidate for president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son and grandson of Navy admirals, the former Navy pilot and  
Vietnam prisoner-of-war scheduled his day's start with a visit to 
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. A poor student and 
troublemaker, McCain barely graduated from the school but later 
distinguished himself as a flyer and prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in New Hampshire, the leadoff primary state, his speech  
to voters was laced with references to his military record -- ``I 
have passed from a young man to an old one in the service of my 
country'' -- and with criticism of his political foes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, he said, broke a promise to protect Social  
Security and weakened the U.S. military. By promising to ``respect 
the dignity of the office,'' McCain suggested that Clinton has not. 
</P>
<P>
	He said both parties in Congress wasted money on ``unneeded  
weapons systems and other pork projects while 12,000 (military) 
personnel -- proud young men and women -- subsist on food stamps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said no other candidate was as qualified to be  
commander-in-chief, a clear reference to the lack of foreign policy 
experience held by George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time when our nation's leader can no longer rely  
on briefing books and talking points, when the experts and the 
advisers have all weighed in, when the sum total of one's life 
becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions 
that determine the future of our democracy,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a two-term Texas governor who served stateside in the  
Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, has made no secret 
of his need to bone up on foreign policy and rely on advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush holds a healthy lead over all GOP rivals in polling and  
fund-raising, though McCain has closed the gap in New Hampshire. 
The Arizona senator has gained attention in recent weeks with the 
publication of a family memoir that recalls his tortuous 5 1/2 years 
in a Vietnam prison. 
</P>
<P>
	An unorthodox politician by nature, McCain is expected to take  
the unusual step of skipping Iowa's caucuses and focusing on the 
early New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. New Hampshire is 
loaded with independent-minded voters who might like the underdog 
McCain, while South Carolina has a huge population of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain confronted another issue today before his announcement.  
He said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that he wants the Supreme 
Court's decision legalizing abortion overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also want to change the dynamics of this debate, which  
has kept us gridlocked into positions which caused people to shoot 
at abortion clinics and other Americans to view it as the only 
issue in American politics,'' McCain said. ``There are areas we can 
agree on. ... We need to work together to eliminate abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's signature issue in Congress -- campaign finance reform --  
has failed repeatedly and is being debated again in Washington this 
fall. He said the cause must be won to give Americans faith in 
government again.	   ``We can continue to watch as the American people grow ever more 
alienated from the practice and institutions of democracy. We can 
continue to tolerate a government that has become little more than 
a spectacle of selfish ambition, a government auctioned to the 
highest bidder. Or we can take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can fight together to reclaim our government from those who  
corrupt it. This is our new patriotic challenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said American foreign policy must be more consistent and  
meaningful. ``We cannot hide behind empty threats, false promises, 
meaningless rhetoric, and photo op diplomacy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong military requires smart spending, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``As president, I won't ask how much security we can afford.  
I'll ask how much security do we need, and I will find the 
resources to pay for it. But I won't tolerate one dime of our 
defense budget being wasted to re-elect shortsighted politicians 
who put their own ambitions before the national interest,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	--Repealing the tax penalty applied to married couples, slashing  
the inheritance tax, ending the earnings test penalty for senior 
citizens and increasing the number of Americans who qualify for the 
lowest tax rate of 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paying teachers on merit and testing their competency.  
</P>
<P>
	--Conducting a nationwide test of school vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
	--Using new technology to help lower-class Americans lift  
themselves up. ``The information revolution will hasten the end of 
a two-tiered society of haves and have-nots,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Aspen Mayor's Son Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- The 18-year-old son of Mayor Rachel Richards  
was arrested in a convenience store holdup and the theft of a Range 
Rover and shotguns from a home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor accompanied Jacob Richards to the police station  
Friday, when he turned himself in on conspiracy and other felonies. 
He was in jail this morning in lieu of $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards was arrested after a friend -- who was caught in another  
vehicle stolen from Aspen -- told police he and Richards, along with 
a third man, stole the items from the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards, who worked for a cleaning company, had the key,  
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards was charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery in  
connection with an Aug. 5 holdup at the Aspen market. Two masked 
men, one armed with a handgun and the other with a rifle, took a 
large amount of cash and fled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards once worked at the store, but police did not say why  
they suspect him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire matter is now in the hands of the justice system,  
and both Jacob and I wish to see it fully resolved,'' the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspen, a ritzy resort town, has been hit with a series of armed  
robberies and burglaries recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Tom Stephenson wouldn't say if the crimes were  
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation continues,'' he said. ``We have some  
promising leads.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Jump in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A group of European central banks triggered the  
biggest one-day increase in gold prices in 13 years Monday with a 
surprise plan to put a cap on their planned sales of gold bullion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold peaked at $285 an ounce in London Monday, more than $16  
above the price of $268.60 in late trading Friday. The price fell 
back to $279.90 in late London trading and was $281.80 in New York 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying marked a sharp break from recent pessimism about  
gold's long term prospects, which was accompanied by 20-year lows 
in the price of gold on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's price gains caused stocks in South African gold-mining  
companies to jump by an average of more than 15 percent -- a welcome 
respite after a string of mine closures and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increase, consumers in the United States and other  
wealthy countries are unlikely to have to pay higher retail prices 
for gold jewelry and other finished products. 
</P>
<P>
	``The labor in making the product is probably more important  
than the cost of the raw material,'' said John Slater, an economist 
at National Westminster Bank Group. ``A rise of this magnitude is 
not likely to have a large impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound in gold prices followed the announcement on Sunday  
by 15 central banks that they would limit their combined sales of 
bullion to 400 tons per year for a total of five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the banks acted to restore stability to gold  
prices by removing the uncertainty that a central bank might 
suddenly sell some of its reserves and drive prices down further. 
The banks also agreed not to increase their leasing of gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``These decisive measures by a group which accounts for some 50  
percent of all official gold holdings will reduce dramatically the 
scope for rumor and speculation which has been such a damaging 
feature of the gold market in recent years,'' said the World Gold 
Council. The council is a London-based group financed by 
gold-mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
	World prices for the metal had declined markedly since May, when  
Britain's Treasury announced its intention to sell much of its 
reserves and replace them with securities denominated in dollars, 
yen and euros -- assets that offered a better financial return. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold has historically been a haven for investors in times of  
turmoil, but less so in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	It peaked at $875 per ounce in January 1980 -- a time when U.S.  
inflation rate was in double figures, oil prices were rising 
rapidly and Soviet troops were entering Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, The Bank of England auctioned off 25 metric tons  
of gold, its second such sale of reserves this year. Switzerland's 
central bank and the International Monetary Fund also had expressed 
an interest in selling off some of their gold holdings, causing an 
outcry from gold-producers -- many of them poor countries in Africa 
who feared that the resulting drop in prices would deny them badly 
needed revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear in the market that the Bank of England's sales would  
lead to further banks' selling is very much reduced now,'' Slater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhona O'Connell of T. Hoare Canaccord, a London-based brokerage  
specializing in precious metals, said she expected the central 
banks' strategy to help push gold up to $320 an ounce by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's increase was the largest rise from one trading day to  
the next since Nov. 5, 1986, when the price for gold shot up by 
$17.25 an ounce, according to the World Gold Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock in Anglogold Ltd., the South African firm that is the  
world's biggest gold producer, rose 12 percent in value, while 
those of rival Gold Fields Ltd. soared 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the central banks' plan also brought the ``sobering''  
realization that gold's role is changing, said Paul Walker, a 
director of Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd, a London-based 
precious metals research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold will continue to be less important as a store of value for  
central banks and governments as they shift their assets to 
securities which earn greater returns, he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Prevents Flu Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Junior got the flu? Bad enough for the kid,  
but parents also know they may inevitably be the next to contract 
the sneezes and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it appears there is something they can do about it.  
</P>
<P>
	A study released Sunday shows that a new variety of prescription  
flu drug is the first ever proven to keep family members from 
getting sick when someone brings home the bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, an inhaled powder called Relenza, is due on  
drugstore shelves on Friday. A similar competing medicine in pill 
form is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are a major step forward,'' said Dr. Frederick  
Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. ``The 
latest data show that they clearly work for prevention, as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His study, conducted during last winter's flu season, showed  
that taking Relenza cuts the chances of catching the flu from an 
ill relative by up to 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not all the good sniffles news. Hayden released  
details of a second study Sunday of the first anti-viral medicine 
that appears to reduce the duration of the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden described the results at the annual scientific meeting of  
the American Society of Microbiology. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza reduces the duration of a bout of flu by a day or two.  
Unlike the earlier generation of flu drugs, which are powerless to 
prevent the disease, it works against both major strains of the 
disease, known as influenza A and B. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
last summer and is made by Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. The company says 
the wholesale cost for a dose to treat one bout of flu will be $37. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 25 million and 50 million Americans typically get the  
flu each winter. Doctors emphasize that the flu vaccine is still 
the best way to ward off the disease, but the new drugs should help 
when people fail to get shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, youngsters bring home the flu to their parents and  
siblings from school and day care. The latest experiment was 
intended to see if family members could be protected by taking 
Relenza at the first sign of flu in the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 975 families with school-age children volunteered to  
participate in the study. Between December and March, 337 of these 
families actually had a case of flu. The sick person and the rest 
of the family were randomly assigned to get either the drug or a 
look-alike dummy spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 4 percent of the folks in getting Relenza came down  
with the flu, compared with 19 percent in the untreated comparison 
families. Even when they did get sick, their disease appeared to be 
far milder. Flu in the Relenza-treated family members typically 
lasted three days, compared with about six days in the comparison 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important aspect of the drug that could reduce the  
burden of influenza,'' said Dr. William Craig of the University of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza will be the first of a new class of flu medicines known  
as neuraminidase inhibitors to reach the market. However, 
Hoffman-LaRoche's Tamiflu, a similar medicine in pill form, is 
expected to be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback to these medicines is that they must be started  
within the first day or two of symptoms to have any effect on the 
disease. Most people don't call their doctor at the first twinge of 
flu's body ache, and they probably could not get an instant 
appointment, even if they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said drug companies will have to convince both physicians  
and patients to look at flu differently, now that medicines are 
available to both treat the disease and prevent it. For instance, 
he said doctors may eventually become willing to prescribe the 
drugs over the phone without seeing patients if they report typical 
flu miseries during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report to the conference, Hayden described the  
results of a study of pleconaril, an experimental medicine for the 
common cold. The medicine was developed by Viropharma Inc. of 
Exton, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested it on 1,024 people and found that it shortened  
the length of a typical moderate-to-severe cold from 14 days to 
10 1/2. They looked at various measures of a cold's severity, 
including the number of tissues used. Their count: Pleconaril 
reduced the number of tissues needed by 23 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Presidential Field Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican presidential field is shrinking  
faster than a punctured beachball. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a year before the presidential election and four  
months before the first votes are cast in Iowa, four candidates 
already have fallen -- collapsing under the crush of money shortages 
and an unforgiving, front-loaded election calendar that offers 
little hope for underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
	There's not enough cash to go around in a crowded field, leaving  
a frustrated group of Republican candidates scrabbling for any 
money that escapes the voracious fund-raising vacuum cleaner of 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. He already has amassed an unprecedented 
$50 million warchest, five times that of his nearest challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle was the latest dropout, heading  
for the door Monday fast on the heels of Ohio Rep. John Kasich, 
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire. Alexander and Kasich were winnowed out in a battle for 
the centrist segment of the Republican Party; Quayle came up short 
among the right wing of the GOP. Smith bolted to run under the 
banner of the U.S. Taxpayers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen candidates drop out in the year before the election  
but not so many,'' said Michigan State University political 
scientist David Rohde. ``That's partly a function of the size of 
the Republican field and partly a function of Bush's money 
dominance. I don't think we've seen that combination of events 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the candidates' problem is that most Americans are not  
paying attention now and can't even say who is running. 
</P>
<P>
	``For most people, the election is not going on,'' President  
Clinton observed. Indeed, a Pew Research Center poll this month 
found that 37 percent of respondents could not come up with the 
name of a single Republican candidate and -- even worse -- that 50 
percent could not name a Democratic candidate without prompting. 
</P>
<P>
	The public's indifference is not the worst part. The biggest  
problems are the lack of money and a political calendar expected to 
produce a Republican and Democratic nominee around March 7 when a 
dozen states -- including powerhouses California and New York -- 
stage primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only six months before it's all over and decided in terms  
of the nomination,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist not 
aligned with a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that candidates like Dan Quayle and Lamar  
Alexander can't run traditional underdog campaigns because the 
campaign is over so soon,'' New Hampshire GOP state chairman Steve 
Duprey said. ``Front-loading and compression of the calendar is 
making it virtually impossible for lesser known, lesser funded 
candidates to have a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle tried to soldier on despite an eighth-place finish among  
nine candidates in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll last month. Pulling 
out of the race, he said, ``The political reality set in when I 
looked at the money and the calendar after New Hampshire. New 
Hampshire is an issue-oriented state but after that -- this is where 
the light went off -- there are 18 primaries in 30 days ... which 
leaves you no time to build on your momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Quayle's departure, eight Republicans are still standing,  
including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who officially entered the 
race Monday. Except for front-runner Bush and millionaire Steve 
Forbes, the others -- Elizabeth Dole, Gary Bauer, Patrick J. 
Buchanan, as well as second-tier candidates Alan Keyes and Sen. 
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- are struggling for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, the conservative television commentator, may jump ship  
to run as a Reform Party candidate. Bauer, likely to benefit from 
Quayle's withdrawal, is likely to hang in and battle Forbes for 
conservative support. Dole got new life from her impressive showing 
in Iowa and is likely to press forward despite money problems. 
Bush, of course, remains king of the hill, while his rivals watch 
for him to stumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the race, Quayle said Republicans should consider  
spreading out the calendar of primaries and re-examining the $1,000 
limit on individual contributions. Others agree that the day of the 
underdog is fading. 
</P>
<P>
	``From now on, unless this is changed for both parties,'' said  
Gillespie, '' the nominee is inevitably going to be the governor of 
California, Texas, Florida or New York, the incumbent president or 
vice president or someone who has inherited great sums of wealth. 
The day of a dark horse candidate with good ideas and energy and 
enthusiasm being able to capture a major party nomination may be 
over.''

<HEADLINE> New Encephalitis Strain Hits NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported  
in the Western Hemisphere -- not the St. Louis strain blamed earlier 
-- has caused four deaths and sickened 33 people in the city and its 
suburbs, federal health officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reclassified the  
cases as West Nile-like fever, a mosquito-borne ailment whose 
symptoms are similar to those of St. Louis encephalitis but 
generally milder. The two viruses are easily confused in laboratory 
tests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are re-examining 174 more cases -- including eight  
fatalities -- to see whether they also were caused by the new 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a question of two very, very rare diseases, and there  
was just some confusion about it,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. 
``If anything, the disease we're dealing with now is somewhat less 
severe than the one we were dealing with before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists got their first hint that St. Louis encephalitis  
might be a misdiagnosis when birds around the Bronx Zoo died and 
tested positive for West Nile-like fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials call the new strain West Nile-like because they have  
not yet identified it with certainty. A related strain known as the 
Kunjin virus is also suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nile strain is found mainly in Africa, the Middle East,  
and Asia. It would probably enter the United States through 
infected birds, said Dr. Ned Hayes, a CDC epidemiologist. Humans 
can get the virus from mosquitoes that have picked it up from 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment and prevention measures are the same for both  
illnesses, Giuliani said. For several weeks, the city has been 
spraying pesticides to kill mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Urge U.N. Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Republican and Democratic lawmakers came  
to the United Nations Monday to demand the U.S. Congress pay the 
nation's $1.5 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous and embarrassing that the United States -- the  
wealthiest country in the world -- is the biggest deadbeat at the 
U.N.,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	She was joined at a press conference by Chris Shays, R-Conn.,  
and Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., to draw attention to the debt and release 
a letter to the congressional leadership demanding the dues be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, to House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Minority  
leader Richard Gephardt, warned that U.S. foreign policy was being 
undermined by the arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is again threatened this year with losing its  
vote in the General Assembly if it doesn't pay an estimated $350 
million by the end of the year. Its vote in the Security Council is 
secured. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held up payment of $1.5 billion for years,  
demanding that the United Nations streamline its organization and 
institute a no-growth budget. Legislation that would have paid off 
the bulk of the bills was vetoed last year by President Clinton 
because it contained unrelated restrictions on U.S. spending for 
overseas family planning organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who insist on linking these two issues now hold U.N.  
arrears funding hostage,'' Lowey said. ``As this nonsense 
continues, these opponents squander the successes we have gained 
through our participation in the U.N.''

<HEADLINE> Volcano Visitors Unfazed by Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- A plane crash on  
Mauna Loa Volcano that killed all 10 people aboard didn't deter 
sightseers on Monday from the flights that reveal the spectacular -- 
and dangerous -- elements of Hawaii's beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this for a long time,'' said Jerry Leo  
of Brick, N.J., who took an around-the-island flight. ``Once we 
were up there we never thought of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii tourism officials played down the repercussions of  
Saturday's Big Island Air crash, saying most visitors understand 
that many island activities, such as flying over volcanoes and 
waterfalls, are inherently risky. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii's deadliest sightseeing accident in 25 years, the  
twin-engine plane crashed almost two miles up the slopes of Mauna 
Loa, an active volcano that reaches 13,600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators were trying to find a missing body and the  
cause of the crash in the burned wreckage. Some pieces of the plane 
were so charred that they crumbled in the hands of recovery crews. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's corrections chief, Hank Risley, was among the  
dead, that state's governor said Monday. The other nine victims had 
not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400,000 people a year take in Hawaii's spectacular  
sites from the sky. Helicopter and plane tours take them within 
1,000 feet of bubbling lava, waterfalls and lush valleys that they 
would not be able to reach by car or even by foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any activity you do that has danger in it, you run risks,''  
said David Carey, president and chief executive of Outrigger Hotels 
and Resorts and a member of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``But given the vast number of air tours that go out every day  
from all the islands, it's a very safe activity. I believe it's 
safer than driving down a freeway in L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many tourists apparently agreed and had no qualms about signing  
up for aerial tours over the Big Island just two days after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had one cancellation due to that,'' said Wendy Hart  
of Island Hoppers, which offers nine daily plane tours. ``We've had 
questions, but no cancellations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of Big Island Air's Piper Navajo Chieftain last made  
contact Saturday at 5:21 p.m., one hour after it took off from the 
airport. The pilot did not say there were any problems, said Gail 
Minami, the park's operations supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact there was no distress call means the pilot could have  
smashed into jagged lava without warning, she said. Rescuers said 
the plane slid about 75 yards, rolled over and burned, but remained 
mostly intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Island Air officials couldn't be reached Monday. The  
company's phone was busy.

<HEADLINE> Donaldson Launches Web News Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ABC's Sam Donaldson took to the Internet on  
Monday in an early test of how America's television industry will 
fare as it cautiously embraces the online medium. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson launched the first regularly scheduled news program  
created especially for the Web by a major network, which planned to 
broadcast future shows live on the Internet three times each week 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	All indications pointed to an embarrassingly small Internet  
audience for the early effort -- an online survey of viewers during 
the broadcast, for example, collected only 373 responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, who appeared for the 15-minute Web broadcast in a  
tiny 2-inch window on computer screens, acknowledged what appeared 
to be lackluster numbers but said afterward, ``I'm pumped!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I made Web,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the broadcast, viewers could click for more information  
on specific subjects and type comments in a chat room. Donaldson 
promised to read them all, though he didn't during the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a sensitive fellow,'' he said in advance. ``I ask that  
you keep it a little mild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's venture is unusual because networks typically offer video  
on the Internet only if it's also being shown on their traditional 
television and cable broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Donaldson's broadcast -- he interviewed the chairman of the  
Federal Communications Commission about high-speed Internet 
connections on Monday's show and talked with a technology executive 
-- won't be seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's online efforts to date have been colored by deep  
fears that by encouraging more viewers to log onto the Internet, 
networks are cannibalizing their lucrative cable and television 
broadcasts: As people turn on their PCs, they're turning off their 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the days when you can't compete against yourself are  
gone,'' said David Westin, president of ABC News. ``Ubiquity is 
going to be the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters also fear the extraordinary fragmentation of their  
audience that's possible on the Internet. Instead of competing for 
viewers against a few dozen cable networks, Web sites must fight 
for attention among millions of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eyeballs still matter,'' said Lynn Povich, MSNBC's East Coast  
managing editor. ``There are a lot of them (Web sites) out there, 
and there is a lot of segmentation by interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But experts also point to an enormous opportunity by creating  
programs during weekdays for the Internet. While few employees have 
televisions in their offices and cubicles, most have computers with 
Internet connections. ABC's new show targets these workers, airing 
at www.abcnews.com during the lunch hour, at 12:30, on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going behind the iron curtain at work, and that's  
cool,'' said Rick Ducey, a senior vice president at the National 
Association of Broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	At CNN's Web site, which offers video clips, traffic peaks  
during the day, but television viewership peaks in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Internet is allowing us to do is, to access people  
where we haven't been accessing them before,'' said CNN 
Interactive's Kerrin Roberts. ``If someone is not watching CNN on 
television but going to the Web ... we need for them to be coming 
to (CNN). If there's cannibalization, we still want them to come 
through to CNN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC encouraged viewers to watch its Internet program as its  
aired -- the way traditional broadcasts are shown -- but also will 
store copies on its Web site that can be seen at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a TV broadcaster, you're used to doing business in a  
certain way,'' Ducey said. But ``if it's 6:35, you've missed the 6 
o'clock news. With Internet access, it makes sense to make that 
news available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This ability to show video on demand is among the Internet's  
greatest strengths, but it can play havoc with advertisers: If a 
company has a huge sale next weekend, how useful are its ads if 
they're not seen until after the sale? 
</P>
<P>
	But experts also promise new benefits for advertisers. During an  
ad by Ford Motor Co., for example, a viewer could click to the 
local dealership's Web site, scan his list of cars available, pick 
a color and select options and set up an appointment to haggle 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's show offered a single 30-second ad during its first  
broadcast, but didn't include any such interactive features.

<HEADLINE>  Ty Cobb's Dentures Sell for $7,475 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the day Tiger Stadium closed, Ty Cobb's  
dentures sold for $7,475. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's without floss.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb's choppers were sold to Karen Shemonsky of Clarks Summit,  
Pa., who spent most of Monday explaining to friends why she had 
purchased them in the Sotheby's auction of Barry Halper's baseball 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep calling me, saying, `Why would you want that?''' she  
said. ``My sister goes on cruises. I'd rather have this in my 
hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, it was a lot cheaper than Cobb's 1928 jersey, which  
sold last weekend for $332,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Sotheby's estimated the dentures of the Detroit  
Tigers great at between $300 and $500 in the auction catalog. The 
price caught Shemonsky's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that, I said to my husband, `That's not bad for a  
piece of history,''' she said. ``It caught my eye. It's so odd, so 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Shemonsky can certainly appreciate a good set of teeth. For  
53 years her father, Frank Alimenti, was a dentist in Old Forge, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put fillings in and they stayed there for 40 years,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, she and her husband drove 130 miles from Clarks  
Summit to Manhattan for the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know the format,'' she said. ``I was a rookie.''  
</P>
<P>
	If she had her choice, she said she would have gone after some  
of the auction's Mickey Mantle stuff because he was her favorite 
player. But those were break-the-bank prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Mantle, you need $20,000 or $30,000,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb's teeth, she decided, would take a smaller bite out of her  
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
	She watched for a while and even got in a couple of bids -- $900  
for a Babe Ruth glove that went for $1,700 and $800 for a pair of 
Babe Ruth watches that sold for $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
	All the time, Cobb's teeth were in the back of her head.  
</P>
<P>
	She filled out a form indicating interest in bidding by  
telephone when the dentures went up for sale. Then she and her 
husband, Gene, discussed it on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I thought I'd go to $1,500,'' she said. ``Then,  
today, I decided I'd go to $2,000 and if push came to shove, 
$2,500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That plateau went in the blink of an eye, and with the bidding  
jumping in increments first of $250, and then $500, Shemonsky's 
adrenaline kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing she knew, the choppers belonged to her for a mere  
$6,500. Add in the buyer's commission and tax and the price goes to 
$7,475. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only took a minute,'' she said. ``I never thought I would  
go that high. It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was her husband upset?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' she said. ``He laughed. We're married 23 years  
next month. He's very understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Halper auction reached its halfway point with  
sales of more than $12 million for eight of the 16 scheduled 
sessions. The auction ends Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cobb would like this part. Hours after Shemonsky bought his  
dentures, a package of underwear endorsed by longtime rival Ruth 
went for nearly $6,000 less, selling at $1,840. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the difference in price?  
</P>
<P>
	``The underwear,'' a Sotheby's spokesman explained, ``was not  
game-used.''

<HEADLINE>  49ers' Young Is Ousted by Rough Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco quarterback Steve Young was  
knocked out of Monday night's game against the Arizona Cardinals 
when he took a severe hit with 28 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who has taken punishment repeatedly this season behind a  
struggling offensive line, was hit by two Cardinals on a blitz as 
he let go of a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeneas Williams hit Young high and J.J. McCleskey hit him low  
and Young's head appeared to bounce off the knee of an offensive 
lineman as he fell to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Young lay motionless for a couple of minutes, before slowly  
getting to his feet and making his way to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime, coach Steve Mariucci said Young did not have a  
concussion, but was woozy and would stay out of the game as a 
precaution. Team doctors said later Young did have a slight 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was 13-of-23 for 92 yards with a touchdown and an  
interception as the 49ers took a 17-0 halftime lead. He was 
replaced by Jeff Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was sacked five times and knocked down 16 more in last  
week's 28-21 come-from-behind victory over New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci's precaution goes back to his first game as 49ers coach  
in 1997 when Young was kneed in the head in the second quarter 
against Tampa Bay and returned to the game in the fourth quarter. 
That was Young's third concussion in a 10-month period.

<HEADLINE> SLOC Hires Customs Broker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee hired a  
customs broker for national olympic committees and the world's 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Circle International Group of San Francisco served as the  
customs broker for the 1996 Atlanta Games, where it ``demonstrated 
expertise in managing the customs process,'' Bill Wagner, SLOC's 
senior vice president of operations said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their work is behind the scenes in terms of customs clearance,  
warehousing and distribution, but the effort is essential for the 
availability of equipment and materials at the Games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Circle also will help write a customs manual and hold workshops  
for games participants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Games is expected to draw teams from as many as 80  
nations and 9,000 members of the media.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street bargain-hunting and a stronger  
dollar sparked a modest recovery Monday from last week's huge 
stock-market selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.06 to 10,303.39,  
halting a four-day retreat, but finished well below its highs of 
the day. The index of 30 blue-chip companies had been up as much as 
123.16 points Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.95 at 1,283.31, and the  
Nasdaq composite index was up 21.34 at 2,761.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow fell a total of 524.30 points, its biggest  
weekly point loss ever. That plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, 
or 9.2 percent, below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
But with the lift Monday, it still is up more than 12 percent this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 129.21 points  
last week. The index is still up nearly 26 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's heavy selloff created many undervalued stocks, which  
investors scooped up on Monday, said Bryan Piskorowski, a market 
analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a technical kind of dead-cat bounce,'' he said. The  
Wall Street term applies to just a modest rebound from a steep 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising value of the dollar against the Japanese yen also  
improved the mood among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which fell to a 3 1/2-year low against the yen earlier  
this month, rose sharply Monday on indications that Japan will work 
to stop the dollar's recent slide with support from other 
industrialized nations. A strong dollar makes U.S. securities more 
attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of  
Baltimore, said investors seem to be going back to technology 
stocks, which were big catalyst for the market before last week's 
retreat. That could be seen on the Nasdaq where Intel jumped 2 
33/64 to 78 3/16 and Sun Microsystems rose 3 3/4 to 93 15/16. But not 
all technology shares advanced as evidenced by Dow component IBM 
losing 2 to 123. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing an oversold market, and bargain-hunting taking  
over,'' said Cripps. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher Monday was Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 2 to 92  
and Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 2 1/16 at 99 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining stocks also bolstered the stock market as gold bullion  
posted its biggest daily gain in 13 years. Gold producers benefited 
after European central banks said they will limit bullion sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mixed, with Ebay down 7 5/16 at 138 3/4 and  
America Online up 3 5/8 at 101 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were weak as long-term interest rates  
climbed back above 6 percent. Dow component JP Morgan was down 4 
3/16 at 112 13/16 and Chase Manhattan fell 1 1/4 to 74 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market will remain volatile the next few weeks because of  
worries about interest rates and the dollar, analysts said. Wall 
Street, though, should benefit from third-quarter earning reports 
which are due beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors played down any talk that last week's market drop was  
the beginning of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case for a bear market is still a weak one,'' said  
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The 
leading indicators of the economy continue to point up not down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One benefit of last week's market drop is that it may give the  
Federal Reserve another reason to keep interest rates steady, 
Johnson said. The Fed next meets on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 943.54 
million shares, down from 1.04 billion shares in Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, was up 4.77 at 421.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Drag Death Defendant Blames Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The final defendant facing a murder trial in the  
dragging death of a black man is reportedly blaming the crime on 
two co-defendants who have been sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn A. Berry, 24, told ``60 Minutes II'' his version of what  
happened on the early morning of June 7, 1998, when James Byrd Jr. 
was chained to the bumper of Berry's pickup truck and dragged three 
miles to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Berry, whose trial  
is set to begin in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry insists his mistake was being in the wrong place with the  
wrong people -- white supremacists John W. King and Lawrence R. 
Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, was convicted and sent to death row in February, while  
former prison buddy Brewer, 32, was sentenced to death last week. 
Both men were members of a white supremacist prison gang, the 
Confederate Knights of America, while jailed together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hanging around a bad crowd. I mean, that's no excuse.  
But I mean, I was with people that I shouldn't have been with,'' 
Berry said, according to a transcript of the interview scheduled to 
air tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry and King had been friends for nearly a decade. Brewer had  
just come to town to visit King after losing a job, and all three 
stayed together at King's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The roommates had decided to go cruising in Berry's pickup the  
night they ran into Byrd, hitchhiking in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry offered him a ride home and Byrd hopped in the cab.  
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, who Berry describes as being ``very drunk,'' ended up on  
the ground being kicked by both Brewer and King. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing, joking, acting like they were having a  
good time,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Brewer covered Byrd's face with black spray paint, Berry  
said, Brewer kicked him in the head. Then he heard the chain being 
pulled out of the rear of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw them chain him up,'' Berry said. ``I sat in the  
truck. And they started dragging him down that dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill was driving. I was in the middle. Russell was on the  
passenger side and I asked him why he did it,'' Berry said. ``And 
he said he's starting `The Turner Diaries' early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Turner Diaries,'' called an inspiration for Oklahoma City  
bomber Timothy McVeigh by the FBI, describes a race war in which 
white supremacists kill blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said he didn't stop Brewer and King because he was afraid  
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they have DNA evidence showing Byrd's  
blood was on Berry's shoes, and District Attorney Guy James Gray 
said Monday there is more evidence he has not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, said his client's  
interview with ``60 Minutes II'' is a re-telling of the statements 
he gave to police.

<HEADLINE> Nike Links Up With Web Marketer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- You'll soon be able to buy Nike products  
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike reportedly plans to allow Fogdog Sports, an online sporting  
goods retailer, to sell the full Nike line of products. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times and the Portland Oregonian are reporting the  
deal. The two companies have an announcement scheduled for later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times says that Nike extracted a high price for the right to  
sell its athletic shoes, shirts and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	It gets warrants to acquire 12 percent of Fogdog's shares.  
</P>
<P>
	Nike is hoping the new Internet strategy will jump-start sales  
in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Buys Stake in Nain Food Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. has struck a strategic alliance  
with The Hain Food Group Inc. aimed at combining Hain's natural and 
organic brands with Heinz's manufacturing and purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Heinz will pay $100 million for a 19.5 percent  
stake in Hain, which is based in Uniondale, N.Y., under the deal 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz expects 15 percent to 18 percent growth in the natural and  
organic foods market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The natural foods industry is growing ... and we expect it to  
continue to grow, so Heinz must find a way to participate in that 
growth,'' said Joseph Jimenez, president and chief executive of 
Heinz North America. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Heinz also conveys its Earth's Best organic  
baby food brand to Hain, which has been marketing and distributing 
the product for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance gets Heinz into the organic food market through  
Hain's distribution routes in North America at a relatively low 
cost, about 1 percent of Heinz' more than $9 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz's $100 million investment representing one-third of Hain's  
projected $300 million in revenue for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hain has 3,500 brands, some leading organic or natural food  
categories such as snack chips and soy products, but has been 
caught between spending to expand its market and investing in more 
capacity. Heinz helps to solve the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows us to invest in brands, not in bricks and mortar  
in building plants. Heinz has the capacity,'' said Irwin Simon, 
Hain's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz also expects to bring some organic foods it currently  
sells in India and parts of Europe into North American markets 
through Hain's distribution system, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Johnson, Heinz's chief executive, said the deal should  
deliver earnings growth to both companies this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns analyst Terry Bivens wasn't so sure Heinz would see  
such an immediate benefit. But he said the deal would give 
slow-growing Heinz a foothold in a fast-growing food business, and 
puts serious muscle behind Hain. 
</P>
<P>
	One example: Heinz's strong relationship with Kroger would help  
Hain get its organic and natural foods in the grocer's new Nature's 
Market store-within-a store, Bivens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez and Malcolm Ritchie, a Heinz executive vice president  
and president of Heinz Europe, will join Hain's board.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holding Steel Talks With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will hold a series of  
high-level talks with Japan about last year's huge surge in 
Japanese steel shipments to the United States, the Clinton 
administration announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this dialogue is to more effectively address  
the considerable problems we have had in steel and to prevent 
future problems from occurring,'' Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Susan Esserman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese agreed to the talks during a meeting Esserman held  
Friday with Hisamitsu Arai, Japan's vice minister of international 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-Japanese talks are the latest effort by the  
administration to respond to complaints from U.S. steelmakers about 
a surge of foreign steel into the United States in the wake of the 
Asian currency crisis, which pushed many nations into recessions 
and led to a world oversupply of steel and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan was the single largest contributor to the surge in steel  
imports last year, accounting for 40 percent of the total increase, 
Esserman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is also in discussions with the government of  
South Korea to launch similar talks with that country, and Esserman 
indicated other countries could be added later. 
</P>
<P>
	A country-by-country review of steel trade was one of the items  
that Clinton promised to pursue to head off legislation that would 
impose global quotas on steel imports, something Clinton has said 
would violate World Trade Organization rules.

<HEADLINE> UAW OKs DaimlerChrysler Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers on Monday approved a  
lucrative four-year contract with DaimlerChrysler by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal covering 75,000 hourly and salaried workers was  
approved by 86 percent of voters in balloting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our members at DaimlerChrysler have every reason to be proud  
of these industry leading contracts and every reason to be proud of 
the contribution they have made to turning this company around and 
that pride is reflected in the overwhelming rate of approval for 
this agreement,'' said UAW President Stephen P. Yokich. 
</P>
<P>
	The union said the deal gives the average DaimlerChrysler  
assembly worker $29,300 in wage increases and bonuses over the next 
four years. Workers get an annual increase of 3 percent a year for 
all four years, a $1,350 signing bonus and improved cost of living 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	The union expects the DaimlerChrysler contract to be used by  
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. with only minor changes. 
Talks were held at GM through the weekend and appeared to be 
intensifying, while talks at Ford continued at a lower level. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal has several clauses aimed at protecting union jobs.  
If employment drops below 80 percent of a set level in a bargaining 
unit, DaimlerChrysler must replace each job lost, according to a 
union summary of the contract. If the level is between 80 percent 
and 90 percent, one of every two empty positions must be filled; 
between 90 and 100 percent, the ratio is 1-to-3. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also agreed not to spin off any division into a  
separate business or close or sell any factories. Such a clause 
might be aimed more at GM and Ford than DaimlerChrysler. GM has 
spun off its Delphi parts unit, and Ford would like to spin off its 
Visteon parts unit -- a move the UAW opposes.

	Greenspan Urges Improved Markets  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future Asian-style currency crises could be  
avoided or their damage at least lessened if developing countries 
strive to improve the soundness of their financial systems, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. Greenspan said that the 
serious global financial crisis of the past two years dramatically 
underscored the need for developing countries to pay attention to 
such issues as how they regulate their banks and whether they are 
pursuing the correct policies needed to build sound financial 
systems. ``Improving deficiencies in domestic banking systems in 
emerging markets will help to limit the toll of the next financial 
disturbance,'' Greenspan said in a speech to financial leaders 
gathered for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank.

Computer customers. The seven-year agreement comes six months after 
Dell agreed to buy $16 billion worth of computer components from

installation and onsite warranty services for a wide range of Dell 
products, including desktop machines, notebook computers,

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Co. announced a major  
restructuring Monday, including changes in top management and a 
corporate realignment. The defense contractor said it plans to sell 
eight businesses that employ 9,000 people. The businesses to be 
sold include a New Hampshire firm that makes ``black box'' data 
recorders in airplanes and a Washington state firm that is cleaning 
up a nuclear reactor site. The businesses have combined annual 
revenues of $1.4 billion. But some Wall Street analysts were 
disappointed that Lockheed, the No. 1 defense contractor in terms 
of sales, decided not to tackle problems in its aerospace business, 
which has experienced some costly setbacks and failures. Lockheed 
shares were at 32 3/16, up 1 9/16.

	LONDON (AP) -- A group of European central banks triggered the

surprise plan to put a cap on their planned sales of gold bullion. 
Gold peaked at $285 an ounce in London today, more than $16 above 
the price of $268.60 in late trading Friday. The price fell back to 
$278.90 in late London trading and was $281.90 in New York late 
today. Today's price gains caused stocks in South African 
gold-mining companies to jump by an average of more than 15 percent 
-- a welcome respite after a string of mine closures and layoffs.

Minister Shi Guangsheng. She then discussed specific details with 
lower-level officials. The talks are scheduled to end tomorrow.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. said today it will start selling a  
Walkman that fits into the palm of a hand and downloads music from 
the Internet while protecting copyrights. The ``Memory Stick 
Walkman'' is designed to fight the proliferation of illegal music 
exchanges on the Internet and to create a new standard for portable 
audio players. The Walkman will cost $430 and requires a computer 
with Microsoft Windows 98 to transfer music. Memory Stick users 
would pay for Internet music made compatible with Sony's encryption 
system, but would not be able to download songs from free Web 
sites. A Sony spokesman did not explain what form the payments 
would take.

Shoney's disclosed today that it also has agreed to sell nine 
Shoney's restaurants in Charlotte, N.C., to franchisees Graham

cited a decline in prices for Chinese-made bicycles over the past

the two plants. Huffy did not say whether any jobs would be

<HEADLINE> Army Offers $6,000 Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is so anxious to find recruits that  
it's offering an extra $6,000 bonus to anyone who can get into 
basic training before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's on top of up to $12,000 in other incentives and $50,000  
in scholarships, depending on what field the recruit chooses and 
the length of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's almost too late to get the windfall, because the enlistee  
would have to report for training by Thursday, the final day of 
this fiscal year, to qualify 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the person came in with a birth certificate and a high  
school diploma, we might make it,'' Army recruitment spokesman Doug 
Smith in Fort Knox, Ky., said Monday. ``You'd practically have to 
have your toothbrush with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army and Air Force are expected to fall short of their  
recruiting goal by about 8,000 men and women this year as they face 
a booming civilian job market, record college enrollment and a 
declining 20-something population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is resorting to TV ads and offering up to $12,000  
bonuses for some jobs and still can't meet its goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has had more success by accepting greater numbers of  
enlistees who haven't graduated from high school and by adding 100 
recruitment offices. 
</P>
<P>
	And so has the Marines Corps, by maintaining its tough image,  
lately placing its ads on TV shows featuring extreme sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, which began offering the new bonus Aug. 17, is short  
by about 6,300 recruits. The Air Force expects to end the year 
needing 1,700 enlistees to maintain current levels. Both the Navy 
and Marines say they'll meet goals. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the competition from private enterprise and  
higher education, shrinking the military services since the Vietnam 
War has resulted in less interest among young Americans in joining 
the 1.4 million-member all-volunteer military. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200,000 new recruits are needed each year to maintain  
force levels set by Congress and military planners. The goal this 
year was just over 197,000. When all the recruits are added up at 
the end of the month, it isn't expected to reach much over 189,000, 
meaning even more recruitment pressure for the next fiscal year 
beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all relates to fewer dinner table conversations about  
joining the military,'' said Master Sgt. Tom Clements, Air Force 
recruitment spokesman in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure has made recruiting one of the military's toughest  
jobs, ``comparable to sea duty,'' said Navy recruitment spokesman 
Cmdr. Steve Lowry in Millington, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	With new incentives and hundreds of new, younger recruiters,  
both the Army and Air Force have managed to boost recruitment in 
recent weeks. The Army, which at one time was projecting a 
shortfall of 8,000 recruits itself, still expects to miss its needs 
by the biggest number since 1979 when the force was much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is ahead of this month's goal but will still end  
the year short, according to recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, which fell short by 6,900 last year, is within 100 of  
its goal for this year, and expects to meet the target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines were never in doubt they would meet their goal even  
without big signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy recruiters insist that the acceptance of up to 10 percent  
non-high school graduates -- last year the Navy set a 5 percent 
limit -- has not reduced the quality of recruits. In fact, said 
spokesman Lt. Steve Zip, non-graduates face stricter math and 
verbal test requirements and other standards than those with a 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call them proven performers,'' Zip said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has refused to lower its requirement that 99  
percent of recruits have high school degrees, said Clements. ``We 
are a very technical force. Air Force needs are such that we have 
to retain our standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Air Force also has significantly increased incentives,  
with 100 of the 150 career fields now qualifying for bonuses of up 
to $12,000, compared with just a dozen last year. To get the full 
bonus, an enlistee would have to go into combat or rescue fields 
and sign up for six years.

<HEADLINE> Parole of Rapist Stirs Resentment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEWITT, Ark. (AP) -- After 14 years behind bars, convicted rapist  
Wayne Dumond is set to head home to a huge catfish dinner and a 
fresh start as a welder in the family business. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the welcome may end.  
</P>
<P>
	Many in this rural community plan to keep their distance from  
Arkansas' most infamous convicted rapist. Some apparently are 
unconvinced that Dumond has suffered enough, although he was 
castrated -- he says by masked vigilantes -- before he was sent to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word that I would choose is fearful, reluctant,'' said  
Betty Watson, whose husband was pastor at the church Dumond 
attended. ``We are a small community, we embrace each other, we 
love each other. But still, with the history he has, it is 
uneasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So uneasy, she adds, ``I've heard people say, `We'll kill him,'  
that he won't live long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Watson is not the only one who's heard that talk.  
</P>
<P>
	``More than one person has expressed an interest in doing Mr.  
Dumond bodily harm, up to and including the termination of his 
life,'' Mayor Carroll Lester Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond, 50, was convicted in the 1984 rape of Ashley Stevens, a  
17-year-old high school cheerleader from Forrest City and a distant 
cousin of President Clinton, who was governor at the time of the 
assault and trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond was at his home in Forrest City awaiting trial when his  
testicles were cut off, he says by intruders who used fishing line. 
The former St. Francis County sheriff later displayed them in a jar 
on his office desk. No one was arrested for the attack, and Dumond 
later won a $100,000 jury verdict against the sheriff for emotional 
distress over the display. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond's family say people have no reason to fear him.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's not going to do anything,'' said his younger brother,  
Bobby Dumond. ``I don't understand why everyone is making a big 
deal about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his brother's safety, Bobby Dumond said: ``There's not  
going to be a problem. ... There will be a family member with him 
at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Post-Prison Transfer Board, which voted 5-0 to parole  
Dumond, said they are convinced he poses no threat. He is to be 
freed in the next month or two, after completing a prerelease 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond plans to live with his stepmother, Lula Mae Dumond, and  
work at City Welding Shop, where the staff includes his son Joey, 
brother Bobby and brother-in-law Mike Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond also must undergo mental-health counseling and will be  
connected to an electronic monitor indefinitely. He won't be 
allowed to leave Arkansas County or contact Ms. Stevens or her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	That's little comfort for some residents.  
</P>
<P>
	Dale Sloate, who lives a block from Dumond's future workplace,  
has warned his 9-year-old grandson to stop riding his bicycle in 
the gravel parking lot of the welding shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Waitress Candace Bunch, who has children ages 15, 10 and 7, said  
she also is scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather he not be here,'' she said. ``I know he supposedly  
can't do anything, but pressure is going to build upon him out 
here, and it ain't going to take much to make that man go off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others have a more forgiving attitude. Some believe he was  
innocent of the rape -- framed because police needed a suspect and 
he had a criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had been anybody else besides Clinton's cousin, I don't  
think he'd have got the conviction he got,'' said Denise Stephens, 
a secretary at the Arkansas County sheriff's office in DeWitt. ``I 
think he's been mistreated not only by the public, but by 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dumond originally was sentenced to life plus 20 years. But in  
1992, Lt. Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, while acting as governor, reduced 
the sentence to 39 1/2 years, which made Dumond eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee announced in September 1996 that he intended  
to free Dumond, citing ``serious questions'' about Dumond's guilt. 
But Huckabee reconsidered after protests by the victim's family and 
state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Dumond was charged in Oklahoma in the death of man who  
was bludgeoned with a claw hammer, but the charge eventually was 
dropped. A little over a year later, after moving to Washington, 
Dumond pleaded guilty to second-degree assault for attacking a 
woman in a mall parking lot. A five-year sentence was deferred on 
condition he abstain from drugs and receive mental treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, after moving to DeWitt, he was charged with raping a  
22-year-old woman at knifepoint while she lay in bed with her 
3-year-old daughter. According to a state police report, Dumond 
confessed to the attack, but the woman said she dropped the charge 
after Dumond agreed to counseling and to stay out of town unless 
accompanied by a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who would just flippantly say, 'He's paid his dues,  
he's entitled to his life,' just don't know the whole story,'' the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dumond family says it is the mayor -- and others fanning  
opposition -- who don't know the full story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pay no attention to them. People around DeWitt, they  
don't know anything they're talking about,'' said Dumond's youngest 
son, Joey, 23, who was 9 when his dad went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	For a week or so now, Bobby Dumond has been saving about 75  
catfish in his freezer -- all caught from the Arkansas River -- for 
his brother's first post-prison meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a lot of family together and have a big  
dinner,'' he said. ``He's been gone so long, we want to make him 
feel wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan chipmakers Nosedive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Makers of computer chips and other  
semiconductors took a beating on Taiwan's stock market Monday, as 
trading resumed for the first time since the killer earthquake shut 
their factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductors stocks fell 3.5 percent -- the maximum allowed  
under emergency curbs imposed by regulators -- and analysts 
predicted they will keep falling, even though the companies say 
they are getting closer to restarting production. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan produces 10 percent of the world's chips and about 80  
percent of the ``motherboards'' used to run personal computers. The 
quake on Sept. 21 brought Taiwan's chipmaking to a standstill, and 
experts fear supply shortages could spread throughout the global 
high-tech industry, driving up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor  
Manufacturing Co., said Monday that half of its production 
equipment was in operating order, adding it has sold some chips 
that were in the pipeline before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it takes time to recover to normal output,'' said  
TSMC spokesman Y.C. Huang. ``We will try our best to achieve this 
goal as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 Taiwanese chipmaker, United Microelectronics Corp.,  
said it has repaired most of its damage and hopes to be back at 
full production capacity within days. It didn't specify how many 
days, though. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown will cost United Microelectronics about $430  
million in operating revenues this month, about 25 percent of what 
it would normally have brought in, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Taipei Stock Exchange reopened, all eyes were on the  
chipmakers. Taiwanese officials, fearing panic-selling throughout 
the market, introduced emergency measures to stop any stock from 
falling by more than 3.5 percent per day, half the usual limit, for 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	While big chipmakers went limit down Monday, shares in cement,  
glass and steel manufacturers rallied on hopes that they can cash 
in as Taiwan rebuilds many shattered towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the rise by construction material stocks, there was  
``virtually no buying interest,'' said Margaret Pan, a vice 
president at Capital Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Charts of the main stock index looked like the heart monitor on  
a hospital patient who died -- a line that dropped sharply then 
moved straight across the computer screen with no up or down 
fluctuations. The index finished 2.7 percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The semiconductor companies did not suffer much physical damage  
at their plants, located mostly in northern Taiwan far away from 
the quake's epicenter in the center of the island. 
</P>
<P>
	But power cuts kept them out of business last week and it  
remains unclear how soon they can be up and running. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,  
Taiwan's version of Silicon Valley, has returned to normal and the 
companies are scrambling to get their equipment fine-tuned and back 
in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake killed almost 2,100 people and left analysts wondering  
how bad the island's export-based economy will be hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The government slashed its 1999 economic growth forecast to  
around 5.5 percent, compared to previous projections of 5.7 
percent. Interest rates and unemployment could rise, too.

<HEADLINE> Nike Links Up With Web Marketer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nike is taking on a retail partner for the  
first time, buying a minority share in the Internet company Fogdog 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike chairman Phil Knight and Fogdog CEO Tim Harrington were to  
announce the deal during an online news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike will purchase a 12 percent stake in Fogdog, a  
California-based start-up that sells more than 15,000 athletic 
products, including about 160 Nike goods, on its fogdog.com Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Nike will buy nearly 6.2 million shares  
of Fogdog common stock at $1.03 per share. Fogdog, which filed for 
a public stock offering on Friday, expects to see the stock open at 
several times that price when shares begin trading in about three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time a start-up has traded discounted stock  
to a supplier. Before going public earlier this year, the shopping 
Web site Priceline.com sold about 10 percent of its shares to Delta 
Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike's U.S. sales have been slumping for two straight fiscal  
years. Previously, Nike had only sold its wares through department 
stores and its own chain of Niketown outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike had been trying to sell more merchandise online, but  
pondered the best strategy for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogdog, based in Redwood City, Calif., has been around only  
three years and has less than $10 million in annual sales. But Nike 
chose the company because it was viewed as a leader in online 
sports retailing, according to a Nike official who did not wish to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a saying: `The best on the Web is bred on the Web,' ''  
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogdog was founded in 1994 by three Stanford University  
roommates who wanted to design Web sites for sporting-goods 
companies. Four years later, Fogdog started its first Web site, 
SportSite.com, then changed to fogdog.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Also as part of the deal, Nike executive Tom Clarke will join  
Fogdog's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Fogdog had begun to acquire executives from Nike and other  
sports manufacturers even before the Nike deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Joyce, a 20-year Nike employee who recently served as vice  
president of global sales, left Nike in September to become 
president of Fogdog. Other Fogdog vice presidents include former 
executives with retailer Foot Locker and sports-equipment maker 
Mizuno Sports Inc.

<HEADLINE> IBM, Dell Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM Corp., emerging as the top name in running  
computers for e-commerce and other key operations, scored again 
Monday with a $6 billion pact to provide technical support for Dell 
Computer customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year agreement comes six months after Dell agreed to  
buy $16 billion worth of computer components from IBM, also over a 
seven-year span. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM Global Services will provide installation and onsite  
warranty services for a wide range of Dell products, including 
desktop machines, notebook computers, workstations, network servers 
and data-storage products. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, is the world's largest direct  
seller of computers and computer systems, with revenues of $21.7 
billion over the past four quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM pact won't replace Dell's existing computer service  
alliances with Unisys and GetronicsWang. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision to ally with IBM on technical support shows the  
growing sense of urgency in business when it comes to managing 
computer systems vital to sales, communications and general 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, some observers say, technical support is becoming a  
more crucial concern than choosing which hardware to use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really make any difference anymore whether they buy  
an IBM (computer) or a Dell or a Compaq as long as it works,'' said 
Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's top competitor this realm is EDS Corp. Other players  
include Computer Sciences Corp., AT&AMP;T Corp. and Digital Equipment 
Corp., which had provided technical support to Dell's customers 
until it was acquired by Compaq Computer in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM also competes with Dell as a computer maker, Dell's  
rivalry with Compaq is much more intense. IBM's services arm, 
meanwhile, is not perceived as an IBM marketing team in disguise, 
said Barry Jaruzelski, an industry analyst with the New York-based 
consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	But a greater concern for Dell is providing the best possible  
support for its customers, and few companies can provide the vast 
resources available through IBM, Jaruzelski and Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 22,000 technicians and 139 data centers around the world  
IBM is becoming the ``servicer of choice,'' said Albert, adding 
that Dell wants to offer its customers the best options. ``Even 
IBM's competitors on the hardware front are alligning themselves 
with IBM on the services front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM Global Services, with $29 billion in annual revenues and  
about 130,000 employees, is actually IBM's fastest growing unit, 
and the fastest growing part of that business is ``hosting'' 
computer servers that run Web sites and conduct electronic 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final products that people traditionally associate with  
IBM is not where they get their growth,'' said Jaruzelski.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Coach Stands by His Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz's difficult season on the field  
has gotten harder at home as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina coach, struggling with his team's 14-game  
losing streak, is now dealing with his wife's recurring throat 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz will miss practice Wednesday so he can fly with Beth Holtz  
to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The two will get a second 
opinion about tumors discovered in her adrenal glands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Holtz's attitude is better than mine,'' Holtz said.  
</P>
<P>
	She will have major surgery this week, he said, either in  
Columbia or at the Mayo Clinic, and remain hospitalized for as long 
as a week. ``The prognosis is very good for a complete and healthy 
recovery,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as five days ago, Holtz said he was not so hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
	``It has not been easy for the past several weeks,'' he said.  
``But after Wednesday, we'll feel better because we'll know what 
we're dealing with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said when the two learned his wife's condition was not as  
dire as they thought, he told her, ``Boy, I really am so 
thrilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said she responded, ``Yeah, I only have to have major  
surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz agreed to take the South Carolina job in December only  
after his wife's health had improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks (0-4) have the country's longest current major  
college losing streak at 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's oldest son, Skip, left his job as Connecticut's  
coach and became his father's offensive coordinator, partly to be 
near his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	If things go well, Holtz will return to practice Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Trey Pennington says it was hard to watch his coach  
deal with his wife's condition. ``We're sorry he's having such a 
hard time in his personal life and his career,'' Pennington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family also has had to deal with Skip's severe abdominal  
infection that left him weak, feverish and in the hospital during 
preparations for Georgia three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When Holtz learned several weeks ago that his wife's relapse  
could be serious, he told South Carolina athletic director Mike 
McGee that she would come first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody agreed to that,'' Holtz said. ``She needs my  
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Holtz isn't quitting on the Gamecocks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am totally committed to this program in the long run,'' he  
said. ``This is not something I'm going to walk away from until we 
turn it around completely.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Urges Truth in Deposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONES CREEK, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush urged former Lt.  
Gov. Ben Barnes to tell the truth in a deposition today if 
questions surfaced about how the Republican presidential candidate 
got into the Texas National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody ought to tell the truth when they're being  
deposed,'' Bush said today in a Brazoria County appearance. ``I'm 
confident he will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that Barnes said Sunday that  
he personally contacted a Guard general to help Bush get a pilot's 
slot in the Guard during the height of the Vietnam War. He told the 
newspaper that he did it at the request of a Bush family friend, 
Sidney A. Adger. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, has said that if  
such contact occurred, it wasn't needed and was without his 
knowledge or consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes' testimony was scheduled to be taken by lawyers for  
former Texas Lottery Executive Director Lawrence Littwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what Ben Barnes is going to say,'' Bush said.  
``But I know what the facts are. When I got into the National Guard 
over 30 years ago, they were looking for pilots. And I proudly 
served in the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never asked anybody to ask me, and neither did my dad.''  
</P>
<P>
	Littwin has sued GTECH Corp., the state's lottery operator over  
his discharge in 1997 after four months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Littwin's lawyers want to question  
Barnes, a former GTECH lobbyist, about whether GTECH was allowed to 
keep its lucrative state contract in exchange for Barnes' silence 
about the Guard matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, Barnes and GTECH have denied that scenario.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the Bush camp was aware a year ago, during the  
gubernatorial campaign, that the issue could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Midland businessman Donald L. Evans, then chairman of Bush's  
re-election bid, said he went to Barnes in September 1998 to 
investigate allegations made in ``an anonymous letter floating 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter alleged that Bush's father, then a Houston  
congressman, had solicited the influence of Barnes, who was speaker 
of the Texas House, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a straightforward businessman and I like to know the  
facts; I'm not interested in rumors or innuendoes,'' he told The 
Associated Press. ``Ben's a friend of mine, so I went to Ben.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said Barnes told him nobody in the Bush family had asked  
for such help. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Barnes said he recalled a Houston businessman, whose  
name was not mentioned, may have brought up the younger Bush's 
desire to enter the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said Sunday night that he met with Barnes on his own  
initiative and that he was only interested in the issue coming up 
during the gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't have anything to do with a possible presidential  
race at all,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, now national finance chairman for Bush's presidential  
campaign, said that if the anonymous letter had become a 
gubernatorial campaign issue, he wanted to be able to respond. ``I 
wanted to know the facts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, contacted Sunday by the AP, would not comment about the  
meeting with Evans, saying, ``My lawyers have asked me not to say 
anything until the deposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would comment afterward, Barnes replied: ``That all  
depends on my lawyers. I'm going to testify to the truth and it'll 
all be there in the deposition.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Discusses Belarus Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin approved a draft agreement  
on merging Russia and Belarus and ordered his aides to prepare for 
public discussion of the document, the Kremlin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian authorities want to release the draft agreement later  
this week, but haven't yet received the go-ahead from Belarus, 
Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhodko said, according to 
the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, which has a population of 146 million people, and  
Belarus, with 10 million people, have been discussing a plan to 
merge. In 1996, Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko signed a union agreement boosting political, economic 
and military ties between the two nations, but stopped short of 
creating a single state. 
</P>
<P>
	Public discussion of the draft agreement will most likely  
involve publishing it in Russian and Belarusian newspapers, along 
with letters of response from readers. Prime Minister Vladimir 
Putin has said it will not involve a public referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	After public discussion, the merger must be approved by the  
parliaments of both nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The authoritarian Lukashenko, a devout admirer of the Soviet  
Union, has pushed for a quicker integration, partly to help solve 
Belarus' crippling economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belarusian economy is one of the most unreformed in the  
former Soviet Union, with virtually all assets and markets under 
government control. It relies heavily on supplies of cheap energy 
from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian politicians have been noncommittal toward union with  
Belarus, partly because of fear of Lukashenko's authoritarian ways 
and his unpredictability. Many also warn that merger would put an 
additional strain on Russia, which is struggling with its own 
economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Bucs Don't Expect Sapp Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A broken hand will limit Warren Sapp in  
practice, however, Tampa Bay doesn't expect the injury to keep the 
Pro Bowl defensive tackle from playing against the Minnesota 
Vikings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp, tied for the league lead with four sacks, fractured two  
bones in his left hand when he was hit by teammate John Lynch 
during the second quarter of Sunday's 13-10 victory over the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	He played the second half wearing a soft cast, finishing with  
two tackles. His hand and wrist were fitted Monday for a hard cast 
that Lynch, the Bucs' Pro Bowl safety, signed: ``Sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little discomfort in there, but as long as I know I  
can't do any more damage to it, I'll be fine,'' said Sapp, who 
plans to play Sunday at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had more pain in the middle of the second half than I did at  
any time. We're going to go with it, and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony Dungy said Sapp will participate in the portion of  
practice dedicated to individual, agility and conditioning drills, 
but will be held out of contact work in preparation for the 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard cast will be removed this weekend and replaced by one  
that will be less restrictive in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do as much as the law allows to protect it. I'm not  
exactly sure what we'll have on there, but something similar to 
what he had in the second half,'' Dungy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp, who has missed only two games because of injuries in five  
seasons, shares is tied for the league sack lead with teammate 
Chidi Ahanotu, Washington's Kenard Lang and Chicago's Clyde 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs are first in the league in total defense, and neither  
Sapp nor Dungy feel the injury will affect the overall 
effectiveness of the unit, which has allowed a league low 143.3 
yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he can play, and play as well as he did in the second half  
of this past game, we'll be fine. ... It really just gives guys a 
chance to pick up the slack,'' Dungy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes away part of his game,'' he added, ``but I think  
he'll adjust and be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sapp said he broke a pinkie in 1997 and played ``one-handed''  
fairly well. The injury may limit some things he can do, however, 
his presence will still force opponents to account for him in game 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of that is I'm not the only guy who's rushing well  
right now,'' he said. ``We've got a whole bunch of guys who are 
playing the game the way it's supposed to be played.''

<HEADLINE> Andre Agassi Holds Benefit Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- With help from a handful of celebrity  
performers, tennis star Andre Agassi's benefit concert served up 
some good news: More than $3.9 million was raised for local youth 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an awesome time,'' Agassi said during Saturday night's  
fifth annual concert at the MGM Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The money from the concert, silent auctions and other events  
benefits the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, which was founded 
in 1994 to help at-risk Las Vegas children. Agassi donates money 
and spends time one-on-one with the children, frequently playing 
tennis with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stage for this year's concert were Sir Elton John,  
LeAnn Rimes, Luther Vandross, Gloria Estefan, Robin Williams and 
Stevie Wonder.

	Six years ago, the actress adopted a baby boy; she also has a  
16-year-old daughter.

</P>
<P>
	``A big question was, `Would I love an adopted child, who

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Announces Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Co.'s latest bid to refocus its  
operations won praise from Wall Street analysts. But they said the 
defense giant still has a ways to go to restore investor 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed announced a major restructuring Monday, including  
changes in top management and a corporate realignment. The defense 
contractor also said it plans to sell eight businesses that employ 
9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses to be sold range from Sanders, a New Hampshire  
firm that makes ``black box'' data recorders in airplanes and a 
Washington state firm that is cleaning up a nuclear reactor site. 
The businesses have combined annual revenues of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Wall Street analysts were disappointed that Lockheed,  
the No. 1 defense contractor in terms of sales, decided not to 
tackle problems in its aerospace business, which has experienced 
some costly setbacks and failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed, which had 161,000 employees and $26 billion in sales  
last year, will reorganize into four core businesses by the end of 
the year, replacing five semiautonomous sectors that often competed 
with each other, said spokesman James Fetig. The reorganization 
will result in an unspecified number of layoffs at Lockheed's 
Bethesda headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're looking at a company trying to get its arms around what  
they own following the acquisition of several dozen companies over 
the last decade,'' said Christopher H. Mecray of Deutsche Bank 
Alex. Brown. ``This is one of the steps they're taking to flatten 
out a structure that has kind of gotten out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changes were also announced at the top. Robert J. Stevens, vice  
president of corporate strategic development, will take over as 
chief financial officer, replacing Philip J. Duke, who is leaving 
the post after less than a year. Duke was named to an executive 
vice president post in a new division responsible for improving the 
company's efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed said the actions would not affect the earnings outlook  
for 1999 and 2000. Sale of the eight businesses is expected to 
offset the anticipated $1 billion in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's reorganization effort, in the works since June, comes  
in the hopes of restoring sagging profits and investor confidence. 
The company reported a second-quarter loss in July of $41 million, 
due in part to launch failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, however, said the company's reorganization did  
not go far enough to stem the company's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line to our investors is it won't hurt, it might  
help a little, but it's not the solution to poor earnings 
performance,'' said Joseph Campbell of Lehman Brothers. ``While 
this was a major strategic review, a major strategic review isn't 
what's going to make the market go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors attracted to Lockheed's stable, modestly growing  
defense business don't like the risky space business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin suffered four launch failures between August  
1998 and last April. More than $2 billion in military and private 
satellites were either destroyed or placed in useless orbits. An 
independent review blamed cost-cutting, lack of quality control and 
the loss of experienced personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Boeing beat out Lockheed for a $4.5 billion  
government spy satellite contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Nisbet of JSA Research, Inc. said he was not yet  
recommending Lockheed as a buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed has ``pretty much denigrated the confidence that  
investors have had in the past and it's not going to be easily 
restored,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies targeted for sale include Sanders in Nashua and  
Manchester, N.H.; Infrared Imaging Systems in Lexington, Mass.; 
Fairchild Systems in Syosset and Yonkers, N.Y.; Control Systems in 
Johnson City, N.Y. and Ft. Wayne, Ind.; Hanford Corp. of Richland, 
Wash.; Retech of Ukiah, Calif.; and the Energy Technologies unit 
based in Bethesda. Lockheed will also dispose of the space 
electronics product line in Manassas, Va.

<HEADLINE> Senate Debates Education Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Priming for yearend budget battles, Senate  
Republicans and Democrats spent Monday in a highly partisan debate 
over the course and funding of national education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, using their majority, prevailed in pushing through  
a nonbinding resolution commending the GOP-led Congress for 
reforming the education system by giving states, local schools and 
parents more flexibility and authority over their children's 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	It passed on a party-line 51-42 vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Immediately afterward, a Democratic resolution condemning  
Republican budget writers for cutting educational funding and 
stating that more money should be spent to hire and train new 
teachers went down, 52-41. A lone Democrat voted with the 
Republicans, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats claim that the Republicans cut education funding to an  
unacceptable level while struggling to come up with a budget for 
the fiscal year 2000 that meets strict spending ceilings set in the 
1997 balanced budget law. 
</P>
<P>
	The original GOP budget proposal for fiscal 2000, which begins  
Friday, reduced education by 17 percent from 1999 levels. The House 
Appropriations subcommittee responsible for that bill last week 
agreed on a plan that would reduce education by only 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said President Clinton is seeking  
a 3 percent increase in education. ``It's wrong to cut education at 
all,'' Kennedy said. ``We should be investing more in education, 
not less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said Republicans believe the  
president's education spending initiatives only impose more federal 
mandates on how schools can spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans' view is that local schools and parents know  
best what programs will improve student performance,'' Gregg said. 
``Rather than tying their hands with federal mandates, Republicans 
believe that local schools should have the flexibility to use 
federal dollars to meet local needs.''

<HEADLINE> IOC To Check Atlanta Games Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee intends to  
investigate possible improprieties by its members during Atlanta's 
successful bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's new ethics commission, set up after the Salt Lake City  
bribery scandal, said Monday it would study the report on the 
Atlanta bid submitted to Congress by former Attorney General 
Griffin Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The report detailed lavish gifts, travel, college scholarships,  
job assistance and other perks offered to IOC members and their 
families by the Atlanta bid team. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the report was sent last week to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch after he asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to 
provide details on any abuses related to the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the report showed there was a  
``culture of corruption'' in the bid process and that ``clearly, 
votes were for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in connection  
with the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC members and their relatives received 
$1.2 million worth of cash payments, college scholarships and other 
inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the chairman of the  
eight-man ethics panel, IOC vice president Keba Mbaye, a former 
vice president of the World Court at The Hague, would examine the 
Atlanta report. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mbaye finds ``anything meaningful,'' he will submit the  
information to the full commission for review, Servan-Schreiber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows the IOC is serious about reforms and the ethical  
practice of its members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IOC received a letter from Upton last  
Friday requesting Samaranch to testify at a House hearing on the 
Atlanta bid excesses Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The House commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation  
has threatened to subpoena Samaranch if he declines to appear 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at a Senate hearing in April  
prompted by the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said Samaranch was traveling and had not yet  
replied to Upton. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the ethics panel dropped its inquiry into the conduct  
of Finnish IOC member Peter Tallberg related to Sydney's winning 
bid for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallberg, who denied any wrongdoing, had been under scrutiny for  
allegedly asking a Sydney bid official for help in getting his son 
a temporary job in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said the panel dropped the case on grounds that the  
Sydney official was a long-time friend of Tallberg's and the 
request was unrelated to the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel asked for more information on the only other  
pending case against an IOC member. The member, who has not been 
identified, was accused of making sexual advances toward a member 
of Cape Town's unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission, which also finalized its procedural rules  
Monday, is composed of three IOC members and five from outside the 
IOC. The outside members include former U.S. Senate Republican 
leader Howard Baker and former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez 
de Cuellar.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Coach Upbeat Despite 17-0 Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Though he now heads a South Carolina team  
with the nation's longest losing streak among major colleges, coach 
Lou Holtz's well-known enthusiasm was firing on all cylinders 
Monday as he reviewed the Gamecocks' 17-0 loss to Mississippi 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	His take on the Gamecocks, who now have 14 consecutive losses:  
The defense is playing great, the offensive line is getting better 
and they are oh-so-close to breaking out of their scoring slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would really be hard on me if I didn't see some  
brightness,'' Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the face of it, he's looking into darkness.  
</P>
<P>
	The 0-4 Gamecocks failed on fourth-and-a-foot at the goal line  
Saturday. They had two tipped balls intercepted, one a crushing 
52-yard TD return by Mississippi State's Ashley Cooper. Holtz calls 
his kicking game ``absolutely disastrous.'' South Carolina 
quarterback Phil Petty left with a knee injury that could keep out 
of this week's game against Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the chicken curse,'' the coach said of the  
hex that fans think has haunted the Gamecocks for generations. 
``But I'm starting to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team had a productive prayer meeting on Sunday, where  
players identified problems and vowed to improve before the next 
game with Mississippi, Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the team would have caved in, tight end Trey  
Pennington said. But these Gamecocks are angered, not cowed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to us, it's embarrassing,'' he said. ``It's not  
something you ever want to be a part of, and it's disappointing to 
be a part of. But it's not something I sit here and dwell on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz hasn't lost this much since he got into head coaching at  
William &AMP; Mary. The Tribe lost seven straight, four at the end of 
his first season in 1969 and three more the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	He never started a season 0-4 and had not lost that many in a  
row anywhere in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina keeps extending its school record for consecutive  
losses. It once went 15 games without winning in 1963 and 1964, but 
that included three ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Even worse, the Gamecocks have five bowl teams and archrival  
Clemson left this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to stay positive, no matter what the circumstances  
are,'' Pennington said. ``If you think negative, it will only get 
worse.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Molds Ariz Line in Mean Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- He was the epitome of toughness, the fierce  
anchor of Pittsburgh's ``Steel Curtain'' defense and part of one of 
the most memorable television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, ``Mean Joe'' Greene is just Joe Greene, defensive line  
coach of the Arizona Cardinals, who played San Francisco on Monday 
night. He gets as much satisfaction watching his players succeed as 
he did wreaking havoc with offenses while helping the Steelers win 
four Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' he said. ``I want them to be good. I want us to  
win because I understand the thrill of victory. Back then, that's 
why I played, and I like to think that's why they play today -- the 
thrill of victory, the thrill of the hunt. That's the charge. 
That's why so many people watch the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene brings the same intensity to coaching that he brought  
every day to the field as one of the most intimidating players ever 
to take the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe loves this game, and he loves watching young guys  
improve,'' defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in his 13th season as an NFL assistant, and most NFL fans  
probably aren't even aware of what he's doing these days. But the 
players who work with him appreciate the Hall of Famer's approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's tough. He's passionate. I think he still plays through  
us,'' defensive end Andre Wadsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Greene speaks, the players know he's been there and  
outplayed every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each day, he has the same fire,'' defensive end Simeon Rice  
said. ``And I think he builds on his persona, as a legend, as a 
great player, and that filters down to make him a great coach. 
Every day he shows he has the energy and fire. The soul of the man 
filters over to us. We gravitate to him, and we take a little bit 
of it to the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Noll offered Greene the job of defensive line coach for  
Pittsburgh in 1987, but Greene wasn't sure he wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I asked a lot of people that I knew and respected, and I  
prayed about it,'' he said. ``After praying about it, it became 
crystal clear. Go do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After five years with the Steelers, he was on the staff of Don  
Shula in Miami for four seasons. In 1996, he joined Vince Tobin to 
begin the formidable task of making the Cardinals a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive line Greene has molded is potentially one of the  
NFL's best, especially if two-time Pro Bowl performer Eric Swann 
comes back strong from knee surgery. Greene worked extensively with 
seventh-round draft pick Mark Smith to make him a strong NFL 
tackle, and Greene was livid when Smith skipped minicamp this 
summer, then held out before finally rejoining the team last week. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Wadsworth and Rice, Greene has two defensive ends blessed  
with speed and talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he doesn't understand the perception that great  
players don't make good coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard that when I was playing, that guys who played never  
had the wherewithal and patience to coach,'' he said. ``I never 
thought that was true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he has no desire to be a head coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``That bug hasn't bit me,'' he said. ``Maybe it was the way I  
grew up, but that's not something that motivates me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But with a player like Greene, the past is never forgotten.  
</P>
<P>
	Last June, he was on hand when Coca-Cola celebrated the 20th  
anniversary of the television commercial when the big, menacing, 
exhausted football player accepted a Coke from a little boy, 
chugged it down, then as he walked away, he turned and tossed the 
boy his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks, Mean Joe,'' the boy said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still in New York. He's 30 years old now,'' Greene said.  
</P>
<P>
	Greene seems a bit awed the commercial is so well remembered  
after two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was the emotion brought about by the contrast of a  
huge, big, black football player and a young, tiny little white 
kid,'' Greene said. ``We came together and created a little bit of 
magic for a short period of time, and people seemed to like it, 
even to this day.''

<HEADLINE> Hatch Ran for Presidency Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For those who doubt Sen. Orrin Hatch's  
prospects of winning the presidency, consider this: he has run for 
the office before -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hatch Wins Presidency,'' blared the headline of the Baldwin  
High School newspaper, in its May 29, 1951 editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh high school's senior class had voted for  
president of the United States in a mock election. Forty-eight 
years later, the young man who won that day is chasing the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't surprise me,'' Joyce Strong, Hatch's classmate, said  
in a telephone interview from her home in Pittsburgh. ``He always 
talked about it at reunions. Always said he was thinking about 
running for real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah senator's odds of winning the 2000 presidential race  
are formidable. The last to enter the Republican race, he announced 
his candidacy a day after Texas Gov. George W. Bush declared he had 
raised a record-breaking $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch had collected nothing. But he had accumulated 23 years of  
experience negotiating Washington's roiling political waters from a 
prominent perch among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at Baldwin, Hatch won the office on the second round of  
balloting because the student who acquired the most votes the first 
time around failed to get the 66 percent required by the rules. Now 
a candidate for the GOP nomination, Hatch is hoping for the same 
kind of victory-by-default, should Bush stumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Utah, Hatch's parents Jesse and Helen moved the family  
to a farm in Pittsburgh, where they raised chickens and grapes. 
Hatch says he enjoyed taking care of the chickens, but often got in 
trouble for blowing off his ``hated'' assignment, to hoe the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hatch household, he said, was anchored in faith, hard work  
and fun -- basketball and softball were favorites of the senator and 
Jesse, the older brother he worshipped, recalls neighbor Nick 
Obringer, 77, who still lives in a Pittsburgh-area house adjacent 
to the former Hatch property. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was shattered by Jesse's death during World War II.  
``It just about killed us,'' Hatch says now. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mormon, Hatch says he relies on his faith and prays morning,  
noon, night and sometimes in between. ``I address my father in 
heaven and thank him for all the things he has done and ask him for 
the things that I need,'' Hatch said. ``He doesn't answer me too 
often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes that among other things, his candidacy will educate  
voters about Mormonism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people who are prejudiced against Mormons,  
because they don't believe that Mormons are Christians,'' Hatch 
says. ``Part of that is generated by people who are bigots; you 
know, I can't do much about bigotry, but I can do a lot about 
people who are misinformed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He met Elaine, his wife of 42 years, in an astronomy class at  
Brigham Young University. After the couple graduated and moved back 
to Pittsburgh, Hatch worked as a janitor and girls dormitory sentry 
on the side. A full scholarship sent him to law school at the 
University of Pittsburgh. In private practice years later, he 
fought government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the Senate in 1976, in his first bid for  
public office, and set up a home in Vienna, Va., where he and his 
wife raised six children, now aged 29 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential campaign will cost Hatch significant time away  
from his family and his home, from where he drives his own Lincoln 
Town Car to the Capitol. Time doing his favorite things -- golfing, 
songwriting and doting on his 19 grandchildren -- also is likely to 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott recently criticized Hatch  
publicly for embarking on such a time-consuming endeavor as a 
presidential campaign even with the demands of his chairmanship of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But from Hatch's perspective, this is his year for the  
presidency. Last time around, he stepped aside for former Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole. ``I didn't think Bob would get it, but I 
thought he deserved to take his shot,'' Hatch says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the single most experienced person in the race,'' he said.  
``Most people know that I haven't ever become part of this city, 
that I've taken it on; and by that I mean taken on the liberal bent 
of this community for all 23 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the lanky, stern senator is perhaps best known outside  
the Beltway for his starring roles in some of Congress' darkest 
dramas, from the hearings on Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court 
nomination to President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the senator who read aloud from ``The Exorcist'' during  
the Thomas hearings, suggesting that Anita Hill may have lifted 
details of her allegations of sexual harassment from the book. And 
he predicted that the Senate might go easier on Clinton if the 
president came clean about the relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
Hatch called the president ``a jerk'' when Clinton did otherwise 
during a televised address to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Capitol Hill, Hatch also is notable for his playful  
personality and for striking up strong friendships with political 
enemies -- a practice he believes is too rare in the political world 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
	His career in Congress is peppered, for example, with ferocious  
fights on social issues with Sen. Ted Kennedy, the liberal 
Democratic icon from Massachusetts. But their relationship is 
equally marked by gestures of support for one another during 
personal crises. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the William Kennedy Smith rape trial, Hatch  
told Kennedy, Smith's uncle, to ``stop acting like a teen-ager,'' 
quit drinking and get married. Kennedy did. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy in return cheered Hatch up when the Utah senator's name  
was linked with the BCCI scandal, in which Hatch was accused of 
violating rules or law in contact between his office and the Bank 
of Credit and Commerce International. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before an ethics probe cleared him of wrongdoing, Kennedy  
``called me up and said, 'We all know you didn't do anything 
wrong,''' Hatch remembers. ``That meant a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, when Kennedy chafes Hatch on policy, the senator from  
Utah threatens to ``get him in trouble with his sisters,'' to whom 
he has grown close from collaborating on the Special Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's wardrobe hints at his playfulness. He is famous in  
Congress, for example, for pairing loud neckties with shirts that 
may or may not match, and wearing them under otherwise conservative 
suits. Hatch's favorites, he says, range from the occasional bolo 
to ties emblazoned with the logo of the Utah Jazz basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	He often bestows his fashion sense on others. During a recent  
interview, Hatch declared a photographer's necktie ``pathetic,'' 
disappeared into a closet next to his desk and emerged offering a 
less-subtle replacement given him by former heavyweight champion 
Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has a songwriting career on the side that has attracted  
attention from at least one icon of the music industry. He is 
practically a Pip - now that Gladys Knight has recorded two of his 
songs. Proceeds go to production costs and loans for his recording 
company, spokesman Paul Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the doubts and jokes his presidential bid inspires, Hatch  
scoffs. He points out that voters sent him to the Senate in his 
first bid for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one gave me a chance then, either,'' Hatch says.

<HEADLINE> Army Offers $6,000 Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is offering $6,000 to men and women  
who join up before Friday -- on top of other bonuses and 
scholarships -- as the U.S. military ends its most difficult 
recruiting year since the post-Vietnam 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army is about 6,300 recruits short. The Air Force, too,  
expects to fall short, by about 1,700, of the enlistees needed to 
maintain current levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy expects to meet its needs after a big shortfall last  
year, but only after accepting more personnel who failed to finish 
high school and stepping up recruitment and bonus programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Marine recruiters, with flashy TV spots on shows featuring  
extreme sports, says their hard-line approach has quite 
successfully maintained ``product appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we know a kid really wants to be a Marine, then we can  
talk about college and everything else that's important,'' said 
Master Sgt. Richard Ecker, Marine recruitment spokesman in 
Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The other services are struggling, however, in a time of  
increased job opportunities outside the military, post-baby-boom 
reductions in military-age populations, and record college 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrinking the military services also has resulted in shrinking  
interest among young Americans in joining the 1.4 million-member 
all-volunteer forces. Close to 200,000 recruits are needed each 
year to maintain force levels set by Congress and military 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all relates to fewer dinner-table conversations about  
joining the military,'' said Master Sgt. Tom Clements, Air Force 
recruitment spokesman in San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It's made recruiting one of the military's toughest jobs,  
``comparable to sea duty,'' said Navy recruitment spokesman Cmdr. 
Steve Lowry in Millington, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Final recruitment figures for the fiscal year ending Thursday  
will not be out until next month, but officials of all four 
branches have been counting heads daily and know where they stand. 
</P>
<P>
	With new incentives and hundreds of new, younger recruiters,  
both the Army and Air Force have managed to boost recruitment in 
the year's final weeks. The Army, which at one time was projecting 
a shortfall of 8,000 recruits, still expects to miss its needs by 
the biggest number since 1979 when the force was much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is ahead of this month's goal but will end the  
year short, recruiters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, short by 6,900 last year, is within 100 of its goal  
for this year, and with three days to go expects to meet the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Marines would meet their goal was never in doubt.  
</P>
<P>
	The Army's final incentive, available since Aug. 17, is a $6,000  
recruitment bonus on top of up to $12,000 in bonuses and $50,000 in 
scholarships, depending on the recruit's chosen field and length of 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	It's almost too late to get the year-end bonus, because a  
recruit must report for training by Thursday to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the person came in with a birth certificate and a high  
school diploma, we might make it,'' Army recruitment spokesman Doug 
Smith in Fort Knox, Ky., said Monday. ``You'd practically have to 
have your toothbrush with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Army and Navy have added younger recruiters, closer to  
the age of the people they are trying to attract. And the Army has 
sent out more than 2,000 newly enlisted soldiers to talk to young 
people about ``what joining the Army has done for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The military generally accepts men and women from 18 to 34,  
depending on the job, and 17-year-olds are allowed with a parent's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy recruiter Lt. Steve Zip said factors contributing to the  
Navy's ability to overcome last year's shortfall include a variety 
of education and other incentives and the addition of 100 new 
recruiting stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has refused to lower its requirement that 99  
percent of recruits have high school degrees, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very technical force. Air Force needs are such that  
we have to retain our standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Air Force, too, has significantly increased incentives.  
One hundred of its 150 career fields now qualify for bonuses of up 
to $12,000, compared with just a dozen last year. To get the full 
bonus, an enlistee would have to choose training for combat or 
rescue fields and sign up for six years.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Underwood wound self-inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The neck wound that left Dimitrius  
Underwood of the Miami Dolphins bleeding on a downtown street was 
self-inflicted, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the player Sunday afternoon after getting calls  
that a man was yelling for help. He was covered with blood as 
officers approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Underwood apparently slashed his neck with a knife at  
the home of the mother of his twin children. No one in the home saw 
him cut himself, but several people in the neighborhood saw him 
running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Police took Underwood to Sparrow Hospital, where he was listed  
today in fair condition after undergoing surgery Sunday. No further 
information was released at the request of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real rough for the family,'' Hall said. ``They're  
going through a real rough time, like any family would at a time 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood had 
written a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood cooperated with police when they found him around  
12:45 p.m. Sunday and has spoken with police since, Hall said. He 
declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his actions, 
but said police are close to completing their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were expected to hold a news conference this  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings made Underwood their second first-round  
draft pick, and 29th overall, in April even though the defensive 
lineman had missed his senior season at Michigan State with a 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1 but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood explained his departure by saying he was torn between  
a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to support his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. He was claimed on waivers by  
Miami after 23 other teams passed on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings. He's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during preseason and was  
expected to begin working out again this week. The Dolphins did not 
play Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Is Busy Year for Executioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With three months remaining, 1999 already is  
the deadliest year on America's death row in almost half a century. 
Eighteen states have executed 76 killers, and the total could reach 
100 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been this stairway upward since the death penalty  
was reinstituted'' in 1976, said Richard Dieter of the Death 
Penalty Information Center, a group critical of how capital 
punishment is administered. ``It hasn't peaked yet: ... 150 is 
probably where things may max out over the next three to four 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executions last Friday in Delaware and North Carolina raised the  
year's total to 76, the most since 1954, when 81 people were put to 
death in U.S. prisons. If the year-end toll reaches 100, as Dieter 
said could happen, it would be the first time since 105 people were 
executed in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 68 executions last year, 74 in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	States have executed 576 convicted killers since the Supreme  
Court ended in 1976 a four-year nationwide ban on capital 
punishment. Currently, about 3,565 people are on death rows across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries have abolished the death penalty, including  
Canada, Australia, France and Germany. Amnesty International said 
it received reports of 1,067 executions in China in 1998, more than 
100 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 66 in Iran. The 
organization said it also has unconfirmed reports of hundreds of 
executions in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 38 American states with death penalty laws have  
imposed capital punishment this year, and once again Texas is first 
with 25 executions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What sometimes people lose sight of is that prosecutors don't  
give the death penalty -- it takes a unanimous 12 folks (on a jury) 
to do it,'' said John B. Holmes Jr., district attorney in Harris 
County, Texas, which includes Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes' office seeks a death sentence in 12 to 20 cases a year  
and almost always succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good sense for knowing whether it's a death-worthy  
prosecution,'' he said. ``We don't seek it callously or 
inadvisedly. ... These people we're seeking death on generally have 
awful records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia has tallied the second-largest number of executions  
this year at 11, followed by nine in Missouri and six in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1930 and 1967, U.S. prisons carried out 3,859 executions  
-- an annual average of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	After capital punishment resumed in 1977 with Gary Gilmore's  
execution by a Utah firing squad, the number of executions rose 
slowly as many inmates filed multiple appeals to avoid the death 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Congress and the Supreme Court have sought to  
speed up the federal court appeal process by limiting the number of 
appeals inmates can file. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people sentenced to death across the country  
averaged about 300 a year from 1986 through 1996, then dipped to 
256 in 1997. If that is the beginning of a trend toward fewer death 
sentences, Dieter said, the number of executions eventually could 
start heading down as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight states with death penalty laws have carried out no  
executions since 1977: Connecticut, Kansas, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> McCain Launches White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- War hero and senator, John McCain officially  
opened his Republican presidential campaign Monday by declaring 
himself the best candidate to command U.S. troops and reform a 
political system that is ``a spectacle of selfish ambition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an address that invoked the patriotic spirits of his father  
and grandfather -- ``I was born into America's service'' -- McCain 
blended the outlines of a presidential agenda with subtle digs at 
President Clinton, his Republican presidential rivals and the GOP 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is because I owe America more than she has ever owed me  
that I am a candidate for president of the United States,'' the 
Arizona senator and former prisoner of war told a crowd of 500. 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged to protect Social Security, cut taxes, veto  
pork-barrel spending, improve access to the Internet and test the 
merits of spending government money in private schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	His signature issues -- decreasing the influence of money in  
politics and beefing up the U.S. military -- are part of what he 
called ``a new patriotic challenge'' for the nation. Americans, he 
said, must take up causes ``greater than self-interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has been running for president since December 1998. The  
formal announcement, originally scheduled for the spring but 
delayed because of the Kosovo conflict, was designed to bring 
attention to his underdog bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time after McCain's announcement, former Vice President  
Dan Quayle said he was abandoning his bid for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Navy pilot shot down on his 23rd mission over Vietnam  
in 1967, McCain started his day in the U.S. Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Md. A poor student and troublemaker, McCain barely 
graduated from the academy, but later distinguished himself during 
5 1/2 years in a Vietnam prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the son and grandson of Navy admirals, and I was born  
into America's service,'' he said, reading from a TelePrompTer in a 
dry but well-received speech. ``It wasn't until I was deprived of 
her company that I fell in love with America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign team believes that McCain's biography is his  
greatest asset in a field of candidates with less-compelling life 
stories. McCain made subtle comparisons of his own, criticizing 
political rivals in both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, he said, broke a promise to protect Social  
Security and weakened the U.S. military. By promising to ``respect 
the dignity of the office,'' McCain suggested that Clinton has not. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress waste money  
on unneeded weapons systems while 12,000 military personnel 
``subsist on food stamps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He attacked isolationists, saying ``walls are for cowards'' -- a  
reference to GOP presidential foe Pat Buchanan, who is considering 
bolting to the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the next commander-in-chief needs ``broad and deep  
experience,'' a clear reference to GOP front-runner George W. 
Bush's lack of foreign policy credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a two-term Texas governor who served stateside in the  
Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, has made no secret 
of his need to bone up on foreign policy and rely on advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time when our nation's leader can no longer rely  
on briefing books and talking points when the experts and the 
advisers have all weighed in, when the sum total of one's life 
becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions 
that determine the future of our democracy,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though McCain has closed the gap in New Hampshire, Bush holds a  
healthy lead over all GOP rivals in polling and fund-raising. The 
Arizona senator has gained traction in recent weeks with the 
publication of a family memoir. 
</P>
<P>
	An unorthodox politician by nature, McCain is likely to take the  
unusual step of skipping Iowa's caucuses and focusing on the early 
New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. New Hampshire is loaded 
with independent-minded voters who might like the underdog McCain 
and South Carolina has a huge population of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the departure of Quayle from the race Monday may  
increase pressure on McCain to compete in Iowa. It was Quayle who 
first wondered out loud whether Bush could handle foreign policy 
without ``briefing books'' and more experience. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's efforts to reform campaign finance laws have failed  
repeatedly and are being debated again in Washington this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	'' We can continue to tolerate a government that has become  
little more than a spectacle of selfish ambition, a government 
auctioned to the highest bidder,'' he said. ``Or we can take 
stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic voter Hoyt Nelson was part of the large crowd that  
turned out for the lunchtime address in a small park. ``I think a 
lot of Democrats are tired of watching elections get bought,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Antonelli, another Nashua resident, said he liked McCain's  
promise to uphold the dignity of the presidency. ``All the rest -- 
from the rest of them -- is words,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said American foreign policy must be more consistent and  
meaningful. ``We cannot hide behind empty threats, false promises, 
meaningless rhetoric, and photo op diplomacy,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong military requires smart spending, he said. ``I won't  
tolerate one dime of our defense budget being wasted'' by 
shortsighted politicians, he pledged.

<HEADLINE> Huffy To Stop U.S. Bike Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Huffy Corp. said Monday it will close its  
two bicycle plants in the United States by year's end and begin 
importing all of its bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company cited competitive pressures from Chinese-made  
bicycles, which have declined in price during the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffy has been making bicycles in the United States since 1934  
and currently imports about 70 percent of its bikes, from China, 
Taiwan and Mexico. The company holds 25 percent to 30 percent of 
the U.S. market, the largest single share. 
</P>
<P>
	It planned to continue making bicycles with partners around the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Huffy Bicycle Company remains committed to maintaining its  
leadership position in the U.S. bicycle industry,'' said Chris 
Snyder, president of the bicycle company. 
</P>
<P>
	The move eliminates the jobs of 600 workers. Huffy's plant in  
Farmington, Mo., employs 440 people, and 160 work at the plant in 
Southaven, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southaven plant makes frames, wheels and other parts that  
are shipped to Farmington, where the bicycles are assembled. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 employees in the bicycle division will remain at Huffy  
headquarters in the Dayton suburb of Miamisburg to work on design, 
marketing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmington Mayor Kevin Engler said the city of 11,600 will try  
to find another employer to move into the 426,000-square-foot plant 
and seek government help for job retraining. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are solid workers that have made a good  
product,'' he said. ``It's unfortunate that they're losing their 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said closing the plants will cut costs and complete  
the company's transformation from a single-brand manufacturer to a 
multi-brand design, marketing and distribution company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this change in sourcing is clearly aimed at  
making Huffy more competitive in hopes it will be able to build up 
share of market,'' said David Leibowitz, a Burnham Securities 
analyst who follows the bicycle industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Leibowitz said Huffy's move is a strong indication that the less  
expensive bicycles are being made overseas, leaving U.S. production 
to focus on more expensive bikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies still make bikes in the United States. For  
example, a Schwinn subsidiary produces mountain and BMX bikes in 
Santa Ana, Calif., and makes frames at various U.S. locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunswick Bicycles makes mountain and BMX bikes at a plant in  
Olney, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larry Pizzi, Brunswick's vice president of marketing, said  
prices of imported Chinese bikes has declined 30 percent a year for 
the past 2 1/2 years, forcing Brunswick to transfer some production to 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's had devastating effects on the American bicycle  
industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pizzi said Brunswick's U.S. work force has fallen from 2,500  
employees to 650. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Huffy closed its bicycle plant in Celina, putting 1,100  
employees out of work and moving production to Farmington, where it 
had begun operating in 1993. Huffy opened the plant in Southhaven 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is obviously a very tough action, a very unfortunate  
action for our employees,'' said Thomas Frederick, chief financial 
officer for Huffy. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick said the company will start marketing the Farmington  
and Southaven plants soon in hopes that another employer will 
locate there. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffy said the pre-tax cost and other charges associated with  
the plant closings are estimated at $42.4 million, or $2.64 per 
share. The company said its earnings will also be hurt by having to 
sell its inventory of more expensive, U.S.-produced bikes and 
winding down domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
	Huffy Corp. also makes lawn equipment and basketball backboards.  
It was founded in 1924 as Huffman Manufacturing Co. to make 
equipment for service stations.

<HEADLINE>  Nintendo Chief To Chair Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln was  
appointed chairman of the Seattle Mariners today, succeeding John 
Ellis, who was designated chairman emeritus and will remain on the 
club's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln has been the representative of principal owner Hiroshi  
Yamauchi, president of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan, on the Mariners' 
board of directors since the billionaire electronic-game magnate 
put up most of the money to buy the club in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Lincoln, a key figure since the current owners  
acquired the club, took over as chief executive less than three 
months after the opening of Safeco Field, an open-air ballpark with 
a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to the new park has been dogged by controversy over the  
Mariners' demand for $100 million in additional funding from King 
County to cover cost overruns for the $517 million project. Public 
officials contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by the club said home attendance this season  
was 2.9 million, second only to the 3.1 million of 1997. On a 
per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent higher at 
Safeco Field than in the club's old digs at the nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln faces the immediate challenge of finding a new general  
manager to replace Woody Woodward, who is retiring, and re-signing 
the team's top two players, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. and 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, whose contracts expire after next season. 
Both have said they will look elsewhere unless the Mariners show a 
commitment to winning by signing other key players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-78 with seven games  
left in the season, have not made the playoffs since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln previously announced plans to retire from Nintendo on  
Feb. 14, when he turns 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, the club's point man in the battle to get the stadium  
project approved in the first place and once again on the overruns, 
said in a prepared statement he decided to leave as chairman 
because it was the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to complete the Safeco Field project,'' Ellis said.  
``With that done, I am ready to hand over responsibility to Howard 
and help the Mariners in any way I can.''

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Sells Lender's for $275M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. is selling its Lender's  
Bagels business to the owner of Log Cabin syrup and Aunt Jemima 
pancake mix for $275 million -- 41 percent below what it paid for 
Lender's less than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which was expected and was announced today, is the  
latest by Kellogg to revive its sagging stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyer is Aurora Foods Inc., a diversified $1 billion food  
company based in San Francisco with brands like Duncan Hines, Log 
Cabin, Mrs. Butterworth's, Van de Kamp's, Mrs. Paul's, Chef's 
Choice, Aunt Jemima, and Celeste. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg had purchased Lender's in 1996 for $466 million. New CEO  
Carlos Gutierrez had said recently the division's future with the 
cereal-maker was questionable because it wasn't making money. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one analyst welcomed the announcement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Next to Quaker's purchase of Snapple, Kellogg's purchase of  
Lender's was one of the dumbest in the food industry in the 1990s. 
... Kellogg got into the frozen bagel business just as everyone 
else was getting into fresh bagels,'' said John McMillin, an 
analyst with Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the sale is a step in the right direction as Kellogg  
attempts to regain its financial health. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes Lender's plants in Mattoon, Ill., and West  
Seneca, N.Y., and is expected to be completed by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	For a limited period of time, Kellogg will supply Aurora with  
bagels from the Lender's plants in New Haven and West Haven, Conn. 
Kellogg is seeking to sell the Connecticut facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg announced that it expects to record a charge to earnings  
of approximately $170 million before taxes in the current quarter 
as a result of the sale. Kellogg plans to report third quarter 
results Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lender's is a strong brand, but it has not met our growth  
expectations,'' Gutierrez said in a news release today. ``This 
divestiture will enable us to focus our resources on the best 
opportunities, both internal and external, to further expand our 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aurora Foods chairman and chief executive Ian Wilson said he  
expects to grow Lender's sales through the introduction of new 
products and packaging, increased strategic marketing support and 
dedicated management focus. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also expects to realize cost savings by  
consolidating some production, as well as absorbing the sales, 
marketing and administrative functions in the frozen foods division 
of Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lender's number one market share position, strong brand equity  
and 'orphan' status within the Kellogg's organization makes this an 
ideal acquisition for Aurora,'' Wilson said in a news release. 
``Lender's is well suited to Aurora's strategy of acquiring and 
revitalizing undermarketed brands.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia To Continue Bombing Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Warplanes unleashed rockets and bombs on  
the Chechen capital today, while the Russian military pledged to 
keep bombing Chechnya until Islamic militants in the breakaway 
republic are wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets bombed Grozny for a fifth straight day, again  
targeting oil derricks and industrial targets. According to 
eyewitnesses, several oil wells were ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed today that 300 people  
had been killed in the Russian airstrikes against Grozny. The 
figure could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing is aimed at weakening Islamic militants who twice  
invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in recent 
weeks and have their main bases in Chechnya. Russia also blames the 
militants for the recent bombings of four apartment buildings in 
Moscow and other cities that killed some 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev today said the bombing of  
Chechnya would continue ``as long as the last bandit is not 
destroyed,'' according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's increasingly hard-line stance has raised fears of  
a possible ground invasion of Chechnya, despite a disastrous 
1994-96 war in which Russian troops were defeated by a much smaller 
guerrilla force. Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de 
facto independence in 1996, but Moscow still claims it is a part of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said Sunday that he could not rule out the possibility  
of launching ground operations in the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin tried to play down fears that  
there would be a repeat of the war, in which Russia often sent 
poorly trained troops into battle. Putin said Russia would rely on 
air raids to knock out infrastructure and ``patiently, methodically 
destroy (the militants) from the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no more assaults. We shall spare our men,''  
Putin said in an interview published today in the Vremya MN 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin said today that Russia was still planning for a meeting  
between President Boris Yeltsin and Maskhadov, but that it would 
take place when Yeltsin deems it appropriate. Plans for such a 
meeting to end conflict between Russia and Chechnya have fallen 
apart several times during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	After emerging from talks today with Yeltsin, Putin said that no  
meeting would take place until Maskhadov denounces terrorism in his 
republic and until Moscow is sure the militants can't use a meeting 
to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to back away from meetings for the sake of  
meetings, from meetings for the sake of giving militants time to 
lick their wounds and carry out strikes on us from another side,'' 
Putin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov, who claims his government is not connected to the  
militants, said in a televised address Sunday that he was ``ready 
for any political dialogue with the Russian leadership in order to 
save the lives of fellow countrymen,'' according to the ITAR-Tass 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen leader also said he would exert all his efforts to  
avoid full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting with the head of the Russian border service today,  
Yeltsin said the Russian border must be strengthened so that new 
weapons or militants don't enter the North Caucasus region. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Chechens continued to try to flee the bombing by  
heading west, to the republic of Ingushetia. After some 40,000 
fled, Ingushetian authorities closed the border Sunday. On the 
other side of the border, Chechen authorities set up tents for some 
of the trapped civilians and brought piles of firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	But others stayed, and about 4,000 people held a rally in  
downtown Grozny today to demand an end to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya also resumed television broadcasts today, just 24 hours  
after Russian planes bombed Grozny's television center, cutting its 
signal.

	The Roman Catholic Bishop of Baucau, East Timor's second-largest  
town, told Portuguese state radio RDP the attack took place 
Saturday on a rural road as the group was returning from Los Palos, 
18 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately we have received confirmation today that they  
were killed and thrown into a stream,'' Bishop Basilio do 
Nascimento said. He said nine people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead also included two seminarians, the local head of the  
Catholic church relief agency Caritas, two volunteers, the 
vehicle's driver and an Indonesian journalist working for a 
Japanese news organization, the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian missionary news service MISNA and the Vatican's  
missionary arm, Fides, both reported that pro-Indonesian militiamen 
carried out the attack. The reports were based on sources in East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	MISNA said as many as 16 people died.  
</P>
<P>
	It identified the dead nuns as Italian Sister Erminia Cazzaniga,  
69, and East Timorese Sister Celeste de Carvalho Pinto, 48. The 
other victims' names were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Fides said do Nascimento would conduct a funeral for the group  
on Tuesday in Baucau. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of people have been killed and  
hundreds of thousands have fled their homes in the violence that 
has swept through mostly Roman Catholic East Timor since it voted 
overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia in a U.N.-monitored 
ballot last month. Indonesian army-backed militiamen have been 
behind most of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Do Nascimento urged the multinational peace force stationed in  
East Timor to deploy units to rural areas as quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Tank Explosion Said Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Radioactive waste has risen like bread  
dough in a million-gallon storage tank at the Hanford nuclear 
reservation, provoking concerns about a possible explosion or 
environmental contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers at the Department of Energy site near Richland,  
less than 10 miles from the Columbia River in south-central 
Washington, say both scenarios are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chance of explosion is very low,'' said Rick Raymond, the  
project manager for the contractor, Lockheed Martin Hanford. Still, 
``any time you have a situation where you're trapping gas faster 
than releasing it, it's an unacceptable situation and needs to be 
dealt with in an urgent manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The radioactive waste in Tank SY-101 is a byproduct of the  
process used to extract plutonium from uranium irradiated at 
Hanford's now-defunct nuclear reactors. The tank contains cesium 
and decaying organic materials that generate hydrogen, nitrogen, 
nitrous oxide and ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The tank became notorious in the late 1980s and early '90s as  
Hanford's ``burping'' tank because it released thousands of cubic 
feet of gas every three months or so. If an ignition source had 
been present, the flammable gases could have exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	A mixer pump installed in 1993 took care of the problem by  
allowing the continuous escape of small amounts of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also created a new problem no one expected -- without the  
periodic releases of huge amounts of gas, bubbles began to build up 
in the meringue-like crust floating in the liquid waste. 
</P>
<P>
	The crust began to thicken and grow. It is now about 10 feet  
thick in a tank just over 38 feet tall. The top of the crust is 26 
inches from the top of the tank, although it was 2 inches higher in 
May, when Hanford managers began releasing gas at the same rate it 
is produced. 
</P>
<P>
	While the possibility exists that the waste could spill over and  
breach the tank, the 5/8-inch-thick steel welds on the double-shell 
tank should prevent that from happening, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in late October or early November, Lockheed Martin  
Hanford will begin pumping out Tank SY-101, diluting 300,000 
gallons of the radioactive brew as it is transferred to another 
tank, and then diluting the 700,000 gallons still in SY-101 with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be a permanent fix, said Craig Groendyke, manager  
for the SY-101 project for the Energy Department's Office of River 
Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanford was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project  
to build the atomic bomb. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was 
produced at the site until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The site has 54 million gallons of radioactive waste stored in  
149 aging single-shell tanks, 67 of which have leaked. Newer tanks, 
such as SY-101, have two shells, and none have leaked.

<HEADLINE> East Carolina Blows Into Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	East Carolina spent last week away from home because of problems  
caused by Hurricane Floyd. The Pirates will spend this week in the 
Top 25 after beating the Miami Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in Raleigh, N.C., 80 miles west of its campus  
Greenville, East Carolina (4-0) upset Miami 27-23 on Saturday and 
moved into The Associated Press' Top 25 college football poll at 
No. 19. The Pirates' last Top 25 appearance was 1991, when they 
finished No. 9 in the final poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The top eight teams, led by No. 1 Florida State, No. 2 Penn  
State and No. 3 Florida, remained the same while six new teams 
joined the poll after a Saturday of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan, a 21-16 winner over Wisconsin, was No. 4, followed by  
No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M, No. 6 Nebraska, No. 7 Tennessee, No. 8 Virginia 
Tech, No. 9 Georgia Tech and No. 10 Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles, after a 42-10 win over North Carolina, received  
61 first-place votes and 1,740 points on Sunday from the 70 sports 
writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State, a 45-24 winner over Indiana, had five first-place  
votes and 1,659 points. Florida, which beat Kentucky 38-10, 
collected three first-place votes and 1,623 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight Top 25 teams lost on Saturday, and just two -- Miami and  
Arkansas -- remained in the ratings. Miami fell from No. 9 to No. 
18, while Arkansas dropped six places to No. 20 after a 35-28 loss 
to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Ohio State, No. 13 Kansas  
State, No. 14 Michigan State, No. 15 Texas, No. 16 Mississippi 
State, No. 17 Marshall, No. 18 Miami, No. 19 East Carolina and No. 
20 Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama moved back in at No. 21, followed by No. 22 Syracuse,  
No. 23 Oklahoma, No. 24 Virginia and No. 25 Oregon, the only Pac-10 
team in the rankings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The other new teams in this week's poll are Alabama, Syracuse,  
Oklahoma, Virginia and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Leonard Gives TV Its Biggest Moment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Justin Leonard was scorned on television  
but ended up providing one of its greatest moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard, who struggled over the first two days of the Ryder Cup,  
made a 45-foot, uphill putt Sunday that turned out to be the 
decisive stroke for the U.S. team, one cheered riotously on the 
course and in homes across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the ball was just destined to go in,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Leonard had looked early on in the competition with Europe as if  
he were destined to go home with nothing. And veteran announcer and 
two-time Ryder Cup player Johnny Miller had suggested on national 
television that Leonard might think about doing just that, heading 
for Dallas to watch the Ryder Cup on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it was good that I wasn't at home watching it on TV,''  
Leonard said after his glorious putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller later said he simply calls things the way he sees them  
and saluted Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	So did thousands who lined the fairway on No. 17 at The Country  
Club and leaned over the top of the bleachers behind the 16th tee. 
And so did several players and wives who rushed to embrace him, a 
loss of control that caused some embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	That reaction was sharply criticized by the European side, for  
Jose Maria Olazabal still had a chance to halve the hole. He 
eventually missed the putt from 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard apologized for running off the green after he made the  
putt and triggering the mini-stampede. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a difficult moment to hold oneself in check. The heavily  
favored Americans were trounced the first two days and were on the 
verge of pulling a comeback few expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as almost no one had expected Leonard to make his putt, not  
even Leonard himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if I could make it,'' he said. ``I was trying to  
make it, but I was also trying to get the ball close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard drew inspiration for his own comeback from his  
teammates, especially Hal Sutton, and also Davis Love, who joined 
him on the 10th hole. The Americans were leading but needed a key 
half point from Leonard. He would lose the 10th to go 4-down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about kicking Davis out,'' Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he soon won five of six holes, with the putt on 17 that put  
him 1-up, assuring the half point he eventually won. 
</P>
<P>
	``You win one or two holes in a row, momentum -- the momentum  
shifts,'' Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed for him and the rest of the U.S. team it shifted to cap  
the biggest comeback in Ryder Cup history.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Utility Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Northeast Utilities and a subsidiary  
pleaded guilty today to multiple violations of federal nuclear 
safety and clean water laws, agreeing to pay $10 million in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility and its subdivision, Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.,  
agreed to pay $6.65 million in fines and make $3.35 million in 
donations, including $1 million to the University of Connecticut 
for a chair in ethics and $1 million for the state's open space 
preservation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Northeast Nuclear's half share of the total  
penalty was the biggest in the history of the commercial nuclear 
power industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 violations of the Atomic Energy Act and six violations of  
the Clean Water Act happened from 1994 to 1996 at the Millstone 
nuclear power plant near Waterford and at the Devon Generating 
Station in Milford. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe the acts were deliberate, U.S. Attorney  
Stephen C. Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't go forth in a case of this magnitude if it was  
simply nothing more than an inadvertent mistake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities Chairman Michael Morris appeared in federal  
court to acknowledge the wrongdoing by subsidiary Northeast Nuclear 
Energy Co., the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We failed to live up to what was required of us as a  
responsible corporate citizen and as a leader in our community,'' 
he said. ``Today we are paying a very steep price for that 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Utilities serves 1.7 million people in Connecticut,  
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear violations involved the submission of inaccurate  
training data on nuclear reactor operator license applications, the 
company said. The discrepancies were discovered in 1996 and 1997, 
and resulted in major changes in the training system at Millstone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clean Water Act violations involved a water quality sampling  
point which was moved without permission, the improper emission of 
a chemical into Long Island Sound and erroneous data from water 
testing at Devon. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the violations had prompted it to crack down on  
its staff and stricter compliance with government standards. NU has 
hired Daniel Esty, director of the Yale University Center for 
Environmental Law and Policy, as an outside adviser.

<P>
	LYDENBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A bus carrying British tourists  
overturned when its brakes apparently failed on a steep hill 
Monday, killing at least 26 people and injuring 11, police said.

	The bus was heading into this provincial town 135 miles east of  
Johannesburg when it overturned, said Lydenburg police Inspector 
Gerrit Smit. He said the victims apparently were all British 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first officers on the scene spoke to a person  
identifying himself as the driver, who said the brakes on the bus 
failed, Smit said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth major crash in South Africa in less than two  
weeks, Transport Ministry spokesman Mike Mabasa said. The 
government plans to meet with bus companies to try to find ways to 
make travel safer.

<HEADLINE> Report Accuses Prison Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHINO, Calif. (AP) -- Guards at the state's largest prison for  
young offenders locked inmates in excrement-smeared cells and 
forced some to battle rival gang members, a state report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report from the office of the inspector general said inmates  
were also improperly drugged and slammed into walls at Heman G. 
Stark Youth Correctional Facility, the Los Angeles Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility, at Chino some 40 miles east of Los Angeles, houses  
1,400 inmates between 18 and 25 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's office issued the report after a  
six-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards allegedly tested how some inmates would fare inside the  
prison's general population by setting them up to fight other 
inmates and rival gang members in what guards called the ``Friday 
night fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guards released inmates from handcuffs and sat them next to  
other offenders, who were often rivals, the report said. The 
encounters became brawls one out of four times, it said. At least 
one inmate was temporarily paralyzed and others suffered serious 
bruises and cuts from the abuse, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates complained about the treatment, but their grievances  
often were ignored, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Friday to the administration's Cabinet-level  
secretary for corrections, Gov. Gray Davis said the investigation 
``has yielded very serious findings that place the safety of both 
wards and staff at risk.'' He ordered an overhaul of the system and 
immediately prohibited the ``Friday night fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The facility's acting chief deputy director, Steve Chatten, was  
suspended in May. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a month that the state Youth  
Authority has fallen under scrutiny. On Aug. 16, state officials 
said Stanford University tests of a psychiatric drug on 61 teen-age 
inmates may have violated a state law banning medical research on 
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Philanthropist Oseola McCarty Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) -- Oseola McCarty, a washerwoman with a  
sixth-grade education and an enormous generosity that made her a 
national folk celebrity, has died. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	She died Sunday at her Hattiesburg home after battling cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	McCarty accumulated $250,000 over 75 years of laundering and  
ironing other people's clothes in her unairconditioned home. She 
gained fame in 1995, when she gave away $150,000 to a scholarship 
fund for poor blacks at the University of Southern Mississippi. At 
the time, she had never even visited the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heaven couldn't have gotten a better angel,'' said Stephanie  
Bullock, who received a McCarty scholarship. ``She was an 
inspiration, a blessing, a treasure to the entire earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty had dreams of furthering her education and becoming a  
nurse, but she quit school after the sixth grade to help support 
her mother, grandmother and an aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	After her donation to the school, the woman who never married or  
learned to drive was praised by President Clinton and the United 
Nations and given an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty had left home only for a one-mile walk for groceries and  
to go to church until she ushered in 1997 by dropping the Times 
Square ball in New York. She said that was the first time she had 
ever stayed up until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	She promoted her unpretentious philosophies about life in a 1996  
book, ``Simple Wisdom for Rich Living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the ones that make the big money, but the ones who  
know how to save who get ahead,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oseola McCarty is one of those women whose face has `wise'  
written all over it,'' said actor Danny Glover in presenting her an 
Essence Award in 1996. ``She is a kind and generous spirit who has 
taken the biblical adage `It's better to give than receive' to 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's donation encouraged others to give money to USM for  
unfortunate students and the Oseola McCarty Endowed Scholarship 
Fund began. More than $330,000 had been raised at the time of her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine students have received the scholarships and three have  
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	Her activities slowed in 1998 and she was diagnosed with colon  
cancer that April, just a month after her 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, she told The Associated Press she had more dreams to  
fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still want to get married,'' she said. ``I don't want no  
children, though.''

the members and subscribers of The Associated Press. AP chiefs of 
bureau around the country asked the wire service's 1,550 American 
newspaper members to plumb their archives -- essentially the photo 
album of a nation -- and pick one image emblematic of a time, a 
place, an important person, even a quiet moment. Contributions also 
came in from scores of the AP's 8,000 subscribers overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	What emerged was a modern mosaic of moments -- hundreds of them.  
The accompanying national and international photos are just a 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are stunning in their content, others memorable in their  
composition. In this collection are the familiar and famous, the 
images that helped readers process the world. But here, too, are 
unknown photos of great people and great photos of unknown people. 
</P>
<P>
	The iconic: Levittown, sprawling across a swath of Long Island  
after World War II. RFK gunned down in LA, dying, bathed in the 
ghostly light of an Ambassador Hotel pantry. The bombed-out shell 
of the Murrah Federal Building -- Tim McVeigh's handiwork. A 
starving Ethiopian woman and child whose hunger captured the 
attention of the world. The weeping girl kneeling next to a fallen 
student at Kent State. Alabama Gov. George Wallace, chest jutting 
in defiance, making his ``stand at the schoolhouse door.'' Anguish 
at Columbine High School, minutes after Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold made their own unimaginable stand. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrated, in unfamiliar surroundings: Harry S. Truman  
dedicating two Arkansas dams in 1952. Winston Churchill in a 
wide-brimmed hat, languidly reading Time magazine on a ship deck in 
Florida. Wilbur Wright flying an airplane over Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The quiet: John F. Kennedy, mulling the world in a  
shadow-dappled Oval Office. Bill Clinton, a generation later, 
washing his face in a men's room on the road to the presidency. A 
little boy named Ron Cole, unflinching, being injected with the 
Salk polio vaccine in Portland, Ind., in 1955. Marine Lance Cpl. 
Perron Shinnerman, his leg claimed by a land mine in Vietnam, 
embracing his wife on a tarmac in Sioux Falls, S.D. A firefighter 
breathing life into an injured kitten. 
</P>
<P>
	The global: Eva Peron's funeral, mobbed by hundreds of thousands  
of Argentines. Nelson and Winnie Mandela in a family picture from 
long ago. Bodies lying in Palestinian refugee camps. St. Paul's 
Cathedral in London, standing tall during the Nazi blitz. Refugees 
streaming from Kosovo. A Moscow man hugging a Soviet commander. 
Hirohito and MacArthur, posing stiffly after the surrender. Chiang 
Kai-Shek's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	And the unexpected: a whitetailed deer at the instant of being  
killed by a passing car in Montana, taken by a photographer who'd 
stopped to get a picture of the animal on the roadside. A man named 
Walter, spooning food into his mouth in his home -- a small, upended 
cardboard box on the streets of downtown Philadelphia. George 
Reeves, television's Superman from the 1950s, serving salad to 
workers at Hess's Department Store in Allentown, Pa. -- in cape and 
tights. 
</P>
<P>
	All captured by photographers as varied as their subjects -- and  
shared here in a unique way. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP, the world's largest news-gathering organization, is a  
cooperative founded in 1848. Member newspapers exchange news of 
their regions through the AP, and share support of a global staff 
of writers, photographers, and audio and video reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperative pioneered the transmission of news pictures by  
leased telephone wire in 1935; today, the old analog process has 
yielded to a high-speed digital network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Photos of the Century -- a collection of memorable  
photographs chosen by newspapers around the world -- is made 
possible by the unique cooperative structure of The Associated 
Press,'' AP President Louis D. Boccardi says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The AP thrives on the sharing of news and information from its  
members and subscribers,'' Boccardi says. ``We are proud to play a 
pivotal role in providing these reflections of life in the 20th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of these images evokes questions: How have we lived? What  
made us cry -- or laugh? What made us turn away in disgust or tell a 
loved one that we care? Most importantly, what made us act? 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures pass faster now. Miss America, soon to be  
dethroned. Soldiers dismantling a bit of the Iron Curtain -- a 
barbed-wire fence on the Austria-Hungary border. Adlai Stevenson's 
shoe leather. A public hanging in Kentucky. Tokyo subway riders 
felled by a nerve-gas attack. Red Grange breaking away for a 
touchdown. Huey Long in his coffin. Buddy Holly's crushed plane. 
Cuban refugees. Farm foreclosures. Jessica McClure pulled from the 
Texas well. Waco and David Koresh. Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
	They are the places and faces of our century. But perhaps none  
more so than Nhieu Thi Nguyen and her great-great granddaughter 
Quincy Casselman, photographed by The Herald Journal in Hyrum, 
Utah, in 1997. She survived the Vietnam war and followed her family 
to the United States in 1981 so she could, finally, be around to 
kiss a baby who is four generations beyond her -- and ethnically 
mixed in ways only the 20th century could have produced. 
</P>
<P>
	These two -- the elder and the innocent, experience alongside  
possibility -- bookend it all: war, peace, cultural change, mass 
migration. And, above all, community -- be it family, town, city, 
nation or species. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, of course, photos tell only of moments. But put  
enough of those moments together and you begin to weave a tapestry 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This project illustrates the invaluable contribution that  
newspapers have made, and will continue to make in documenting 
history,'' says AP Executive Photo Editor Vin Alabiso. ``From 
Pulitzer Prize-winning images to quiet yet special moments, 
newspaper photographers remain the visual storytellers of their 
communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is impossible to document the entire history of a nation or a  
world. It's the historian's ultimate frustration; there is simply 
too much to record. 
</P>
<P>
	But by assembling these moments, we compile a catalog of  
ourselves. Each detail -- a facial expression, a passing car, a 
building, even a detail on a sign -- transports us, fleetingly, to a 
place and a time other than our own. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the miracle of the captured moment -- and the miracle of  
photography in the century where it grew to adulthood and shaped 
our view of who we are.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver, Atlanta Claim Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The expansion Atlanta Thrashers and the  
Vancouver Canucks were the busiest teams during Monday's NHL Waiver 
Draft, with both selecting two players apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers took center Jeff Williams from the New Jersey  
Devils and right wing Ladislav Kohn from the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Kohn was then traded to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks for an 
eighth-round pick in the 2000 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks claimed defensemen Chris Joseph from the Ottawa  
Senators and John Namestnikov from the New York Rangers, filling 
spots created by the holdouts of Ed Jovanovski and Adrian Aucoin, 
both restricted free agents. Joseph and Namestnikov previously 
played for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 10 players changed teams as the Devils also lost  
defenseman Ken Sutton to the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa also lost two players as center Viacheslav Butsayev went  
to the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta lost a player it claimed in June's expansion draft back  
to the team it took him from, St. Louis Blues center Terry Yake. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players selected were defenseman Ladislav Benysek by  
Anaheim from the Edmonton Oilers; Jamie Rivers by the New York 
Islanders from St. Louis; and defenseman Rich Brennan by the Los 
Angeles Kings from the Nashville Predators.

<HEADLINE>  Giants' Offense Lacking Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- As frustrated as New York Giants  
coach Jim Fassel is with the play of his offense, quarterback Kent 
Graham isn't in danger of losing his starting job. At least not 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel promised on Monday to do whatever it takes to get his  
supposed big-play offense going this Sunday against Philadelphia, 
but he made it clear Graham is not solely to blame for the Giants' 
lack of punch after an explosive preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	That will keep Kerry Collins, signed in the offseason to a  
nearly $17 million contract, on the bench a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I'm very frustrated,'' Fassel said. ``The way I  
look at this is that this is a very difficult challenge, one that 
I'm going to solve by hook or crook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York (1-2) is averaging 246 yards in total offense,  
including 56 per game rushing. It has 52 points this season, and 17 
of those were either scored directly or set up by the defense in 
the season-opening 17-13 victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday night's 16-14 loss to New England, the offense scored  
a touchdown on the opening series and added another on its final 
possession, with the Patriots playing a prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In between was one mishap after another. The most notable was  
the failure to convert a fourth-down quarterback sneak at the 
Patriots 41, trailing 10-7 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel was the first to admit that Graham has made mistakes, but  
he wasn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Brian Williams back at center, the offensive line has  
struggled making holes. Running backs Sean Bennett, out at least 
four weeks with a knee sprain, and LeShon Johnson have made some 
poor reads when the holes are there, and the receivers have 
compounded things by either not getting open or by running the 
wrong routes. 
</P>
<P>
	If some of those mistakes were eliminated Sunday night, Fassel  
said the Giants might have won. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham actually had good statistics against New England,  
completing 23 of 36 passes for 216 yards, two touchdowns and no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times, the media, a lot of people can lose  
perspective,'' Graham said. ``Everybody blames the quarterback. 
Everybody blames the coach. We're the first ones to go down. I 
understand that's the nature of the profession, but at the same 
time, I have to look at it realistically and wonder what we are 
doing and how we can make it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching videotapes of the first three games, Graham  
believes the offense is close to putting everything together. 
Usually, he sees just one person making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not time to hit the panic button, no way,'' Williams  
said. ``It's still early in the season. We have to focus extremely 
hard this week. Philly is struggling and we're struggling. We just 
have find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the third straight year the Giants' offense has  
struggled early under Fassel, who had the reputation of being an 
offensive wizard when hired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the offense averaged 240 yards in the first three  
games, six less than it is averaging now. 
</P>
<P>
	One source of help for the offense is the expected return of  
starting halfback Gary Brown this week. After rushing for 1,063 
yards a year ago, he missed most of training camp while recovering 
from an injury incurred during a motorcycle accident in late June. 
He missed the first three weeks of the season because of a knee 
injury suffered in the final preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown gives the Giants an inside running attack. Bennett, who  
was injured Sunday night, and Johnson are better running outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people expect me to go out and help and I  
expect that of myself,'' Brown said. ``I want that type of 
pressure. I want people to say to me you have to make it go. It 
makes me feel good and puts pressure on me to perform. I like 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Brown makes the running game go, the offense should get  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, Graham may be in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not to the point where I'm saying I'm going to make a  
change for change's sake,'' Fassel said. ``That's not my 
personality to just change it to change it. At some point in time, 
if I need to do that, I'll do that.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Win at Ballpark's Last Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With Al Kaline, Ernie Harwell and a sellout crowd  
bidding goodbye, Tiger Stadium went out on in grand fashion in its 
last turn at bat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Better make that grand slam fashion.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fick, wearing the No. 25 of former Tigers favorite Norm  
Cash, hit his first career grand slam in the eighth inning and 
Detroit beat Kansas City 8-2 in its final game at the corner of 
Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	In moving postgame ceremonies emceed by Harwell, 65 former  
Tigers -- from Eldon Auker, who played in 1933, to Brad Ausmus of 
the 1999 squad -- formed a chronological line from home plate to the 
flag pole in center field. 
</P>
<P>
	A flag featuring a Tiger Stadium logo was lowered and passed  
from player to player, from Auker at one end to Ausmus at the 
other. It will be raised next season at Comerica Park, the Tigers' 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind me stands over 70 years of Tigers' history'' Auker said  
as he presented the flag to Ausmus. ``Each of us has touched this 
flag today as this stadium has touched millions of fans who have 
attended games here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never forget us, for we live on by those who carry on the  
Tigers tradition and who so proudly wear the olde English D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home plate was dug up immediately after the final out and  
carried to Comerica Park where it was relocated in the new stadium 
being built about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the fans, who cheered lustily as each of the players were  
introduced and jogged to their respective positions, booed at every 
reference to Comerica Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight we say goodbye,'' Harwell said in his closing remarks  
as music from the sound track of the movie ``Apollo 13'' played 
softly in the background. ``But we will not forget. Open your eyes, 
take a look around, and take a mental picture. Moments like this 
will live on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he concluded, Harwell's voice began to choke with emotion.  
</P>
<P>
	Many in the stands remained for as long as they could, taking in  
one last, loving look. Some, who were close enough, leaned over the 
rail and scooped handsful of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farewell old friend, Tiger Stadium,'' Harwell said. ``We will  
remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 43,356 chanted Fick's name and he stepped to the  
top of the dugout steps and doffed his cap as thousands of flash 
bulbs popped. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Polonia and Karim Garcia also homered for the Tigers whose  
final record at the old ballyard was 3,764 wins, 3,090 losses and 
19 ties. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was fairly well-behaved. Only a few fans jumped over  
the fence and tried to run across the field after Doug Jones struck 
out Carlos Beltran to end it at 7:07 p.m. But they were quickly 
escorted from the grounds and a security force of both mounted and 
foot police ringed the warning track for postgame ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Built on the site of a haymarket in 1912, the ballpark that was  
once home to Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Denny McLain 
and Kaline made one last sentimental journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's players all wore numbers of Tigers who played through  
the years. The starters wore the numbers of the Tigers' all-time 
team. Center fielder Gabe Kapler wore a uniform without a number, 
honoring Cobb -- the greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in an 
era before uniforms were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game with the Royals was the 6,873rd regular season  
game at the stadium, which also has played host to 35 postseason 
games and three All-Star games. Special baseballs were used, and 
the bases were changed after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout put the Tigers over the 2 million mark in attendance  
for just the sixth time in club history, and the first time since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, a Hall of Famer, exchanged lineup cards with Royals Hall  
of Famer George Brett. Both wore their familiar uniforms, Kaline 
with his No. 6, Brett with No. 5. Harwell, the beloved broadcaster, 
emceed pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great times we've experienced in Tiger Stadium we'll  
cherish forever,'' mayor Dennis Archer told the crowd. ``Now, let's 
create some new memories in Comerica Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers won 3,764 games in the old ballpark, lost 3,090 and  
tied 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was home to us for a long time,'' said Eddie Mayo, a member  
of the 1945 World Series champions. ``Old friends are hard to 
slough off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, with the olde English ``D'' on his breast, was saluted  
with a two-minute standing ovation during the pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken many times about the first day I ever saw this  
ballpark, as an 18-year-old kid fresh off the train from 
Baltimore,'' Kaline said. ``I again find myself humbled and a bit 
overwhelmed by the events unfolding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Rogell, a shortstop from 1930-39, threw out the ceremonial  
first pitch as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good day, but a sad day,'' said U.S. Sen. Jim  
Bunning of Kentucky, a Hall of Fame pitcher who was with the Tigers 
from 1955-63. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Bill Freehan, selected by Detroit fans as the greatest  
Tigers catcher ever: ``Bittersweet is the perfect word for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weather cooperated, with pale blue skies, gentle sunshine  
and a pleasant breeze coming off the Detroit River as thousands of 
fans came through the old ballpark's turnstiles one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levine, a 53-year-old fan, flew in from Chicago. In his  
wallet were ticket stubs from the 1968 game when the Tigers 
clinched the AL pennant and the game when McLain got his 30th win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out here on the plane this morning, probably 80 percent  
of the people were coming here to see a ballgame for the last 
time,'' he said. ``I have tons of feelings about this old place. I 
used to skip school regularly to attend opening days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one. A century's worth of baseball has been  
played on this historic piece of ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1912, with home plate moved from right field to its  
present location, the stadium opened as Navin Field. That was five 
days after the sinking of the Titanic. Fenway Park opened in Boston 
the same day, making them the two oldest ballparks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler wasn't nervous, although he probably had reason to  
be. Moehler was Detroit's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, his main claim to fame this season was drawing a  
10-day suspension after an umpire caught him with sandpaper in his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad when it's over with, I'll tell you that,'' said  
Moehler who got credit for the victory, giving up two runs in six 
innings. ``I'll miss the stadium, but I'll be glad when all the 
hoopla is over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he was just like any other fan when it came to saying  
goodbye to this revered mass of rusting girders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my video camera around and I could see where people  
were trying to take the signs down,'' Moehler said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 81.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, led by gains in technology  
shares, as bargain-hunting and a stronger dollar helped the markets 
recover from last week's huge decline. 
</P>
<P>
	At late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 81.05 at 10,360.82. The index of 30 blue-chip 
companies had been up as much as 123.16 points this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.24 at 1,288.60, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 25.65 at 2,766.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow fell a total of 524.30 points, its biggest  
weekly point loss ever. That plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, 
or 9.2 percent, below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. 
But with the lift today, it still is up almost 13 percent since the 
year began. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 129.21 points  
last week. The index is still up more than 26 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing an oversold market, and bargain-hunting taking  
over,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason 
of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that investors seem to be going back to technology  
stocks, which were big catalyst for the market before last week's 
retreat. On the Nasdaq, Intel jumped 3 5/8 at 79 1/16, Amgen, a huge 
biotech concern, was up 2 1/4 at 80 1/8 and Sun Microsystems rose 3 3/4 to 
93 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has risen on indications that Japan will work to stop  
the dollar's recent slide vs. the yen. After months of sparring 
over the direction of foreign exchange markets, finance ministers 
of industrialized nations moved closer over the weekend to an 
agreement on how to revive the sagging U.S. currency, as well as 
protect Japan's nascent economic recovery. The news helped stop the 
dollar's slide against the yen. A stronger dollar makes U.S. 
securities more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher today was Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 2 5/16 to  
92 5/16, and IBM, up 2 1/2 to 122 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks were weak, including Dow component, JP  
Morgan, down 3 7/16 to 113 9/16 and Chase Manhattan, down 1 5/16 at 
74 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining stocks also propelled the stock market as gold bullion  
posted its biggest daily gain in 13 years. Gold producers benefited 
after European central banks said they will limit bullion sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors played down any talk that last week's market drop was  
the beginning of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case for a bear market is still a weak one,'' said  
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The 
leading indicators of the economy continue to point up not down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One benefit of last week's market drop is that it may give the  
Federal Reserve another reason to keep interest rates steady, 
Johnson said. The Fed next meets on Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 617.23 million shares 
at late afternoon, down from Friday's heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, was up 4.73 at 421.82.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Land Link Opens Oct. 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will open a land route for Palestinians  
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Oct. 3, two days later than 
stipulated in the most recent peace agreement, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called safe passage will allow Palestinians for the first  
time to move freely between the West Bank and Gaza. It is expected 
to boost trade, bring families closer together and ease the sense 
of isolation felt by many of the 1 million residents of Gaza, a 
crowded coastal strip ringed by barbed wire fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the most recent peace accord, Israel was to open the safe  
passage on Oct. 1. However, the date falls on a Friday, the Muslim 
day of rest and the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Officials in 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said the safe passage 
would instead open on the next business day, Oct. 3, a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The route, using existing roads in Israel, starts near the West  
Bank village of Tarkumiya and leads to the Erez Crossing between 
Israel and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace agreement also says the Palestinians may begin work on  
a seaport in Gaza by Oct. 1. Ali Shaath, the harbor supervisor, was 
in Holland on Monday to discuss the final details with officials 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland and France are paying for the project, with the French  
share reportedly amounting to $80 million.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Seeks Economic Reversal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Floating freely against the dollar for  
the first time in five years, the Colombian peso fell only slightly 
Monday, suggesting a massive international loan package had 
encouraged confidence in the country's battered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are good days for Colombia,'' Finance Minister Juan  
Camilo Restrepo said from Washington, where he detailed credits for 
$6.9 billion from the International Monetary Fund and other lending 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clouds on the economic horizon have been greatly lifted,''  
he told Caracol radio. 
</P>
<P>
	President Andres Pastrana is counting on economic recovery to  
reverse his plummeting popularity and to underpin a broad-based 
strategy he announced during a U.S. visit last week for forging 
peace and combating the illegal drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	At trading's end Monday, the peso had lost just 1.1 percent of  
its value, dropping to 2017 to the dollar from its start at 1994.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Before scrapping an exchange control system on the peso over the  
weekend, Colombia's central bank had in the past year orchestrated 
two devaluations, allowing the peso to drop by nearly 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank spent $400 million last week alone in a vain attempt to  
brake that slide, though many analysts said the speculative attack 
owed more to the exchange system's existence than to any gross peso 
overvaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication that the decision to free the  
Colombian peso was affecting Colombia's immediate neighbors, both 
of them mired in recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders in Caracas said the Venezuelan bolivar, widely  
considered about 40 percent overvalued, was unaffected Monday. The 
bolivar is propped up by the same sort of currency system Colombia 
has just eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ecuador, President Jamil Mahuad's plan to make his nation the  
first ever to default on Brady bond interest payments and 
renegotiate millions of dollars of U.S.-backed foreign debt 
received generally positive reaction Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and former government officials, frequently critical of  
Mahuad, said the president was taking a realistic approach to the 
nation's crushing foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must confront the world with the truth,'' said Mario  
Ribadeneira, a former finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, trading Monday on Ecuador's national currency, the  
sucre, opened 11 percent down against the dollar following Mahuad's 
announcement Sunday night that Ecuador would only make good on a 
little less than half of a $98 million interest payment on foreign 
debt due Tuesday. Ecuador's sucre lost nearly 5 percent of its 
value against the dollar on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Colombia's planning minister, Mauricio Cardenas, said  
he expected a quick return to 5 percent annual growth rates which 
had stabilized the country during decades of civil strife. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some analysts cast doubt on whether Colombia had truly  
put its economic troubles behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that the future is clear is too optimistic,'' said  
Javier Fernandez Riva, a leading private economist. He predicted 
the economy will still contract by 4 percent this year and grow 
only by 3 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	While many details were still unclear about Colombia's new  
agreements with creditors, Restrepo insisted they would not spell 
more misery for the country's rising ranks of poor and unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sector unions called a two-day nationwide strike last  
month to protest an eventual IMF agreement they said would 
impoverish workers. Unemployment is at 20 percent and the economy 
contracted by nearly 7 percent in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF agreements often require governments to slash social  
programs as a way to put public finances in order. But Restrepo 
said the loan package included $4.2 billion from lenders including 
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for programs 
to create jobs and assist rural refugees from Colombia's 35-year 
civil conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	As a condition for its $2.7 billion contribution, the IMF is  
demanding Colombia cut its fiscal deficit from about 5 percent of 
gross domestic product to 1.5 percent over three years.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Visitors Undaunted by Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- A plane crash on  
Mauna Loa Volcano that killed all 10 people aboard didn't deter 
sightseers on Monday from the flights that reveal the spectacular -- 
and dangerous -- elements of Hawaii's beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting for this for a long time,'' said Jerry Leo  
of Brick, N.J., who took an around-the-island flight. ``Once we 
were up there we never thought of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii tourism officials played down the repercussions of  
Saturday's Big Island Air crash, saying most visitors understand 
that many island activities, such as flying over volcanoes and 
waterfalls, are inherently risky. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii's deadliest sightseeing accident in 25 years, the  
twin-engine plane crashed almost two miles up the slopes of Mauna 
Loa, an active volcano that reaches 13,600 feet on Hawaii's Big 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators found remains of the 10th body on Monday  
as they searched for the cause of the crash in the burned wreckage. 
Some pieces of the plane were so charred that they crumbled in the 
hands of recovery crews. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire's corrections chief, Hank Risley, was among the  
dead, that state's governor said Monday, and corrections officials 
told New Hampshire's Concord Monitor that Risley's stepmother also 
died. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were awaiting dental and medical records to  
confirm the identities of the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Risley was among six victims from the U.S. mainland. Two victims  
were from the Big Island and two were from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hammerschmidt of the National Transportation Safety Board  
said investigators don't have a preliminary cause as to why the 
plane veered off its course and slammed into the hardened lava. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was not carrying a flight data recorder since federal  
law does not require one for sightseeing planes. But it did contain 
a global positioning system that might contain some useful 
navigational data, Hammerschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400,000 people a year take in Hawaii's spectacular  
sites from the sky. Helicopter and plane tours take them within 
1,000 feet of bubbling lava, waterfalls and lush valleys that they 
would not be able to reach by car or even by foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any activity you do that has danger in it, you run risks,''  
said David Carey, president and chief executive of Outrigger Hotels 
and Resorts and a member of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``But given the vast number of air tours that go out every day  
from all the islands, it's a very safe activity. I believe it's 
safer than driving down a freeway in L.A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many tourists apparently agreed and had no qualms about signing  
up for aerial tours over the Big Island just two days after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had one cancellation due to that,'' said Wendy Hart  
of Island Hoppers, which offers nine daily plane tours. ``We've had 
questions, but no cancellations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of Big Island Air's Piper Navajo Chieftain last made  
contact Saturday at 5:21 p.m., one hour after it took off from the 
airport. The pilot did not say there were any problems, said Gail 
Minami, the park's operations supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact there was no distress call means the pilot could have  
smashed into jagged lava without warning, she said. Rescuers said 
the plane slid about 75 yards, rolled over and burned, but remained 
mostly intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Island Air declined comment, referring all inquiries to the  
NTSB.

<HEADLINE> Nintendo Chief To Chair Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln was  
appointed chairman of the Seattle Mariners today, succeeding John 
Ellis, who was designated chairman emeritus and will remain on the 
club's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln has been the representative of principal owner Hiroshi  
Yamauchi, president of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan, on the Mariners' 
board of directors since the billionaire electronic-game magnate 
put up most of the money to buy the club in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Lincoln, a key figure since the current owners  
acquired the club, took over as chief executive less than three 
months after the opening of Safeco Field, an open-air ballpark with 
a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to the new park has been dogged by controversy over the  
Mariners' demand for $100 million in additional funding from King 
County to cover cost overruns for the $517 million project. Public 
officials contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by the club said home attendance this season  
was 2.9 million, second only to the 3.1 million of 1997. On a 
per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent higher at 
Safeco Field than in the club's old digs at the nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln faces the immediate challenge of finding a new general  
manager to replace Woody Woodward, who is retiring, and re-signing 
the team's top two players, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. and 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, whose contracts expire after next season. 
Both have said they will look elsewhere unless the Mariners show a 
commitment to winning by signing other key players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-78 with seven games  
left in the season, have not made the playoffs since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln previously announced plans to retire from Nintendo on  
Feb. 14, when he turns 60. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis, the club's point man in the battle to get the stadium  
project approved in the first place and once again on the overruns, 
said in a prepared statement he decided to leave as chairman 
because it was the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to complete the Safeco Field project,'' Ellis said.  
``With that done, I am ready to hand over responsibility to Howard 
and help the Mariners in any way I can.''

<HEADLINE> More on New-Era Thinking / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In spite of yearlong warnings about the lofty  
height of stocks, the market has barely suffered a serious scratch 
let alone a dent. 
</P>
<P>
	And that brings up what might be called the Dent theory to  
explain how the market can suffer so many brief fits of depression 
and then recapture its old enthusiasm a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	That enthusiasm can be measured: Despite the caveats of  
analysts, scholars, regulators and, rarely, corporate executives, 
the Dow Jones is up 7 percent and the Nasdaq 17 percent in the past 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	So much of what these types have warned about has not come to  
pass; they have cried wolf so often that their warnings no longer 
resound with the clanging of bells and the flashing of red lights. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, investors seem to soak up the new-era philosophy,  
that this is indeed a rare time, marked by a technological 
explosion and financed by the insatiable desire of investors to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Dent, a futurist, demographer and marketplace analyst  
expressed it well in his book, ``The Roaring 2000s,'' which 
describes a phenomenal economic boom lasting into the year 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, said Dent, the population bulge referred to as the  
Baby Boomers, which has affected car sales, home sales, computer 
sales and all else, will have about run its course. 
</P>
<P>
	But, before the big thrust is over, he says, the Dow Jones  
industrial average will have reached at least 21,500 points -- about 
double today's number -- and might even reach 35,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Harry Dent isn't the only extreme bull.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, ``Boomeronics'' by William Sterling and Stephen Waite  
identified other reasons for being bullish, and a dozen or more 
other volumes have waxed enthusiastic about the new economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Dow 36,000'' by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett, economic  
scholars, has survived critical reviews, and is among The Wall 
Street Journal's business best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The theme of optimism can be convincingly described, and its  
credibility is buttressed to a great extent by events: Stocks 
really have boomed, and ordinary investors have indeed made 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, investors with no more than a casual involvement in  
the unfolding drama can hardly fail to notice that repeated 
warnings about inflation and other negatives have not measured up. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is a popular, deeply rooted and mainly  
justifiable feeling among Americans that, materially speaking, 
times tend to get better, not worse. Hope is stronger than fear or 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	The ingredients produce a potent counterweight to the views of  
some of the marketplace's sagest analysts, and of respected public 
figures, such as Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	And they probably provide at least some of the reason why the  
stock market from time to time endures scratches, some of them 
serious, but somehow doesn't suffer crippling injuries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs World Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States supports a second five-year  
term for James Wolfensohn to head the World Bank, U.S. officials 
said Monday. U.S. backing ensures the Australian-born American will 
be reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is expected at Tuesday's opening session of the  
bank's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation Monday that Michel Camdessus, Wolfensohn's  
counterpart at the bank's sister institution the International 
Monetary Fund, may step down after wrestling with international 
financial crises for a record 12 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers informed finance ministers  
of the other major industrialized countries Saturday of the U.S. 
decision to renominate Wolfensohn. According to the officials, 
Summers said, ``Jim Wolfensohn has done an extraordinary job of 
bringing energy and passion to the bank's critical development 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn, 65, would be only the second of the nine presidents  
in the bank's 53-year history to serve a second term, which would 
start next May. The other was former U.S. defense secretary Robert 
McNamara, president from 1968 to 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Under practices adopted when the bank and its sister  
institution, the International Monetary Fund, were established 
after World War II, an American heads the World Bank, a European 
the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn, a former Wall Street investment banker, took over at  
the bank in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a news conference about his impending reappointment,  
Wolfensohn said that during his second term he would spend less 
time on trying to reform the 182-nation organization and more on 
trying to reduce global poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the deck chairs is not smart if the boat is  
sinking,'' Wolfensohn said. ``If we're going to get any closer to 
port (and reduce poverty), we have to get away from the internal 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and colleagues say the Frenchman Camdessus, 66, already  
past the midpoint of a record-breaking third five-year term at the 
IMF, has been drained by dealing with a series of international 
financial crises while fending off IMF critics.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Blame Game Is On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The coach blamed the quarterback. The  
quarterback blamed the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The push and pull between questionable play calling and shoddy  
execution was in full swing Monday -- and not just on talk radio -- 
as the Jacksonville Jaguars tried to explain an unexpected loss to 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was the third-and-goal play from the Titans 3-yard line  
with 1:03 remaining. A chip shot field goal would have tied the 
game, but coach Tom Coughlin called for a pass to Keenan McCardell. 
</P>
<P>
	Not recognizing that double coverage was rolling McCardell's  
way, Mark Brunell lofted the ball towards the corner of the end 
zone. Samari Rolle made a break on the ball, got the interception 
and, after an intentional safety, the Titans had a 20-19 victory 
and a surprising lead in the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell took blame for a bad decision on the pass. He wouldn't  
do the same for the play call, one that had Jaguars fans fuming, 
knowing the team had two timeouts and an almost sure ticket to 
overtime in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't call them, I just run them,'' Brunell said during an  
edgier-than-usual session with reporters. ``If you want 
information, if you want to talk about the play calling, I'm not 
the one to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar vein, Coughlin took some blame, but said he  
couldn't explain Brunell's interception, or the read the 
quarterback made the play before, when he never appeared to see a 
wide-open Kyle Brady for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, it's always my responsibility, so I take  
that one right on the chin,'' Coughlin said. ``I wonder what I 
could have done differently. But the fact of the matter is, you've 
got to make a play in those situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also being questioned was Coughlin's decision to bypass a  
25-yard field goal at the end of the first half, opting for a fake 
that fooled nobody. 
</P>
<P>
	The receiver on the play, Rich Griffith, was blanketed in  
quadruple coverage. Holder Bryan Barker was supposed to have a 
running option, as well, but he was pushed out 2 yards short. 
</P>
<P>
	The score remained 3-0 at halftime and, with the stop, the  
Titans had all the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming away with points there would have been a positive,''  
Coughlin said. ``When you take a chance like that in the kicking 
game and it works out your way, you're a genius. When it doesn't, 
you're a bum. There's no question about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other factors, like a driving rainstorm, or the  
defense's inability to hold on its biggest drive of the game, the 
45-yard march that Neil O'Donnell led for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than anything, Coughlin felt it was four turnovers that  
cost the Jaguars the game. That, not the play calling, was what 
kept him up late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four turnovers is just so blatantly in contrast to what we  
believe in,'' Coughlin said. ``The callous disregard for the ball 
just strikes right at your gut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule made this loss no easier to stomach.  
</P>
<P>
	Next week, the Jaguars travel to Pittsburgh, a place they have  
never won, where the Steelers are every bit as miffed over a loss 
at home, 29-10 to the Seattle Seahawks, against a team they figured 
they would beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin, however, wasn't quite ready to let his latest loss go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to grind on this one for a while, because this one  
hurts,'' he said. ``This shouldn't have happened to a football team 
as far along as we are in a game like that at home.''

<HEADLINE> Drag Death Defendant Blames Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The final defendant facing a capital murder trial  
in the dragging death of a black man blames the savage hate crime 
on two already-condemned co-defendants, according to an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Allen Berry, 24, told ``60 Minutes II'' his version of  
what happened on the early morning of June 7, 1998, when James Byrd 
Jr. was chained to the bumper of Berry's pickup truck and dragged 
three miles to his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Berry, whose trial  
is set to begin in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry insists his mistake was being in the wrong place with the  
wrong people -- white supremacists John William King and Lawrence 
Russell Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, was convicted and sent to death row in February, while  
former prison buddy Brewer, 32, was sentenced to death last week. 
Both men were members of a white supremacist prison gang, the 
Confederate Knights of America, while jailed together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hanging around a bad crowd. I mean, that's no excuse.  
But I mean, I was with people that I shouldn't have been with,'' 
Berry said, according to a transcript of the interview released 
Monday. The interview was to air Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry and King had been friends for nearly a decade. Brewer had  
just come to town to visit King after losing a job, and all three 
stayed together at King's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The roommates had decided to go cruising in Berry's pickup the  
night they ran into Byrd, hitchhiking in Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry offered him a ride home and Byrd hopped in the cab.  
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, who Berry describes as being ``very drunk,'' ended up on  
the ground being kicked by both Brewer and King. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing, joking, acting like they were having a  
good time,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Brewer covered Byrd's face with black spray paint, Berry  
said, Brewer kicked him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he heard the chain being pulled out of the rear of the  
truck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw them chain him up,'' Berry said. ``I sat in the  
truck. And they started dragging him down that dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill was driving. I was in the middle. Russell was on the  
passenger side and I asked him why he did it,'' Berry said. ``And 
he said he's starting 'The Turner Diaries' early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Turner Diaries,'' called an inspiration for Oklahoma City  
bomber Timothy McVeigh by the FBI, describes a race war in which 
white supremacists kill blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said he didn't stop Brewer and King was because afraid of  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said they have DNA evidence showing Byrd's  
blood was on Berry's shoes, and District Attorney Guy James Gray 
said Monday there is more evidence he has not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, said his client's  
interview with ``60 Minutes II'' is merely a re-telling of the 
statements he gave to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Brief portions of Berry's original statement, given several  
hours after his arrest, have been made public in earlier court 
filings, but the exact details are still under seal. Gray said 
``there are going to be a lot of conflicts'' between the interview 
and what Berry told investigators.

<HEADLINE> Senate Pushes $324B for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to blunt President Clinton's attacks  
on their education budget, Republicans pushed a $324 billion social 
spending bill through a Senate panel Monday that would outspend the 
president for schools by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved by voice vote by a Senate Appropriations  
Committee subcommittee, is a more generous version of legislation a 
House subcommittee approved last Friday. Clinton has already 
threatened to veto the House bill because it would cut his 
proposals for hiring teachers, worker protections and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is still likely to spark battles with the White  
House because of reductions in several of Clinton's priorities. 
Even so, its numbers push it far closer to what an eventual 
compromise between the White House and Congress is likely to look 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very tough line between what I think the president  
will sign and what I can sell'' to congressional Republicans, the 
subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said in an 
interview. ``It is a devilishly difficult judgment play, but I 
think we're on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa,  
said, ``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot 
better than what the House did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000, which begins Friday. 
It is the most controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual 
spending bills to begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200  
million less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and 
human services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains language continuing a ban on national  
testing of students, and allowing hypodermic needles to be provided 
to some drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said when the full Appropriations Committee considers  
the bill on Tuesday, he will try to remove language that would 
allow federal funds to be used for biomedical research on stem 
cells from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would do so to avoid a long, contentious debate on  
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Paul Newman Starting Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) -- Paul Newman is starting a camp near  
here for children with chronic or life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Painted Turtle Camp is the seventh camp in the nation and the  
first in California to be associated with Newman's Hole in the Wall 
Gang Camp Fund, which he started in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The 183-acre site 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles was  
purchased by Page Hannah-Adler, actress Daryl Hannah's younger 
sister, and other board members. It's expected to open in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a volunteer at the first camp that Paul Newman built  
with his salad dressing proceeds,'' Ms. Hannah-Adler said in 
Sunday's Los Angeles Times. ``I thought it was such an amazing 
experience, we needed to have one in California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each summer the camp will accommodate 1,000 children ages 7 to  
17. The facility will be used year-round for other events.

	Greenspan Urges Emerging Markets Improvements  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future Asian-style currency crises could be  
avoided or their damage at least lessened if developing countries 
strive to improve the soundness of their financial systems, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. ``Improving 
deficiencies in domestic banking systems in emerging markets will 
help to limit the toll of the next financial disturbance,'' 
Greenspan said in a speech to financial leaders gathered for the 
annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank.

	Budget Surplus Swells to $115 Billion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal budget surplus is now expected to  
hit a record $115 billion for the fiscal year that ends this week, 
the largest surplus in history. ``It is a landmark achievement for 
our economy,'' President Clinton said today. The 1999 surplus would 
be about 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product, the largest on 
this basis since 1951.

	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain officially announced his  
candidacy today for the Republican presidential nomination. The 
U.S. senator from Arizona and Vietnam war hero said he was the best 
candidate to command American troops and to reform a political 
system that is ``a spectacle of selfish ambition.'' McCain vowed to 
protect Social Security, cut taxes, veto pork-barrel spending, 
improve access to the Internet and test the merits of spending 
government money in private schools. Meanwhile, former vice 
president Dan Quayle gave up his White House dreams today.

	Man Says He OK'd Bush for Guard

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The former speaker of the Texas House of  
Representatives acknowledged today that he called the head of the 
Texas Air National Guard in 1968 to recommend George W. Bush for a 
pilot slot during the Vietnam War. But Ben Barnes, who later was 
lieutenant governor, said the request for his help came from a Bush 
family friend -- not Bush or his father, who then was a congressman. 
The Texas governor and GOP presidential front-runner insisted that 
neither he nor his father sought such assistance when he joined the 
Guard.

coast are investigating whether banks that issue credit cards are 
selling data on customers' spending habits and creditworthiness to 
marketing firms. A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer said banks ``may be breaching the trust of their customers

the guidebooks will come in 26 regional editions, offering specific 
information about the private health plans open to Medicare 
beneficiaries in each state. The new information campaign, which 
cost $133 million this year, was required by Congress in 1997 
legislation aimed at encouraging more Medicare beneficiaries to

<HEADLINE> 49ers, Cardinals To Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- A shootout on Monday Night Football? Shutout  
seems more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals have had two of  
the most inept offenses in the NFL in the first two weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco ranks 27th among the 31 NFL teams, while Arizona  
is 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Young was knocked around like a bowling pin in last week's  
28-21 come-from-behind victory over New Orleans. Jake Plummer has 
thrown seven interceptions and just one touchdown pass for the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a great start for one of the NFL's most successful  
veteran quarterbacks or one of the most highly regarded young ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not on all cylinders,'' Young said of his 49ers.  
``We're going to try to win games however we can while we get our 
feet under us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have suffered from a lack of a rushing game.  
</P>
<P>
	With Garrison Hearst gone with a career-threatening injury, San  
Francisco is tied for 20th in the NFL in rushing at 91 yards per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is even worse. The Cardinals rank 27th in rushing,  
averaging just 2.2 yards per carry. Adrian Murrell, a 1,000-yard 
rusher the last two seasons, has carried the ball 43 times but has 
just 112 yards to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to establish the running game,'' Plummer said. ``You  
see what it does when we do run the ball well, when Adrian is 
getting 100 yards or 115 yards a game. We usually win those 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said part of the problem is that rookie fullback Joel  
Makovicka is still learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's playing poorly, but he's seeing things a  
lot faster than he's used to seeing, and a lot more different 
looks,'' Plummer said. ``Things are going through his head, and 
he's going to get better. He's made some good blocks, but there's 
been some times that he's been a little indecisive and that hurts 
Adrian, because he's got to hit the hole and if there's a guy 
standing there, it's tough to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer knows he has to make better decisions, too. Of the four  
interceptions he threw in last week's 19-16 loss at Miami, he 
blamed three on bad choices. He said none of them could be blamed 
on his sore right thumb that he sprained in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer said he's shaken off his miserable performance of a  
week ago.

	``I have to,'' he said. ``If there are still things from last  
week that are weighing me down, and I'm thinking about them, I'm 
not thinking about the Niners. I'm not doing what I can for my 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, 6-0 in Monday night games,  
is most concerned with protecting Young, who was sacked five times 
and knocked down 16 other times in last week's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci is considering shuffling his offensive line. Jeremy  
Newberry, beaten repeatedly by New Orleans defensive end Troy 
Wilson, might move from right tackle to guard, with Derrick Deese 
switching to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Newberry or Deese will have to contend with Arizona defensive  
end Andre Wadsworth, who is coming off the best game of his young 
pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a variety of things one can do, and we probably will  
use all the variety,'' Mariucci said. ``But in general, we just 
need to get better in that area. We have been better and we need to 
get there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's appearance will be San Francisco's 52nd on Monday  
night, 27th of the 1990s. The Cardinals will be on Monday Night 
Football for only the third time since they moved from St. Louis 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is you know grandma and everybody else will be  
watching,'' Mariucci said. ``The entire country sits down and 
watches the game, as opposed to Sunday, when there are 14 other 
games going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Vince Tobin said his team does have some  
experience in the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me it's a lot like a playoff atmosphere, and we were in the  
playoffs last year, so that gives us a little bit of feel of what 
the national glare is,'' Tobin said. ``Everybody's family and 
friends at home will see them play. I think the intensity level 
increases because everybody knows that everybody is watching 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Domingo Sings Met Opening Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crying out the words, ``La commedia e finita!  
(The comedy is over!),'' tenor Placido Domingo collapsed sobbing 
over the body of the faithless wife he had just stabbed to death, 
as the curtain fell on another opening night at the Metropolitan 
Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just any opening, though. Domingo's performance Monday night  
as the jealous clown Canio in Leoncavallo's ``Pagliacci'' marked 
his 18th Met opening, surpassing the record of 17 set by Enrico 
Caruso in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish-born tenor was greeted with enthusiastic applause at  
his first appearance, extended cheers after his big aria, ``Vesti 
la giubba,'' and a standing ovation when he came out for his final 
bow, dressed in a baggy clown suit, his face covered with 
greasepaint. 
</P>
<P>
	And he earned every bravo, singing with elegance and intensity,  
his burnished sound remarkably fresh for a singer of 58. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief on-stage ceremony later, Domingo paid tribute to  
everyone at the Met ``from the pit to the public,'' especially 
thanking the audience, saying, ``If you come and fill the theater, 
they will let me open it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo said that as the day approached he had become  
increasingly nervous. ``I think, am I going to do it or not, 
because you never know, you can catch a cold,'' Domingo said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would take more than a cold to stop this marvel of energy  
and versatility. In fact, Monday's opening was just a warmup for 
the real challenges he'll undertake at the Met this season -- 
starting with the title role in Verdi's ``Otello'' on Saturday 
night. In later months he'll sing Count Danilo in Lehar's ``Merry 
Widow'' and Siegmund in Wagner's ``Die Walkuere'' -- and for good 
measure conduct several performances of Puccini's ``La Boheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo wasn't the only tenor getting attention during the  
opening. ``Pagliacci'' was preceded by another short opera, 
Mascagni's ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which introduced the 
Argentinean tenor Jose Cura. 
</P>
<P>
	Cura, 36, was the first tenor since Caruso in 1903 given the  
honor of making his Met debut in a leading role on the first night 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's too soon to say whether he can repay the honor by  
becoming a worthy heir to Domingo and the other leading tenor of 
the last 20 years, Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice has a dark, almost baritonal tinge to it. It's capable  
of thrilling power, but the sound sometimes seems to be produced 
under extreme pressure. His high notes were mostly on the mark, but 
noticeably pushed up from below. 
</P>
<P>
	Cura's acting ability and charisma are exceptional, and they  
went a long way to make one overlook the erratic singing. With his 
good looks and smoldering stage presence he brought the character 
of the reckless peasant Turiddu vividly to life. 
</P>
<P>
	The Met surrounded both tenors with outstanding casts. In  
``Pagliacci,'' the role of Canio's wife, Nedda, was sung 
beautifully by soprano Veronica Villarroel, and her lover, Silvio, 
was performed with distinction by baritone Dwayne Croft. Veteran 
baritone Juan Pons took the part of the villainous Tonio ably, a 
few raspy high notes in the Prologue aside. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Cavalleria,'' mezzo Dolora Zajick was a powerhouse as  
Santuzza, the woman Turiddu has betrayed. Baritone Nikolai Putilin 
was unusually sonorous as Alfio, the jealous husband who kills 
Turiddu in a duel. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Rizzi conducted both operas with a lot of energy but also  
with some missed signals between the orchestra and the singers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cav'' and ``Pag,'' as the two operas are popularly known,  
premiered two years apart, in 1900 and 1902, but are now almost 
always performed together. They are the chief survivors of the 
style known as ``verismo,'' or naturalism, that flourished early in 
the century. Both are set in southern Italy and deal with adultery, 
jealousy and murder among ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
	Caruso reached his milestone of 17 openings in a mere 18  
seasons. Between his Met debut in 1903 as the Duke in Verdi's 
``Rigoletto,'' and 1920, when he appeared as Eleazar in Halevy's 
``La Juive,'' Caruso missed just one opening night, in 1906. He 
died in 1921 of pleurisy at age 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo's Met opening nights have been spread over 29 years,  
starting with his first in 1971, when he sang the title role in 
Verdi's ``Don Carlo.''

<HEADLINE> Defending NFC Champions Faltering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Forget the Dirty Birds. These are the same  
ol' Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly resembling the team that was in the Super Bowl a mere  
eight months ago, the defending NFC champions have quickly 
recaptured a look of incompetence that's more familiar in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get this thing turned around,'' safety Marty  
Carter said Monday, ``if we're going to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's looking more and more unlikely after Sunday's debacle in  
St. Louis, when a team that was 4-12 a year ago routed the Falcons 
35-7. The game wasn't even as close as the score, the Rams scoring 
on their first four possessions and outgaining Atlanta 311-67 in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought St. Louis beat us in every phase of the game,''  
coach Dan Reeves said. ``Looking at the film did nothing to change 
that statement, other than it looked like they were playing a 
different speed than we were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 17-0 in each of their first two games, the  
Falcons trailed 28-0 to the Rams. The offense struggled once again, 
but this time it was complemented by a complete breakdown on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran into a buzz saw in St. Louis,'' Carter said. ``Wow. It  
was bombs away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams' dominance was epitomized by a three-play sequence in  
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	With his team already leading 7-0, Kurt Warner threw a 38-yard  
touchdown pass to Torry Holt on third-and-18. After Todd Lyght 
intercepted a pass from Chris Chandler, Warner capitalized on the 
very next play with a 46-yard scoring strike to Isaac Bruce. On the 
first play of St. Louis' next possession, Marshall Faulk broke off 
a 58-yard run to set up another TD. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three plays in a row defensively, we had really poor  
performance,'' Reeves said. ``We just gave up way too many big 
plays. On the road, where your defense has to play well, we just 
didn't get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More troubling, the Falcons secondary ``looked like the Keystone  
Kops,'' in the words of free safety Eugene Robinson. During a bye 
week, St. Louis came up with a game plan that caught Atlanta 
completely off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of teams are attacking us like they expect us to be in  
certain coverages,'' Carter said. ``They're exploiting the 
coverages we're using.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, the Falcons have been plagued by factors beyond their  
control. All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson is out for the season 
with a knee injury, while Chandler is hobbling on a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler missed one game, tried to play Sunday and wound up  
being knocked out again before halftime. He is questionable for 
next weekend's game against the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very good,'' Chandler said Monday. ``I have no idea  
about playing. I'm just trying to get it better before it gets 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already worse for the Falcons is the situation on the defensive  
line, where tackles Shane Dronett and Ed Jasper are both out for 
2-to-4 weeks. Dronett pulled his right calf muscle, while Jasper 
sustained ligament damage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentally, the entire team is suffering a severe case of  
shellshock. Although the Falcons have never put together 
consecutive winning seasons during their 34-year history, no one 
expected a start like this. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are losing, you never have the confidence,'' Reeves  
said. ``As I have said many times, winning breeds confidence, 
losing brings around the wrong kind of things: people 
second-guessing you, people talking about how bad you are playing. 
That is all you hear and all you read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, this is not what Carter had in mind when he signed  
with the Falcons as a free agent after eight mostly losing seasons 
in Tampa Bay and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to come into a situation where the team did as  
well as this team did a year ago, to come into a situation where 
expectations are so high and then collectively produce so little,'' 
he said. ``Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have such high 
expectations. That's the most difficult thing. We're on every 
sports show, every channel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only five teams have rebounded from an 0-3 start to make the  
playoffs, and it's little consolation that the Super Bowl champion 
Broncos are also winless after three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons owner Taylor Smith is confident Reeves can get things  
turned around, as he did during his first season in Atlanta. In 
1997, the Falcons were 1-7 at the midway point but won six of their 
final eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan is so consistent,'' Smith said. ``He knows how to handle  
things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He better hurry.

<HEADLINE> Report: FDA Officer Aided Diet Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A high-ranking U.S. Food and Drug  
Administration official helped a small businessman in Florida 
promote the popular diet drug fen-phen in 1995, during the height 
of the pill combination's popularity, newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the FDA never approved or endorsed fen-phen, which has  
since been linked with heart-valve problems, Dr. Michael Weintraub 
provided advice and patient referrals to a fledgling chain of 
weight-loss clinics dispensing fen-phen, The Philadelphia Inquirer 
reported Sunday and The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub suggested a list of doctors who might endorse the diet  
drug combination, talked to at least three potential clients and 
allowed his name to be used in advertising, said Tampa, Fla., 
attorney John Trevena, who founded Advantage Weight Control in 
1994. Weintraub denies allowing his name used in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub, who left the FDA in 1998 after five years and is now  
a pharmaceutical consultant, has not been investigated by the FDA 
for wrongdoing. Weintraub said his activities were similar to 
assistance he offered to other people who sought advice about 
fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't reject talking to people who called me up,''  
Weintraub told the Inquirer. ``I believed that the drugs could help 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub is largely credited for launching the fen-phen fad  
with a 1992 medical study that suggested combining fenfluramine, 
sold under the brand names Pondimin and Redux, and phentermine in 
an ``off-label'' combination use. Each drug was FDA approved, but 
the cocktail was not. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products Corp. marketed Pondimin and Redux until  
September 1997, when the FDA pushed for their withdrawal after a 
study linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
American Home Products now faces thousands of lawsuits from 
patients who claim to be hurt by them and is negotiating a 
settlement estimated at $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub joined the FDA in 1993, and eventually became director  
of over-the-counter-drug evaluation. Weintraub agreed to advise 
Trevena beginning in 1995, though he refused to be paid, citing 
government ethics policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months that followed, Trevena recommended names of  
prominent obesity experts who might serve as the center's medical 
director. He testified before the state medical board urging it not 
to ban fen-phen -- though he explained his remarks were not on 
behalf of the FDA -- and praised Trevena's centers to the Florida 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub also personally advised at least three prospective  
Trevena clients who were considering joining the program, Trevena 
said. After speaking with Weintraub, all three signed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, a client asked Weintraub for a referral to a  
weight-loss physician in her area. Weintraub's reply, written on 
FDA letterhead dated February 1995, gave her the name of Trevena's 
marketing consultant -- not a physician. 
</P>
<P>
	``He enthusiastically assisted us,'' Trevena told the Journal.  
</P>
<P>
	He said his business, which has since filed for bankruptcy,  
relied heavily on Weintraub's advice on such matters as how to 
monitor patients. Its publicity materials said the center used the 
``Weintraub Protocol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weintraub said he did suggest a name or two as possible medical  
directors and referred at least one patient to Trevena. He said 
that to anyone who asked about fen-phen he explained the possible 
side effects, ``potential and real,'' and stressed the need for a 
full physical exam and medical monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their three conversations, Trevena said he asked  
Weintraub whether his advice and help with the weight-loss clinic 
were ethical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Weintraub indicated that because of his high-level  
position and contacts within the FDA, he wasn't concerned about 
it,'' Trevena said. ``He said it wasn't a problem.''

<HEADLINE>  New Mariners Chair Makes Big Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Howard Lincoln got off to a fast start as  
chairman of the Seattle Mariners, offering Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex 
Rodriguez contracts he said would make them the best-paid players 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players have emphasized that their interest in remaining  
with the Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-78 before Monday 
night's game, hinges more on having a club that can make the 
playoffs than on their own contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking over Monday from John W. Ellis, chief executive of the  
franchise since 1992, Lincoln said the club's player payroll would 
be boosted to $65 million to $70 million, an increase of about 30 
percent after three years at roughly $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're operating on the assumption that that will be  
sufficient,'' Lincoln said. ``We are operating a business. We have 
to take into consideration revenues and costs... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're in good shape. I think this will put us, from a  
competitive standpoint, where we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without giving figures, Lincoln said the Mariners had made  
``definitive, written offers'' to Griffey and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are long-term contract proposals which, if accepted,  
would make these two players the highest-paid players in the 
130-year history of major league baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player was immediately reachable for comment. The  
Mariners played the Rangers Monday night in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners president Chuck Armstrong will continue to direct the  
search for a general manager, a task Lincoln said he hoped would be 
completed by Oct. 31, when the resignation of Woody Woodward takes 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Chuck to make the final decision,'' Lincoln said.  
``Certainly it's an organizational decision ... I'm certainly going 
to interview the final candidates and all that but Chuck will make 
the final call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's job is safe, he stressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have great confidence in Chuck,'' Lincoln said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, 56, has held the post under three sets of owners and  
was the longest tenured general manager in the majors. He announced 
his resignation Sept. 17, saying he was worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Ellis, grinning his widest grin in months.  
</P>
<P>
	``That 1,000-pound gorilla is gone from my back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellis is staying on the Mariners' board as chairman emeritus and  
also remains the club's representative to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was told about the impending  
change a couple of months ago, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Lincoln was ``a wise choice,'' American League  
president Gene Budig said in a statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the move had been circulating since the mid-July  
opening of Safeco Field, the Mariners' new open-air ballpark with a 
retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' home attendance this season was 2.9 million,  
second only to the 3.1 million of 1997, the last year they made the 
playoffs. On a per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent 
higher in the new ballpark than in the club's old digs at the 
nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been dogged by controversy over the Mariners'  
demand for more funding from King County to help cover $100 million 
in cost overruns on the $517 million project. Public officials 
contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln did not rule out legal action to try to force the  
county's hand but said the Mariners would continue to negotiate for 
mediation, an approach rejected in June by the Washington State 
Public Facilities District board that oversaw stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Ellis said he believed the Mariners will  
remain in Seattle for the duration of their 20-year lease on Safeco 
Field because, unlike the old Kingdome lease, it contains no escape 
clause based on attendance.

	HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, Hawaii (AP) -- Rescue crews  
scoured the smoky wreckage of a twin-engine plane searching for the 
bodies of 10 people killed in Hawaii's worst air disaster in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dead was the head of New Hampshire's corrections  
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage of the Big Island Air plane was spotted early  
Sunday about 9,800 feet up the Mauna Loa Volcano, an active volcano 
that soars to 13,600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims were badly burned and parts of the wreckage so  
charred that they ``just disintegrated'' in the hands of recovery 
crews, said Doug Lentz of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, in which 
the volcano is located. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of dismemberment and it was very difficult to  
discern all the bodies,'' Lentz said. ``There is some confusion as 
to whether we have all the bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were taken to Hilo Hospital, which said it had  
remains for only nine victims, Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers said the twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain slid about  
75 yards, rolled over and burned, but remained mostly intact, said 
Gail Minami, the park's operations supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain was reported overdue at  
Kona International Airport at 7:20 p.m. Saturday, said Marilyn 
Kali, spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The last contact from the plane came at 5:21 p.m., one hour  
after it took off from the airport, and the pilot did not say there 
were any problems at that time, Minami said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact there was no distress call means the pilot could have  
smashed into jagged lava without warning, Minami said. ``It was a 
hard landing, a hard impact,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a shock to us,'' said Roy Mann, Big Island Air's  
director of operations. ``It just simply hurts. Our hearts and our 
prayers go out to all those families that have been impacted by 
this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann declined to name the pilot but said that person had more  
than 10,000 hours of flight experience. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to release any information about the  
passengers. But in Concord, N.H., today, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said 
she had been informed that Hank Risley, head of the New Hampshire 
Department of Corrections, was among the victims. Risley, who was 
in his early 50s, had nearly 28 years of corrections experience 
when he took the state post early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and National  
Transportation Safety Board were due at the crash site today. The 
Army's Central Identification Laboratory, which normally works on 
identifying remains of missing servicemen, was asked to assist. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was one of two owned by Big Island Air, a 14-year-old  
tour company based in Kailua-Kona. The eight-seater was built in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a good part of the island is inaccessible by car, air  
tours are a popular way to see the island and its active volcanoes. 
Helicopters and small planes fly near bubbling summits and then 
over nearby valleys to see rainbows and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was Hawaii's worst since Oct. 28, 1989, when an Island  
Air DHC-6 Twin Otter crashed on the island of Molokai, killing 20 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1974, there have been five fatal air crashes in and around  
the park, killing 43 people.

<HEADLINE> Antibiotic May Kill Resistant Germs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A drug described as the first entirely new  
kind of antibiotic in more than 35 years is expected to give 
doctors a fresh weapon against germs that are resistant to anything 
science now has. 
</P>
<P>
	The medicine, called Zyvox, appears to work as well as standard  
antibiotics against garden-variety germs and can also kill those 
that are resistant to everything else, including vancomycin, now 
the drug of last resort for stubborn infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers presented the results of several large studies on  
the drug Monday at a conference sponsored by the American Society 
for Microbiology. Its maker, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, plans to seek 
approval for Zyvox from the Food and Drug Administration and other 
regulatory agencies around the world by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a crying need for new antibiotics'' for use against  
common but potentially deadly infections, said Dr. Jack Remington 
of Stanford University. Zyvox ``is the first new antibiotic in the 
world in 35 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the need for new antibiotics is critical because  
standard medicines are quickly losing their punch against many 
common microbes. Zyvox is likely to be reserved for especially ill 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox will join another new antibiotic, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's  
Synercid, which was approved by the FDA last week. Although 
available for the first time in the United States, Synercid is one 
of a class of antibiotics that has long been used in Europe as an 
additive to animal feeds. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Zyvox is said by its developers to be entirely new,  
a synthetic compound designed from scratch to attack the bacterial 
life cycle at an entirely different point from other medicines. 
Because the drug will be different from anything that bacteria have 
encountered before, resistance should be rare, at least at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that resistance will be very slow to emerge,'' said  
Dr. George Eliopoulos of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
However, at least three cases of Zyvox resistance have already been 
seen during experimental use. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox works only against gram-positive bacteria, so-called  
because of the way they turn purple when stained. Worldwide, more 
than half of all serious infections treated in hospitals are gram 
positive. These include staph, strep and enterococci bacteria that 
cause pneumonia and infections of the skin, bloodstream and urinary 
tract. 
</P>
<P>
	Often these infections are caught while patients are in the  
hospital for other things, and they tend to be resistant to many of 
the standard antibiotics in use since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 patients have been treated so far with Zyvox, most  
of them in a variety of comparison studies. However, the drug has 
also been given to 550 patients who could not use other 
antibiotics. Dr. Carol A. Kauffman of the Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the drug cleared up the infection 
in three-quarters of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Zyvox studies outlined:  
</P>
<P>
	--In 397 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, Zyvox plus  
aztreonam cured 66 percent of patients, compared with 68 percent on 
vancomycin plus aztreonam. 
</P>
<P>
	--In treatment of 526 patients who caught pneumonia outside  
hospitals, 91 percent got better on Zyvox, compared with 89 percent 
on cefpodoxime. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 591 patients with complicated skin infections, Zyvox worked  
on 91 percent, compared with 86 percent on oxacillin. 
</P>
<P>
	--For treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant staph  
bacteria, Zyvox succeeded in 77 percent of patients, compared with 
75 percent on vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	--Among 145 patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus,  
Zyvox worked in 89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to have drugs with new modes of activity,''  
said Dr. William Craig of the University of Wisconsin. ``Most of 
what have come out in recent years have been me-too drugs'' that 
bacteria are already becoming resistant to. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox, known generically as linezolid, is the first of a class  
of drugs called oxazolidinones. Dr. Donald H. Batts of Pharmacia &AMP; 
Upjohn said the last entirely new category of antibiotics was the 
quinolones, discovered 35 years ago.

	The Republican presidential candidates reactions Monday to Vice  
President Quayle's departure from the race for the GOP nomination: 

</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you have your heart set on a race and it

quiet integrity that is rare in politics today. It has not gone 
unnoticed.'' --Steve Forbes 

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Heinz Buys Stake in Nain Food Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. has struck a strategic alliance  
with The Hain Food Group Inc. aimed at combining Hain's natural and 
organic brands with Heinz's manufacturing and purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh-based Heinz will pay $100 million for a 19.5 percent  
stake in Hain, which is based in Uniondale, N.Y., under the deal 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz expects 15 percent to 18 percent growth in the natural and  
organic foods market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The natural foods industry is growing ... and we expect it to  
continue to grow, so Heinz must find a way to participate in that 
growth,'' said Joseph Jimenez, president and chief executive of 
Heinz North America. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Heinz also conveys its Earth's Best organic  
baby food brand to Hain, which has been marketing and distributing 
the product for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance gets Heinz into the organic food market through  
Hain's distribution routes in North America at a relatively low 
cost, about 1 percent of Heinz' more than $9 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz's $100 million investment representing one-third of Hain's  
projected $300 million in revenue for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hain has 3,500 brands, some leading organic or natural food  
categories such as snack chips and soy products, but has been 
caught between spending to expand its market and investing in more 
capacity. Heinz helps to solve the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows us to invest in brands, not in bricks and mortar  
in building plants. Heinz has the capacity,'' said Irwin Simon, 
Hain's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz also expects to bring some organic foods it currently  
sells in India and parts of Europe into North American markets 
through Hain's distribution system, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Johnson, Heinz's chief executive, said the deal should  
deliver earnings growth to both companies this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns analyst Terry Bivens wasn't so sure Heinz would see  
such an immediate benefit. But he said the deal would give 
slow-growing Heinz a foothold in a fast-growing food business, and 
puts serious muscle behind Hain. 
</P>
<P>
	One example: Heinz's strong relationship with Kroger would help  
Hain get its organic and natural foods in the grocer's new Nature's 
Market store-within-a store, Bivens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez and Malcolm Ritchie, a Heinz executive vice president  
and president of Heinz Europe, will join Hain's board.

<HEADLINE> Sela Ward Plays Single Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This week's ``Once and Again'' starts with Lily,  
the 40-year-old single mother played by Sela Ward, exploding with 
an anxious confession: ``I have NO idea what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, what she's doing is nothing less than picking up the  
pieces of her life after the breakup of her marriage. She's 
rebuilding her identity and coping with guilt for what divorce has 
done to her two daughters. Diciest of all, she's risking romance 
with Rick, a similarly damaged single father of two. 
</P>
<P>
	So that's what Lily is doing on ``Once and Again,'' which airs  
Tuesday at 10 p.m. EDT on ABC, then repeats Friday on cable's 
Lifetime at 11 p.m. EDT. And she must be doing something right. A 
critical favorite long before its debut, the series last week gave 
ABC the highest rating among adults 18-to-49 of any network's 
premiering drama in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	What that audience encountered was a refreshingly adult drama  
with the wry humor and bittersweet honesty befitting its creators, 
Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, until now best known for the 
age-defining ``thirtysomething.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers also found a splendid cast, headed up by Billy Campbell  
as Rick and Ward in quite a change from her flamboyant role on the 
sometimes racy, sometimes wacky ``Sisters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But could the sleekly gorgeous Sela Ward make Lily's plight  
convincing? The matter was settled in the premiere episode's first 
moments: 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever wanted, I think, was to be safe,'' Lily mused.  
``That's the funny thing, because I never chose the safe thing. I 
would try, and somehow it would always end up being unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of that poignant speech, Ward laughs.  
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' she declares, ``was the first paragraph in the script  
and the thing that hooked me. I went, `Ohmigod! This is how I feel! 
Everything in my life is about safety!' And I kept reading and the 
writing was so good, I couldn't get it out of my head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what's so interesting about Lily: You get to explore  
her insecurities and neuroses, and then transcend that. With this 
role, you have somewhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In important ways, ``Once and Again'' is a very grown-up drama.  
It dares to tilt toward being about adults who have kids, not about 
kids who have parents. The payoff: Everything becomes more complex. 
And richer. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, just watch Lily and Rick, laden with  
responsibilities, try to find a night they're both free for a date. 
</P>
<P>
	And as they separately anticipate sex with each other, hear Lily  
fret to her sister, ``I've got two kids! How can I take my clothes 
off?'' While, elsewhere, Rick's business partner is pressing him 
portentously, ``What's her body like? Two kids!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say that, besides its stretch marks and bulging  
Filofaxes, ``Once and Again'' doesn't also deal with universal 
issues: love, family, trying to learn from one another. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is deft in tracking parallel issues as they unfold  
for different generations. This week we see Lily and Rick in the 
car outside a restaurant, making out like teen-agers -- while, back 
at Rick's house, his teen-age son Eli is in bed with a girl. 
Clearly, this isn't just a show about divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been divorced,'' says Ward. Curled up on the sofa  
in a Manhattan hotel's bar, she bathes a sore throat with hot tea 
as she reflects on her series' potentially broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get married till I was 35. But before that, I would  
have serial monogamy of three, four years at a time. I feel like 
I've been divorced three times over. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to look far for divorce and all the people it  
affects,'' she notes. ``And kids can totally relate to being in a 
family of divorce, with their parents dating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with her brown eyes a bit watery and her apologies for  
being a little spaced, the fluish Ward still glows. Those eyebrows 
arch like boomerangs. Her smile is luminescent. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Meridian, Miss., she first found success modeling,  
then moved into acting with roles in such features as ``Nothing in 
Common,'' ``The Fugitive'' and ``54.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For five seasons she played Teddy, struggling artist and  
recovering alcoholic, on NBC's ``Sisters,'' for which she won the 
1994 Emmy for Best Actress in a Drama. 
</P>
<P>
	And now she wants the world to know: There's life after 40.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sort of loaded for bear,'' says the 43-year-old Ward,  
tapping a Southernism, ``because I've been exec-producing this 
documentary for Lifetime on beauty and ageism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're living in this youth-obsessed culture where the message  
we get -- especially from the entertainment industry and advertising 
-- is that our life is over at 40. And I resent it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With her documentary, which Lifetime will air next spring, ``I'm  
doing my little part to give a woman, or a man, a chance to think, 
`You know what, I can make a different choice.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, choices are what Lily faces, in the extreme. It isn't  
safe. But it's fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`ALLY': Tonight at 9 p.m. EDT, you can catch a rerun of the Fox  
comedy-drama ``Ally McBeal.'' Or Tuesday at 8 p.m., you can see the 
premiere of ``Ally'' -- which, come to think of it, is sort of a 
rerun, too. In this inspiration of repurposing from producer David 
E. Kelley, ``Ally'' Lite alchemizes old footage from the original 
show and some fresh footage with star Calista Flockhart and the 
rest of the cast, into a half-hour format that steers clear of 
lawyerly pursuits to dwell on the comedy in Ally's world. Sounds 
like something old, something new, much borrowed, and a little bit 
-- well, not blue, but sometimes racy.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Amax Mulls Merger Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The boards Cyprus Amax Minerals and  
Asarco Inc. have authorized managers to explore alternatives to 
their planned merger, both companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements follow moves last week by two other suitors of  
the copper rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge on Wednesday upped its bid for Cyprus  
Amax and Asarco by $1 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday Mexican copper mining giant Grupo Mexico SA, which  
owns a 10 percent stake in Asarco, said it would offer to buy all 
of Asarco's common shares it doesn't already own for $26 a share -- 
topping Phelps Dodge's bid for New York-based Asarco by about $27.4 
million, or 69 cents a share based on Monday's closing stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Englewood-based Cyprus and Asarco have rebuffed two previous  
stock-only offers from Phelps Dodge. Asarco has not commented 
specifically on the Grupo Mexico bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus and Asarco shareholders were scheduled to vote on their  
merger Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cyprus officials said in a written statement Monday the  
company will consider its alternatives, including the proposal from 
Phelps Dodge. They declined to elaborate on the discussions. Senior 
Vice President Gerald Malys didn't return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco, in a statement said managers were authorized ``to  
explore all available strategic alternatives that could maximize 
shareholder value.'' Those options include merging with Cyrpus or 
another company, a sale of some assets, acquisitions or a change in 
its capitalization or dividend policy, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division last week  
signed off on Phelps Dodge Corp.'s proposal to acquire the other 
two companies. The deal would merge three of the country's four 
largest copper companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Asarco shares closed up $3.37 1/2, at $29.93 3/4, on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Cyprus Max rose 93 3/4 cents, to 
$19.56 1/4, while Phelps Dodge shares were up $2.06 1/4, at $56.62 1/2, both 
on the Big Board.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An antibiotic designed from scratch to

<HEADLINE> IMF Offers Aid to Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said today it  
would provide financial assistance to Ecuador if the country makes 
good-faith efforts with creditors'' to resolve debt difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador announced Sunday night it would default on slightly less  
than half of the $98 million in Brady bond payments due this week. 
The Quito government also said it would immediately begin talks 
with creditors to restructure its total $6 billion in Brady debt. 
</P>
<P>
	With the announcement, Ecuador became the first country to  
default officially on payments of bonds named for Nicholas Brady, a 
former U.S. treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the IMF said Managing Director Michel Camdessus  
``regrets that to date Ecuador appears not to have found it 
possible to enter into negotiations with creditors, with a view to 
reaching a comprehensive resolution of these difficulties in a 
collaborative manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Camdessus ``continues to urge authorities to  
establish a collaborative framework for negotiations with its 
creditors with the objective of reaching agreement on a 
comprehensive financing package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a package would provide Ecuador with sufficient cash while  
it dealt with its economic programs and tried to return to 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador is seeking $400 million in aid from the IMF, which also  
would like to see the government adopt certain belt-tightening 
measures in addition to reaching agreement with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Better, the Ecuadorean Central Bank president, said Sunday  
in Washington that he was optimistic the country's decision on 
Brady debt wouldn't hurt chances of an agreement with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus Reaches $115 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today increased its  
estimate of the rapidly growing budget surplus, saying it should 
hit at least $115 billion in fiscal 1999, the largest in American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a landmark achievement for our economy,'' President  
Clinton said in a Rose Garden announcement, scribbling the new 
figure on a chart for the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``And when you consider where we were just seven years ago, it's  
as great an American comeback as the Ryder Cup was yesterday,'' he 
said, referring to the U.S. team's come-from-behind victory in the 
golf team classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger-than-expected surplus likely will prompt new  
Republican calls for major tax cuts for Americans. Clinton vetoed a 
$792 billion tax cut bill last week as ``too big, too bloated'' and 
urged passage of a cut in the range of $250 billion to $300 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The president called anew on Republicans to work with the  
administration on fixing Social Security, Medicare and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do all that and still have an affordable tax cut for  
the middle class and pay down our debt so that by 2015 we are 
debt-free for the first time since 1835, when Andrew Jackson was 
president,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress should not ``throw in the towel'' and put  
matters aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pessimistic,'' the president said. ``We've still got  
plenty of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders are struggling to adjourn Congress by Oct.  
29. They suggested Clinton's veto had killed chances for sweeping 
tax reductions this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the higher surplus figure ``is further proof that  
we're on the right road to prosperity. Our nation has come a long 
way in a short time. In 1992, the budget deficit was $290 billion, 
projected to rise above $400 billion this year,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the administration had estimated the surplus  
for fiscal 1999 -- which ends Thursday -- at $99 billion, but the 
booming economy and larger than expected tax revenues pushed the 
figure higher. The $115 billion figure would break the record $69 
billion surplus last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after adjusting for inflation, it is still the largest  
surplus in American history, the administration said. The 1999 
surplus would be about 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product, 
the largest on this basis since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he was not dismayed by the prospect of  
political deadlock with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I think if the past is any measure, one way or the other,  
the taxpayers are going to be all right, because we can do pretty 
well by conflict, I suppose, and eventually drag this out to where 
we have at least got a decent education budget, we're still paying 
down the debt,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Developments in War on Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some other developments this year in the war on cancer:  
</P>
<P>
	--March 16: An enzyme that normally powers cells has been found  
to also promote the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors, a 
discovery researchers say could lead to new drugs to fight cancer. 
The scientists say that without the energy supplied by the enzyme 
ATP synthase, tumors would not grow beyond the size of a pinhead 
because they could not develop the blood vessels needed to receive 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	--March 23: Injecting chemotherapy directly into a tumor and  
cutting off its blood supply can double the survival rate of adults 
with colon cancer that has spread to the liver, a medical 
researcher says. 
</P>
<P>
	--April 14: Scientists report that an immune-system booster  
derived from cow bile has shown promise against pancreatic cancer, 
the deadliest of all malignancies. Though it is probably no cure 
for most patients, the drug Virulizin seems to work about as well 
as the standard medicine with far fewer side effects. The next step 
will be to try giving them together. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sept. 9: An experimental drug may relieve some of the miserable  
side effects of cancer treatment, allowing stronger doses of 
chemotherapy and radiation, researchers say. Ironically, the drug, 
pifithrin, works by briefly blocking a gene that is a natural 
defense against cancer. Although the drug has been used only in 
mice, researchers hope to have it ready for human tests in about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sept. 16: Researchers report that antithrombin, a protein that  
helps regulate blood clotting, can be changed into a cancer fighter 
that starves tumors, blocking cancer by preventing blood vessel 
formation. The action is similar to two other proteins, endostatin 
and angiostatin, found last year. Human trials on those are to 
start soon.

<HEADLINE> La. Governor Favored in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- His ethics have been questioned, he has had  
to weather a scandal surrounding his secret dealings with a former 
Ku Klux Klan leader and his chief opponent just won the endorsement 
of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Republican Gov. Mike Foster is the odds-on favorite  
to win re-election in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The question appears to be not whether he will win, but whether  
he will take more than 50 percent of the vote in the Oct. 23 
primary, in which all 12 candidates will appear on one ballot 
regardless of party. If no one wins a majority, the top two 
finishers head to a Nov. 20 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, a contractor from the southern Louisiana town of  
Franklin, is riding high on voter satisfaction with a growing state 
economy, an overhaul of the state's higher education system, new 
standards for elementary and secondary schools and reforms designed 
to lower the liability of business and property owners in personal 
injury lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known among his challengers is U.S. Rep. William Jefferson,  
a New Orleans Democrat who once served with Foster in the state 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Should he win, Jefferson would be Louisiana's first black  
governor since Reconstruction. His effort got a boost Monday from 
President Clinton, who was in New Orleans to raise money and rally 
the Democratic troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should only vote for him if you think he'd be the best  
governor. But if you think he'd be the best governor and you let 
him be defeated, it would be a terrible thing,'' Clinton said 
during a $2,500-per-person fund raiser at the New Orleans mansion 
of horror novelist Anne Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit added about $1 million to the $425,000 Jefferson has  
for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson said Foster hasn't done enough to improve education  
and promised a statewide effort to rebuild crumbling schools and 
hire more and better paid teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring that message, Clinton visited the Sophie B. Wright  
Middle School in New Orleans. It was built in 1912 and has not had 
a significant renovation since the 1950s, principal Charlotte 
Matthew said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the race is Tom Greene, a Republican state senator who  
could steal some of Foster's conservative voters. He has a built-in 
base -- fellow Christian conservatives unhappy that Foster has not 
done enough to stop the spread of legal gambling in Louisiana. But 
he has little money, about $50,000 on hand compared to about $2.7 
million for Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	With even less cash on hand is Baton Rouge attorney Phil Preis,  
who appears to have the longest shot among the four candidates with 
statewide name recognition. Preis, a Democrat who has never held 
public office, spent more than $1 million of his own money in the 
1995 governor's race and wound up with 9 percent in a crowded 
field. He had only about $38,000 in contributions on hand last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Preis and Jefferson both have repeatedly criticized Foster's  
relationship with former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the state Board of Ethics fined Foster  
$20,000 for failing to report more than $150,000 in payments to the 
ex-Klansman for a computerized list of potential supporters 
compiled by Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the payments barely affected Foster's popularity,  
according to an independent poll released in June: His approval 
rating fell from 79 percent to 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has said he did not realize the failure to report was an  
ethics violation and that he tried to keep the purchase secret 
because ``it ain't real cool to put out there that you're buying 
something from David Duke.''

<HEADLINE> Shaquille O'Neal, Cosby Back Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former New York Knicks All-Star Bill Bradley  
may be in the basketball Hall of Fame, but Democratic presidential 
rival Al Gore picked up an endorsement Monday from one of the 
game's biggest superstars, Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, an All-Star center for the Los Angeles Lakers, joined  
entertainer Bill Cosby in endorsing the vice president for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that you represent the best opportunity we have to  
inspire young people to be better Americans,'' O'Neal said in a 
letter that was read at a fund-raiser for Gore at the Bethesda, 
Md., home of lobbyist Weldon Latham. 
</P>
<P>
	The event raised about $250,000 for Gore's campaign, officials  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosby, who regaled the group of about 250 Gore supporters with a  
30-minute comedy routine that made no mention of politics, said: 
``This election is a no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaquille O'Neal is my biggest supporter,'' Gore said in a  
joking reference to the towering 7-foot-1 NBA star. He also 
promised the mostly black audience that ``the progress we've made 
in civil rights this century is just the foundation of what will 
happen in the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal also sent Gore a present: a pair of his used, custom-made  
basketball shoes. Gore peeked inside and declared them to be a size 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the endorsements was well-received by Gore's campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ``These two are  
very prominent Americans who have both transcended their 
professions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has a 2-to-1 lead over Bradley among blacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, has courted  
blacks actively during the campaign, which he has said is based on 
a theme of racial unity. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Gore was given headliner status at the  
annual dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who was not invited to speak at the dinner, held a  
campaign event where he received the endorsement of several 
prominent blacks, including actors Spike Lee and Samuel L. Jackson 
and Harvard University author and professor Cornel West. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also has actively chased the financial support and  
endorsements of professional athletes, including NBA players. His 
former teammate, Phil Jackson, the former Chicago Bulls coach, held 
a fund-raiser in Chicago in July with several NBA stars, including 
Willis Reed and John Havlicek, that raised $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Gore was endorsed by House Minority Whip Rep. David  
Bonior of Michigan and Reps. Lane Evans of Ohio and David Obey of 
Wisconsin. Gore also has received the support of more than 100 
Democratic members of Congress. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
also endorsed Gore on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bradley was endorsed by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan, D-N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Y2K Readiness Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers and health care experts said Monday  
they were concerned that doctors, hospitals and other Medicare 
health insurance providers will not be prepared to handle the Y2K 
computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook is alarming,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the House Government Reform subcommittee monitoring the 
year 2000 computer issue. As of last week, he said, less than 2 
percent of the 230,000 hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other 
health care providers who submit claims to Medicare had tested 
their computer systems with Medicare contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Christoph, chief information officer for the Health Care  
Financing Administration, which oversees the Medicare program, told 
Horn's panel that the HCFA has fixed its internal computer systems 
and sees no interruptions from its end in servicing the 39 million 
senior citizens eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	But he agreed that ``we now see our greatest risk to the program  
as the uncertainties in the readiness of our partners; namely, our 
Medicare providers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has worried those monitoring the health care industry is  
the low level of response to surveys seeking information from 
doctors and hospitals about Y2K compliance, and how few of those 
responding have actually tested to ensure their computers are ready 
for the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Until tests are carried out, said Joel Willemssen of the General  
Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress, ``the 
ability of these entities to process Medicare claims in a future 
date environment is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christoph said the HCFA is carrying out an extensive outreach  
program involving an 800-number, a Web site (www.hcfa.gov/y2k), 
year 2000 ``jump start kits'' and mailings to its 1.1 million 
Medicare providers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all Medicare managed care organizations are required to  
certify that their systems will perform into the new millennium, 
but reviews of the contingency plans for national chains indicate 
that while 50 percent are reasonable or in need of minor 
improvements, the other 50 percent need major improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly 7 million in Medicare HMO programs require  
preauthorization for speciality care, said Joseph R. Baker of the 
Medicare Rights Center, and computer breakdowns could mean that 
these people can't get authorization for the care they need, ``with 
potentially devastating consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Whitney Addington, president of the American College of  
Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, said there is a 
high level of Y2K awareness among doctors and many have taken 
corrective measures. But many haven't tested their systems, he 
said, and this could lead to a ``last minute 'debugging' demand 
that could overwhelm available resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Senate panel following Y2K developments, in a  
report on the status of Y2K compliance 100 days before the new 
year, also pointed to the health care industry as an area of major 
concern. It concluded that while large hospitals and federal 
agencies such as the HCFA are in good shape, there was a real 
possibility of disruptions at the local doctor and rural or small 
inner-city hospital level. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits of the year,  
and will not be able to differentiate between 2000 and 1900. That 
could cause computer systems to malfunction or break down.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Funds for Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Resisting doctors' orders to rest his  
strained vocal chords, President Clinton raised money today for a 
Democratic congressman who hopes to become Louisiana's governor and 
pushed Congress to increase education funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never met a child that couldn't learn, or a school that  
couldn't turn around,'' Clinton told a group of students, parents 
and educators at Sophie B. Wright Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual budget battle is just shaping up with only days left  
in the current fiscal year. Clinton, who announced that federal 
budget surplus projections had reached a record high $115 billion 
before leaving the White House this morning, vetoed a massive 
Republican tax cut last week that he said would have squandered the 
opportunity to shore up Medicare and invest in education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what are we going to do with our  
prosperity?'' he said. ``You know that we've got a lot of 
challenges out there, and you know as well as I do that the modern 
economy requires more education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the education address, Clinton was speaking to two  
fund-raisers for Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., who has his eye on 
the state's governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was making the trip two days after his doctors diagnosed  
edema of his vocal chords, essentially strain from talking too 
much. They recommended that the president speak only when necessary 
for the next 10 days -- a tough task given Clinton's chatty nature 
and the series of fund-raising appearances awaiting him on the West 
Coast at the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very difficult, given the commitments that he's  
made and the work schedule that he has, to do exactly what the 
doctors have recommended,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is concerned about the hoarseness and his  
ability to continue to make the fine speeches he makes around the 
country. We're going to do our best to make sure we get him the 
rest he needs,'' the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton vetoed the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut  
proposal and called on Congress to work with him on achieving a 
compromise over spending priorities before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a visit to Norfolk, Va., days before that veto, the president  
urged Congress to ``leave politics at the schoolhouse door'' and 
embrace his plan for tax breaks to help school districts repair, 
expand and upgrade schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, about 25,000 school buildings -- roughly a third of 
the nation's public schools -- are in need of extensive repairs or 
must be replaced altogether. The GAO estimated that simply 
repairing existing schools would cost $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's bond proposal for school modernization would provide  
$24.8 billion in tax credit bonds over two years, in the idea that 
the amount would make it cheaper for local school districts to 
modernize up to 6,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	According to census figures, school districts nationwide spent  
$18.7 billion on school construction in 1996, the latest year for 
which data was available. The districts spent $15.9 billion in 1995 
and $14.4 billion in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Underwood Found Bleeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood of the Miami Dolphins  
underwent surgery after police found him on the street with a 
life-threatening cut on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He was operated on at Sparrow Hospital and listed in stable  
condition today. Hospital officials are talking to his doctors and 
family and plan a medical update later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police do not know how Underwood was injured, but a crime is not  
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was cut. We're still investigating the nature of the  
injury,'' said Sgt. Linda Doherty-Wright, a Lansing police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty-Wright said police discovered Underwood lying on a  
street about two blocks south of the state Capitol in downtown 
Lansing about 12:45 p.m. Sunday. The site is near a park and a 
library and about a block west of the city's main business street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Underwood while on their way to answer a call in  
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing police said Underwood had been arrested Saturday night  
and released on bond, but had no information on the charge. No one 
at the Ingham County prosecutor's office could be reached this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	WLNS-TV, WSYM-TV and the Detroit Free Press reported that  
Underwood had been arrested on a charge of failing to pay child 
support. The player has 17-month-old twins who live with their 
mother in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was arrested about 7 p.m. Saturday and taken to the  
Ingham County Jail in Mason. About 10 p.m., an unidentified woman 
posted his $500 bond. But he declined to leave immediately, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stayed up in the jail about an hour after the bond was  
posted, and we had to kick him out,'' Ingham County Sheriff Gene 
Wrigglesworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Kay Van Ellis told the newspaper the woman who bailed him  
out waited 45 minutes, then went home and returned about 11:45 p.m. 
and left with Underwood. She said Underwood had been deep in 
conversation with another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Free Press reported Underwood was shirtless when he was  
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins were awaiting more details on the defensive end.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our hopes foremost are about his health,'' team spokesman  
Harvey Greene said. ``But until we have additional information, it 
would be premature for the club to comment on his situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Nick Saban said: ``Our thoughts and our  
prayers are with Dimitrius and we hope for a full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings made Underwood their top draft pick, and  
29th overall, in April even though he had missed his senior season 
at Michigan State with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1 but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood explained his departure by saying he was torn between  
a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to support his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. He was claimed on waivers by  
Miami after 23 other teams passed on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings. He's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during preseason and was  
expected to begin working out again this week. The Dolphins did not 
play Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Broncos on Wrong End of Three-Peat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After two years atop the NFL, the Denver Broncos  
are being reminded how the other half lives. They have quickly 
become bottom feeders pressed to explain their shortcomings with 
each loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's improbable 0-3 start -- the worst for a defending Super  
Bowl champion since 1987 -- has blindsided the Broncos, who remain 
winless without longtime quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expected this. Everybody believes we're better than  
this,'' defensive end Harald Hasselbach said Monday. ``I can't 
really come out and say that we are. It's up to us to show that we 
are. We're searching for the answers from within. We'll know them 
when we get them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A quarterback change apparently is not part of the immediate  
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan was asked repeatedly Monday whether he would  
consider replacing starter Brian Griese with Bubby Brister or Chris 
Miller. He defended Griese each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian's our starter. He's going to be our starter,'' Shanahan  
said. ``I know he's taking a lot of heat right now, but that's the 
nature of this business. What I've got to do is evaluate who I 
think is the best to go in there and execute. I've been dealing 
with the quarterbacks for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Shanahan was asked if he was telling reporters  
they should get used to seeing Griese as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not telling you anything,'' Shanahan said. He then paused.  
``Yeah, I guess that's what I'm telling you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Griese as the starter, the Broncos are in the midst of  
their longest losing streak since Shanahan took over as coach in 
1995. It would be unfair, however, to cast all the blame on the 
second-year quarterback, who had just three pass attempts in his 
rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, Denver is allowing 155 yards rushing per game.  
Kansas City's Kimble Anders ran for a career-high 142 yards against 
the Broncos in Week 2 and Mike Alstott had a career-best 131 yards 
Sunday for Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Denver's running game has disappeared. Reigning  
league MVP Terrell Davis, who ran for 2,008 yards last year, is 
averaging 64 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a running threat has prompted opponents to challenge  
Griese to beat them through the air. The results have been dismal 
as Denver has scored 41 points -- 62 fewer than through three games 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely need a spark,'' said Miller, who shrugs off talk  
that he should be the starting quarterback. ``The only thing that 
will spark us is winning on Sunday. If you can do that, then you 
can start working off a positive, build some confidence and get the 
thing headed in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History says it may be too late for the Broncos to resurrect  
their quest for a third straight championship. No NFL team has 
started the season 0-3 and won a divisional playoff game, let alone 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am personally not a guy who likes to draw from history,''  
Hasselbach said. ``I believe that anything is possible. I think we 
create our own fate, so to speak. It's up to us how good we want to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan believes the Broncos, who play host to the New York  
Jets (0-3) on Sunday, can turn their season around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of confidence in our offense that we can still  
put the ball in the end zone,'' he said. ``I am frustrated and 
disappointed, but like I said, `What do you do about it?' Are you 
going to keep on crying about it or go try to get something done?''

<HEADLINE> Quayle Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dan Quayle, the former vice president who  
hoped to overcome long odds and ridicule to step up to the 
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, today gave up his White 
House dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Phoenix news conference, Quayle said, ``There's a time to  
stay and there's a time to fold. There's a time to know when to 
leave the stage. Thus today I am announcing that I will no longer 
be a candidate for president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle thus became the latest victim of Republican front-runner  
George W. Bush's juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was facing a campaign where the front-runner would have up  
to $100 million to spend, and an unprecedented frontloading of the 
primary system made the task for me of winning the nomination of my 
party virtually impossible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle pledged to work to unite the Republican Party and said he  
would support the nominee. ``I want to see the Republicans 
recapture the White House,'' he said. ``It is time that we restore 
honor, dignity and decency to the Oval Office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure winnows the GOP field to eight major  
Republican candidates, and will increase speculation about the 
finance and political health of the remaining contenders. There is 
already turbulence within the nomination race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has made inroads against Bush in  
New Hampshire, formally kicked off his campaign today. Conservative 
commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting the GOP to seek 
the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush said he wished Quayle well. ``I think any time  
you have your heart set on a race and it doesn't go well, it's got 
to be a tough call,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole said she did not think Quayle's departure from  
the race would have a major impact on the campaign. ``Obviously I'm 
going to look quickly to see if there are not people who might not 
like to join the Dole team,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. They are most likely to pick up Quayle supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he believed that he could have won the New Hampshire  
primary but that he wouldn't have had the resources to compete in 
the crowded early campaign calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he leaves the race with his ``head held high. I am proud  
of what I accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's advisers said the former vice president decided to quit  
this weekend after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and campaign 
manager Kyle McSlarrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, has been running a debt since early in the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reality just hit home that this wasn't to be,''  
said former Sen. Dan Coats, a fellow Indiana Republican and Quayle 
supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he won in New Hampshire, where to you go from there?''  
asked Coats. ``You don't have the funds ... and you're up against a 
candidate who can outspend you 100-to-1 if he wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reality was harsh for the resilient conservative.  
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
were beaten by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 
1992, the former Indiana senator sought to push beyond a history of 
political gaffes and controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles that faced Quayle was what one  
supporter labeled the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day 
the then-vice president misspelled the word in a classroom full of 
school children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch 
line for countless jokes, cementing for many American the 
perception that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said during his April announcement speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Already Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire have dropped out of 
the GOP primary contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, cited Bush's  
fund-raising prowess as a reason for leaving. Smith is considering 
a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare  
to file their October finance statements, which will disclose how 
well or poorly their fund-raising operations are doing. Quayle is 
not the only Republican candidate having a hard time competing with 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole is aggressively trying to raise money to compete against  
Bush. Her situation may be even more precarious, given the fact 
that she is courting the same moderate and establishment 
Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Quayle has no regrets about his campaign and leaves  
buoyed by a recent national poll that showed him with 9 percent of 
the vote -- a distant second to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been unable to break out of the second-tier of candidates  
in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, however. Also in 
those ranks are radio host Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's campaign has been on the ropes since Aug. 14, when he  
finished near the back of the pack in Iowa's nonbinding straw poll. 
He is still convinced he could fare well -- even win -- the New 
Hampshire primary. Despite that, the concentrated primary calendar 
would give him little time to raise enough money to capitalize on a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income 
families. He also portrayed himself as the best qualified potential 
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Victims Thankful for Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- Curt Sherrod, like hundreds exhausted  
from preserving family keepsakes and cleaning the mud from their 
flooded homes, used the Sabbath to take refuge from the storm's 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old was among 800 people who attended an outdoor  
service Sunday at a Rocky Mount church, one of scores across 
eastern North Carolina where prayers of thanks were lifted toward 
heaven. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a time like this, you really realize what God is all  
about,'' Sherrod said at Englewood Baptist Church. ``He gives you 
the courage to get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the region flooded by Hurricane Floyd, church services  
were held Sunday wherever a dry spot could be found, from parking 
lots to day-care centers to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Though never threatened by flood waters, Englewood Baptist  
Church offered people a place to donate items, to get a hot meal 
and to pray. The Rev. Donald Pope alluded to that during his sermon 
he delivered under overcast skies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to feed them; we're going to clothe them; we're  
going to give them deodorant, praise God,'' Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., attended the service and offered  
his thanks for the donations that have poured into communities like 
Rocky Mount. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely amazing to watch how God's children  
respond,'' Edwards said. ``The response both here and all over this 
state has been absolutely heroic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In hard-hit Tarboro, about 50 parishioners of His Majesty Church  
and a group of volunteers from Axton, Va., held a church service in 
the lobby of a day-care center, opening with the hymn ``It's All 
Right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, the eight volunteers had helped pull waterlogged  
items from the church, which had 9 1/2 feet of water inside at the 
height of the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the midst of the storm, God sent us some people, and I  
thank him for giving us these people, because they put a face on 
Christ,'' said Barbara Pittman, whose husband is the bishop of the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	While floodwaters continued to recede Sunday, many rivers  
remained above flood stage and some were not expected to drop below 
that until Friday. Parts of eastern North Carolina also were 
expected to see some showers and thunderstorms today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking for any torrential rainfalls. This is just  
normal rainfall, from a quarter to a half-inch,'' said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Ruth Aiken in Raleigh. ``Any amount 
of rainfall when people are still in shelters is going to be a 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,790 people remained in shelters Sunday, their homes  
either inundated with water or unsafe to be in. The state 
agriculture department estimated last week that Floyd killed 30,000 
hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports from Edgecombe County, one of the hardest hit  
areas following the 28 inches of rain that fell over a two-week 
period, place the home losses at $43 million, with 1,200 homes 
damaged or destroyed. With countless homes still under water, that 
number was expected to rise.

<HEADLINE> Adoption Records Opening Law Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Monday upheld  
the constitutionality of a law allowing adopted children to see 
their adoption records even if their birth parents want the 
information kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee case has been watched by organizations in other  
states and could lead to similar legislation elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect is going to be felt nationwide,'' said Jane Nast,  
president of the American Adoption Congress. Nast said similar laws 
are planned in Oregon, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 5-0 decision, Chief Justice Riley Anderson wrote that  
disclosing the information does not violate the privacy rights of 
birth parents. Adoptees could be prosecuted, however, if they try 
to contact birth parents against their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's law allows adoptees who are 21 years old or older to  
request to see their records, which are held at the Department of 
Children's Services. Birth mothers must be notified of the request 
and have the legal option of refusing to see the child. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was passed by the General Assembly in 1995 after  
adoptees argued they were being deprived of information vital to 
their physical and mental well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only in effect for two weeks because of legal challenges.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the law praised the decision, which reversed a  
lower court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've vindicated us as real people,'' said Caprice East, a  
Nashville interior designer whose failed efforts to see the records 
of her own adoption led to the law. ``We just were second-class 
citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However William Pierce, of the National Council For Adoption,  
called it ``a tragic day for privacy rights in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I believe there is a clear miscarriage of justice if the ruling  
stands,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sela Ward Plays Single Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This week's ``Once and Again'' starts with Lily,  
the 40-year-old single mother played by Sela Ward, exploding with 
an anxious confession: ``I have NO idea what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, what she's doing is nothing less than picking up the  
pieces of her life after the breakup of her marriage. She's 
rebuilding her identity and coping with guilt for what divorce has 
done to her two daughters. Diciest of all, she's risking romance 
with Rick, a similarly damaged single father of two. 
</P>
<P>
	So that's what Lily is doing on ``Once and Again,'' which airs  
Tuesday at 10 p.m. EDT on ABC, then repeats Friday on cable's 
Lifetime at 11 p.m. EDT. And she must be doing something right. A 
critical favorite long before its debut, the series last week gave 
ABC the highest rating among adults 18-to-49 of any network's 
premiering drama in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	What that audience encountered was a refreshingly adult drama  
with the wry humor and bittersweet honesty befitting its creators, 
Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, until now best known for the 
age-defining ``thirtysomething.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers also found a splendid cast, headed up by Billy Campbell  
as Rick and Ward in quite a change from her flamboyant role on the 
sometimes racy, sometimes wacky ``Sisters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But could the sleekly gorgeous Sela Ward make Lily's plight  
convincing? The matter was settled in the premiere episode's first 
moments: 
</P>
<P>
	``All I ever wanted, I think, was to be safe,'' Lily mused.  
``That's the funny thing, because I never chose the safe thing. I 
would try, and somehow it would always end up being unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of that poignant speech, Ward laughs.  
</P>
<P>
	``That,'' she declares, ``was the first paragraph in the script  
and the thing that hooked me. I went, `Ohmigod! This is how I feel! 
Everything in my life is about safety!' And I kept reading and the 
writing was so good, I couldn't get it out of my head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what's so interesting about Lily: You get to explore  
her insecurities and neuroses, and then transcend that. With this 
role, you have somewhere to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In important ways, ``Once and Again'' is a very grown-up drama.  
It dares to tilt toward being about adults who have kids, not about 
kids who have parents. The payoff: Everything becomes more complex. 
And richer. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, just watch Lily and Rick, laden with  
responsibilities, try to find a night they're both free for a date. 
</P>
<P>
	And as they separately anticipate sex with each other, hear Lily  
fret to her sister, ``I've got two kids! How can I take my clothes 
off?'' While, elsewhere, Rick's business partner is pressing him 
portentously, ``What's her body like? Two kids!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say that, besides its stretch marks and bulging  
Filofaxes, ``Once and Again'' doesn't also deal with universal 
issues: love, family, trying to learn from one another. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is deft in tracking parallel issues as they unfold  
for different generations. This week we see Lily and Rick in the 
car outside a restaurant, making out like teen-agers -- while, back 
at Rick's house, his teen-age son Eli is in bed with a girl. 
Clearly, this isn't just a show about divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been divorced,'' says Ward. Curled up on the sofa  
in a Manhattan hotel's bar, she bathes a sore throat with hot tea 
as she reflects on her series' potentially broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get married till I was 35. But before that, I would  
have serial monogamy of three, four years at a time. I feel like 
I've been divorced three times over. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to look far for divorce and all the people it  
affects,'' she notes. ``And kids can totally relate to being in a 
family of divorce, with their parents dating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with her brown eyes a bit watery and her apologies for  
being a little spaced, the fluish Ward still glows. Those eyebrows 
arch like boomerangs. Her smile is luminescent. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Meridian, Miss., she first found success modeling,  
then moved into acting with roles in such features as ``Nothing in 
Common,'' ``The Fugitive'' and ``54.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For five seasons she played Teddy, struggling artist and  
recovering alcoholic, on NBC's ``Sisters,'' for which she won the 
1994 Emmy for Best Actress in a Drama. 
</P>
<P>
	And now she wants the world to know: There's life after 40.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sort of loaded for bear,'' says the 43-year-old Ward,  
tapping a Southernism, ``because I've been exec-producing this 
documentary for Lifetime on beauty and ageism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're living in this youth-obsessed culture where the message  
we get -- especially from the entertainment industry and advertising 
-- is that our life is over at 40. And I resent it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With her documentary, which Lifetime will air next spring, ``I'm  
doing my little part to give a woman, or a man, a chance to think, 
`You know what, I can make a different choice.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, choices are what Lily faces, in the extreme. It isn't  
safe. But it's fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`ALLY': Tonight at 9 p.m. EDT, you can catch a rerun of the Fox  
comedy-drama ``Ally McBeal.'' Or Tuesday at 8 p.m., you can see the 
premiere of ``Ally'' -- which, come to think of it, is sort of a 
rerun, too. In this inspiration of repurposing from producer David 
E. Kelley, ``Ally'' Lite alchemizes old footage from the original 
show and some fresh footage with star Calista Flockhart and the 
rest of the cast, into a half-hour format that steers clear of 
lawyerly pursuits to dwell on the comedy in Ally's world. Sounds 
like something old, something new, much borrowed, and a little bit 
-- well, not blue, but sometimes racy.

<HEADLINE> NYC Exhibit Becomes Political Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Art fused with politics Monday as an exhibit  
including elephant dung on a painting of the Virgin Mary became the 
latest issue in the duel between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani -- who like the first lady is an all-but-declared  
candidate for the Senate from New York -- has threatened to cut $7 
million in funding to the Brooklyn Museum of Art if it goes ahead 
with the show on Saturday. He has called the exhibit, which also 
features bisected animals and a topless woman in the place of Jesus 
at the Last Supper, ``sick'' and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, a City Hall source speaking on condition of  
anonymity said the museum agreed to pull the dung-decorated 
painting as part of a tentative deal with the mayor. But the museum 
issued a statement saying no deal had been reached and that the 
exhibit was going to open as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Mrs. Clinton declared that the museum shouldn't  
lose its funding -- money that makes up a full third of its budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not appropriate to penalize and punish an institution  
such as the Brooklyn Museum,'' Mrs. Clinton said during an 
appearance at a Harlem school. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, she said she shares ``the feeling that I know  
many New Yorkers have that there are parts of this exhibit that 
would be deeply offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not go to see this exhibit,'' she added.  
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who is Roman Catholic, accused the first lady of  
supporting the use of public money ``to attack and bash the 
Catholic religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the works in the exhibit: ``The Holy Virgin Mary''  
painting, which depicts Mary with dark skin, African features and 
flowing robes. It includes shellacked clumps of elephant dung and 
dozens of cutouts of female private parts from pornographic 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The work -- part of the British ``Sensation'' exhibit -- has  
fueled a debate about freedom of expression and public support of 
the arts. It has also brought both financial peril and publicity to 
a museum used to operating in the shadows of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and other Manhattan attractions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has sided with the mayor,  
while civil rights activists have said that pulling the museum's 
funding would violate the First Amendment. The New York Civil 
Liberties Union was planning a rally to support the exhibit, and 
conservative Republicans were planning one against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virgin Mary'' artist Chris Ofili, who is noted for using  
elephant dung in his works, has refused interviews -- a stance that 
has done nothing to halt the furor. 
</P>
<P>
	Art critic Jeffrey Hogrefe of the New York Observer said: ``They  
wanted to get some publicity and they got it. ... I think it was 
pretty calculated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn Museum's director, Arnold Lehman, has been silent.  
But elsewhere, opinions about the work -- even from those who 
haven't seen it -- abound. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, O'Connor said  
he was ``saddened'' by what appears to be an attack on the Virgin 
Mary. And Gov. George Pataki said he was grateful that no state 
money was involved in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor dodged the question of whether Giuliani should cut  
off vital funding to the museum. But Mrs. Clinton argued that 
personal reactions ``should not lead to the penalization and 
shutting down of an entire museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other works in the exhibit include a series of Siamese-twin type  
mannequins, some with sex organs in place of noses and mouths; a 
work consisting of two halves of a pig, sliced from snout to hoof, 
suspended in two formaldehyde tanks; and ``Wrecked,'' an up-to-date 
version of the Last Supper with a topless woman standing in for 
Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It puts real life in art,'' Village Voice critic Jerry Saltz  
said of the exhibit, which has made stops in London and Berlin. 
``Some of it is atrocious. Some of it is pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Fines Truck Crew Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- NASCAR officials on Monday announced  
they fined Randy Goss, crew chief for Greg Biffle's Roush Racing 
entry, $48,860 following last week's Craftsman Truck Series race in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty, the difference between first and 36th place money  
in last Friday's The Orleans 250 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, was 
the result of an unapproved intake manifold found by officials in a 
post-race inspection of the Ford truck in which series-leader 
Biffle won his record ninth race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR said the team will retain the race victory but will also  
be fined 120 championship points, the difference between first and 
36th places. That leaves Biffle with only a 10-point margin over 
Jack Sprague, second in the race and a runner-up in the season 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Goss' actions were deemed in violation of Section 12, Rule 4,  
Article A and Article Q in the 1999 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series 
Rule Book: actions detrimental to automobile racing, and: use of 
parts that do not conform to NASCAR rules, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoff Smith, president of Roush Racing, said he planned to file  
an appeal on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, we intend to vigorously pursue the appeal after it is  
filed. All competent evidence will show in a compelling way that 
the intake manifold was submitted to NASCAR for inspection prior to 
its first use in competition, and has been subsequently submitted 
for inspection on numerous other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``At all times and under all circumstances the part was approved  
following each inspection by the appropriately authorized NASCAR 
official.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Brokerages Prepare for Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Freedom is about to hit Japan's securities market.  
</P>
<P>
	In the latest step in a sweeping financial reform program, Japan  
is abolishing fixed commissions on stock trades as of Oct. 1. 
Entrepreneurs are ready to jump in with low fees and online 
brokering, but analysts wonder how enthusiastic investors will be. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential payoff is huge. Japan continues have one of the  
highest savings rates in the world, with assets held by individual 
investors estimated at $11.2 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	But with many Japanese still hesitant to put money in stocks,  
more than half of that amount is deposited with banks and in postal 
savings accounts. At present, just 10 percent of Japanese 
individual savings are in stocks or mutual funds compared to 60 
percent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan took the first step in its ambitious financial reforms  
last year by lifting regulations in currency exchange. Abolishing 
fixed commissions is another major step, and by 2001 banks, 
insurance companies, and brokerages will be allowed to enter one 
another's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest step, brokerages will be allowed to set their own  
commission fees for trades below 50 million yen ($467,000) as of 
Oct. 1, which should open the way for discounting of trading fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixed commissions were abolished in the United States in 1975,  
spurring growth of the discount brokerage industry. More recently, 
online trading at rock-bottom commisison rates has spurred a major 
increase in stock investing among average Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some entrepreneurs in Japan see the lifting of fixed commissions  
as an opportunity to compete against the more established brokerage 
houses. Online trading specialist Monex Securities Co. is one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	An alliance between electronics giant Sony Corp. and former  
Goldman Sachs partner Oki Matsumoto, Monex will be offering the 
lowest commission fee of all -- 1,000 yen (about $10) for any 
transaction up to 1 million yen ($10,000). That's a 93 percent 
discount from the current fixed rate of 15,000 yen for all 
transactions up to 1 million yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've received over 20,000 requests for information since we  
had our first press conference just under a month ago,'' said 
Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the company isn't likely to become profitable until the  
third year. Analysts say even that would be a luckier outcome than 
most will be able to hope for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how cheap the commission fees are,'' said  
Hideyasu Ban, a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley. ``Unless 
investors think that buying stocks is a better and safer investment 
than keeping money in the bank, online brokers are going to have a 
hard time making money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge won't be a price war among brokerages.  
Rather, it will be to convince people to get their hard-earned cash 
out of the bank and into the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokerage houses will be beefing up their marketing campaigns to  
advertise the potential high returns of investing in stocks. Some, 
like Merrill Lynch, have already hired public relations companies 
to help them lure in investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge of getting individuals interested in stocks will  
be that much more difficult given the recent weakness in the Tokyo 
market. Last Wednesday, the benchmark Nikkei average tumbled 3.4 
percent, its biggest one-day loss since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, major players are gearing up to take advantage of the new  
rules. Charles Schwab Corp., the largest U.S. online broker, will 
join forces with Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. to form a new 
online securities company, which should be open for business within 
the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Others alliances already expected include Japan's Softbank and  
E-Trade, and the Sumitomo Group allying with DLJdirect Inc. Both 
are anticipated to offer competitive commission fees through online 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura, Japan's largest broker, started online trading in  
February 1998. Since then, it has gained over 46,700 clients, and 
the figure is expected to continue growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big brokers like Nomura, Daiwa, and Nikko won't be  
entering the price war,'' said Robert Garone, a financial analyst 
at Commerzbank in Tokyo. ``They're more sensible than to follow 
price-cutting to the rock-bottom.''

<HEADLINE> KLM Plans Merger With Alitalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and  
Italy's national carrier Alitalia plan to extend their alliance 
into a full merger, KLM chief executive Leo Van Wijk said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	KLM could take an equity stake in Alitalia, Van Wijk said, once  
the Italian government sells its 53 percent stake. KLM is also 
partially government owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Wijk said the companies received approval for a merger from  
European regulatory authorities in August, when their alliance was 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't just applying for an alliance. We applied for a  
merger,'' Van Wijk told reporters in The Hague. ``We don't have to 
go back (to the European Commission) to implement what we are 
aiming for, which is a full merger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although plans to merge the management into a single board  
headed by a chairman and a CEO were revealed earlier this year, the 
airlines did not say whether they intended to swap stock or fuse 
operations to form one company. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Alitalia would also seek to take a stake  
in KLM or whether the Dutch would gain a majority holding in the 
merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts already called the alliance a virtual merger, but Van  
Wijk's comments confirm their assumptions.

<HEADLINE> McCain Launches Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
is issuing a ``new patriotic challenge'' for America, promising to 
return dignity to the White House, strength to the U.S. military 
and honesty to a government that is now ``a spectacle of selfish 
ambition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formally opening the campaign he began nearly 10 months ago, the  
war hero and Senate maverick also pledged today to protect Social 
Security, cut taxes, veto pork-barrel spending, improve access to 
the Internet and test the merits of spending government money in 
private schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	His top issues: reform political campaign laws and improve  
America's national security. McCain said both issues are examples 
of how he wants to challenge Americans to champion a ``cause 
greater than self-interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a draft of his announcement provided by campaign officials,  
McCain said, ``It is because I owe America more than she has ever 
owed me that I am a candidate for president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son and grandson of Navy admirals, the former Navy pilot and  
Vietnam prisoner-of-war scheduled his day's start with a visit to 
the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. A poor student and 
troublemaker, McCain barely graduated from the school but later 
distinguished himself as a flyer and prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in New Hampshire, the leadoff primary state, his speech  
to voters was laced with references to his military record -- ``I 
have passed from a young man to an old one in the service of my 
country'' -- and with criticism of his political foes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, he said, broke a promise to protect Social  
Security and weakened the U.S. military. By promising to ``respect 
the dignity of the office,'' McCain suggested that Clinton has not. 
</P>
<P>
	He said both parties in Congress wasted money on ``unneeded  
weapons systems and other pork projects while 12,000 (military) 
personnel -- proud young men and women -- subsist on food stamps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said no other candidate was as qualified to be  
commander-in-chief, a clear reference to the lack of foreign policy 
experience held by George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``There comes a time when our nation's leader can no longer rely  
on briefing books and talking points, when the experts and the 
advisers have all weighed in, when the sum total of one's life 
becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions 
that determine the future of our democracy,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, a two-term Texas governor who served stateside in the  
Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War, has made no secret 
of his need to bone up on foreign policy and rely on advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush holds a healthy lead over all GOP rivals in polling and  
fund-raising, though McCain has closed the gap in New Hampshire. 
The Arizona senator has gained attention in recent weeks with the 
publication of a family memoir that recalls his tortuous 5 1/2 years 
in a Vietnam prison. 
</P>
<P>
	An unorthodox politician by nature, McCain is expected to take  
the unusual step of skipping Iowa's caucuses and focusing on the 
early New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. New Hampshire is 
loaded with independent-minded voters who might like the underdog 
McCain, while South Carolina has a huge population of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain confronted another issue today before his announcement.  
He said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that he wants the Supreme 
Court's decision legalizing abortion overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also want to change the dynamics of this debate, which  
has kept us gridlocked into positions which caused people to shoot 
at abortion clinics and other Americans to view it as the only 
issue in American politics,'' McCain said. ``There are areas we can 
agree on. ... We need to work together to eliminate abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's signature issue in Congress -- campaign finance reform --  
has failed repeatedly and is being debated again in Washington this 
fall. He said the cause must be won to give Americans faith in 
government again.	   ``We can continue to watch as the American people grow ever more 
alienated from the practice and institutions of democracy. We can 
continue to tolerate a government that has become little more than 
a spectacle of selfish ambition, a government auctioned to the 
highest bidder. Or we can take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can fight together to reclaim our government from those who  
corrupt it. This is our new patriotic challenge,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said American foreign policy must be more consistent and  
meaningful. ``We cannot hide behind empty threats, false promises, 
meaningless rhetoric, and photo op diplomacy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong military requires smart spending, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``As president, I won't ask how much security we can afford.  
I'll ask how much security do we need, and I will find the 
resources to pay for it. But I won't tolerate one dime of our 
defense budget being wasted to re-elect shortsighted politicians 
who put their own ambitions before the national interest,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also proposed:  
</P>
<P>
	--Repealing the tax penalty applied to married couples, slashing  
the inheritance tax, ending the earnings test penalty for senior 
citizens and increasing the number of Americans who qualify for the 
lowest tax rate of 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Paying teachers on merit and testing their competency.  
</P>
<P>
	--Conducting a nationwide test of school vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
	--Using new technology to help lower-class Americans lift  
themselves up. ``The information revolution will hasten the end of 
a two-tiered society of haves and have-nots,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Pushes $324B for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking to blunt President Clinton's attacks  
on their education budget, Republicans pushed a $324 billion social 
spending bill through a Senate panel Monday that would outspend the 
president for schools by $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved by voice vote by a Senate Appropriations  
Committee subcommittee, is a more generous version of legislation a 
House subcommittee approved last Friday. Clinton has already 
threatened to veto the House bill because it would cut his 
proposals for hiring teachers, worker protections and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill is still likely to spark battles with the White  
House because of reductions in several of Clinton's priorities. 
Even so, its numbers push it far closer to what an eventual 
compromise between the White House and Congress is likely to look 
like. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very tough line between what I think the president  
will sign and what I can sell'' to congressional Republicans, the 
subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said in an 
interview. ``It is a devilishly difficult judgment play, but I 
think we're on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa,  
said, ``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot 
better than what the House did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000, which begins Friday. 
It is the most controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual 
spending bills to begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200  
million less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and 
human services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains language continuing a ban on national  
testing of students, and allowing hypodermic needles to be provided 
to some drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said when the full Appropriations Committee considers  
the bill on Tuesday, he will try to remove language that would 
allow federal funds to be used for biomedical research on stem 
cells from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would do so to avoid a long, contentious debate on  
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Stadium Gets Last Turn at Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With Al Kaline, Ernie Harwell and a sellout crowd  
bidding goodbye, Tiger Stadium took its last turn at bat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Built on the site of a haymarket in 1912, the ballpark that was  
once home to Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Denny McLain 
and Kaline made one last sentimental journey. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the team will play in Comerica Park, a state-of-the  
art stadium about a mile away. But Monday, when the Tigers played 
the Kansas City Royals, was a time for remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's players all wore numbers of Tigers who played through  
the years. The starters wore the numbers of the Tigers' all-time 
team. Center fielder Gabe Kapler wore a uniform without a number, 
honoring Cobb -- the greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in an 
era before uniforms were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, a Hall of Famer, exchanged lineup cards with Royals Hall  
of Famer George Brett. Both wore their familiar uniforms, Kaline 
with his No. 6, Brett with No. 5. Harwell, the beloved broadcaster, 
emceed pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great times we've experienced in Tiger Stadium we'll  
cherish forever,'' Detroit mayor Dennis Archer told the crowd. 
``Now, let's create some new memories in Comerica Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline was saluted with a two-minute standing ovation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken many times about the first day I ever saw this  
ballpark, as an 18-year-old kid fresh off the train from 
Baltimore,'' Kaline said. ``I again find myself humbled and a bit 
overwhelmed by the events unfolding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Rogell, a shortstop from 1930-39, threw out the ceremonial  
first pitch as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather cooperated for the occasion, with pale blue skies,  
gentle sunshine and a pleasant breeze coming off the Detroit River 
as thousands of fans trooped to the corner of Michigan and Trumbull 
one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levine, a 53-year-old fan, flew in from Chicago. In his  
wallet were ticket stubs from the 1968 game when the Tigers 
clinched the AL pennant and the game when McLain got his 30th win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out here on the plane this morning, probably 80 percent  
of the people were coming here to see a ball game for the last 
time,'' he said. ``I have tons of feelings about this old place. I 
used to skip school regularly to attend opening days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one. A century's worth of baseball has been  
played on this historic piece of ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1912, with home plate moved from right field to its  
present location, the stadium opened as Navin Field. That was five 
days after the sinking of the Titanic. Fenway Park opened in Boston 
the same day, making them the two oldest ballparks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous,'' said Katy Smythe, 32, from nearby Northville.  
``I have mixed feelings, like somebody is kicking me out of my 
house and I can never come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler wasn't nervous, although he probably had reason to  
be. Moehler was Detroit's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, his main claim to fame this season was drawing a  
10-day suspension after an umpire caught him with sandpaper in his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad when it's over with, I'll tell you that,'' he  
said. ``I'll miss the Stadium, but I'll be glad when all the hoopla 
is over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was just like any other fan when it came to saying  
goodbye to this revered mass of rusting girders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my video camera around and I could see where people  
were trying to take the signs down,'' Moehler said. 
</P>
<P>
	For this game, Moehler gave his video camera to C.J. Nitkowski,  
another starter, who wasn't expected to play in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to tape the first pitch and the lineup card  
exchange and then he said, `You want me to tape you?' and I said, 
`No, get the lunatics running on the field and stuff like that.' 
</P>
<P>

things. It seems I always pitch for those things. But I'm happy. 
It's an honor.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Monday after a  
weekend meeting among major industrial nations sparked hopes for 
joint action against the Japanese currency's rapid rise. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.00 yen,  
up from 104.17 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar slipped against other major currencies, with the euro  
rising to $1.0468, up from $1.0464 at the end of last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's strong gain against the yen followed a weekend  
meeting in Washington by the Group of Seven industrialized 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, the G-7 countries said in a statement they  
``shared Japan's concern about the potential impact of the yen's 
appreciation for the Japanese economy and the world economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Japan failed to get a clear pledge from other G-7 members  
for coordinated action. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's surge could smother Japan's budding recovery from a  
harsh recession by making Japanese exports more expensive in other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has bought dollars in its currency markets several times  
this summer to curb the yen's gains, but without success. As 
recently as May, the dollar bought more than 124 yen, but has since 
fallen about 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5303 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5310 late Friday, and 1.4703 Canadian dollars, 
down from 1.4734 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.6472 from $1.6437.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8680 German  
marks, down from 1.8685 on Friday; 6.2651 French francs, down from 
6.2666; and 1,849.35 Italian lire, down from 1,849.79.

<HEADLINE> California Blaze Claims 37 Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAPPY VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters today contained a  
wind-whipped fire that had burned across 2,000 acres, gutted at 
least 37 homes and forced the evacuation of up to 700 people from a 
rural area of northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's looking pretty good out there,'' said Del  
Walters, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in spite of the trench dug around the fire by some of  
the estimated 380 firefighters, hot spots and wind gusting above 25 
mph continued to cause concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the evacuees, as many as 500 people from Happy Valley,  
nine miles south of Redding, checked in Sunday at an evacuation 
center at nearby Anderson Union High School but only about a dozen 
spent the night. Many were allowed to return home late Sunday or 
found other places to stay, and by late morning everyone was 
allowed back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sumner, his wife, Linda, and daughter, Stephanie, 19, left  
their home and two of their cats behind Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was fire all the way around (our home),'' Sumner said.  
``I've been asking the sheriff what's going on. ... I was just told 
that I can't go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire started Sunday morning as three separate blazes that  
merged in brush and scrub timber north of town, officials said. The 
cause was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind blew flames toward the edge of town and made the situation  
``highly volatile,'' said Department of Forestry spokeswoman Sharon 
Wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters suffered minor injuries. One was treated for  
smoke inhalation and the other was hospitalized for fatigue and 
dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to homes, the fire destroyed 40 other structures  
including sheds and outbuildings, plus 15 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators expected to find additional destruction, Walters  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just north of Redding, high wind expected Sunday didn't  
materialize as firefighters continued to battle a series of 
lightning-triggered wildfires in California's Trinity Alps 
Wilderness that have burned more than 60,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central California coast near Big Sur, another group of  
fires had burned 42,454 acres in the Ventana Wilderness of Los 
Padres National Forest. Two of the blazes are estimated to be weeks 
away from containment, CDF spokesman Tony Akin said. The Big 
Sur-area fires alone have cost more than $27 million to fight since 
they were started by lightning Sept. 8.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Astros Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man was charged with disorderly conduct  
Monday for jumping out of the stands at County Stadium during a 
Milwaukee Brewers game last week and tackling Houston Astros right 
fielder Bill Spiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Berley W. Visgar, 23, of South Beloit, Ill., was charged with  
two counts of disorderly conduct, District Attorney E. Michael 
McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's deputy who arrested Visgar on Friday night said he  
appeared intoxicated and smelled strongly of alcohol. Visgar has 
admitted to drinking at least three beers at the game and both beer 
and vodka before arriving at the stadium, the criminal complaint 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar told authorities he never wanted to hurt Spiers but had  
intended to jump on his back to attract the attention of the 14,000 
fans attending the game, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Visgar asked fans seated around him whether they  
would pay his fine if he jumped onto a player or ran naked onto the 
field, the complaint said. Some said they would. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar then scaled an 8-foot wall, ran 20 feet across the field  
and jumped on Spiers' back during the bottom of the sixth inning. 
Players from both teams quickly entered the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiers tried to wrestle Visgar from his back but eventually fell  
to the ground. Spiers received scrapes to his face and had neck and 
back pain. The outfielder left the game during the next inning and 
was out of Houston's starting lineup Saturday night but pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar could have faced a more serious battery charge, but that  
would have required Spiers to return to Milwaukee to testify if 
necessary, said Assistant District Attorney Tom McAdams. 
</P>
<P>
	McAdams said Spiers told him he was willing to testify but with  
the Astros currently in the thick of the NL Central Division 
pennant race it could be difficult for him to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have enough evidence to pursue disorderly conduct  
charges without Spiers' testimony, McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visgar faces up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine for each  
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released from jail Sunday on $1,150 cash bail, said  
sheriff's Sgt. Judy Knitter. His initial court appearance is 
scheduled Oct. 14.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Utility Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Northeast Utilities pleaded guilty Monday  
to violating federal nuclear-safety and clean-water laws and agreed 
to pay $10 million, including the biggest penalty in the history of 
the nuclear power industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the utility's offenses included releasing  
pollutants into Long Island Sound and supplying deliberately 
inaccurate information on employee license applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The public was never in any immediate danger, according to the  
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Environmental Protection 
Agency. And none of the violations involved any leaks of 
radioactive material, said Hubert Miller, NRC regional 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is continuing, and authorities would not rule  
out prosecution of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Two NU subsidiaries, Northeast Utility Service Co. and Northeast  
Nuclear Energy Co., agreed to pay $6.65 million in fines and make 
$3.35 million in donations, including $1 million to the University 
of Connecticut for a chair in ethics and $1 million for the state's 
open-space preservation program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We failed to live up to what was required of us as a  
responsible corporate citizen and as a leader in our community,'' 
NU chairman Michael Morris said in a statement. ``Today we are 
paying a very steep price for that failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the sum is for nuclear safety violations, the biggest  
penalty in the history of the nuclear power industry, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The violations occurred between 1994 and 1996 at the Millstone  
nuclear power plant near Waterford and at the Devon Generating 
Station in Milford, which uses conventional fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Millstone has been under close scrutiny from the NRC for years.  
In 1996, the complex was ordered shut down because of safety 
concerns. Authorities credited some of the Millstone 
whistle-blowers with helping start the investigation that resulted 
in Monday's pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Millstone's reactors are back in operation. The third is  
being mothballed. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was convicted of falsifying the records of 19 people  
applying for nuclear operating licenses at Millstone. Prosecutors 
said the utility falsely claimed the workers had fulfilled the 
training requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Six water environmental counts centered on the unauthorized  
discharge of pollutants into Long Island Sound from Millstone and 
Devon. In addition, prosecutors said the company diluted water 
samples, invalidating the results of tests for pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It created a situation where no one really knew how much was  
being dumped into Long Island Sound,'' said Steven Herman, EPA 
assistant administrator for enforcement.

<HEADLINE> New Medicare Reference Books Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the next few weeks, elderly and disabled  
Americans can expect to find a new government guidebook in their 
mailboxes, meant to help them unravel the complexities of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is to help Medicare beneficiaries make more  
informed health care decisions,'' said Medicare's director of 
beneficiary services, Carol Cronin. ``We've found that there is 
substantial work to be done in helping beneficiaries understand the 
basic Medicare program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, similar Medicare reference books have been sent to  
senior citizens only once -- when they first become eligible for the 
national health insurance program at age 65 -- or upon request. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the guidebooks will come in 26 different  
regional editions, offering specific information about the private 
health plans open to Medicare beneficiaries in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a test mailing of the books reached about 5 million  
households in five states. This year, the mailing will go to 32 
million households in an attempt to reach all 39 million Medicare 
beneficiaries nationwide. From now on, it will be an annual fall 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	The new information campaign, which cost $133 million this year,  
was required by Congress in 1997 legislation aimed at encouraging 
more Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in private health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government can save money when senior citizens choose  
private plans -- mainly HMOs -- that accept a flat, monthly 
per-patient fee from Medicare regardless of the amount of care 
provided. In contrast, the government must pay each medical bill 
directly for patients who stay in the traditional Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	The new guidebooks provides general information about how  
Medicare works and also explains tradeoffs for those considering 
joining an HMO. For example, someone who chooses an HMO may get 
extra benefits, such as prescription drug coverage, that are not 
normally offered by Medicare. At the same time, however, they may 
have less freedom to choose their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	More detailed information is available on Medicare's Internet  
site or can be obtained by calling a toll-free help line listed in 
the guide. 
</P>
<P>
	Many libraries and senior citizens centers also are gearing up  
to help elderly people who don't have home computers find answers 
to their questions on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Blocking Enzyme Could Help Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found that blocking  
production of an enzyme interferes with the ability of many cancers 
to reproduce, a step that could one day lead to new treatments for 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In laboratory experiments, the scientists prevented cancer cells  
from producing the enzyme telomerase, which helps the cells grow 
without limit. That resulted in the cells stopping their 
reproduction and dying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't developed a chemical, a therapeutic drug,''  
stressed Dr. Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute for 
Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., a member of the research 
group. He added that the method used in the laboratory study is not 
practical for use in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Weinberg said, the findings being published in the October  
issue of the journal Nature Medicine point the way for 
pharmaceutical companies to search for drugs that do the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerry Shay of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical  
Center in Dallas called the report ``very dramatic proof of the 
principle that inhibiting telomerase may in fact lead to the death 
of cancer cells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shay, a leading cancer researcher, was not a member of  
Weinberg's research team. 
</P>
<P>
	In normal human cells, structures called telomeres protect the  
ends of the DNA that codes the cell's purpose. Each time the cell 
reproduces, the telomeres shrink slightly, until they reach a 
critical length that stops the cell from reproducing and it dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have learned that 80 percent to 90 percent of cancer  
cells have developed the ability to produce the enzyme telomerase, 
which protects the telomeres, allowing the cell to keep reproducing 
indefinitely, growing into a tumor. These cells produce a chemical 
called hTERT that provides a template for the creation of 
telomerase. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg and his fellow researchers were able to alter hTERT  
into a negative form that blocks telomerase production and, in 
laboratory experiments, they inserted the so-called negative-hTERT 
into human colon, ovarian and two types of breast cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the negative-hTERT present, the cells stopped producing  
telomerase, their telomeres began to shrink with each reproduction 
and the cells eventually stopped reproducing and died. 
</P>
<P>
	When they injected mice with the treated cells, tumors failed to  
develop. Mice injected with untreated versions of the same cells 
developed cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg's team used a form of gene therapy to introduce the  
negative-hTERT into the cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is practicable in a culture dish, but it isn't  
practicable in a living animal bearing a tumor,'' he said. ``That's 
why it's not convertible to therapeutic potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe over the next several years one company or  
another will develop a chemical to interfere with this enzyme,'' he 
added. ``But one has to be very clear and explicit that such a 
chemical does not yet exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg added that if a telomerase-interfering drug were  
developed, it would need to be used in conjunction with other 
therapy because it does not always act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in the colon cancer cells, which have short  
telomeres to begin with, reproduction stopped promptly. But the 
breast cancer cells continued to proliferate for 10 to 20 days 
before stopping and the ovarian cancer cells took 30 to 40 days to 
be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, he said, it would be useful to remove the bulk of  
the cancer first and then use anti-telomerase therapy to clean out 
small remaining nests of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Weinberg, the research team included scientists  
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical 
School.

<HEADLINE> Truth Over Bloody Sunday Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- International fact-finders  
said Monday they have already compiled 60,000 pages of evidence in 
hopes of determining what really happened on Bloody Sunday 1972, 
when British soldiers shot dead 13 Catholic protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Bloody Sunday Inquiry -- led by three judges  
from England, Canada and New Zealand -- detailed results from the 
past year's work during a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers' claims they fired after being provoked by Irish  
Republican Army gunmen -- an assertion accepted by a 1972 
investigation -- have long infuriated Catholic residents of the 
city, who insist the soldiers fired first and killed only unarmed 
people. The massacre was a defining moment in Northern Ireland's 
past three decades of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Christopher Clarke said the inquiry's legal team had  
identified about 1,500 residents of Londonderry and 800 soldiers as 
potential witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, he said, they had received signed statements from 551  
civilians, 329 ex-soldiers and 18 police officers. They were still 
trying to trace 268 ex-soldiers, many of whom were probably living 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke said his legal team had gathered 5,000 photos and 36  
hours of film footage of the event, largely from residents and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's public hearings are devoted to clearing away  
important legal arguments before the panel hears oral testimony 
from witnesses in March. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans for the  
fact-finding inquiry in January 1998 in a bid to build Catholic 
support for political compromise in Northern Ireland, which has a 
pro-British Protestant majority. Last week the British government 
revealed that the investigation had already cost taxpayers $18 
million.

<HEADLINE> Adoption Records Opening Law Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In a closely watched case, the state  
Supreme Court has upheld a law allowing adopted children to see 
their adoption records, even if their birth parents want the 
information kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect is going to be felt nationwide,'' said Jane Nast,  
president of the American Adoption Congress. Nast said similar laws 
are planned in Oregon, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's 5-0 decision, Chief Justice Riley Anderson wrote  
that disclosing the information does not violate the privacy rights 
of birth parents. Adoptees could be prosecuted, however, if they 
try to contact birth parents against their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's law allows adoptees who are 21 or older to request  
to see their records, which are held at the Department of 
Children's Services. Birth mothers must be notified of the request 
and have the legal option of refusing to see the child. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was passed in 1995 after adoptees argued they were being  
deprived of information vital to their physical and mental 
well-being. It was only in effect for two weeks because of legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the law praised the decision, which reversed a  
lower court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've vindicated us as real people,'' said Caprice East, a  
Nashville interior designer whose failed efforts to see the records 
of her own adoption led to the law. ``We just were second-class 
citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Pierce, of the National Council For Adoption, called it  
``a tragic day for privacy rights in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I believe there is a clear miscarriage of justice if the ruling  
stands,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador May Get IMF Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States urged Ecuador on Monday to  
adopt a credible economic program and reach new arrangements with 
its creditors so it could obtain financial help from the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the United States could support an IMF loan for Ecuador only 
if the government makes meaningful progress in talks to reach new 
terms with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadorian officials have already started what are likely to be  
protracted negotiations by meeting Monday with private sector 
creditors in New York during sessions organized by Chase Manhattan 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador announced Sunday it would default on slightly less than  
half of the $98 million in Brady bond payments due by Thursday. The 
market already had anticipated such a move so there was no negative 
reaction Monday and little danger of contagion spreading to other 
Latin American bonds or emerging market bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have encouraged, and will continue to encourage, Ecuador to  
work with the IMF to put in place a strong and credible economic 
adjustment program that will addresses its financial problems and 
lay the basis for restored stability and growth,'' the Treasury 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a program should provide the basis for Ecuador to work  
with its private creditors in a transparent and cooperative manner 
to reach arrangements that best satisfy their common interest i 
economic recovery and sustainable finances over the medium term,'' 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the IMF said it would provide Ecuador with  
financial assistance if the country makes good-faith efforts with 
creditors to resolve debt difficulties. Ecuador is seeking $400 
million in aid from the IMF.

<HEADLINE>  Tenn. Probes Academic Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Defending national champion Tennessee,  
which in recent years has uncovered cheating in its advanced degree 
programs and a telephone card fraud scandal among its athletes, is 
now investigating whether tutors did schoolwork for football 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee President J. Wade Gilley, who started his job last  
month, said Monday the school is following ``normal procedure and 
has turned this matter over to the (university's) general counsel's 
office for review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this review is complete, the university will announce its  
findings and, if necessary, take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics Director Doug Dickey said the university also has  
reported the matter to Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy 
Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer declined to discuss the  
allegations, which he termed ``a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is anything about football, I will be glad to talk to  
you,'' he told about a dozen reporters who met him after practice. 
``The players are not going to allow it to be a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported Sunday that internal memos show high-level  
administrators in the athletic department were told of four tutors 
who may have done schoolwork for at least five football players, 
possibly violating the university's honor code and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the information was passed on to the proper campus  
authorities charged with investigating possible rules infractions, 
said Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for Tennessee. 
</P>

	The alleged incidents dated to 1995, and it was unclear whether  
any of the players were on the 1998 national champion team. Three 
of the five players have transferred, according to ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, four Tennessee redshirt freshmen, including kick

	The new allegations come less than a month after Tennessee

the country.

<HEADLINE>  Tenn. Probes Academic Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Defending national champion Tennessee,  
which in recent years has uncovered cheating in its advanced degree 
programs and a telephone card fraud scandal among its athletes, is 
now investigating whether tutors did schoolwork for football 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee President J. Wade Gilley, who started his job last  
month, said Monday the school is following ``normal procedure and 
has turned this matter over to the (university's) general counsel's 
office for review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this review is complete, the university will announce its  
findings and, if necessary, take appropriate action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics Director Doug Dickey said the university also has  
reported the matter to Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy 
Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer declined to discuss the  
allegations, which he termed ``a concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is anything about football, I will be glad to talk to  
you,'' he told about a dozen reporters who met him after practice. 
``The players are not going to allow it to be a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN reported Sunday that internal memos show high-level  
administrators in the athletic department were told of four tutors 
who may have done schoolwork for at least five football players, 
possibly violating the university's honor code and NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the information was passed on to the proper campus  
authorities charged with investigating possible rules infractions, 
said Malcolm McInnis, NCAA compliance officer for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incidents dated to 1995, and it was unclear whether  
any of the players were on the 1998 national champion team. Three

<HEADLINE> John Brown's Quest: Image From Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a day in the mid-1840s a man with a square  
jaw, drawn mouth, furrowed brow and sunken, staring eyes was frozen 
for posterity by the lens of a daguerreotype camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The image, captured on the camera's trademark silver plate in  
1846 or 1847, is the earliest known portrait of John Brown, the 
white man who was America's most radical warrior in the battle for 
the abolition of slavery. Last week it and 38 other portraits by 
the man Brown posed for went on view at the National Portrait 
Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's right hand is raised, palm outward. His left grasps a  
banner believed to be the standard of the ``Subterranean Passway,'' 
a militant version of the underground railway that brought escaped 
slaves north to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Brown's grim face is the riveting central image, the  
focus of the show is on the man on the other side of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	He was Augustus Washington, a professional photographer and free  
black man who operated a daguerreotype studio in Hartford, Conn., 
and was himself an ardent abolitionist. 
</P>
<P>
	By the late 1840s the antislavery movement in the United States  
was nearing a boil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary cooling off in the  
strife between foes of slavery in the North and slaveowners in the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise permitted California to enter the Union as a free  
state. But, in a stinging irritant to abolitionists, it also made 
it easier to recapture fugitive slaves, wherever found. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1854 passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act let those territories  
decide by popular vote whether to enter the union as free or slave 
states, making them an immediate battleground in the abolition 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	For Brown and Washington these events amounted to forks in the  
road. Faced with a choice, one would choose blood, the other exile. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's road would lead to deadly struggles with pro-slavery  
forces in Kansas. And, in the most explosive moment before the 
opening of the Civil War, it would lead on Oct. 16-17, 1859, to his 
raid on the government arsenal at Harper's Ferry, in what later 
became West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The slave rebellion Brown expected did not materialize. Hanged  
before the year was out, he left this prophesy: ``I, John Brown, am 
now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be 
purged away, but with blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Augustus Washington, born free about 1820, also believed in  
freedom for the slaves. But he had an evident sense of humor as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``While others are advocating every man a house, free soil and  
free speech, it remains for Washington to advocate and furnish free 
Daguerreotypes, for the next 60 days,'' he said in an 1851 
advertisement in a Hartford newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he said he was ``determined to take as good or  
better likenesses as anyone in this state at prices cheaper than 
anyone in this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Washington, who had attended Dartmouth College, was also  
eager to contribute to the ``progress of the oppressed and 
unfortunate people with whom I am identified'' and to become ``a 
useful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington was well on his way to a useful life when he began to  
despair of the worsening racial climate in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fugitive Slave Act put at risk not only the liberty of  
fugitive slaves but also that of free blacks who suddenly found 
themselves exposed to arrest as presumed slaves on flimsy evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington had long opposed the movement to send free blacks to  
Africa where Liberia had been founded for that purpose in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
	But the point came ``where he could not see a future for black  
Americans in the context of the United States,'' says Ann M. 
Shumard, the Portrait Gallery's assistant curator of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington sailed with his wife and children for Liberia in  
1853, considering it ``the only land in which we can feel ourselves 
truly free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the next year he was so convinced he had made the right  
choice that he wrote he would rather trust his wife and children 
``to the tender mercies of the African hyena ... than leave them as 
drudges in America .'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Liberia, Washington first resumed work as a photographer. He  
later became one of Liberia's leading sugarcane growers and entered 
politics, winning election to the Liberian House and Senate before 
his death on June 7, 1875. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, ``A Durable Memento: Portraits by Augustus  
Washington, African-American Daguerreotypist,'' runs through Jan. 
2.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Inmates Hold Guards Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Protesting the deaths of 10 inmates in a  
riot, left-wing prisoners held more than 70 prison guards hostage 
Monday in seven prisons across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	At one of the prisons, the hostage-takers hurled stones at  
soldiers and unfurled a taunting banner that read ``Come over if 
you have the courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of soldiers moved into Istanbul's Umraniye prison and  
fired tear gas through the windows, but the government insisted 
that they were not planning to storm the prison and rescue the 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to end the hostage taking peacefully,'' said the  
head of Turkey's prisons, Ali Suat Ertosun. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen of the guards were being held in Umraniye.  
</P>
<P>
	The fighting began Sunday in Ankara's Ulucanlar prison after  
inmates clashed with soldiers who raided the prison to search for 
an escape tunnel that the inmates reportedly were digging. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes quickly spread to other prisons after 10 inmates were  
killed and 28 guards and inmates were injured in Ankara, the 
Justice Ministry reported. Earlier, news reports and human rights 
groups said that 11 inmates were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ertosun said 71 guards were taken as hostage by inmates who  
barricaded themselves inside of the wards. He said earlier reports 
that 90 guards were seized were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has been trying to move inmates -- primarily leftists and  
Kurds -- to smaller prisons in an effort to break up the wards. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftist inmates have frequently argued that right-wing inmates  
receive favorable treatment from guards, who turn a blind eye to 
the goods that they smuggle into prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards reportedly act more harshly toward left-wing inmates who  
are seeking to overthrow the state.

	LANEXA, Va. (AP) -- A woman was charged Monday with murdering her

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 88.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, led by gains in technology  
shares, as bargain-hunting and a strengthening dollar helped 
markets rebound from last week's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
88.65 at 10,367.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.29 at 1,291.65, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 45.89 at 2,786.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Dow fell a total of 524.30 points, its biggest  
weekly point loss ever. It tumbled more than 200 points in two 
separate sessions. That plunge left the Dow 1,046.71 points, or 9.2 
percent, below its record close of 11,326.04, set Aug. 25. But with 
the lift this morning, it still is up almost 13 percent since the 
year began. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index lost 129.21 points  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing an oversold market, and bargain-hunting taking  
over,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason 
of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that investors seem to be going back to technology  
stocks, which were big catalyst for the market before last week's 
retreat. That could be seen on the Nasdaq where Amgen, a huge 
biotech concern, was up 2 3/8 at 80 1/4 and Sun Microsystems rose 4 3/16 
to 94 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has risen on indications that Japan will work to stop  
the dollar's recent slide vs. the yen. After months of sparring 
over the direction of foreign exchange markets, finance ministers 
of industrialized nations moved closer over the weekend to an 
agreement on how to revive the sagging U.S. currency, as well as 
protect Japan's nascent economic recovery. The news helped stop the 
dollar's slide against the yen. A stronger dollar makes U.S. 
securities more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the Dow higher today was Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 2 3/16 to  
92 3/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, up 2 3/16 at 99 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining stocks also propelled the stock market as gold bullion  
posted its biggest daily gain in at least nine years. Gold 
producers benefited after European central banks said they will 
limit bullion sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors played down any talk that last week's market drop was  
the beginning of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the case for a bear market is still a weak one,'' said  
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ``The 
leading indicators of the economy continue to point up not down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One benefit of last week's market drop is that it may give the  
Federal Reserve another reason to keep interest rates steady, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 350.80 million shares 
at midday, down from Friday's heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performance of  
small-company stocks, was up 5.79 at 422.88. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed up 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 shot 
up 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Underwood Wound Self-Inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The saga of Dimitrius Underwood took  
another bizarre turn Monday when police said he had slashed himself 
in the neck with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the 22-year-old defensive end covered with blood on  
a downtown street Sunday after getting calls that a man was yelling 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick by Minnesota, Underwood left the  
Vikings after one day in training camp. He later changed his mind 
and signed with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood apparently cut his neck at the home of the mother of  
his twin 17-month-old children, Hall said. No one in the home saw 
him cut himself, but several people in the neighborhood saw him 
running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Police took Underwood to Sparrow Hospital, where he was listed  
in fair condition Monday after undergoing surgery Sunday. No 
further information was released at the request of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real rough for the family,'' Hall said. ``They're  
going through a real rough time, like any family would at a time 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood had 
written a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	The player cooperated with police when they found him about  
12:45 p.m. Sunday and has spoken with police since, Hall said. He 
declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his actions, 
but said police are close to completing their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was arrested by police about 7 p.m. Saturday for  
nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted for him about 
three hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the jail in Mason 
for another hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no trouble arresting Underwood or taking him to the  
county jail, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood played defensive end at Michigan State for three  
seasons before sitting out his senior year with a sprained ankle. 
The Minnesota Vikings in April made Underwood their second 
first-round draft pick, and 29th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1 but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State football coach Nick Saban on Monday hinted that  
Underwood's ambivalence about playing football may not be new. 
</P>

	``I think Dimitrius' behavior over a little bit of time here has  
been a little bit unusual,'' Saban said at his weekly news 
conference. ``We tried to help the guy last year; I know the 
Dolphins have tried to help him now, and I've talked to him on 
several occasions. ... Maybe now someone can help him and he can do 
well.''

<P>
	Underwood has explained his departure from Minnesota by saying  
he was torn between a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to 
support his children.

<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75  
million signing bonus by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	He was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams passed  
on him and is now getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first 
season of a five-year contract with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, he'll be fine and then find the kind of assistance,  
help that he needs to do a good job, and I'm not talking about 
football,'' Green said Monday. ``Because when you're in the

the things that he needs as a young man of 22.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood dislocated his left shoulder in an exhibition game and  
was expected to begin working out again this week. The Dolphins did 
not play Sunday.

<P>
	``(I) have passed on the word that we are 100 percent supportive  
of him. Our No. 1 concern is his health and well-being, and the No.

Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson declined further comment. The team did not practice  
Monday, and players were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good person and a good guy and he's going through some  
hard times right now,'' Saban said.

<HEADLINE> Sony Walkman Will Download Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp. said Monday it will start selling a  
Walkman that fits into the palm of a hand and downloads music from 
the Internet while protecting copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Memory Stick Walkman'' is designed to fight the  
proliferation of illegal music exchanges on the Internet and to 
create a new standard for portable audio players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walkman will cost $430 and requires a computer with  
Microsoft Windows 98 to transfer music. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walkman uses technology to protect the record industry from  
the illegal copying and distribution of music over the Internet. 
Currently, music can be downloaded from the Internet for free. 
</P>
<P>
	Memory Stick users would pay for Internet music made compatible  
with Sony's encryption system, but would not be able to download 
songs from free Web sites. A Sony spokesman did not explain what 
form the payments would take. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like IBM, Sony, Microsoft and scores of record  
companies have been banding together to develop ways to protect the 
music industry from the growing popularity of MP3, a technology 
that gives near-CD quality to music downloaded from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of Sony's new Walkman would move music onto something  
called a ``Magic Gate Memory Stick'' -- a thumb-sized rectangular 
card that is inserted into the player. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will be possible to move music from a CD or a mini-disc  
into a personal computer and then into the MS Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony says another advantage of its new player is its size: It is  
just slightly larger than a credit card and weighs only 2.4 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese launch of the new Walkman is set for Dec. 21,  
though the music available for download will be limited at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Even affiliate Sony Music Entertainment said it may not have  
Internet music titles ready for the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear if record companies will sign up for Sony's  
copyright protection system, Sony said, but the company hopes that 
the fear of losing royalties will push record companies to make 
their titles compatible with the Memory Stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any case, we are not developing digital music technology  
specifically for the Memory Stick,'' said spokesman Akira Takayasu. 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been set for its overseas launch.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Underwood Wound Self-Inflicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The saga of Dimitrius Underwood took  
another bizarre turn Monday when police said he had slashed himself 
in the neck with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the 22-year-old defensive end covered with blood on  
a downtown street Sunday after getting calls that a man was yelling 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somewhat despondent,'' police spokesman Lt. Ray Hall  
said. ``He was upset, physically upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-round draft pick by Minnesota, Underwood left the  
Vikings after one day in training camp. He later changed his mind 
and signed with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood apparently cut his neck at the home of the mother of  
his twin 17-month-old children, Hall said. No one in the home saw 
him cut himself, but several people in the neighborhood saw him 
running down the street afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Police took Underwood to Sparrow Hospital, where he was listed  
in fair condition Monday after undergoing surgery Sunday. No 
further information was released at the request of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real rough for the family,'' Hall said. ``They're  
going through a real rough time, like any family would at a time 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said physical evidence at the scene and witnesses'  
statements convinced police Underwood used the knife on himself. 
The officer would not describe the knife, other than to say it was 
a common household knife. He declined to say if Underwood had 
written a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
	The player cooperated with police when they found him about  
12:45 p.m. Sunday and has spoken with police since, Hall said. He 
declined to say if Underwood gave them a reason for his actions, 
but said police are close to completing their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attention is turned toward safeguarding his good mental  
health,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood was arrested by police about 7 p.m. Saturday for  
nonpayment of child support. A $500 bond was posted for him about 
three hours later, but Underwood refused to leave the jail in Mason 
for another hour, spending the time talking to another inmate, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no trouble arresting Underwood or taking him to the  
county jail, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood played defensive end at Michigan State for three  
seasons before sitting out his senior year with a sprained ankle. 
The Minnesota Vikings in April made Underwood their second 
first-round draft pick, and 29th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a five-year, $5.3 million contract Aug. 1 but walked  
out of training camp the next day. Underwood told coach Dennis 
Green he had no desire to play football. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State football coach Nick Saban on Monday hinted that  
Underwood's ambivalence about playing football may not be new. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Dimitrius' behavior over a little bit of time here has  
been a little bit unusual,'' Saban said at his weekly news 
conference. ``We tried to help the guy last year; I know the 
Dolphins have tried to help him now, and I've talked to him on 
several occasions. ... Maybe now someone can help him and he can do 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has explained his departure from Minnesota by saying  
he was torn between a desire to pursue the ministry and the need to 
support his children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings released him Aug. 11. Underwood sacrificed a $1.75  
million signing bonus by leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	He was claimed on waivers by Miami after 23 other teams passed  
on him and is now getting a base salary of $395,000 in the first

<HEADLINE> U.N. Votes for E. Timor Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations' main human rights body voted  
Monday for an international inquiry into atrocities in East Timor, 
despite opposition from Indonesia and its Asian allies. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency session of the 53-member U.N. Human Rights  
Commission voted 32-12 with six abstentions in favor of the move, 
proposed by the European Union. Three countries were not present. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU had tried to overcome resistance from Indonesia and its  
Asian allies to an inquiry into reported massacres and other 
abuses. Asian countries, including China and the Philippines, voted 
against. Japan and South Korea abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's ambassador, Hassan Wirajuda, said his country was  
not obliged to honor the resolution but would pursue its own 
efforts to investigate rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Extremely grave violations ... need to be addressed by the  
international community,'' said Finnish Ambassador Pekka 
Huhtaniemi, speaking on behalf of the EU and east European 
countries. ``This is indispensable for the reconciliation and for 
the future of East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wirajuda had called on ``friends of Indonesia'' to reject the  
proposal. ``The high-handed self-righteous approach ... could well 
provoke a strong nationalist backlash in Indonesia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the EU replaced a strongly worded proposal with a  
slightly softer version, which included praise for the Jakarta 
government and stressed the importance of Indonesia's own National 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU insisted an investigation should be internationally led  
with Indonesian participation, but Indonesia proposed a national 
fact-finding mission with foreign observers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission of inquiry, which could be the first step toward  
establishment of a U.N. war crimes tribunal for East Timor, was 
supported by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Huhtaniemi welcomed Indonesian promises to investigate abuses  
but maintained the resolution was ``constructive and cooperative in 
its spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wirajuda said Indonesia is ``actively considering the  
establishment of a special court for human rights.''

the London Stock Exchange and its financial stocks as star 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies rose 4.35  
points, or 1.4 percent to close at 309.38, with the bank index up 
2.5 percent, and the technology index up 2.0 percent.

percent, the Paris CAC-40 index rose 1.2 percent and Amsterdam's 
AEX index rose 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest Bank rose 9.0 pecent amid speculation that Royal Bank of  
Scotland may launch a bid to rival Bank of Scotland's hostile $34.3 
billion offer last week. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of 
Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Woolwich all rose. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	In London, Anglo American was the best blue-chip performer, up  
9.4 percent as gold prices surged. 
</P>
<P>
	This followed a pledge by 15 European central banks, including  
the Bank of England, for a five-year moratorium on all new sales of

speculation will add to the optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economies (in Europe) are starting to bounce back and all this  
corporate activity shows that there is momentum herem,'' said 
Sharon Coombs, European strategist at HSBC Securities. ``It's 
likely to continue over the next couple of years. There's a lot of 
scope for Europe.''

<HEADLINE> Tennessee's Dwayne Goodrich Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee cornerback Dwayne Goodrich was  
charged with disorderly conduct after police say he threatened 
officers who asked him to leave a convenience store near campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich was arrested at 2:20 a.m. Sunday at Rocky Top Market.  
He was released from the Knox County Detention Center at 8:45 a.m. 
after posting bond several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	A police report said Goodrich was intoxicated and, when asked to  
leave the store, became loud and threatened to hurt officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Phillip Fulmer told The Tennessean he was aware of the  
arrest, but had no comment. In the past, Fulmer has suspended 
players for disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich, 21, a senior co-captain and regarded as one of the  
country's better defensive back, intercepted a pass Saturday in No. 
7 Tennessee's 17-16 victory over Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 185-pounder from Oak Lawn, Ill., returned an  
interception for a touchdown in the Vols' 23-16 Fiesta Bowl victory 
over Florida State that gave them the national title last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodrich started all 13 games last year and led the secondary  
with 10 pass breakups.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are easing House-approved  
cuts in President Clinton's plans for education and other social 
programs, but they still face clashes over many of the White 
House's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee planned to vote today on a  
$324 billion social spending bill for fiscal 2000, which begins 
Friday. The measure, approved Monday by a subcommittee, would 
outspend Clinton on education by $500 million, but provide less 
than he wants for hiring teachers, after-school centers and some of 
his other favorite initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very tough line between what I think the president  
will sign and what I can sell'' to congressional Republicans, the 
subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said in an 
interview. ``It is a devilishly difficult judgment play, but I 
think we're on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to complete as many of the 13 annual spending bills as  
possible by the new fiscal year, GOP leaders planned to push a 
compromise $21 billion energy and water projects measure through 
the Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill, which would be the fifth to be sent to Clinton, was  
likely to get his signature after Republicans dropped language that 
would have helped developers and local governments file quicker 
legal appeals when the government blocks them from building on 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the measure Monday by 327-87. Even so, Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson criticized Republicans for ``severe 
cuts'' in Clinton's requests for security of plutonium and 
computers and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step, House-Senate bargainers approved a compromise  
$12.6 billion foreign aid measure for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiators dropped language barring aid to groups that  
lobby to ease overseas abortion restrictions, a defeat for 
anti-abortion conservatives. But the bill contained $2 billion less 
than Clinton wanted, cuts that prompted an administration veto 
threat when they were proposed in earlier versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	With Congress certain to fail to send Clinton all the spending  
measures by Friday, lawmakers planned votes as early as today on a 
stopgap bill that would keep agencies functioning through Oct. 21. 
White House budget chief Jack Lew said the president would sign the 
bill, but warned that Republicans should be under ``no illusion'' 
that he would sign several short-term measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already threatened to veto the House's version  
of the education-health-labor bill, citing its cuts in his plans 
for job training for teen-agers, hiring teachers, and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill eased many of the reductions, but not all. But  
its numbers pushed it far closer to what an eventual compromise 
between the White House and Congress was likely to look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe our bill is not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better  
than what the House did,'' said the subcommittee's top Democrat, 
Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would finance the departments of Labor, Education  
and Health and Human Services for fiscal 2000. It is the most 
controversial -- and the last -- of the 13 annual spending bills to 
begin making its way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the measure would pay for automatically approved  
benefits such as Medicaid. The portion that lawmakers fully control 
totals $91.7 billion -- $4 billion more than this year but $1.4 
billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that money, the Senate bill would provide $200 million less  
than the $1.4 billion Clinton wanted for hiring thousands of new 
teachers; $60 million below the $240 million he sought for GEAR-UP, 
which helps disadvantaged students prepare for college; and $200 
million below the $400 million he proposed for before- and 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would provide $35.2 billion for education, $500 million  
more than Clinton; $11.4 billion for labor programs, $200 million 
less than Clinton wanted; and $37.5 billion for health and human 
services programs, $1.6 billion below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $17.6 billion for the National Institutes  
of Health, $1.7 billion more than Clinton; $6 billion for education 
for handicapped students, or $600 million more than Clinton; and 
$7.8 billion for Pell grants for low-income undergraduates, $300 
million more than Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To help Republicans claim the measure would not eat into Social  
Security surpluses, they would delay $16.5 billion of the bill's 
spending until fiscal 2001.

<HEADLINE> Big Trucks Facing Tougher Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is  
crafting new rules for tougher emission standards and cleaner 
burning diesel fuel to reduce pollution from large, heavy-duty 
trucks, according to interest groups briefed on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA plans to announce some interim steps within a few weeks  
and follow up by proposing regulations early next year that would 
dramatically reduce the amount of smog-causing chemicals and soot 
coming from truck tailpipes, according to these sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the EPA is preparing regulations that would cut  
sulfur in diesel fuel perhaps by as much as 90 percent, said the 
sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA officials declined to give details beyond saying that some  
new proposals on truck pollution will be announced within a few 
weeks and that EPA Administrator Carol Browner is intent on 
reducing air emissions from heavy-duty trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the EPA announced it would complete regulations by the  
end of the year to sharply reduce smog-causing chemicals from 
automobiles, including popular sport utility vehicles and pickup 
trucks. And it proposed requiring low-sulfur gasoline to be sold 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar approach that would require cleaner vehicles as well  
as cleaner fuel is being developed as part of the agency's efforts 
to curtail pollution from large tractor-trailer rigs, dump trucks 
and other heavy-duty trucks, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tougher emissions and fuel standards for large trucks would  
begin to be phased in by 2007, according to sources familiar with 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	While the more than 5 million large trucks and buses account for  
only 2.5 percent of all vehicles on the road, they produce 26 
percent of the smog-causing nitrogen oxide from vehicles and more 
than half of the soot in urban air, according to the Clean Air 
Trust, an environmental advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the interim steps to be proposed in next few weeks, the  
EPA is expected to propose more stringent pollution requirements on 
medium-size trucks weighing 8,500 to 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	While most sport utility vehicles and pickups weigh less than  
that and will be covered by the EPA's automobile standard, there 
has been growing consumer demand for big pickups and giant SUVs 
that do not have to meet the stricter light truck or car emissions 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	To close this ``loophole'' as critics have called it, the EPA is  
expected to propose that these medium-size vehicles will have to 
meet new, stricter emissions standards recently enacted by 
California, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the separate regulation expected to be announced early next  
year, the EPA will require that by 2007: 
</P>
<P>
	--Smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions from trucks be cut by 75  
percent to 90 percent beyond what already is being required in 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	--Particulates, or microscopic soot, be reduced by 90 percent  
over what is required today. 
</P>
<P>
	--The sulfur content of diesel fuel be cut to less than 40 parts  
per million, compared with an average of 500 parts per million in 
diesel today. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the EPA required that trucks meet tougher  
emissions controls beginning in 2004, but now there is widespread 
opinion within the agency that more stringent standards are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there is a great need to go further,'' agreed Frank  
O'Donnell of Clean Air Trust. ``These trucks are a huge source of 
pollution, and cleaning up the fuel is an integral part of the EPA 
plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Becker, who represents state and county air pollution  
agencies, said cleaner trucks and cleaner diesel fuel are needed 
for states and communities to meet federal air quality 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trucks emit huge amounts of diesel exhaust which adversely  
affects human health,'' said Becker.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Mixed in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities were mixed in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.720 percent, up from 4.660 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.810 percent, down from 4.890 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 30 when the  
bills sold for 4.875 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Aug. 2 when the rate was 4.750. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.856 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,880.70 and 5.013 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,756.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield  
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making 
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, declined to 5.23 percent last 
week from 5.26 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Traders Press for Action on Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Currency traders put pressure on the world's  
financial leaders Monday to respond to the yen's sharp rise and 
protect Japan's fragile economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	And at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund,  
financial ministers and central bank governors took time out from 
squabbling over Japan's monetary policy to hear comments on the 
global economy from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan participated in weekend meetings of finance ministers  
and central bank governors from the United States and other G-7 
countries during which they said they shared Japan's worries about 
the impact of the yen's appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was higher against the yen Monday in Europe, holding  
on to its earlier gains in Asia, as currency dealers digested 
statements made over the weekend by Bank of Japan and the G-7. But 
analysts said if Japan doesn't follow its statements with action, 
the yen could resume its climb. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has strengthened by about 15 percent against the dollar  
since early July, trading at 106.31 Monday in Europe compared to 
104.21 in New York late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials and businesses fear the yen's climb will make  
the country's exports more expensive as the economy begins to pull 
out of recession. This could help set off inflation in the United 
States and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Monday to the World Bank's Development Committee, which  
groups many emerging market countries, Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers said the IMF and the World Bank should work more closely to 
fight global poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	He also renewed the U.S. demand for stronger anti-corruption  
safeguards in the institutions' aid packages.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Scores Record TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Ryder Cup had its best overnight rating  
Sunday, but it was still lower than all of golf's majors played on 
American soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's comeback victory by the Americans in singles play  
posted a 6.3 overnight mark and a 15 share, according to NBC. That 
was up 62 percent from the 1997 Ryder Cup and up 43 percent from 
the 1995 event, the last time it was held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But the final day eclipsed only that of this year's British  
Open, which had a 5.7 overnight rating. The Masters (10.7), U.S. 
Open (7.9) and the PGA Championships (7.7) all had higher ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL also fared better Sunday, with Fox posting a 10.9 and  
CBS a 9.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 6 1/2-hour Ryder Cup program peaked from 4-4:30 p.m. EDT  
with a 8.5/14. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC showed nearly 11 hours of coverage Saturday and had a  
4.9/17. Over the two days, the network aired a Ryder Cup record 17 
hours, 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The network estimates 55 million viewers saw all or part of the  
Ryder Cup, surpassing the previous high of 42 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The two telecasts also gave the program its highest two-day  
average. The average was 5.4/14, breaking the mark of 4.1/12 in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	National ratings will be available later this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Overnight ratings measure the top 46 markets across the country.  
The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation tuned 
to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays Sign Catcher Flaherty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays signed catcher John  
Flaherty to a three-year contract extension Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is the kind of veteran player we want to help us bring a  
championship team to Tampa Bay,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. 
``He is a smart player, a solid individual both on and off the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty is hitting .280 with 14 home runs and 70 RBIs in 114  
games this season. He has thrown out 47 of 121 attempted base 
stealers (39 percent), the second best percentage in the league to 
Texas' Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty, who will be under contract through 2002, is the third  
player this month the Devil Rays decided to bring back for next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Canseco's option for 2000 was picked up Sept. 15 and Fred  
McGriff signed a two-year extension on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Larry Rothschild also signed a one-year extension  
through 2002 this month and LaMar's contract was extended through 
2004.

<HEADLINE> Nun Says She Will Stop Gay Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A nun ordered by the Vatican to cease her  
ministry to gay and lesbian Roman Catholics says she will obey but 
will work within the church to have the order reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Jeannine Gramick said in a statement that she believes it  
``more beneficial'' to minister to homosexuals with the church's 
blessing than without it. 
</P>
<P>
	She called on fellow Roman Catholics to ``help me find creative,  
collaborative ways to lift the burden of this directive from my 
shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gramick, 57, and the Rev. Robert Nugent, the founders of New  
Ways Ministry in Mount Rainier, were summoned to Rome in July and 
ordered to stop their work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said  
Nugent and Ms. Gramick ``have caused confusion among the Roman 
Catholic people and have harmed the community of the church.'' It 
called their teachings ``erroneous and dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said in late July he would stop ministering to  
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Gramick had refused to talk about the decision, saying  
she was ``anguished and deeply troubled.'' She took a month's leave 
from her ministerial commitments to decide whether she would obey 
the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gramick called the church's decision ``unfair'' and said she  
wants to ``pursue the call I still feel to minister to lesbian and 
gay people,'' The Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent met Ms. Gramick founded the New Ways Ministry in 1977 to  
``promote justice and reconciliation of gays and lesbians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts led to seminars as well as books and pamphlets on  
homosexuality and the church. In 1988, Nugent and Ms. Gramick were 
told their case was being investigated by the church. 
</P>
<P>
	While the church teaches that homosexual acts are evil, it also  
says that homosexuals should be treated with ``respect, compassion 
and sensitivity.'' Gay rights groups have said the two repeatedly 
refused to condemn homosexual acts as evil and instead strove for 
reconciliation for gays with the church.

<HEADLINE> Gore Avoids Mentioning Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SWANZEY, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has grandparenting  
down pat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently the preferred method is to give them everything  
they want,'' he said about his nearly 3-month-old grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is becoming less clear whether he can give New Hampshire  
voters everything they want. Recent polls show rival Bill Bradley 
gaining on him in New Hampshire and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaking up sun and support from 300 or so folks at a pond-side  
picnic Sunday, Gore brushed off a question about the polls as if it 
were a fly buzzing around the apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I'm not taking any vote for granted,'' Gore  
told The Associated Press. ``This is going to be a hard, tough 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later in Manchester, Gore said he no longer considers  
himself the front-runner in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the underdog in New Hampshire,'' he told The Union Leader  
of Manchester. ``Because of what you and the news media have been 
covering in the polls, which shows... that it's a dead-even race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One picnic-goer, Randy Filiault of Keene, said his wife is a  
Gore supporter, but he hasn't made up his mind yet, in part because 
he is not convinced Gore is electable. Polls also show Gore 
trailing the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bradley and Gore have touched on the issues equally  
well, but Gore has to overcome the perception that he's 
unelectable. I think that perception has helped Bradley,'' Filiault 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Gus Lerandean of Swanzey wasn't buying that. He said  
he doesn't put much faith in the polls this early and criticized 
Bradley for abandoning the Democratic Party when he left the 
Senate. He praised Gore for ``being in the trenches so long and not 
jumping ship on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He just has that stick-to-it-ness,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After his arrival, Gore joined in a volleyball game for a few  
minutes before launching into his campaign speech. 
</P>
<P>
	With his wife, Tipper, by his side, he sounded broad themes of  
``expanding the definition of human dignity'' by reaching out to 
people with disabilities and others who face discrimination because 
of their race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, a bit more fired up, he listed some of his familiar goals,  
including a higher minimum wage, smaller school class sizes, 
broader access to preschools and more organizational power to labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations, he said, should have less  
power over people's lives and medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have a right to play God,'' Gore said. ``These  
decisions ought to be made by doctors and nurses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Gore didn't talk about was Bradley. In the AP interview  
after his speech, Gore denied a report in Time magazine that his 
campaign is beginning to orchestrate attacks on the former New 
Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Gore's supporters have criticized Bradley's  
past support of school vouchers that would give parents tax money 
to use for private schools and his proposed policy that would allow 
declared homosexuals to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't said the first word about him. I haven't even  
mentioned his name,'' Gore said Sunday. ``I'm concentrating on 
presenting a positive vision.''

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Up; Gold Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gold prices soared today following an  
international agreement to limit sales from government and other 
official stocks. The U.S. dollar was mostly higher and surged 
against the Japanese yen in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold finished at $279.90 in London, up from $269.00 Friday. At  
midmorning, London gold dealers fixed a recommended price of 
$281.70. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich, gold traded at $280.93, up from $268.35.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold rose $16.95 in Hong Kong to $283.00.  
</P>
<P>
	Monday's prices were the highest since May 7, when Britain  
announced it planned to sell 125 metric tons of its gold reserves 
by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold rallied after the International Monetary Fund's  
policy-making Interim Committee, meeting in Washington over the 
weekend, approved a plan to revalue up to 14 million ounces of its 
gold reserves in transactions with central banks to partly finance 
a Third World debt initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF had dropped plans to sell gold on the open market under  
pressure from gold-mining countries and U.S. lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further effort to bolster gold prices, central bank  
officials from 15 nations pledged Sunday they would hold future 
gold sales to limits already announced. 
</P>
<P>
	In the currency markets, the euro was quoted at $1.0440 in late  
European trading, down from $1.0462 Friday. Later, in midday 
trading in New York, the euro traded at $1.0446. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,  
included 106.19 Japanese yen, up from 104.08; 1.5340 Swiss francs, 
up from 1.5296; 1.4694 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4732. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6478, up from $1.6424.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 106.14 yen, and  
the pound was worth $1.6460. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency rallied against the yen early on  
short-covering after a stalled selloff overnight, but the future 
direction depends on the Bank of Japan's policy, analysts said. 
Short-covering occurs when traders, who earlier had bet on a 
decline in the dollar, buy dollars to either take profits on the 
decline or limit their losses as the dollar rises. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8743 German marks, up from 1.8687; 
6.2855 French francs, up from 6.2681; 2.1120 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.1060; 1,855.55 Italian lire, up from 1,850.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver closed in London at $5.36 bid per troy ounce, up from  
$5.27.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Backs Controversial Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Taking a stand at odds with the man she'll  
probably run against next year, the first lady said today she 
doesn't personally approve of a museum's controversial exhibit but 
thinks it's wrong to take city funds away from the institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking outside a Harlem school this morning, Hillary Rodham  
Clinton said she doesn't like the idea of a portrait of the Virgin 
Mary embellished with elephant dung, part of an upcoming exhibit at 
the Brooklyn Museum, but she believes the museum has a right to 
show it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, like Mrs. Clinton, is considering  
running for U.S. Senate, is pledging to cut $7 million in city 
funds if the museum goes ahead with the show, ``Sensation: Young 
British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' set to open 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share the feeling that I know many New Yorkers have that  
there are parts of this exhibit that would be deeply offensive,'' 
Mrs. Clinton said. ``I would not go to see this exhibit.'' But she 
said `it is not appropriate to penalize and punish an institution 
such as the Brooklyn Museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Cardinal John O'Connor sided with the Republican  
mayor, while civil rights activists said that pulling the museum's 
funding would violate the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened by what appears to be an attack not only on our  
blessed mother ... but one must ask if it is not an attack on 
religion itself and in a special way on the Catholic Church,'' 
O'Connor said Sunday in his weekly sermon at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor did not name Giuliani, but he said he was grateful to  
city officials, adding: ``It is their right, if not their duty, to 
express themselves on such matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged his listeners to send protest letters to the museum.  
But New York Civil Liberties Union director Norman Siegel said the 
threat to cut funding violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``His assertion that New York City can withdraw all funds for  
the museum based on a single exhibition that he finds offensive 
illustrates a serious misunderstanding of the Constitution,'' 
Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel is organizing a Friday rally in support of the exhibit  
outside the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's director, Arnold Lehman, has not publicly said what  
he will do, but he has a reputation for standing firm on matters of 
artistic expression. Directors of other museums have been 
noticeably silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chill in the air because people are afraid of the  
mayor, but if he wins this one there are huge consequences to 
artistic expression,'' Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting, ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' depicts Mary with dark  
skin, African features and flowing robes. It features a shellacked 
clump of elephant dung and two dozen cutouts of buttocks from 
pornographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The artist, Chris Ofili, 30, last year won Britain's prestigious  
Turner Prize, a $33,000 award for artists under 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Ofili, a Roman Catholic, was quoted in The New York Times as  
saying that he used the pornographic images because classical 
images of Mary are often ``sexually charged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began using elephant dung during a six-week stay in Zimbabwe.  
He is now famous for using the material -- which he gets from the 
London Zoo -- in virtually all his artwork and calls it ``quite a 
beautiful object.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at his London residence seeking comment on the  
controversy were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The same show caused a stir two years ago when it was displayed  
at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Three academy members 
resigned in protest when it opened, but record crowds came to look. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its other provocative pieces are Damien Hirst's ``This  
Little Piggy Went to Market, This Little Piggy Stayed Home,'' which 
features two pig halves floating in formaldehyde, and Marcus 
Harvey's ``Myra,'' a 13-foot-high painting of a woman convicted in 
1966 in the notorious British child killings known as the Moors 
murders. It was created from children's handprints, and in Britain, 
in created a furor and was splashed with ink and egg on the opening 
day of the show.

<HEADLINE> B&AMP;W Professes Love for Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Love is in the air at Brown &AMP; Williamson  
Tobacco Corp., which professes its affection for adult smokers on a 
customer telephone line that has industry critics fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll-free number is listed on packages of Lucky Strike  
cigarettes. The B&AMP;W brand once went to war with American GIs and 
now is at the heart of the marketing campaign to project the 
company's softer side. 
</P>
<P>
	Once non-smokers and callers younger than 21 are shooed away  
from the telephone message, the company gets right to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a little soon but, well, it just feels right,'' the  
male voice says as soft mood music begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., are in love with  
you. Yep, you heard right. Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco is in love,'' 
the voice says, as the music crescendos. ``We're a giant 
corporation and you make us feel like a little kitten. Thank you, 
lover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callers are invited to sign up for Brown &AMP; Williamson's mailing  
list, speak to a service representative or get information about 
stores selling B&AMP;W cigarettes in their area. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Joe Helewicz said Monday that the  
company wanted to have fun with the number, which connects callers 
with the B&AMP;W consumer-information center at its Louisville 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You call an 800 number and it's kind of cold,'' Helewicz said.  
``We're just trying to do something that's a little different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry critics contend the courtship is motivated by  
Brown &AMP; Williamson's desire for smokers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahron Leichtman, executive director for Citizens for a  
Tobacco-free Society, based in Cincinnati, said the message dripped 
with insincerity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really ludicrous that any cigarette company would attempt  
to befriend their customers by telling them how much they love 
them, when in fact what they love about the customer is that he or 
she is going to become addicted to a product for the rest of their 
lives,'' Leichtman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Carol Birgmann, executive director of Kentucky ACTION, a  
statewide tobacco prevention and control coalition, said the phone 
line offered no way to prevent minors from listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith said several safeguards  
work against minors getting smoking-related information. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers wanting coupons for B&AMP;W products have to sign a form  
verifying they are at least 21, and those who order from B&AMP;W's 
merchandise catalog have to send in copies of their drivers' 
licenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The line was installed six weeks ago and will continue for  
another couple of weeks, Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Man Says He OK'd Bush for Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The former speaker of the Texas House of  
Representatives acknowledged Monday that he called the head of the 
Texas Air National Guard in 1968 to recommend George W. Bush for a 
pilot slot during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ben Barnes, who later was lieutenant governor, said the  
request for his help came from a Bush family friend -- not Bush or 
his father, who then was a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner,  
meanwhile, insisted again that neither he nor his father sought 
such assistance when he joined the Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you what happened. Nothing happened. My Guard unit  
was looking for pilots and I flew for the Guard,'' Bush said at a 
campaign appearance south of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of my service and any allegation that my dad asked  
for special favors is simply not true. ... I didn't ask anybody to 
help get me to the Guard either,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, a Democrat, has been at the center of questions about  
Bush's Vietnam-era service for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His name surfaced in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas  
by the former executive director of the Texas Lottery. Lawrence 
Littwin has sued GTECH Corp., the lottery operator, alleging that 
the company is to blame for his firing in 1997, after four months 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to court records, Littwin's lawyers wanted to question  
Barnes, who used to lobby for GTECH, about whether GTECH was 
allowed to keep its lucrative state contract in exchange for 
Barnes' silence about the Guard matter. 
</P>
<P>
	That theory has been dismissed as unfounded by GTECH, Barnes and  
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes testified for several hours Monday in a deposition in the  
case. Afterwards, his lawyer issued a written statement saying 
Barnes had been contacted by the now-deceased Sidney Adger, a 
Houston oilman and friend of the elder Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barnes was contacted by Sid Adger and asked to recommend  
George W. Bush for a pilot position with the Air National Guard. 
Barnes called Gen. (James) Rose (Texas Air Guard commander) and did 
so,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither Congressman Bush nor any other member of the Bush  
family asked Barnes' help. Barnes has no knowledge that Governor 
Bush or President Bush knew of Barnes' recommendation,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also said he met in September 1998 with Donald L. Evans,  
a longtime friend and chief fund-raiser for Governor Bush. Barnes 
told Evans about Adger's request, and ``Governor Bush wrote Barnes 
a note thanking him for his candor in acknowledging that Barnes 
received no call from any member of the Bush family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Evans said he met  
with Barnes on his own initiative, without informing the governor 
in advance. At the time, he was Bush's gubernatorial campaign 
chairman and was concerned only about that contest, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joined the National Guard in 1968, at the height of the  
Vietnam War, serving until late 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor has said for several years that he  
received no special treatment. Both he and his father, the former 
president, have said they didn't ask for help in finding the Guard 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if Ben Barnes did or not -- but he was not asked  
by me or my dad,'' Bush said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are relying on whether a man who is deceased (Adger)  
tried to help. I can just tell you, from my perspective, I never 
asked for, I don't believe I received any special treatment,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush indicated that he wasn't concerned about Barnes'  
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody ought to tell the truth when they're being  
deposed. I'm confident he will,'' Bush said. ``I'm not sure what 
Ben Barnes is going to say. But I know what the facts are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he considered questions about his National Guard  
service a personal attack, Bush replied, ``I think it's just 
politics.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mookie Says Mets Can't Get Any Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mookie Wilson toted a rolling suitcase behind him as he strolled  
out of the New York Mets' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to catch a cab,'' said Wilson, whose harmless grounder  
produced the most stirring comeback in team history in the 1986 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, Mookie. The way the Mets are going, the cab almost  
certainly would be late. Or dispatched to the wrong stadium. Or 
parked on the roadside with a blown tire, a busted radiator and 
nothing but fumes in the gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
	This pretty much describes the state of the Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``It can't get any worse, but I don't want to say that,''  
catcher Mike Piazza said after the Mets' collapse continued Sunday 
with their sixth straight loss, 3-2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily for them, the Mets did not have to play another game  
Monday. If they had split the six games, they would be in a better 
position to qualify for the postseason, where they haven't been in 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Atlanta Braves won the division and the Mets are 1 1/2  
games behind the Cincinnati Reds and the Houston Astros for the 
wild card with six to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't explain baseball sometimes,'' said Wilson, whose  
ground ball through Bill Buckner's legs capped a miraculous 
comeback in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. ``Things happen. You 
don't know why they happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, the Mets' first base coach, had a great view of what  
transpired in the ninth inning against the Phillies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bases were loaded with one out. Wayne Gomes had just thrown  
12 balls in 13 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally would stay alive if Rickey Henderson, who had grounded  
into only three double plays all season, did anything but ground 
into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Henderson grounded into a double play, leaving the  
Mets stuck in what looks like a cruel replay of last season -- when 
they lost the last five games and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked enough,'' Henderson said. ``I got nothing to say  
about this crazy stuff going on right now. Ride it out. Let's go 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is where the Mets will be Tuesday, beginning their final  
stretch of three games against Atlanta and three against 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do or say about it,'' Wilson said.  
``You have to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were one game behind the Braves when they arrived in  
Atlanta last Tuesday and 3 1/2 in front of the Reds for the wild card. 
The Braves clinched the division title Sunday with a 10-0 victory 
at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' defense deserted them in the final game at Atlanta,  
where the best defensive team in the majors made two costly errors. 
At Philadelphia, the bats went silent. From the seventh inning 
Friday through the sixth inning Sunday, John Olerud was 5-for-8 and 
the rest of the Mets were 2-for-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed that we'd sweep them,'' said former Met Rico  
Brogna, who homered in each of the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, manager Bobby Valentine said he should be fired if  
the Mets don't make the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Mitsubishi Heavy To Cut 5,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese machinery maker Mitsubishi Heavy  
Industries Ltd. plans to cut 5,000 jobs, or 14.2 percent of its 
work force, in a restructuring drive after lowering its earnings 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy said today it expects a group net loss of $500  
million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000. It had 
previously forecast that it would break even. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy said it is drawing up a new four-year  
restructuring plan that is expected to include slashing 5,000 jobs 
from its work force of 35,000 by March 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous fiscal year, the company posted a group net  
profit of $174 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has been hurt this year by the weak Japanese  
and Asian economies, as well as its failure to meet the plant 
specifications of its customers.

<HEADLINE> Black Stuntworkers Claim Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Black stuntworkers said Monday that  
discrimination in Hollywood is keeping them out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling it,'' said Wayne King Jr., one of several  
stuntworkers at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	King doubled for Michael Jordan in ``Space Jam'' and did stunts  
in ``Amistad,'' Steven Spielberg's movie about a revolt on a slave 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the lack of roles for minorities on television  
has been a contentious issue, with advocacy groups criticizing the 
TV networks for largely white casting this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, black stuntworkers are voicing anger over ``paint downs,''  
in which white stuntworkers don dark make-up and wigs to stand in 
for such actors as Eddie Murphy, Samuel L. Jackson and Lou Gossett 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have paint downs, you're taking jobs away from  
African-Americans,'' said Marvin Walters, a retired black stuntman. 
``I don't care what they say, this is discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters had no hard statistics, but estimated that of some 65  
black stuntworkers in Hollywood, only 15 work on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters is calling for a ``fade-out'' from Oct. 8 to 10 of all  
Viacom productions, asking viewers not to watch any of the products 
from the company that owns CBS, MTV, VH-1 and Nickelodeon, as well 
as the Blockbuster chain of video-rental stores. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that a white stuntwoman has stood in for the female  
Asian lead of CBS' ``Martial Law'' and voiced anger over the hiring 
choices on Paramount's ``Shaft,'' a spin-off of the 1970s TV 
detective series starring Jackson that is in production in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaft'' director and producer John Singleton, who is black,  
said he simply ``hired the best people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Chris Ender said ``Martial Law'' star Kelly Hu has  
a regular Asian stuntwoman but that one time the woman didn't want 
to do a stunt where she had to fall off a cliff.

<HEADLINE> Israel Policy Worries Arab Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Arab Israeli lawmakers say the government's  
decision to crack down on radicals in their community in the wake 
of three terror attacks is reminiscent of their difficult years 
under military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdulmalik Dahamshe of the Democratic Arab Party said Monday  
that the revival of censorship and criminal prosecution against 
incitement reminded Arab Israelis of the military government which 
controlled their villages and towns until 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy followed allegations that Israeli Arabs carried  
out two bombings and fatally stabbed two people in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``This policy endangers dual existence in the country and  
threatens the equal rights for Arabs,'' Dahamshe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab Israeli lawmakers met with Islamic Movement leaders Monday  
to discuss their concerns that the new policy legally distinguishes 
their community from other citizens. They have noted that acts of 
Jewish terror against Arabs have not resulted in crackdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweeping measures have always existed within Israeli law,  
but have been dormant since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Jerusalem, some 30,000 supporters of the powerful  
ultra-Orthodox Shas party held a rally Monday in a city park. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the powerful party, whose constituency is made up  
mostly of working class Jews from North African and Arab countries, 
have hinted that they might leave the government if the party's 
ailing education system does not receive funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, two Israelis were slightly injured in separate  
stone-throwing incidents in the divided West Bank town of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli man was injured when stones were thrown towards a bus  
and an Israeli girl was injured at a junction elsewhere in the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 500 Jewish settlers live in Israeli controlled enclaves in  
the town of 130,000 Palestinians. The two groups live in uneasy 
proximity and often target one another in attacks.

<HEADLINE> West Va.'s Bulger Out for Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia quarterback Marc Bulger  
will miss at least two games with a broken right index finger, 
coach Don Nehlen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger's finger struck the face mask of a Syracuse player while  
attempting a pass Saturday. X-rays taken at the game were negative, 
but further tests showed the break. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurt at the time, but I thought it was fine,'' Bulger said.  
``The more time went on, the more it swelled up. I couldn't bend it 
at the knuckle. I couldn't grip the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger's loss is bad news for an offense that has not scored a  
touchdown in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids have to pull together,'' Nehlen said. ``Normally, if  
the guys are tight, a little adversity will pull them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Brad Lewis, who replaced Bulger for the second half,  
will get his first career start Saturday at home against Navy 
(1-3). Lewis was 8-of-14 for 64 yards with two interceptions in the 
30-7 loss at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Scott McBrien, who has not played this season, will be  
Lewis' backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger, holder of 22 school records, has started every game  
since the 1997 opener, a streak of 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Bulger is 67-of-111 for 692 yards, five TDs and six  
interceptions. In 1998, he set school records with 3,607 yards and 
31 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia (1-3) is off Oct. 9 and has home games with  
Rutgers on Oct. 16 and Temple on Oct. 23.

<HEADLINE> Chiquita Source Sues Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former lawyer for Chiquita sued The  
Cincinnati Enquirer on Monday, accusing the newspaper of breaking a 
promise by identifying him as a source for its expose of the banana 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	George G. Ventura claims former Enquirer reporters Michael  
Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter promised him confidentiality -- with 
management's knowledge -- in exchange for inside information about 
Chiquita Brands International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the reporters violated that promise by secretly  
taping conversations with him and later identifying him to Chiquita 
and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory  
damages. His federal lawsuit accuses the Enquirer and its parent, 
the Gannett Co., of breach of contract, fraud and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer and Gannett denied identifying confidential  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer in May 1998 published a series of stories  
suggesting that Cincinnati-based Chiquita engaged in improper 
business practices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The next month, the newspaper fired Gallagher, saying he had  
employed unethical means of getting information, and renounced the 
stories in a front-page apology. The newspaper also paid Chiquita 
more than $10 million to settle any legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher later admitted stealing Chiquita executives' voice  
mail for the series and was sentenced to five years of probation. 
He also cooperated in the prosecution of Ventura, who was 
identified in court as a source for the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Ventura pleaded no contest to supplying the secret  
codes Gallagher used to get into the voice-mail boxes. Ventura got 
two years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, 38, now a lawyer in Utah, said the disclosure that he  
was a source for the Enquirer stories cost him his job at a Salt 
Lake City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence K. Beaupre, then editor of the Enquirer and now a news  
executive at Gannett, denied the allegations in Ventura's lawsuit. 
``The Enquirer and Gannett have never identified any confidential 
sources,'' Beaupre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's lawyer, Patrick Hanley, said: ``We don't believe  
that Mike Gallagher broke any promises to Mr. Ventura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter is now a reporter for The Detroit News, another  
Gannett newspaper. His lawyer also said McWhirter did not identify 
sources for the Chiquita story.

	McCain Launches White House Bid  
</P>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain officially opened his Republican  
presidential campaign today. The Vietnam war hero and U.S. Senator 
from Arizona declared himself the best candidate to command 
American troops and reform a political system that is ``a spectacle 
of selfish ambition.'' He pledged to protect Social Security, cut 
taxes, veto pork-barrel spending, improve access to the Internet 
and test the merits of spending government money in private schools 
nationwide.

	Budget Surplus Reaches $115 Billion  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the federal  
budget surplus is now expected to hit a record $115 billion for the 
fiscal year that ends this week. Clinton called the estimate 
``proof that we're on the right road to prosperity'' and urged 
Congress to work with him to shore up the retirement system and 
invest in education. Even after adjusting for inflation, the 
administration figure still represents the largest surplus in 
American history, the administration said. The 1999 surplus would 
be about 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product, the largest on 
this basis since 1951.

House dreams. ``There's a time to stay and there's a time to 
fold,'' Quayle said. ``There's a time to know when to leave the 
stage.'' Quayle became the latest victim of Republican front-runner 
George W. Bush's juggernaut. Quayle pledged to work to unite the

	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Northeast Utilities and a subsidiary  
pleaded guilty today to multiple violations of federal nuclear 
safety and clean water laws, agreeing to pay $10 million in 
penalties. The utility and its subdivision, Northeast Nuclear 
Energy Co., agreed to pay $6.65 million in fines and make $3.35 
million in donations, including $1 million to the University of 
Connecticut for a chair in ethics and $1 million for the state's 
open space preservation program. Prosecutors said Northeast 
Nuclear's half share of the total penalty was the biggest in the 
history of the commercial nuclear power industry.

lead today, hitting his 61st off Cincinnati's Ron Villone in his 
second at-bat. The drive landed in the upper deck in left field, 
only the 29th ball to reach that level in stadium history. McGwire 
became the second player to hit 60 twice when he homered in the 
eighth inning yesterday, joining Sosa as the only players in the 
60-60 club. The Reds beat the Cardinals 9-7. Cincinnati's sixth 
victory in seven games gave them a 1 1/2-game lead over the idle New 
York Mets for the NL wild card.

</P>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The neck wound that left Dimitrius  
Underwood of the Miami Dolphins bleeding on a downtown street was 
self-inflicted, police said today. Police found the player 
yesterday after getting calls that a man was yelling for help. He 
was covered with blood as officers approached. Police said 
Underwood apparently slashed his neck with a knife at the home of 
the mother of his twin children. The defensive lineman is listed in 
fair condition after undergoing surgery.

<HEADLINE> Bryn Terfel Shines As Falstaff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel is a large man,  
but he required padding when he sang the title role in Verdi's 
``Falstaff'' to open the 45th season of the Lyric Opera of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The husky Terfel wore belly padding to suggest the paunch of  
Shakespeare's ``goodly, portly man,'' and the padded codpiece that 
completed his red brocade finery in Act 2 drew cackles from 
Saturday's opening night crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	But Terfel's voice required no padding. It had the power to  
convey Falstaff's bombast, the emotion to suggest his eventual 
pathos and all the nimbleness needed for the intricate ensemble 
singing in Verdi's final opera. 
</P>
<P>
	And Terfel's acting and comic timing were almost perfect for the  
role. Although he doesn't turn 34 until November, Terfel was 
convincing as a boozing glutton twice that age. The singer was 
perhaps a bit too agile for an old man in some of the physical 
comedy, but it wouldn't be ``Falstaff'' without some slapstick -- 
and slapstick requires speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is a comedy, ``Falstaff'' is unique in the Verdi  
repertory. The Italian master wrote only one other comedy in his 
long career, and that was a youthful disaster. That Verdi, at 79, 
would emerge from retirement to write one final opera, and make it 
a comedy, is due to the skill and persuasion of fellow composer 
Arrigo Boito, who wrote the libretto for ``Falstaff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boito knew Verdi was fascinated by Shakespeare, so he went to  
that source to find a text to lure the older man out of retirement. 
Boito found it in ``The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' one of 
Shakespeare's weakest plays. To bring more bite and life to the 
pallid Falstaff of ``Merry Wives,'' Boito swiped some 
fuller-blooded passages from ``Henry IV, Part I,'' and pasted them 
into his libretto. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those interpolations provided Terfel with a fine moment  
in Saturday night's performance: the monologue ``L'onore! Ladri!'' 
It's a paraphrase of Falstaff's famous speech about honor in 
``Henry IV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But no ``Falstaff'' can be a one-man show. The opera is Verdi's  
greatest showpiece for ensemble singing, with constantly shifting 
arrays of multiple voices. So the other principals all had a share 
in Terfel's triumph Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Soprano Kallen Esperian and mezzo Patricia Risley were  
delightful as Mistresses Alice Ford and Meg Page, the married women 
Falstaff is deluded into thinking he can seduce. Baritone Lucio 
Gallo was highly effective as the jealous Ford, a role Terfel 
himself has sung. And as Mistress Quickly, contralto Bernadette 
Manca Di Nissa proved a worthy comic foil to Terfel. 
</P>
<P>
	Special applause went to Albanian soprano Inva Mula and Welsh  
tenor Gwyn Hughes Jones, who were both making their local debuts. 
As the young lovers, Nannetta and Fenton, the two couldn't seem to 
keep their hands off one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Falstaff,'' with Antonio Pappano conducting, will have 11 more  
performances, concluding Oct. 29.

<HEADLINE> Head of Miss America Pageant Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The head of the Miss America Pageant  
was abruptly fired from his $250,000-a-year job following a 
controversial decision by the pageant board to drop a longtime ban 
on contestants who've been married or had abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L. Beck, 60, who took over as CEO of the Miss America  
Organization last year, was released from his three-year contract 
Sunday night, according to David Frisch, chairman of the pageant's 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Beck nor pageant officials would say more on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Beck did not return two telephone messages left at his home or  
one at his office. Frisch issued a one-paragraph statement that 
didn't say why Beck was fired, and he did not return telephone 
calls seeking elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the board acknowledged Mr. Beck's contributions to the  
Miss America program during the 12 months that he served as 
president and CEO, they agreed that selecting a new chief executive 
was in the best interests of the Organization at this time,'' 
Frisch's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	A national search for a replacement was to begin immediately,  
the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pageant spokesman John Healy would not say whether Beck was  
fired because of the rules changes, which have been put on hold 
pending talks with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow. I'm surprised it happened this fast,'' said Libby Taylor,  
who runs the Miss Kentucky Pageant and went to court to stop the 
pageant from enacting the rules changes this year. ``I'm just 
speculating, but there has to be more than the contract issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miss America Organization is the nonprofit charity that  
operates the famous beauty pageant. As president and CEO, Beck also 
served as executive producer of the annual Miss America Pageant 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the job on the strength of a resume that included work  
with the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation and the national 
advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving. He had a son killed 
by a drunken driver in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came under fire after The Associated Press reported Sept.  
13 that the pageant had quietly revoked its long-standing ban on 
divorce and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was recommended by Steven Perskie, a pageant lawyer  
who was asked to review the contestant contract that must be signed 
by Miss America hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were made to bring the contract into compliance with  
the state Law Against Discrimination, according to court documents 
filed after furious state directors went to court to block them. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by the pageant's 21-member board last June but never  
made public, the changes outraged state pageant directors, former 
winners and other Miss America pageant traditionalists.

<HEADLINE> Veba, Viag Boards OK Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German utilities Veba and Viag plan to  
merge in a $14.6 billion deal that will create one of Europe's 
biggest electricity suppliers -- and said they were looking for 
acquisitions outside Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisory boards of both companies approved the deal on  
Sunday, the companies announced today. Shareholders and regulators 
must also approve. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create Germany's biggest electricity supplier  
ahead of RWE and Europe's third largest after Electricite de France 
and ENEL of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger puts us at the vanguard of Europe's rapidly  
changing and increasingly competitive energy market,'' Veba 
chairman Ulrich Hartmann said in a statement. ``We're leading the 
consolidation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a later news conference, Hartmann underscored those ambitions  
by saying ``We've made our first contacts'' about possible 
additional deals. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say whom the discussions involved.  
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerates said the combined firm would also become the  
world's biggest supplier of special chemicals. And they said they 
would expand their telecommunications and real estate activities, 
while shedding non-core activities at ``an opportune time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies predicted the merger would bring savings of at  
least $840 million a year by 2002, due to lower costs for capital 
investment and lower personnel costs -- an indication job cuts may 
be planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement calls for Viag shareholders to receive one  
Veba share for 2.8 Viag shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Veba were up 4 percent in Frankfurt after the  
announcement, while Viag shares slipped 3 percent, which traders 
said was due to profit-taking following gains ahead of the merger's 
official announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan must still be approved by shareholders, including the  
Bavarian state government. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Bavaria sold Veba 10 percent of its 25.1  
percent stake in Viag for a base price of $1.7 billion -- a 23 
percent premium, Gov. Edmond Stoiber said. The state will keep its 
remaining stake -- about 5 percent of the merged company -- ``for 
awhile yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has said it wants to sell its Viag stake by 2003 but  
also wants to protect the 20,000 jobs Viag has in Bavaria. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expected approval from antitrust  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	German utilities have been under pressure to consolidate to  
better compete in Europe's recently liberalized energy market. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, which should running by summer 2000, will be  
based in Duesseldorf and headed by Hartmann and Viag chairman 
Wilhelm Simson. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy group of the new company will come from the merger of  
Veba's PreussenElektra with Viag's Bayernwerk. Energy operations 
will be based in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	The specialty chemicals unit will be based initially in  
Frankfurt, where Veba's Degussa-Huels is based, and in Trostberg, 
the home of Viag's SKW Trostberg.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Group Hurting Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in an  
unusually critical report Monday that some countries working with 
the United Nations to end the conflict in Afghanistan are actually 
contributing to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming names, Annan questioned the usefulness of the  
so-called ``Six-Plus-Two'' group and recommended a review by the 
end of the year. The informal grouping is made up of Afghanistan's 
neighbors -- Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Iran 
and China -- plus Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the informal group expressed concern over the  
escalation in fighting between the Taliban Islamic militia that 
controls 90 percent of Afghanistan and the northern-based 
opposition military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Annan said new U.N. reports indicate that external forces  
are supplying weapons and other materials, helping plan military 
offensives and taking part in actual combat. Annan said thousands 
of non-Afghans were involved, mainly on the Taliban side and mostly 
students from religious schools who are as young as 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``By their continuous support for certain Afghan factions, some  
members of the `Six Plus Two' appear mostly to be paying lip 
service to their own stated intentions,'' Annan wrote in the 
report. ``Words must be put into political practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan is widely believed to have aided the Taliban militia in  
their final drive on the Afghan capital in 1996. The Taliban in 
turn have accused Russia and neighboring Tajikistan of aiding its 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the areas under its control, the Taliban militia has imposed  
a harsh legal code based on Afghan tradition and the Islamic holy 
book, the Koran. Under Taliban law, women are forbidden to work or 
attend school and required to wear an all-encompassing garment in 
public. Amputations and executions are among the punishments meted 
out for crimes ranging from theft to adultery and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban -- who are predominantly Sunni Muslims and part of  
Afghanistan's Pushtun majority -- have also been accused by 
international human rights groups of abuses against minorities, 
including Shiite Muslims, ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the report, Annan expressed concern about the worsening human  
rights situation in Taliban-controlled areas, particularly the 
forcing of civilians from their homes during the Taliban's recent 
offensive in the Shomali plains.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Who Revealed Taping Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Don Sanders, a former Senate lawyer  
who revealed the existence of a recording system in Richard Nixon's 
White House, has died after a long battle with cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who died Sunday, had returned to his home state in the  
1980s after more than two decades of federal government service -- 
as a lawyer for congressional committees, as an FBI agent and as an 
assistant secretary of defense under President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the GOP staff lawyer on the Senate Watergate  
Committee who first asked then-presidential aide Alexander 
Butterfield whether there was a recording system in Nixon's White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	After Butterfield confirmed that there was, Sanders said he  
rushed to tell Fred Thompson, the lead minority counsel and now a 
Republican senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both knew then it was important,'' Sanders recalled in a  
1997 interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson asked Butterfield about the taping system during  
nationally televised hearings three days later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was actually Don who discovered the existence of the White  
House taping system, but he was too unassuming to ever mention 
it,'' Thompson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Sanders, while battling cancer, tried to launch a  
national campaign to draft Thompson for the 2000 Republican 
presidential nomination. Thompson declined to enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Louis, Sanders graduated from the University of  
Missouri-Columbia law school and then spent two years in the 
Marines. From 1956 to 1959, he was city attorney for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1959 to 1969, Sanders was an FBI agent. In 1969, he started  
working as a lawyer for congressional committees. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to Missouri, Sanders served as a commissioner in  
Boone County in 1989 and 1990, but he didn't seek re-election. He 
had a private law practice in Columbia until his death.

<HEADLINE> Predators Re-sign Goaltender Dunham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Mike Dunham, the goaltender who got the  
first nine wins in Nashville Predators' history, ended his 22-day 
holdout Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators re-signed Dunham, who had missed the club's first  
eight exhibition games, to a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've missed playing hockey,'' Dunham said at a hastily  
assembled news conference in the Gaylord Entertainment Center. ``I 
apologize to the fans for the situation that occurred. It's too bad 
we couldn't avoid it, but we got it done. We want to put it behind 
us and get back to playing hockey again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager David Poile would not disclose the amount of the  
contract. Dunham's Boston-based agent, Bob Murray, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunham, who went 16-23-3 with a 3.08 goals-against average last  
year for the expansion Predators, will skate with the team for the 
first time this preseason Tuesday morning. Tomas Vokoun is expected 
to start the regular season opener Saturday against the Los Angeles 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville is winless in its exhibition games.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question our team is certainly stronger today with  
Mike Dunham than we were yesterday,'' Poile said. ``We're looking 
for great things from Mike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks stalled weeks ago, when Murray reportedly  
insisted that Dunham should be the Predators' highest paid player. 
Poile felt that was unreasonable, because Dunham played just 44 
games last season due to groin injuries. Center Cliff Ronning's 
$1.7 million salary leads the Predators, who had the NHL's lowest 
payroll last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Poile said that Dunham's compromise deal would not make him the  
club's highest paid player, but that it included incentives based 
on the number of games he played. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to see why we did  
that,'' Poile said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last 10 days, Dunham has been practicing with a U.S.  
national junior team in Michigan. Edmonton Oilers forwards Bill 
Guerin and Mike Grier were also there. Prior to that, Dunham worked 
out in Nashville with Predators trainer Mark Nemish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm the strongest I've ever been,'' Dunham said.  
``I've been skating, I've been working out. I've been doing 
everything I needed to do, including strengthening the groins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an interesting summer, but I'm glad that I'm back  
here. I consider Nashville my home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators selected Dunham in the 1998 expansion draft.  
Dunham, a former All-America at the University of Maine, spent the 
first two years of his NHL career as Martin Brodeur's backup with 
the New Jersey Devils.

<HEADLINE> Parents of Victim, Killer End Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, N.J. (AP) -- Two years to the day after an 11-year-old  
boy was murdered while soliciting PTA donations, his parents made 
peace Monday with the killer's mother and father and will remove 
their names from a wrongful death lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's parents, Edward and Valerie Werner, appeared with  
Nicholas and Dolores Manzie outside the home of a pastor who helped 
unite them. The fathers hugged each other; Mrs. Manzie gave Mrs. 
Werner a bouquet of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe now we can begin to start healing and put the pieces of  
our families back together,'' Mrs. Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Werners said they would remove the Manzies from a lawsuit  
filed Sept. 20. The suit blamed the Manzies, among others, for not 
doing more to control their angry son, who had been in therapy 
after being molested by a 43-year-old man he'd met in an online 
chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, is serving a 70-year prison term for strangling  
sixth-grader Eddie Werner as he went door to door selling holiday 
items for the local PTA on Sept. 27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, his parents and the Werners maintained an icy  
distance. At court hearings and other events related to the case, 
they would sit on opposite sides of the room and exchange only 
brief glances. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Mrs. Manzie went so far as to say the Werners bore  
some responsibility for the killing because they let Eddie go door 
to door unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
	The olive branch was extended Saturday, when Werner asked his  
pastor, the Rev. Thomas Geoffroy of the Christian Life Fellowship, 
to arrange a meeting with the Manzies. 
</P>
<P>
	The fathers met Sunday in Geoffroy's presence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We cried like babies,'' Manzie said. ``We just held each other  
and we couldn't hold each other tight enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mothers didn't meet face to face until Monday, but both said  
they endorsed making peace. Mrs. Werner said she had been mulling 
over such a move for two months anyway.

<HEADLINE>  New Mariners Chair Makes Big Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Howard Lincoln got off to a fast start as  
chairman of the Seattle Mariners, saying the team had offered 
contracts to Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez that would make 
them the best-paid players in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Both stars have emphasized that their interest in remaining with  
the Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-79, hinges more on having 
a club that can make the playoffs than on their own contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking over Monday from John W. Ellis, chief executive of the  
franchise since 1992, Lincoln said the club's player payroll would 
be boosted to $65 million to $70 million, an increase of about 30 
percent after three years at roughly $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're operating on the assumption that that will be  
sufficient,'' Lincoln said. ``We are operating a business. We have 
to take into consideration revenues and costs... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're in good shape. I think this will put us, from a  
competitive standpoint, where we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without giving figures, Lincoln said the Mariners had made  
``definitive, written offers'' to Griffey and Rodriguez. Both 
players are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are long-term contract proposals which, if accepted,  
would make these two players the highest-paid players in the 
130-year history of major league baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mariners' 3-2 loss at Texas, however, Griffey said  
there had been no offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't done anything with me,'' the All-Star center  
fielder said. ``(Lincoln) was talking more about Alex than me. I 
talked to my agent today and he said it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``They've got a lot of  
people in this clubhouse to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said he'd spoken to the Mariners.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've talked to me about it a little bit. At the same time,  
I'm not concerned about an offer. I'm concerned about the face of 
the organization and where it's going to be. I want to see the 
direction of the organization,'' the shortstop said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told them I didn't want any contract offer until the  
season was over. So why get into that now? I would prefer to get 
the offer in October, when the season is over,'' he said. ``Right 
now it's a moot point. I've always said I want to stay here if the 
situation is right. I'll talk to my family in the off-season and 
see where it stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners president Chuck Armstrong will continue to direct the  
search for a general manager, a task Lincoln said he hoped would be 
completed by Oct. 31, when the resignation of Woody Woodward takes 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Chuck to make the final decision,'' Lincoln said.  
``Certainly it's an organizational decision ... I'm certainly going 
to interview the final candidates and all that but Chuck will make 
the final call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's job is safe, he stressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have great confidence in Chuck,'' Lincoln said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, 56, has held the post under three sets of owners and  
was the longest tenured general manager in the majors. He announced 
his resignation Sept. 17, saying he was worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Ellis, grinning his widest grin in months.  
</P>
<P>
	``That 1,000-pound gorilla is gone from my back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellis is staying on the Mariners' board as chairman emeritus and  
also remains the club's representative to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was told about the impending  
change a couple of months ago, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Lincoln was ``a wise choice,'' American League  
president Gene Budig said in a statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the move had been circulating since the mid-July  
opening of Safeco Field, the Mariners' new open-air ballpark with a 
retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' home attendance this season was 2.9 million,  
second only to the 3.1 million of 1997, the last year they made the 
playoffs. On a per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent 
higher in the new ballpark than in the club's old digs at the 
nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been dogged by controversy over the Mariners'  
demand for more funding from King County to help cover $100 million 
in cost overruns on the $517 million project. Public officials 
contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>

county's hand but said the Mariners would continue to negotiate for 
mediation, an approach rejected in June by the Washington State 
Public Facilities District board that oversaw stadium construction.

<HEADLINE>  New Mariners Chair Makes Big Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Howard Lincoln got off to a fast start as  
chairman of the Seattle Mariners, saying the team had offered 
contracts to Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez that would make 
them the best-paid players in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Both stars have emphasized that their interest in remaining with  
the Mariners, third in the AL West at 77-79, hinges more on having 
a club that can make the playoffs than on their own contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking over Monday from John W. Ellis, chief executive of the  
franchise since 1992, Lincoln said the club's player payroll would 
be boosted to $65 million to $70 million, an increase of about 30 
percent after three years at roughly $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're operating on the assumption that that will be  
sufficient,'' Lincoln said. ``We are operating a business. We have 
to take into consideration revenues and costs... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're in good shape. I think this will put us, from a  
competitive standpoint, where we should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without giving figures, Lincoln said the Mariners had made  
``definitive, written offers'' to Griffey and Rodriguez. Both 
players are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are long-term contract proposals which, if accepted,  
would make these two players the highest-paid players in the 
130-year history of major league baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mariners' 3-2 loss at Texas, however, Griffey said  
there had been no offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't done anything with me,'' the All-Star center  
fielder said. ``(Lincoln) was talking more about Alex than me. I 
talked to my agent today and he said it's not true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about it,'' he said. ``They've got a lot of  
people in this clubhouse to talk to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said he'd spoken to the Mariners.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've talked to me about it a little bit. At the same time,  
I'm not concerned about an offer. I'm concerned about the face of 
the organization and where it's going to be. I want to see the 
direction of the organization,'' the shortstop said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've told them I didn't want any contract offer until the  
season was over. So why get into that now? I would prefer to get 
the offer in October, when the season is over,'' he said. ``Right 
now it's a moot point. I've always said I want to stay here if the 
situation is right. I'll talk to my family in the off-season and 
see where it stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners president Chuck Armstrong will continue to direct the  
search for a general manager, a task Lincoln said he hoped would be 
completed by Oct. 31, when the resignation of Woody Woodward takes 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want Chuck to make the final decision,'' Lincoln said.  
``Certainly it's an organizational decision ... I'm certainly going 
to interview the final candidates and all that but Chuck will make 
the final call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's job is safe, he stressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have great confidence in Chuck,'' Lincoln said.  
</P>
<P>
	Woodward, 56, has held the post under three sets of owners and  
was the longest tenured general manager in the majors. He announced 
his resignation Sept. 17, saying he was worn out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for Ellis, grinning his widest grin in months.  
</P>
<P>
	``That 1,000-pound gorilla is gone from my back,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellis is staying on the Mariners' board as chairman emeritus and  
also remains the club's representative to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig was told about the impending  
change a couple of months ago, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Lincoln was ``a wise choice,'' American League  
president Gene Budig said in a statement issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the move had been circulating since the mid-July  
opening of Safeco Field, the Mariners' new open-air ballpark with a 
retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' home attendance this season was 2.9 million,  
second only to the 3.1 million of 1997, the last year they made the 
playoffs. On a per-game basis, attendance was more than 50 percent 
higher in the new ballpark than in the club's old digs at the 
nearby Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been dogged by controversy over the Mariners'  
demand for more funding from King County to help cover $100 million 
in cost overruns on the $517 million project. Public officials 
contend the club is legally bound to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln did not rule out legal action to try to force the  
county's hand but said the Mariners would continue to negotiate for 
mediation, an approach rejected in June by the Washington State 
Public Facilities District board that oversaw stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome, Ellis said he believed the Mariners will  
remain in Seattle for the duration of their 20-year lease on Safeco 
Field because, unlike the old Kingdome lease, it contains no escape 
clause based on attendance.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Captain Still Not Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Jim Rutherford conceded Monday the Carolina  
Hurricanes aren't a likely playoff team without all-star center 
Keith Primeau. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team's general manager isn't backing off in his  
negotiations with the 6-foot-5, 220-pound Primeau as the season 
opener draws near. 
</P>
<P>
	``A (playoff) spot will be hard to get even with Keith,''  
Rutherford said. ``But we can't change our salary structure to give 
us a better chance to make the playoffs in one year that is going 
to upset our salary structure for the next five or 10 years. So, we 
have to run that risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina, the defending Southeast Division champions, opens at  
Boston on Saturday. And it will likely be without Primeau, the 
30-goal scorer and team captain who became a restricted free agent 
on July 1 but has yet to sign with the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Keith is not signed by this Friday I don't see anything  
happening that's going to bring him back five or six games into the 
season,'' Rutherford said. ``He has made his decision and he has 
made his stance and I see this as being a real long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probability of the 27-year-old Primeau signing by the end of  
the week is not good, according to Todd Reynolds, one of Primeau's 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't called us and we haven't called them,'' Reynolds  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Primeau would play in the season opener, Reynolds  
said: ``It doesn't look that way right now. I guess this could take 
quite a while. Keith would love to be there tonight, but he is 
patient and he wants to make sure the contract is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, who led the team with 62 points last season, has turned  
down Rutherford's $4 million a year contract offer, or more than 
twice his $2 million salary of 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed that Primeau is seeking at least $5 million a  
season, or the same money that teammate Ron Francis received from 
the Hurricanes as an unrestricted free agent last offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said Primeau's camp should expect a worse offer by  
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't serve any good purpose to get him signed,''  
Rutherford said of the lesser offer. ``It only serves purpose as to 
the future of this franchise and negotiations that there is going 
to be an offer on the table just so long for a player, and what we 
think is fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a period goes by and the player doesn't come to his senses  
then he is going to understand that it is going to be less. This is 
not just for Keith, this is for the sake of everybody in the future 
-- agents and players -- that belong to the Hurricanes that this is 
how it's going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau could also face a fine for missing training camp,  
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``History has shown that a lot of players who missed training  
camp don't have the year they should have or get injured,'' 
Rutherford said. ``So, should there be something deducted for the 
three weeks that everybody else has put in?'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rutherford said he still wants Primeau as part of the  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't lose sight of the fact that we're dealing with one of  
our top players, a very important player to our franchise and the 
captain of our team,'' Rutherford said. ``Every time you do 
something that becomes a little more harsh it makes negotiations a 
little tougher and it makes it tougher when that player comes back 
into our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is the issue of who will be the captain if Primeau is  
gone. Coach Paul Maurice would like to wait and leave the position 
open for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once there is a change I'm going to make that change for  
good,'' Maurice said. ``If I gave it to (a player) and he walks 
back in after Keith comes back and says, `I don't want to be the 
captain of this team any more' then I'll make that decision. That's 
why I don't want to do this thing too quickly. If we make a change 
I don't want to look back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau was named Carolina's captain last season, replacing  
veteran Kevin Dineen.

<HEADLINE> Ty Cobb's Dentures Sell for $7,475 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the day Tiger Stadium closed, Ty Cobb's  
dentures sold for $7,475. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's without floss.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb's choppers were sold to Karen Shemonsky of Clarks Summit,  
Pa., who spent most of Monday explaining to friends why she had 
purchased them in the Sotheby's auction of Barry Halper's baseball 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep calling me, saying, `Why would you want that?''' she  
said. ``My sister goes on cruises. I'd rather have this in my 
hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, it was a lot cheaper than Cobb's 1928 jersey, which  
sold last weekend for $332,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, Sotheby's estimated the dentures of the Detroit  
Tigers great at between $300 and $500 in the auction catalog. The 
price caught Shemonsky's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that, I said to my husband, `That's not bad for a  
piece of history,''' she said. ``It caught my eye. It's so odd, so 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Shemonsky can certainly appreciate a good set of teeth. For  
53 years her father, Frank Alimenti, was a dentist in Old Forge, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put fillings in and they stayed there for 40 years,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, she and her husband drove 130 miles from Clarks  
Summit to Manhattan for the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know the format,'' she said. ``I was a rookie.''  
</P>
<P>
	If she had her choice, she said she would have gone after some  
of the auction's Mickey Mantle stuff because he was her favorite 
player. But those were break-the-bank prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Mantle, you need $20,000 or $30,000,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cobb's teeth, she decided, would take a smaller bite out of her  
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
	She watched for a while and even got in a couple of bids -- $900  
for a Babe Ruth glove that went for $1,700 and $800 for a pair of 
Babe Ruth watches that sold for $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
	All the time, Cobb's teeth were in the back of her head.  
</P>
<P>
	She filled out a form indicating interest in bidding by  
telephone when the dentures went up for sale. Then she and her 
husband, Gene, discussed it on the way home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I thought I'd go to $1,500,'' she said. ``Then,  
today, I decided I'd go to $2,000 and if push came to shove, 
$2,500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That plateau went in the blink of an eye, and with the bidding  
jumping in increments first of $250, and then $500, Shemonsky's 
adrenaline kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
	The next thing she knew, the choppers belonged to her for a mere  
$6,500. Add in the buyer's commission and tax and the price goes to 
$7,475. 
</P>
<P>
	``It only took a minute,'' she said. ``I never thought I would  
go that high. It just happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was her husband upset?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' she said. ``He laughed. We're married 23 years  
next month. He's very understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Halper auction reached its halfway point with  
sales of more than $12 million for eight of the 16 scheduled 
sessions. The auction ends Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cobb would like this part. Hours after Shemonsky bought his  
dentures, a package of underwear endorsed by longtime rival Ruth 
went for nearly $6,000 less, selling at $1,840. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the difference in price?  
</P>
<P>
	``The underwear,'' a Sotheby's spokesman explained, ``was not  
game-used.''

<HEADLINE> Some Banks Relaxing Loan Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some banks may be counting too much on the  
economic boom continuing, leading them to relax their lending 
requirements and creating an increase in shaky loans, a Federal 
Reserve governor says. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurence Meyer's cautiously worded remarks, in a speech to  
bankers Monday, were the latest among recent warnings by government 
officials about standards of bank lending. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to the Institute of International Bankers, Meyer  
cited ``a possible relaxation in credit discipline that our 
supervisory reviews have detected at some (U.S.) banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While noting that bank loans remain sound overall, he said  
numbers of questionable loans ``have been rising modestly at some 
banks'' in recent months, a trend the central bank director called 
``troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, Meyer suggested, banks ``are relying too much on  
the continuation of good times. They're assuming a very optimistic 
view of their borrowers' operating prospects and that their 
borrowers always will have ready access to financial markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks sometimes fail to put proposed loans through ``stress  
tests'' designed to predict whether borrowers could withstand 
unexpected financial shocks. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers  
Association, acknowledged that potentially risky loans have been 
increasing but added, ``They're still extraordinarily low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators are paid to worry,'' Chessen said after Meyer's  
speech. He said bankers have been asking prospective borrowers more 
questions than they did a year or two ago because they realize that 
the economic boom may soon slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the bankers' group reported the number of Americans  
overdue on credit card bills fell in the April-June quarter to a 
four-year low. The delinquency rate -- the percentage of accounts 30 
or more days overdue -- declined to 3.33 percent in the second 
quarter from 3.58 percent in the first.

<HEADLINE> States Probe Improper Bank Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- State attorneys general from coast to  
coast are investigating whether banks that issue credit cards are 
breaking the law by selling data on customers' spending habits and 
creditworthiness to marketing firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this stage we're in the process of gathering information,''  
said Julie Brill, an assistant attorney general in Vermont and a 
leader of a national task force on the issue. ``We're going to 
assess what the banks are doing. We'll be making decisions on it 
later down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brill would not name the other states involved or the banks  
targeted. But Marc Violette, spokesman for New York Attorney 
General Eliot Spitzer, said dozens of states have joined the probe. 
Aside from Vermont, New York, Illinois and California are said to 
be taking lead roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating,'' said California Attorney General Bill  
Lockyer. ``It's not clear yet whether there is adequate law to 
prosecute criminally or civilly for the sale of private financial 
information from customers. If the law is inadequate, it ought to 
be strengthened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violette said banks ``may be breaching the trust of their  
customers by selling information about their customers' buying 
patterns, their credit limits and other personal data.'' The 
information is sold to marketing companies that use it ``in an 
effort to generate sales and then pay the banks a percentage from 
any new sales they make based on the information the banks provided 
them,'' Violette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kelly, vice president at Bank One Corp. of Chicago, said  
that company's First USA credit card division sometimes uses a wide 
range of data to generate lists of customers who might be 
interested in a specific product or service. It then hires a 
direct-marketing firm to make calls to a list prepared by the 
banking company. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are talking about us sharing confidential  
information,'' Kelly said. ``Here's what we share: name, address 
and telephone number.'' He said customers have a chance to ``opt 
out'' of receiving phone calls, mailings or e-mails containing the 
sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the  
Consumer Federation of America, said even in the scenario described 
by Kelly, ``they used information you gave the bank for a purpose 
other than the one for which you gave it, without your 
permission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the ``opt out'' provision should be an ``opt in,''  
in which consumers make the affirmative choice to have information 
used about them for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brill's boss, Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, said of  
banks' information practices, ``We're analyzing whether it's 
violative of federal law or whether it might be violative of 
individual state laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole issue of personal information is something that  
attorneys general around the country are interested in,'' Sorrell 
added. He noted that companies with a wide variety of commercial 
purposes are collecting information ranging from what products 
people buy at the supermarket to what movies they rent at the video 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill now before a conference committee on Capitol Hill would  
bring extensive deregulation to the financial services industry, 
allowing banks, insurance companies and securities firms to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said this raised the possibility of a customer's bank  
turning down a mortgage request because of something the bank's 
insurance division saw in the customer's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	She said people should demand that their congressional  
representatives ``stop this wholesale trafficking in consumers' 
private information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorrell would not name the banks that have been contacted thus  
far in the investigation. But The Wall Street Journal reported 
Monday that they include Citigroup Inc., based in New York; 
Chicago-based Bank One Corp.; Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., based in San 
Francisco and U.S. Bancorp, based in Minneapolis, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup's director of public affairs was said to be away from  
his office Monday and had not returned a voicemail message about 
two hours after it was left. 
</P>
<P>
	Brill said the task force grew out of an investigation by the  
Minnesota attorney general's office into direct marketing practices 
of U.S. Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Donn Wagge, senior vice president with that company, said Monday  
that his bank agreed to pay $500,000 to the state of Minnesota and 
$2.5 million to charities to settle that case.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Banker Sentenced to Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former employee of a Mexican law firm was  
sentenced Monday to seven years and three months in prison for 
helping launder money planted by U.S. agents posing as drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso Labrada Gurrola, 49, was one of three defendants  
convicted earlier this year in the ``Operation Casablanca'' 
money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge rejected a request for a lighter sentence made his  
lawyers, who argued that Labrada's role in the scheme was minor. In 
refusing, the judge said Labrada lied under oath during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Labrada, convicted of one count each of conspiracy and money  
laundering, was not an attorney, but worked for a law firm that 
represented banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two others convicted in the case are to be sentenced in  
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people were arrested as a result of Operation  
Casablanca, an undercover sting operation carried out by Customs 
Service agents. About 40 Mexican and Venezuelan businessmen 
eventually were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs officials seized $100 million from 14 banks and dozens  
of individuals who were accused of laundering money for the Cali 
drug cartel in Colombia, and the Juarez cartel in Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Young Players Help Veteran Packers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- With a specialized draft and some  
surprising preseason roster moves, the Green Bay Packers put much 
of their fortunes in the hands of young players this season. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, those gambles are paying off.  
</P>
<P>
	Five players with 24 collective games of NFL experience made  
much of the difference for the Packers (2-1) in their 23-20 win 
over the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year receiver Corey Bradford, who the Packers kept last  
month instead of veteran Derrick Mayes, had a 23-yard touchdown 
catch with 12 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches and the other players are putting a lot of faith  
in me and the other young guys,'' Bradford said. ``We don't want to 
blow the opportunity we've been given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three rookies playing in the Packers' secondary have  
attracted the most attention. Antuan Edwards, Fred Vinson and Mike 
McKenzie all played large roles in holding Minnesota's Randy Moss 
to two catches for 13 yards, and their time in the lineup will only 
increase as the season goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since they came in here in April, they've been preparing  
for this game,'' safety LeRoy Butler said. ``They passed their 
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all young, but we've still got to step up and make  
plays,'' Edwards said. ``This team risked a lot to give us that 
responsibility, and we have to embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the effort of second-year defensive tackle Billy Lyon was  
just as important to Green Bay's victory. The team's medical staff 
held Santana Dotson out of the game as a precaution, and Lyon 
responded with his best game as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon and rookie Cletidus Hunt have become integral parts of the  
eight-man defensive line rotation used by the Packers early this 
season. For Lyon, who spent his first season in Green Bay on the 
practice squad, it's the culmination of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dedicated myself in this offseason and during training camp  
to becoming a big part of this football team,'' Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made five tackles while helping Gilbert Brown plug the middle  
of the line and hold Minnesota to 97 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy did great for us,'' Brown said. ``He made plays.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lyon also had one of Green Bay's two sacks when he hauled down  
Randall Cunningham for a 6-yard loss shortly after the 2-minute 
warning in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham rushed his team to the line and completed his next  
pass, but the on-field confusion resulting from Lyon's sack forced 
Cunningham to spike the ball while Green Bay had just nine 
defenders on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings then had to settle for a field goal. Little plays  
like that can turn around a game, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a younger player doesn't mean a thing when you're out  
there on the field,'' he said. ``If you belong, you'll play like 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Edwards did in his first solid game as a  
pro. The first-round draft pick from Clemson was passed by 
third-round pick McKenzie on the depth chart during training camp, 
partly because of a toe injury that slowed Edwards for months. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie started, but Edwards made the game's biggest defensive  
play when he picked off Cunningham's pass midway through the second 
quarter and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown. Edwards scored 
only one touchdown during his four years at Clemson, when he 
returned an interception against South Carolina during his junior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All day we were doing everything we could to stop Moss,'' he  
said. ``We mostly stopped them from making the big play, and that's 
what killed us last year against this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Bradford, who had four catches for 72 yards  
as the Vikings double-teamed Antonio Freeman. On the Packers' last 
play, Bradford read something in quarterback Brett Favre's eyes and 
bumped cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock before taking off toward the end 
zone, where he pulled in his second touchdown catch in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a young kid making a veteran play,'' Favre said.  
``Corey's young, but he's a big-time player.''

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Overhauls Rams Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Dick Vermeil is out of the play-calling  
business this season and the St. Louis Rams, thus far, are better 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	New offensive coordinator Mike Martz has turned the previously  
downtrodden unit, ranked 27th in the league last year, into one of 
the league's best the first two games of the season. The Rams, who 
were 4-12 last year and haven't had a winning season since 1989, 
are 2-0 and riding high behind unknown quarterback Kurt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had so much fun in my whole life,'' Martz said.  
``I'm under a star right now. This is too good to be true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second tour of duty with the Rams for Martz, who  
coached tight ends, receivers and quarterbacks from 1992-96 before 
getting fired along with the rest of Rich Brooks' staff. He moved 
on to the Redskins where he coached quarterbacks for two seasons 
and transformed Trent Green into a budding star. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Martz is in control, and he's far from conservative. The  
Rams scored touchdowns on their first four possessions in Sunday's 
surprising 35-7 rout of NFC champion Atlanta, and one of them came 
on a 46-yard bomb to Isaac Bruce the next play after the Falcons 
had been intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of Mike Martz's attitude,'' Bruce said. ``He likes  
to go for the throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martz said the Rams' offensive talent makes that a natural  
instinct. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just try to mix it up and change formations and keep them  
off-guard, and really try to take control of the game with what we 
do,'' Martz said. ``The nice thing about this is when you have good 
players, there's a pretty good thought they're going to find a way 
to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams opened the game with a 17-play, 80-yard drive that  
lasted 10:13 and was capped by a 1-yard run by Robert Holcombe. 
It's the team's longest drive in terms of plays since Dec. 10, 
1995, against Buffalo, and the longest in terms of time since Nov. 
25, 1990, against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 10-for-14 on third-down conversions against the  
Falcons, their best showing since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, previously a star in NFL Europe and the Arena Football  
League, inherited the job when Green suffered a season-ending knee 
injury in the third exhibition game. Despite entering the year with 
only one quarter of NFL game experience, Warner is second in the 
NFC in passing with a 65.2 percent completion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has done a wonderful job with Kurt Warner,'' Vermeil  
said. ``He's doing an excellent job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner has six touchdown passes -- three in each game -- and only  
two interceptions. He also had enough poise Sunday to improvise 
when the radio helmet receiver malfunctioned because someone else 
in the Trans World Dome was using the frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't hear anything from the sideline, so he just made a  
couple calls in real crucial situations,'' Martz said. ``He didn't 
bat an eyelash; he just executed the first down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall Faulk had 105 yards rushing and 67 receiving Sunday and  
leads the team in both rushing (159) and receptions (12). Bruce has 
11 catches, a 14.5-yard average and two touchdowns. Torry Holt, the 
Rams' first-round pick this year, has two touchdown catches. 
</P>
<P>
	Martz's reward was a game ball, one of several distributed by  
Vermeil. He accepted it with pride, and a little embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in situations where you call plays and you don't  
have good players, and you're just trying to make a first down,'' 
Martz said. ``You have good players, all of a sudden you become 
smart.''

<HEADLINE> 'Old' Rookie Savors Time in Majors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing in the hallway outside the visiting  
locker room at Yankee Stadium, 35-year-old Tampa Bay rookie Jim 
Morris was telling his tale -- again -- when a grinning Jose Canseco 
sneaked up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't give away the whole story,'' Canseco said. ``Save it for  
Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris smiled shyly, and looked down.  
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing is unbelievable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	By now, the whole baseball world is familiar with the  
soft-spoken left-hander and his blazing fastball. If not the man, 
then certainly his remarkable rise to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives hope to everyone out there,'' Yankees general manager  
Brian Cashman said. ``I'm sure there are a lot of over-30 guys out 
there, watching him and thinking, `Maybe I could do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, probably not with the same success. Morris has  
pitched twice for the Devil Rays, retiring all four batters he's 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
	As the reliever said, ``Incredible.''  
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by Milwaukee in 1983, an elbow injury ended his Class A  
career in 1989. Out of the game since then, Morris was teaching 
science and coaching baseball at a rural high school in Texas this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Living up to a promise he made to his players, Morris attended a  
Devil Rays' tryout camp in June. And just like that, he zipped 
through Double-A and Triple-A and was promoted to the big leagues 
on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around he is making sure not to miss a thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Morris was the last Devil Rays player to leave the field after  
batting practice before Sunday's game against New York, lingering 
to sign autographs and chat with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just look for what each day will bring,'' Morris said in a  
gentle voice. ``It's great to be at the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris was awestruck by his first visit to New York and Yankee  
Stadium. He visited Monument Park beyond the left-center field 
fence and soaked in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much baseball history, it's great to be here. I'm  
just taking it all in,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris did not appear in the four-game series against the  
Yankees, even though he warmed up late in Monday night's 10-6 win. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris made his major league debut on the same day he was  
promoted from Triple-A Durham, striking out Texas' Royce Clayton on 
four pitches and hitting 96 mph on the radar gun. His only other 
appearance came two days later when Morris tossed a perfect inning 
in a loss at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, however, is not one to bask in his newfound fame. In  
fact, he seems to shun the limelight altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't stopped to think about it,'' Morris said. ``I don't  
read the papers, and I turn off the TV when I come on. I'm just 
trying to live it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means the whole experience of major league life, including  
rookie hazing by teammates in their mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris is approached by fans of all ages. Young fans seek the  
autograph of a real major leaguer and older fans thank him for 
motivating them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tell me I'm an inspiration,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cashman, three years younger than Morris, also was eager to  
watch the newcomer and his fastball in action -- against another 
team, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is big interest in this story,'' Cashman said. ``I'd  
like to see him pitch, just when they leave town.''

<HEADLINE> California Overhauls HMO Oversight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis signed a sweeping package of  
health care bills Monday that will make California one of three 
states that let consumers sue HMOs for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	California's liability law will let consumers sue if they are  
substantially harmed by a health insurer's decision to delay, deny 
or alter necessary treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new laws will also require managed-care plans and other  
health insurers to provide a second opinion when a patient requests 
it and cover contraceptives, cancer screening and treatment of 
diabetes and mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``These bills taken together will ultimately put medical  
decision-making back where it belongs: in the hands of doctors and 
patients,'' Davis said at a signing ceremony before more than 100 
doctors, consumer advocates, health insurers, lawmakers and others 
at a medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	California law will require HMOs to make decisions about  
physicians' referrals for surgery or specialized care within five 
days in most cases, and let only medical professionals make those 
initial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	To enforce the new laws, Davis approved a new state agency to  
regulate health care plans, taking the job from the Department of 
Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients affected by the changes include an estimated 15 million  
Californians covered by employer-purchased managed-care plans. Such 
plans limit patients' choice of doctors in exchange for lower 
premiums and lower fees for checkups and prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Two measures form the centerpiece of the legislation, Davis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first would establish an independent review system for  
patients who contend a managed-care plan has unfairly denied, 
delayed or changed treatment. Doctors with no stake in disputed 
cases would help resolve them. 
</P>
<P>
	All patient-health plan disputes would go through the review  
system first when the law takes effect in July, except in cases 
where injury is imminent or has already occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who disagree with the outcome could sue under the new  
liability law for compensatory and punitive damages if they have 
suffered substantial injury as a result of the health plan's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2001, defines substantial  
harm as loss of life, loss or significant impairment of limb or 
bodily functions, significant disfigurement, severe or chronic pain 
or significant financial loss. 
</P>
<P>
	California's debate -- particularly on whether to let patients  
sue HMOs -- mirrored deliberations in many other states and in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has been pressing for a ``patients' bill of  
rights.'' At the heart of his proposal is a provision that would 
let patients seek damages from health insurers that botch 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Georgia also have laws that let managed-care patients  
sue if the plan fail to exercise ``ordinary'' care in treatment, 
said Marla Rothouse, a health policy specialist with the National 
Conference of State Legislatures in Washington.

<HEADLINE> 49ers, Cardinals To Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- A shootout on Monday Night Football? Shutout  
seems more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals have had two of  
the most inept offenses in the NFL in the first two weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco ranks 27th among the 31 NFL teams, while Arizona  
is 25th. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Young was knocked around like a bowling pin in last week's  
28-21 come-from-behind victory over New Orleans. Jake Plummer has 
thrown seven interceptions and just one touchdown pass for the 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a great start for one of the NFL's most successful  
veteran quarterbacks or one of the most highly regarded young ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not on all cylinders,'' Young said of his 49ers.  
``We're going to try to win games however we can while we get our 
feet under us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams have suffered from a lack of a rushing game.  
</P>
<P>
	With Garrison Hearst gone with a career-threatening injury, San  
Francisco is tied for 20th in the NFL in rushing at 91 yards per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is even worse. The Cardinals rank 27th in rushing,  
averaging just 2.2 yards per carry. Adrian Murrell, a 1,000-yard 
rusher the last two seasons, has carried the ball 43 times but has 
just 112 yards to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to establish the running game,'' Plummer said. ``You  
see what it does when we do run the ball well, when Adrian is 
getting 100 yards or 115 yards a game. We usually win those 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said part of the problem is that rookie fullback Joel  
Makovicka is still learning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying he's playing poorly, but he's seeing things a  
lot faster than he's used to seeing, and a lot more different 
looks,'' Plummer said. ``Things are going through his head, and 
he's going to get better. He's made some good blocks, but there's 
been some times that he's been a little indecisive and that hurts 
Adrian, because he's got to hit the hole and if there's a guy 
standing there, it's tough to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer knows he has to make better decisions, too. Of the four  
interceptions he threw in last week's 19-16 loss at Miami, he 
blamed three on bad choices. He said none of them could be blamed 
on his sore right thumb that he sprained in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Plummer said he's shaken off his miserable performance of a  
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to,'' he said. ``If there are still things from last  
week that are weighing me down, and I'm thinking about them, I'm 
not thinking about the Niners. I'm not doing what I can for my 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, 6-0 in Monday night games,  
is most concerned with protecting Young, who was sacked five times 
and knocked down 16 other times in last week's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci is considering shuffling his offensive line. Jeremy  
Newberry, beaten repeatedly by New Orleans defensive end Troy 
Wilson, might move from right tackle to guard, with Derrick Deese 
switching to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Newberry or Deese will have to contend with Arizona defensive  
end Andre Wadsworth, who is coming off the best game of his young 
pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a variety of things one can do, and we probably will  
use all the variety,'' Mariucci said. ``But in general, we just 
need to get better in that area. We have been better and we need to 
get there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's appearance will be San Francisco's 52nd on Monday  
night, 27th of the 1990s. The Cardinals will be on Monday Night 
Football for only the third time since they moved from St. Louis 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens is you know grandma and everybody else will be  
watching,'' Mariucci said. ``The entire country sits down and 
watches the game, as opposed to Sunday, when there are 14 other 
games going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Vince Tobin said his team does have some  
experience in the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me it's a lot like a playoff atmosphere, and we were in the  
playoffs last year, so that gives us a little bit of feel of what 
the national glare is,'' Tobin said. ``Everybody's family and 
friends at home will see them play. I think the intensity level 
increases because everybody knows that everybody is watching 
them.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Posts Chat-Room Web Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viewers who tuned in to ABC's novel Internet  
news broadcast Monday to chat electronically with anchor Sam 
Donaldson had more than their names and comments posted to the Web 
site for the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, ABC also disclosed the unique four-numbered  
Internet address for each person who wrote a comment, a decision 
that helps anyone trace a viewer's real-world identity. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, ``Mark from DC'' turned out to be an employee  
at the Justice Department who pressed the chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission: ``When will the telecommunications 
industries begin addressing the increasing gulf in the 
inaccessibility of the Web to (the) poor?'' 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman William Kennard was among Donaldson's guests on the  
debut of his Web-only broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Gershon, general manager for the ABC News Web site,  
couldn't be reached immediately to explain the network's decision 
to publish each viewer's ``Internet protocol'' address. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said earlier that the site will collect only a person's  
name and e-mail address when a viewer asks to subscribe to a 
regular newsletter that Donaldson will write. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's Internet privacy policy, published elsewhere on its Web  
site, warns viewers that some chat boards ``may display IP 
(Internet protocol) addresses along with the message poster's name 
and message.'' It urges people to ``please review each service 
prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are 
comfortable with sharing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a bit of cluelessness that should be fixed,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``There's no reason to do it, and a number of reasons not to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department referred questions about its employee's  
participation in Monday's broadcast to its 1997 Internet policy, 
which urges that employees ``making personal use of Internet e-mail 
should make it clear, when appropriate, that his or her e-mail is 
not being used for official duties.''

<HEADLINE> Golf: A Picture Comes To Life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- They came out wearing shirts with  
pictures of winning U.S. Ryder Cup teams all over them. 
</P>
<P>
	Who would have guessed that by the end of the day, this U.S.  
team would have earned a place alongside them? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you've got to do in this game, ride the streak,''  
European captain Mark James said. ``And they rode the streak 
tremendously well today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side of the greatest final-day comeback in Ryder Cup  
history is the greatest collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two consecutive Ryder Cup meetings and the first two  
days of a third, pressure sat squarely on the Americans' shoulders, 
pressing down on their aspirations like a pinched nerve. And then 
without warning, in the blink of an eye, it changed sides and 
squeezed the competitive life out of their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a reminder that pressure doesn't need a passport, nor  
even a nationality. It goes wherever it wants, whenever it wants. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a stunning 8 1/2-3 1/2 thumping in the singles matches by the  
U.S. side to make the Europeans turn over the cup they brought over 
on the Concorde only a week ago. It was finalized when Jose Maria 
Olazabal of Spain failed to answer the spectacular 45-putt that 
Justin Leonard rolled through the late afternoon shadows on the 
17th green. But in truth, the Euros lost their grip on the small 
gold chalice long before that. 
</P>
<P>
	Just about the stroke of high noon, within seconds of each  
other, Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland and Jarmo Sandelin of 
Sweden both missed putts inside 4 feet. Clarke's, which was for 
par, came at the third hole and put him 1-down to American stalwart 
Hal Sutton. Sandelin, playing just behind those two in the third 
match of the day, missed a birdie try at the second that left his 
match with Phil Mickelson all square. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Clark nor Sandelin ever recovered. Nor, as it turned  
out, did Europe. Just ahead of them, in the day's opening match, 
Tom Lehman birdied No. 4 to take a 1-up lead against Englishman Lee 
Westwood. Just behind them, Frenchman Jean Van de Velde bogeyed the 
first to go 1-down against Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the Americans had the Europeans right where they  
wanted them, trailing in every one of the early matches, Suddenly, 
U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw began materializing everywhere on the 
course, his walkie-talkie crackling, pumping up the troops with 
breathless updates. Suddenly, what began by looking like an 
impossible mission, no longer looked like even an improbable one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had been in the same position before. At Oak Hill  
in 1995, they needed to win five points from the singles to hold 
onto the cup and came up with only 4 1/2. Two years ago, at 
Valderrama, Spain, they needed nine and came up with eight. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Crenshaw tried to minimize the pressure by making  
sure the Americans didn't get ahead of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to win the first four matches,'' Mickelson said  
after drubbing Sandelin 4 and 3. ``We not only did that, we won the 
first six and we dominated in them. That gave our side such 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two days in the team matches, the Europeans had played over  
their heads, ignoring the world rankings that labeled them 
prohibitive underdogs. But paired face to face, that became tougher 
to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 66 Andrew Coltart had to stare down No. 1 Tiger Woods. Van  
de Velde, No. 89, isn't even listed on the same page as No. 4 Love. 
Swede Jesper Parnevik, who seemed invincible playing the team 
portion of the program alongside teen sensation Sergio Garcia, was 
giving away 13 places to his opponent, second-ranked David Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	And it didn't help matters, either, when Parnevik glanced at the  
scoreboard just before teeing off and saw his teammates foundering 
in every match ahead of his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their momentum was definitely building,'' he said afterward.  
``You could tell that just by the first few matches. They just ran 
us over. When they get the first six matches, the whole place gets 
involved and sometimes that's all it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the ninth hole rolled around, Europeans held leads  
in five matches, but in only two was the margin larger than 1-up. 
Making matters even tougher, James had elected to use seven of his 
players in all eight matches the first two days. Fatigue didn't 
make cowards of any of them. But their play down the stretch left 
little doubt the clubs felt heavier, the holes looked smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit,'' said Parnevik, who was 5-down by the turn  
and eventually beaten 5 and 4, ``my focus was not what it was the 
first two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure will do that to a man. Sometimes an entire team.

<HEADLINE> Eight-Alarm Harlem Blaze Injures 45 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An eight-alarm blaze, started by an unwatched  
chicken catching fire on a hot stove, roared through three 
buildings, injuring 45 people and destroying the apartments of 
dozens of residents. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 firefighters battled the blaze, which started in a  
single-family home in Harlem before spreading to an adjoining 
seven-story apartment building and an unoccupied building. 
Sixty-four people were left homeless, the Red Cross said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six firefighters and eight other people sustained minor  
injuries in Sunday's fire. One firefighter was hospitalized in 
serious condition from smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up and I couldn't breathe,'' said resident Netta  
Wright, 46. ``My daughters came running down the hall, saying, 
'Mommy, there's a fire!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters rescued several colleagues and carried one man in a  
wheelchair down seven flights of stairs before his apartment caught 
fire.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Is Busy Year for Executioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many people knew who Gary Gilmore was in 1977  
when he became the first U.S. inmate executed in a decade. Hardly 
anyone has heard of Willie Sullivan and Harvey Lee Green, the 
latest of 76 killers put to death so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Death row is a growth industry. ``It's no longer big news when  
people are executed,'' says Yale Kamisar, a University of Michigan 
law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's execution total, with three months still remaining,  
is the largest number since 1954, when 81 killers received what 
courts call the ultimate punishment. If the year-end toll reaches 
100, it would be the first time since 105 people were executed in 
1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any lack of support'' from the public, says John  
B. Holmes Jr., district attorney in Harris County, Texas, which 
includes Houston. His office seeks a death sentence in 12 to 20 
cases a year and almost always succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``What sometimes people lose sight of is that prosecutors don't  
give the death penalty -- it takes a unanimous 12 folks (on a jury) 
to do it,'' Holmes said. ``We don't seek it callously or 
inadvisedly. ... These people we're seeking death on generally have 
awful records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's the man executed in Missouri for beating a woman to  
death after she refused to pay him $30 to wash her car. A man put 
to death in Texas used a meat cleaver to kill a man whose stereo he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamisar, who opposes the death penalty, says, ``The average  
person can always think of one outrageous case where they wouldn't 
mind executing someone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is what happens when we have a system which puts  
thousands of people on death row,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution trend continues heading upward.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't peaked yet,'' said Richard Dieter of the Death  
Penalty Information Center, a group critical of how capital 
punishment is administered. ``One-hundred, fifty is probably where 
things may max out over the next three to four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 38 states with death penalty laws have imposed  
capital punishment this year, and -- as in many previous years -- 
Texas is first with 25 executions so far this year. Virginia is 
second this year with 11, followed by nine in Missouri and six in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	States have executed 576 convicted killers since the Supreme  
Court ended a four-year nationwide ban on capital punishment in 
1976. Currently, about 3,565 people are on death rows across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people sentenced to death across the country  
averaged about 300 a year from 1986 through 1996, then dipped to 
256 in 1997. If that is the beginning of a trend toward fewer death 
sentences, Dieter said, the number of executions eventually could 
start heading down as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1930 and 1967, U.S. prisons carried out 3,859 executions  
-- an annual average of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore did not try to stop his execution before a Utah firing  
squad in 1977. But the next inmate executed, John Spenkelink, 
fought in court until the end, and many other inmates have filed 
multiple appeals in an effort to avoid the death chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Congress and the Supreme Court have sought to  
speed up the federal court appeal process by limiting the number of 
appeals inmates can file. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, only a few death penalty cases get heavy public  
attention, such as the 1998 execution of Karla Faye Tucker in Texas 
and Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's decision in January to commute the 
death sentence of triple murderer Darrell Mease after a 
face-to-face appeal from Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cases get little notice, like those of Sullivan, executed  
Friday in Delaware, and Green, put to death the same day in North 
Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Sues White House and Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose secret taping helped launch  
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, says she's been subjected to ``extreme 
public embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, ridicule'' and wants 
the White House and her Pentagon employers to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp sued the president's office and the Defense  
Department, alleging Monday they violated her privacy rights by 
leaking ``damaging information ... for partisan political 
purposes'' from her confidential government records. 
</P>
<P>
	After she turned tapes of her friend Ms. Lewinksy's confidences  
about President Clinton over to the independent counsel's office, 
Mrs. Tripp became a favorite target of late-night comedians. 
</P>
<P>
	Various polls taken last winter, when Clinton's Senate  
impeachment trial was fresh on people's minds, showed from 
two-thirds to three-fourths of the American people viewed Mrs. 
Tripp unfavorably. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawsuit was the third filed by a person caught up in the  
swirl of Lewinsky-related media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Julie Hiatt Steele is suing Newsweek magazine for publishing  
what she says were off-the-record comments about Clinton's alleged 
advances against her one-time friend, Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal, called as a witness in the  
Lewinsky investigation, has filed a $30 million defamation suit 
against Internet columnist Matt Drudge, for posting an item saying 
Blumenthal beat his wife. Drudge later retracted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp is preparing to defend herself in Maryland against  
two state wiretapping charges. She was indicted July 30 in a 
prosecution Mrs. Tripp contends was inspired by the Clinton White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who describes herself as a government whistle-blower  
who was urged by Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath, has hired civil 
attorneys who specialize in whistle-blower cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Jim Kennedy said the White House would  
have no comment on Mrs. Tripp's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit contends unidentified people in the executive office of  
the president ``unlawfully disclosed'' contents of her ``personnel 
files, FBI files'' and ``security files.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names 11 current and former Clinton administration  
figures, including first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who it says 
``engaged in communications ... about Linda Tripp,'' although it 
does not name them as defendants nor allege that any of them made 
unlawful disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside Mrs. Clinton, the 10 others are Bruce Lindsey, Cheryl  
Mills, Lanny Davis, Rahm Emanuel, Paul Begala, Ann Lewis, Lanny 
Breuer, Sidney Blumenthal, Harold Ickes and Mickey Kantor. 
</P>
<P>
	The only individuals named in the lawsuit are Kenneth Bacon,  
assistant defense secretary for public affairs, and Bacon's deputy, 
Clifford Bernath. 
</P>
<P>
	The only specific disclosure the lawsuit addresses is an episode  
in which Mrs. Tripp's Pentagon bosses told The New Yorker magazine 
that she had stated incorrectly on a security clearance form that 
she had never been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested for grand larceny when she was a teen-ager, a  
case her lawyers said stemmed from a youthful prank friends played 
on her. She pleaded innocent, and a judge disposed of the case by 
reducing the charge to loitering. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp seeks an unspecified amount of money for ``harm to  
reputation and emotional distress and humiliation.'' The case was 
assigned to U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, appointed to the 
federal bench by President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Kohn, Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, said he asked for assignment  
of the case to Lamberth, who already is handling lawsuits that a 
conservative group, Judicial Watch, filed against the Clinton 
administration concerning alleged violations of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn assembled most of the information for Mrs. Tripp's lawsuit  
from one of the Judicial Watch lawsuits and from prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr's impeachment report to Congress against the president.

	McCain Launches White House Bid  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain  
today formally opened his run for the White House by promising to 
return dignity to the Oval Office, strength to the U.S. military 
and honesty to a government that is now ``a spectacle of selfish 
ambition.'' The war hero and Senate maverick also pledged to 
protect Social Security, cut taxes, veto pork-barrel spending, 
improve access to the Internet and test the merits of spending 
government money in private schools nationwide. His top issues: 
reform political campaign laws and improve America's national 
security. 

</P>
<P>
	Dole Criticizes U.S. Military Power  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's reliability as an ally and global  
power has eroded under the Clinton administration, which appears to 
rely on opinion polls rather than leadership to craft foreign 
policy, Elizabeth Dole said today. The GOP presidential hopeful 
also said Clinton seems to think that with the demise of the Soviet 
Union and the fall of communism in Europe, the United States no 
longer is faced with major threats to its national security. She 
also accused the administration of turning a blind eye to 
human-rights abuses in China and doing little about Chinese thefts 
of U.S. military secrets or threats to Taiwan. 

</P>
<P>
	Tripp Sues White House and Pentagon  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp today sued the White House and her  
employer, the Defense Department, alleging they used confidential 
records to smear her reputation after she brought the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal to light. The suit in federal court, contending 
Mrs. Tripp's privacy was violated, says unidentified people in the 
executive office of the president ``unlawfully disclosed'' the 
contents of ``personnel files, FBI files, security files and other 
government records'' regarding Mrs. Tripp.

	Shares Plunge on Taiwan Exchange

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's stock market felt the jolts of  
last week's killer earthquake when it reopened today, with the 
island's world-leading computer chip companies taking the biggest 
beating as they struggled to restore full production. Blue chips 
tumbled almost 2.7 percent in the first trading session since the 
Taipei Stock Exchange was closed last week by the tremor that 
rocked Taiwan, threatening its export-based economy. Investors 
globally are most concerned about the quake's impact on Taiwan's 
vital semiconductor industry.

	Nike Links Up With Web Marketer  
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nike is taking on a retail partner for the  
first time, buying a minority share in the Internet company Fogdog 
Sports. Nike will purchase a 12 percent stake in Fogdog, a 
California-based start-up that sells more than 15,000 athletic 
products, including about 160 Nike goods, on its fogdog.com Web 
site. Under terms of the deal, Nike will buy nearly 6.2 million 
shares of Fogdog common stock at $1.03 per share. Fogdog expects to 
see the stock open at several times that price when shares begin 
trading in about three months.

	U.N. Votes for E. Timor Commission  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations' main human rights body voted  
today for an international inquiry into atrocities in East Timor, 
despite opposition from Indonesia and its Asian allies. The U.N. 
Human Rights Commission voted 32-12 with six abstentions in favor 
of the move. The European Union had tried to overcome resistance 
from Indonesia and its Asian allies to an inquiry into reported 
massacres and other abuses. Asian countries, including China and 
the Philippines, voted against. Japan and South Korea abstained.

	CELAYA, Mexico (AP) -- At least three explosions from a fireworks  
store tore through a busy area of this central industrial town last 
night, killing at least 56 people and injuring 348 -- many of them 
rescuers. The blast was thought to have started in the back of a 
candy store where fireworks were sold, then more explosions were 
set off, possibly from gas tanks in nearby restaurants or other 
fireworks stashes. Twenty-five businesses were destroyed and 
another 25 damaged.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Venerable Tiger Stadium will be home to its final  
major league baseball game today when the Detroit Tigers take on 
the Kansas City Royals this afternoon. The Tigers play the final 
week of the season on the road and move to Comerica Park, about a 
mile away, next year. Almost everyone agrees the old ballpark, 
which opened in 1912, has seen better days, but a sellout crowd is 
still expected.

<HEADLINE>  Quayle Quits Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Dan Quayle said Monday that he never envisioned  
his Republican presidential campaign ending this way, short on cash 
and before the first vote was cast. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, he said, this has been an ``unprecedented'' campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a time to stay and there's a time to fold. There's a  
time to know when to leave the stage. Thus today I am announcing 
that I will no longer be a candidate for president of the United 
States,'' Quayle said, ending a campaign that has been dogged by 
poor fund-raising and low poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's departure leaves eight major Republican candidates, and  
is bound to increase speculation about the financial and political 
health of the remaining contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at the Arizona Biltmore, near his Paradise Valley  
home, Quayle cited the juggernaut of GOP front-runner George W. 
Bush, who has raised more than $50 million thus far in the campaign 
and leads in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was facing a campaign where the front-runner would have up  
to $100 million to spend, and an unprecedented frontloading of the 
primary system made the task for me of winning the nomination of my 
party virtually impossible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president has raised only about $4 million, and  
has been unable to break out of the second tier of candidates in 
any of the key early states, finishing near the bottom in Iowa's 
nonbinding straw poll last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Quayle remained convinced he could fare well in the New  
Hampshire primary, citing a recent poll that ranked him second 
nationally behind Bush. He told reporters in Iowa last week that 
his conservative message not campaign millions would help him win. 
</P>
<P>
	But a concentrated primary calendar with 18 states voting within  
30 days of New Hampshire would have given him little time to raise 
enough money and capitalize on a success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a decision that had to be made, but my heart hurt,''  
Quayle said in an interview. ``It aches because this is not 
something I thought I would have to do. I could see 50 ways that 
this would end, but this was not one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, said they plan to take a few days  
off and reorganize their lives before deciding what they might do 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle is the fourth candidate to abandon the Republican  
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar  
Alexander folded their campaigns during the summer. Sen. Bob Smith 
of New Hampshire opted to pursue an independent presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the remaining candidates, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who  
has made inroads against Bush in New Hampshire, formally kicked off 
his campaign Monday with a speech at the Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting  
the GOP to seek the Reform Party nomination. Elizabeth Dole is 
aggressively trying to raise money to compete against Bush. Her 
situation may be even more precarious because she is courting the 
same moderate and establishment Republicans as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Millionaire Steve Forbes and activist Gary Bauer, meanwhile,  
have been positioning themselves as the only true conservatives in 
the race. Both moved to recruit Quayle's supporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promised to support his party's nominee and said he  
expects it will be Bush. ``I'm not making an endorsement,'' he 
said. ``I'm just stating the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Quayle's biggest obstacles was what one supporter labeled  
the ``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day the then-vice 
president misspelled the word in a classroom full of school 
children. That and other miscues turned Quayle into a punch line 
for countless jokes, cementing for many Americans the perception 
that Quayle was ill-suited for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle tried to turn it to his advantage,  
telling conservative voters that the controversies proved his 
willingness to fight the media and liberal elite to protect values. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign, Quayle pitched a 30 percent  
across-the-board tax cut and portrayed himself as the best 
qualified potential commander-in-chief.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Cos. Lobbying Costs Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco companies slashed their spending on  
lobbying by more than two-thirds this year as their battleground 
shifted from Capitol Hill to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, five cigarette makers spent $11 million from January  
through June to lobby Congress, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a big drop from the first half of 1998, when the industry  
poured $37 million into an extraordinary effort to defeat 
legislation that would have raised cigarette taxes by $1.10 per 
pack. The bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also would 
have given the federal government new power to regulate nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we faced the McCain bill in Congress, which really  
would have threatened our future viability had it passed, so we put 
a lot of resources behind making sure our voice was heard,'' Brown 
&AMP; Williamson spokesman Mark Smith said. ``This year, we did not 
face that terrible threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Smith said, the industry has turned its attention to a  
Justice Department lawsuit seeking billions of dollars from the 
cigarette companies to reimburse the government for smokers' 
medical bills. The suit, filed on Wednesday, was anticipated for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette companies reached a $206 billion settlement with 46  
states last November, after the McCain bill died. 
</P>
<P>
	To defeat the McCain bill, the tobacco companies brought in  
high-powered lobbyists such as former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, former 
Texas Gov. Ann Richards and former Republican National Committee 
Chairman Haley Barbour. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the industry spent $40 million on advertisements  
attacking the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts paid off; Senate Republicans killed the bill in June  
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, lobbying costs are down 70 percent. Brown &AMP;  
Williamson's spending dropped from $18.2 million to only $1.2 
million for the first half of the year, lobbying disclosure reports 
show. Philip Morris, whose subsidiaries makes food and beer, cut 
its lobbying expenses from $14.4 million to $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorillard cuts its spending on lobbying from $1.9 million to  
$640,000, R.J. Reynolds from $868,600 to $700,000 and U.S. Tobacco 
from $1.3 million to $620,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Fees paid by the tobacco industry to the powerhouse law firm of  
Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand -- whose ranks 
include Mitchell and Richards -- declined from $7.1 million during 
the first six months of 1998 to $80,000 during the same period this 
year. ``There's no legislation,'' explained John Merrigan, a 
partner in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a leading anti-tobacco group noted that the industry  
spent $11 million to lobby during the first six months of the year 
-- even more than the $10 million the companies spent in 1997, 
before the tax battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers are still very large and particularly large in a  
year where there is no tobacco legislation before the Congress,'' 
said Matthew Myers, executive vice president of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids. ``The tobacco industry hasn't withdrawn from the 
playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry also made more than $1 million in campaign  
contributions from January through June. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry political action committees gave $648,136 to  
federal candidates. Philip Morris was the country's fifth biggest 
donor of unregulated ``soft money'' to political parties, giving 
$411,961. U.S. Tobacco gave $243,550.

<HEADLINE> Chiquita Source Sues Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A former lawyer for Chiquita sued The  
Cincinnati Enquirer on Monday, accusing the newspaper of breaking a 
promise by identifying him as a source for its expose of the banana 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	George G. Ventura claims former Enquirer reporters Michael  
Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter promised him confidentiality -- with 
management's knowledge -- in exchange for inside information about 
Chiquita Brands International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said the reporters violated that promise by secretly  
taping conversations with him and later identifying him to Chiquita 
and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory  
damages. His federal lawsuit accuses the Enquirer and its parent, 
the Gannett Co., of breach of contract, fraud and negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer and Gannett denied identifying confidential  
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The Enquirer in May 1998 published a series of stories  
suggesting that Cincinnati-based Chiquita engaged in improper 
business practices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The next month, the newspaper fired Gallagher, saying he had  
employed unethical means of getting information, and renounced the 
stories in a front-page apology. The newspaper also paid Chiquita 
more than $10 million to settle any legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher later admitted stealing Chiquita executives' voice  
mail for the series and was sentenced to five years of probation. 
He also cooperated in the prosecution of Ventura, who was 
identified in court as a source for the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Ventura pleaded no contest to supplying the secret  
codes Gallagher used to get into the voice-mail boxes. Ventura got 
two years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, 38, now a lawyer in Utah, said the disclosure that he  
was a source for the Enquirer stories cost him his job at a Salt 
Lake City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence K. Beaupre, then editor of the Enquirer and now a news  
executive at Gannett, denied the allegations in Ventura's lawsuit. 
``The Enquirer and Gannett have never identified any confidential 
sources,'' Beaupre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher's lawyer, Patrick Hanley, said: ``We don't believe  
that Mike Gallagher broke any promises to Mr. Ventura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter is now a reporter for The Detroit News, another  
Gannett newspaper. His lawyer also said McWhirter did not identify 
sources for the Chiquita story. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment does  
not protect news organizations from being sued when they publish 
the names of sources promised confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in the case of Dan Cohen, a public-relations  
executive who worked for a Republican gubernatorial candidate in 
Minnesota in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters for the Minneapolis Star-Tribune and St.  
Paul Pioneer Press that the Democratic candidate for lieutenant 
governor once had been charged with shoplifting $6 worth of sewing 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporters promised Cohen confidentiality, but their editors  
said his name should be used to make it clear that the information 
came from a rival campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury awarded Cohen $700,000, but that was knocked down to  
$200,000 on appeal.

	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Don Sanders, a former Senate lawyer  
who revealed the existence of a recording system in Richard Nixon's 
White House, has died after a long battle with cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who died Sunday, had returned to his home state in the  
1980s after more than two decades of federal government service -- 
as a lawyer for congressional committees, as an FBI agent and as an 
assistant secretary of defense under President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the GOP staff lawyer on the Senate Watergate  
Committee who first asked then-presidential aide Alexander 
Butterfield whether there was a recording system in Nixon's White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	After Butterfield confirmed that there was, Sanders said he  
rushed to tell Fred Thompson, the lead minority counsel and now a 
Republican senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in St. Louis, Sanders graduated from the University of  
Missouri-Columbia law school and then spent two years in the 
Marines. From 1956 to 1959, he was city attorney for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1959 to 1969, Sanders was an FBI agent. In 1969, he started  
working as a lawyer for congressional committees.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Fined $3,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- An NBA referee from Danbury was fined  
$3,000 Monday for his part in a scam involving the misuse of 
airline tickets received from the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Nunn, 49, pleaded guilty in July to one count of filing a  
false income tax return. He admitted that during 1993 he earned 
more income than he declared on his return by cashing in 
first-class airline tickets for coach tickets and pocketing the 
difference. He failed to report between $8,000 and $13,500, 
including some unreported income from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn was one of 11 league officials convicted after an  
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service dubbed ``Operation 
Slam Dunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fine, U.S. District Court Judge Janet Hall  
ordered Nunn to perform 100 hours of community service and serve 
one year of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	One referee, Steve Javie, was acquitted by a jury in  
Philadelphia in January. The 43-year-old Javie was the only referee 
to plead innocent to charges.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Grants Liberians Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted Liberians in the  
United States a year's reprieve from deportation, one day before 
they were to lose their temporary status as protected residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Monday by the White House, Clinton said he  
directed Attorney General Janet Reno and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to defer deportations for one year in order 
to promote stability in Liberia and West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was worried that deportations could spur  
countries in West Africa to also expel the thousands of Liberians 
who fled there because of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would severely burden Liberia and threaten the fragile  
peace that has been recently achieved in West Africa,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the longest-running immigration sagas of its kind,  
10,000 to 15,000 Liberians have been living in the United States 
under a temporary protection program first granted in 1991, when 
large numbers of people fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Temporary protected status allows for a stay of six to 18 months  
for people whose homeland is hit by natural disaster or war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberians were granted extension after extension as civil  
war raged. But with the fighting officially over since 1997, some 
in the U.S. government believe the country is now becoming safe for 
repatriations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Clinton administration announced that the  
Liberians would get a reprieve. But details weren't announced until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Clinton approved a one-year ``deferred enforced  
departure'' for Liberians. It differs from another extension of 
temporary protected status but the practical impact for Liberians -- 
staying for another year -- is the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking with great anxiety to the end of this month,''  
said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a leading advocate for Liberians in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing deportation, ``Families would have had to make some very  
difficult and, indeed, cruel choices: whether they would leave 
children behind who are American citizens, whether they would go 
underground .... '' Reed said. ``All of those decisions have been 
spared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island has about 12,000 natives of Liberia, the largest  
population of any state. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, roughly 3,000 to 5,000 are under temporary protection  
and could have been deported without the reprieve. Others are 
naturalized citizens or permanent residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Liberian communities are in Massachusetts and areas around  
Washington, the Bronx, N.Y., Los Angeles and the North Carolina 
cities of Raleigh and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting in Liberia from 1989 to 1997 shattered the nation  
founded by freed American slaves in 1822. It killed 200,000 and 
forced half the country's 2.6 million people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The war and the flight of business people disrupted the economy  
and left in shambles the infrastructure of a nation that even in 
prewar days had only one phone line for every 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for Liberians say the country lacks electricity and  
sewage and is unsafe because of roaming paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation would be intolerable if they were to go back to  
a country with 75 percent unemployment and an infrastructure that 
can't cope with their safe return,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, 
D-R.I., who pressed the White House to grant an extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending in Congress is a bill by Kennedy and Reed to grant  
permanent residency to Liberians who were eligible for temporary 
protected status on or after the outbreak of civil war and have met 
other eligibility requirements for immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Reed is trying to amend a fiscal 2000 spending bill  
for the Commerce, State and Justice departments to give Liberians 
temporary protected status for the year. Although that's not 
unnecessary given Clinton's action, Reed argues that it would put 
Liberians on firmer footing to get a future reprieve, if needed. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Miami University Won't Let Band Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Ohio (AP) -- Miami University barred its band from  
playing during halftime of Saturday's game against Marshall because 
some members were drinking, watching pornographic movies and 
mooning people during a trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The band will be allowed to play before and after the game  
because it is on Parents' Day, spokesman Richard Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	The band also was banned from playing at halftime of an upcoming  
Cincinnati Bengals game, and other discipline is possible after an 
investigation, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members on one of six chartered buses to a Sept. 11 game  
against West Virginia were mooning people on the bus and passersby 
while drinking, Little said. Other band members complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The university also is investigating complaints that there was  
drinking in a lodge where the band stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Consuming alcohol while on a band trip violates university  
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will spend several weeks trying to determine  
how many of the band's nearly 300 members were involved, but those 
who complained said only a handful took part, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under school policy, students found guilty of alcohol violations  
must pay for a mandatory course on alcohol education. Students with 
three violations -- or fewer, if disruptive behavior is involved -- 
are automatically suspended or expelled.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Plans Default on Some Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador plans to default on payment of  
millions of dollars of interest on U.S.-backed debt in a move that 
would make it the first country ever to default on Brady bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Ecuador chose to delay its $98 million interest  
payment on its Brady bond debt for 30 days. It has until Tuesday to 
make the payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Jamil Mahuad announced Sunday night that Ecuador  
would only pay interest on the bonds that are not guaranteed by the 
U.S. Treasury Department. He said Ecuador would pay ``a little less 
than half,'' of the $98 million interest payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady, were created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of 
the 1980s. They are partly backed by U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	International lenders and creditors have been watching Ecuador's  
economy. Although the country does not rank among the region's 
largest economies, some fear a default on the once-sacrosanct Brady 
bonds could spark a tumble in emerging bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised address, Mahuad asked international  
lenders and creditors for ``flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador ``cannot pay its foreign debt on the terms that are  
currently presented,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador had been working on proposals to restructure its entire  
Brady bond debt of $6 billion, and was preparing to present 
strategies for foreign debt restructuring this week during the 
annual International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington.

	LIQUICA, East Timor (AP) -- At U.N. headquarters Monday in New  
York, East Timorese independence leader Jose Alexandre Gusmao 
discussed international aid for refugees in East and West Timor 
with the deputy U.N. Secretary-General Louise Frechette and other 
senior U.N. officials. His visit comes a day before the start of a 
new round of high-level talks between Indonesia and Portugal on the

	House, Senate Agree on Foreign Aid Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate bargainers reached agreement  
today on a compromise, $12.6 billion foreign aid bill after they 
dropped language that would have barred aid to groups that promote 
liberalized abortion laws overseas. The deleted provision was a 
concession to the Clinton administration and moderate Republicans,

	US, China Trade Talks Flat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and China ended talks  
seeking a new trade agreement after just one day today, but U.S. 
officials said the two sides would get together again soon. 
American officials called the talks useful even though they ended a 
day early and resulted in no major breakthroughs reported. U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Chinese Trade 
Minister Shi Guangsheng said he needed to return to China earlier 
for an engagement, so Tuesday's sessions were canceled.

opened his Republican presidential campaign today by declaring 
himself the best candidate to command U.S. troops and reform a 
political system that is ``a spectacle of selfish ambition.'' 
McCain has been running for president since December 1998. The 
formal announcement, originally scheduled for the spring but 
delayed because of the Kosovo conflict, was designed to bring

by the thousands Monday, driven out by a Russian bombing blitz 
intended to crush Islamic militants in the breakaway republic. ``I 
wish I were dead,'' mourned Tamara Aliyeva, 70, whose house in 
Grozny was destroyed by Russian bombs. Aliyeva joined tens of 
thousands of Chechens who headed for the neighboring Russian

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal budget surplus is now expected to  
swell to a record $115 billion for the 1999 fiscal year, which ends 
this week. It's the largest total surplus in history. ``It is a 
landmark achievement for our economy,'' President Clinton said 
today. The 1999 surplus would be about 1.3 percent of the gross 
domestic product, the largest on this basis since 1951.

	1999 Is Deadly Year for Executions  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With three months remaining, 1999 already is  
the deadliest year on America's death row in almost half a century. 
Eighteen states have executed 76 killers, and the total could reach 
100 by year's end. Executions last Friday in Delaware and North 
Carolina raised the year's total to 76, the most since 1954, when 
81 people were put to death in U.S. prisons. There were 68 
executions last year, and 74 in 1997.

Jacobs, director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition said

<HEADLINE>  Giants' Offense Lacking Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- As frustrated as New York Giants  
coach Jim Fassel is with the play of his offense, quarterback Kent 
Graham isn't in danger of losing his starting job. At least not 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel promised on Monday to do whatever it takes to get his  
supposed big-play offense going this Sunday against Philadelphia, 
but he made it clear Graham is not solely to blame for the Giants' 
lack of punch after an explosive preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	That will keep Kerry Collins, signed in the offseason to a  
nearly $17 million contract, on the bench a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, I'm very frustrated,'' Fassel said. ``The way I  
look at this is that this is a very difficult challenge, one that 
I'm going to solve by hook or crook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York (1-2) is averaging 246 yards in total offense,  
including 56 per game rushing. It has 52 points this season, and 17 
of those were either scored directly or set up by the defense in 
the season-opening 17-13 victory over Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday night's 16-14 loss to New England, the offense scored  
a touchdown on the opening series and added another on its final 
possession, with the Patriots playing a prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In between was one mishap after another. The most notable was  
the failure to convert a fourth-down quarterback sneak at the 
Patriots 41, trailing 10-7 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel was the first to admit that Graham has made mistakes, but  
he wasn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Brian Williams back at center, the offensive line has  
struggled making holes. Running backs Sean Bennett, out at least 
four weeks with a knee sprain, and LeShon Johnson have made some 
poor reads when the holes are there, and the receivers have 
compounded things by either not getting open or by running the 
wrong routes. 
</P>
<P>
	If some of those mistakes were eliminated Sunday night, Fassel  
said the Giants might have won. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham actually had good statistics against New England,  
completing 23 of 36 passes for 216 yards, two touchdowns and no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of times, the media, a lot of people can lose  
perspective,'' Graham said. ``Everybody blames the quarterback. 
Everybody blames the coach. We're the first ones to go down. I 
understand that's the nature of the profession, but at the same 
time, I have to look at it realistically and wonder what we are 
doing and how we can make it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching videotapes of the first three games, Graham  
believes the offense is close to putting everything together. 
Usually, he sees just one person making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not time to hit the panic button, no way,'' Williams  
said. ``It's still early in the season. We have to focus extremely 
hard this week. Philly is struggling and we're struggling. We just 
have find a way to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the third straight year the Giants' offense has  
struggled early under Fassel, who had the reputation of being an 
offensive wizard when hired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the offense averaged 240 yards in the first three  
games, six less than it is averaging now. 
</P>
<P>
	One source of help for the offense is the expected return of  
starting halfback Gary Brown this week. After rushing for 1,063 
yards a year ago, he missed most of training camp while recovering 
from an injury incurred during a motorcycle accident in late June. 
He missed the first three weeks of the season because of a knee 
injury suffered in the final preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown gives the Giants an inside running attack. Bennett, who  
was injured Sunday night, and Johnson are better running outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people expect me to go out and help and I  
expect that of myself,'' Brown said. ``I want that type of 
pressure. I want people to say to me you have to make it go. It 
makes me feel good and puts pressure on me to perform. I like 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Brown makes the running game go, the offense should get  
better. 
</P>
<P>
	If not, Graham may be in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not to the point where I'm saying I'm going to make a  
change for change's sake,'' Fassel said. ``That's not my 
personality to just change it to change it. At some point in time, 
if I need to do that, I'll do that.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Stadium Gets Last Turn at Bat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With Al Kaline, Ernie Harwell and a sellout crowd  
bidding goodbye, Tiger Stadium took its last turn at bat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Built on the site of a haymarket in 1912, the ballpark that was  
once home to Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Hank Greenberg, Denny McLain 
and Kaline made one last sentimental journey as the Tigers played 
their final home game at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, the team will play in Comerica Park, a state-of-the  
art stadium about a mile away. But Monday was a time for 
remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit's players all wore numbers of Tigers who played through  
the years. The starters wore the numbers of the Tigers' all-time 
team. Center fielder Gabe Kapler wore a uniform without a number, 
honoring Cobb -- the greatest Tiger of them all -- who played in an 
era before uniforms were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's game with the Kansas City Royals was the 6,873rd  
regular season game at the stadium, which also has played host to 
35 post-season games and three All-Star games. Special baseballs 
were used, and the bases were changed after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The sellout of 43,356 put the Tigers over the 2 million mark in  
attendance for just the sixth time in club history, and the first 
time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, a Hall of Famer, exchanged lineup cards with Royals Hall  
of Famer George Brett. Both wore their familiar uniforms, Kaline 
with his No. 6, Brett with No. 5. Harwell, the beloved broadcaster, 
emceed pregame festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great times we've experienced in Tiger Stadium we'll  
cherish forever,'' mayor Dennis Archer told the crowd. ``Now, let's 
create some new memories in Comerica Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 former Tigers were invited to take part in the  
ceremonies honoring Tiger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was home to us for a long time,'' said Eddie Mayo, a member  
of the 1945 World Series champions. ``Old friends are hard to 
slough off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaline, wearing his No. 6 uniform, was saluted with a two-minute  
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spoken many times about the first day I ever saw this  
ballpark, as an 18-year-old kid fresh off the train from 
Baltimore,'' Kaline said. ``I again find myself humbled and a bit 
overwhelmed by the events unfolding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Rogell, a shortstop from 1930-39, threw out the ceremonial  
first pitch as the crowd roared. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good day, but a sad day,'' said U.S. Sen. Jim  
Bunning of Kentucky, a Hall of Fame pitcher who was with the Tigers 
from 1955-63. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Bill Freehan, selected by Detroit fans as the greatest  
Tigers catcher ever: ``Bittersweet is the perfect word for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weather cooperated, with pale blue skies, gentle sunshine  
and a pleasant breeze coming off the Detroit River as thousands of 
fans came through the old ballpark's turnstiles one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Levine, a 53-year-old fan, flew in from Chicago. In his  
wallet were ticket stubs from the 1968 game when the Tigers 
clinched the AL pennant and the game when McLain got his 30th win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming out here on the plane this morning, probably 80 percent  
of the people were coming here to see a ball game for the last 
time,'' he said. ``I have tons of feelings about this old place. I 
used to skip school regularly to attend opening days here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only one. A century's worth of baseball has been  
played on this historic piece of ground. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, 1912, with home plate moved from right field to its  
present location, the stadium opened as Navin Field. That was five 
days after the sinking of the Titanic. Fenway Park opened in Boston 
the same day, making them the two oldest ballparks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm nervous,'' said Katy Smythe, 32, from nearby Northville.  
``I have mixed feelings, like somebody is kicking me out of my 
house and I can never come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Moehler wasn't nervous, although he probably had reason to  
be. Moehler was Detroit's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, his main claim to fame this season was drawing a  
10-day suspension after an umpire caught him with sandpaper in his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad when it's over with, I'll tell you that,'' he  
said. ``I'll miss the Stadium, but I'll be glad when all the hoopla 
is over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he was just like any other fan when it came to saying  
goodbye to this revered mass of rusting girders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my video camera around and I could see where people  
were trying to take the signs down,'' Moehler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former pitching sensation Mark Fidrych, who was famous for  
talking to the baseball during his starts, was asked what he might 
say to the stadium on its final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, stadium, for all the excitement you gave me. I had  
fun here. I had a lot of memories here,'' he said. ``But it's like 
everything in life, you have to go. You can't be around forever.''

<HEADLINE> Pac-10 Nearly Shut Out of Top 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On a day when eight ranked teams tumbled, the Pac-10 Conference  
nearly found itself in a most unusual situation -- without a 
representative in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California and UCLA dropped out of the this week's AP  
poll following losses on Saturday, while Oregon sneaked in at No. 
25 after its 33-30, three overtime win over the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Ducks failed to crack the Top 25, it would have been the  
first time since 1985 that at least one Pac-10 team was not 
included in the AP poll. It's been that kind of a season in the 
wild and wacky Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few weeks there were astounding non-conference  
losses, including Arizona State's 35-7 shocker at New Mexico State 
and Arizona's 34-point loss at Penn State in the Pigskin Classic. 
On Saturday, there were more stunners: 
</P>
<P>
	--John Frankel, Oregon's third kicker, hit a 27-yard field goal  
to lift the Ducks (3-1, 1-0) over the Trojans (2-1, 0-1) in a game 
that saw USC's David Newbury miss three field goal attempts -- two 
in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great moment in my life,'' Frankel said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I take full responsibility for this loss,'' Newbury said.  
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse for USC, quarterback Carson Palmer broke  
his right collarbone and is out at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Joe Borchard replaced injured starter Todd Husak and threw five  
TD passes, including a league-record 98-yarder to Troy Walters, in 
Stanford's 42-32 win over UCLA. Walters had nine catches for a 
school-record 278 yards and three TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	The results have Stanford (3-1, 3-0) leading the Pac-10 after  
opening the season with a 52-point non-conference loss to Texas. It 
also leaves Oregon State (3-0, 0-0) -- looking for its first winning 
season since 1970 -- as the league's lone undefeated team. The 
Beavers, idle on Saturday, open league play at USC next week. 
</P>
<P>
	USC was No. 16 and UCLA No. 18 entering Saturday's games.  
</P>
<P>
	On a day that also included furious finishes, including No. 7  
Tennessee's 17-16 last-minute win over Memphis and East Carolina's 
27-23 comeback over No. 18 Miami, the Pac-10 was at it again. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pullman, Wash., Keith Smith's desperation 42-yard TD pass to  
Bobby Wade with no time left gave Arizona a 30-24 victory over 
Washington State. Replays appeared to show the ball hit the turf 
before Wade had possession. 
</P>
<P>
	In the one game matching Top 25 teams, No. 4 Michigan beat  
Wisconsin 21-16 as Tom Brady threw two TD passes and the Wolverines 
dented Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy chances by holding him to 88 
yards -- none in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to hold him to less than 80,'' Michigan  
linebacker Ian Gold said, ``but 88's not bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne needs 1,105 yards in his final seven games to beat Ricky  
Williams' I-A career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was: No. 1 Florida State 42, North  
Carolina 10; No. 2 Penn State 45, Indiana 24; No. 3 Florida 38, 
Kentucky 10; No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M 23, Southern Mississippi 6; No. 6 
Nebraska 40, Missouri 10; No. 10 Georgia 24, Central Florida 23; 
No. 11 Purdue 31, Northwestern 23; No. 12 Ohio State 34, Cincinnati 
20; No. 13 Kansas State 35, Iowa State 28; No. 14 Michigan State 
27, Illinois 10; No. 15 Texas 62, Baylor 0; No. 16 Mississippi 
State 17, South Carolina 0; No. 17 Marshall 34, Temple 0; No. 21 
Alabama 35, No. 20 Arkansas 28; and No. 24 Virginia 45, BYU 40. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, it was No. 8 Virginia Tech 31, Clemson 13.  
</P>
<P>
                            *CLOSE CALLS   	
</P>
<P>
                    *No. 7 Tennessee 17, Memphis 16    	
</P>
<P>
	At Knoxville, Tenn., Tee Martin's 15-yard TD pass to Cedrick  
Wilson with a minute left saved the Vols (2-1) from dropping out of 
the national title race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them I would take one point or 50 points, whatever we  
could get done,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``I didn't know 
they would take me literally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis (1-3), 31-point underdogs, held Jamal Lewis to 45 yards  
on 16 carries. In 1996, Memphis upset the Vols 21-17 and knocked 
them out of the title chase. 
</P>
<P>
 *No. 10 Georgia 24, Central Florida 23    	
</P>
<P>
	At Athens, Ga., Javier Beorlegui missed an extra point with 5:21  
left, and the Bulldogs (3-0) escaped with a win. Vic Penn's TD pass 
to Page Sessions brought the Golden Knights (0-4) within a point.

one-point lead and just under seven minutes to play when Drew Brees 
threw a 99-yard TD pass to Vinny Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest play in Purdue's 112 years of football gave the  
Boilermakers (4-0) their 10th straight win, the school's longest

	The Pirates were supposed to play the game at home but were  
unable to return to Greenville for more than a week because of

<HEADLINE> 26 Die in Bus Crash in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYDENBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A bus carrying British tourists  
overturned when its brakes apparently failed on a steep hill 
Monday, killing at least 26 people and injuring 11, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was heading into this provincial town 135 miles east of  
Johannesburg when it overturned, said Lydenburg police Inspector 
Gerrit Smit. He said the victims apparently were all British 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first officers on the scene spoke to a person  
identifying himself as the driver, who said the brakes on the bus 
failed, Smit said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth major crash in South Africa in less than two  
weeks, Transport Ministry spokesman Mike Mabasa said. The 
government plans to meet with bus companies to try to find ways to 
make travel safer.

<HEADLINE> ''SNL'' Special Draws Big Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ratings were mah-velous for the ``Saturday  
Night Live'' 25th anniversary special, with an estimated 22.4 
million people watching the reunion of comic actors once deemed not 
ready for prime-time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's three-hour program was the highest-rated entertainment  
special since the Academy Awards in March and drew the best numbers 
for any NBC special since 1993 among the 18-to-49-year-old audience 
demographic it craves, Nielsen Media Research said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthearted comedy special opened with Bill Murray, in his  
lounge singer guise, belting out Bruce Springsteen's ``Badlands,'' 
among others. Billy Crystal resurrected his Fernando talk-show 
character with the famous line, ``You look mah-velous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comic Chris Rock poked fun at all the bad movies former  
``Saturday Night Live'' cast members had made. 
</P>
<P>
	The show also paid tribute to ``SNL'' cast members who have  
died: John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman and Chris Farley. 
</P>
<P>
	After the three-hour special, the star-studded cast and guests  
took elevators to the Rainbow Room, where a makeshift Blues 
Brothers band with Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman and Aerosmith's Joe 
Perry and Steven Tyler performed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a couple of well-known no-shows for the special.  
Eddie Murphy and Dana Carvey both didn't attend, and an NBC 
spokesman didn't have an explanation for their absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was a big night for network television in general. With  
season premieres of ``Touched By an Angel,'' ``The Practice'' and 
the new escapist drama, ``Snoops,'' more people watched TV Sunday 
than on any night since May 23, said Alan Wurtzel, NBC's chief 
researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Network executives are heartened by ratings during the  
one-week-old TV season, particularly for one-hour dramas. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have programming, audiences show up,'' Wurtzel said.

<HEADLINE> New Virus Detected in Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported  
in the United States is to blame for at least one of three deaths 
in the city, federal health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection  
identified a ``West Nile-like'' virus in the victim on Friday and 
were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman 
Barbara Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have  
some more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the 
strain of West Nile or a new virus,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West  
Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region. 
Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and 
Europe, never before in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists earlier thought St. Louis encephalitis killed three  
and sickened 15 other people in the city and neighboring 
Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible the numbers could go higher. Spinal fluid samples  
from 77 people who fell ill but tested negative for St. Louis 
encephalitis would be re-examined for the West Nile or Kunjin 
virus, city Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen told The New York 
Times. Seven of those 77 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the  
United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying 
now under way to combat St. Louis encephalitis should also work 
against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain tissue from victims of the encephalitis outbreak has been  
undergoing analysis at the CDC and at the Emerging Diseases 
Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	W. Ian Lipkin, the director of the Irvine lab, said his  
colleagues had identified either West Nile virus or a variant found 
in Australia, Kunjin virus, in the brains of three encephalitis 
victims from the city's Queens borough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The significance of this is that this particular agent has  
never been reported in North America,'' Lipkin said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Owners, Umpires Select Arbitrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires and owners finally selected an  
arbitrator to hear their dispute, deciding Monday on Alan 
Symonette, a 55-year-old Philadelphian. 
</P>
<P>
	Symonette has been a salary arbitrator the past two years,  
serving on panels that ruled for catcher Charles Johnson and 
against outfielder Matt Lawton. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires want Symonette to rule that 22 umps were illegally  
terminated by the American and National Leagues on Sept. 2. Owners 
say they lawfully accepted the resignations the 22 had submitted as 
part of a mass resignation strategy that backfired in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In a settlement worked out in Philadelphia federal court on  
Sept. 2, the sides agreed umpires could file a grievance under 
their current labor contract. After the grievance was filed, the 
American Arbitration Association's Philadelphia office gave the 
sides a list of 15 arbitrators, and the owners and umpires took 
turns crossing out names Monday until only Symonette remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Symonette, a 1976 graduate of Swarthmore and a 1979 graduate of  
Villanova's law school, worked as a lawyer for the National Labor 
Relations Board from 1979-81, then spent eight years as a lawyer 
for oil and gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, he was part of a three-man panel that gave  
Johnson, then with the Florida Marlins, a raise from $290,000 to 
$3.3 million rather than the $2.25 million the team offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, he served in the three-person panel that ruled  
against Lawton's bid for a raise from $215,000 to $2.4 million and 
picked the Minnesota Twins' offer of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When Symonette starts hearing the case, owners intend to ask him  
to dismiss it, arguing that the labor contract says league 
presidents have final say on hiring and firing umpires and their 
decisions are not subject to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball intends to eliminate the league presidents as  
part of a reorganization, they continue to exist, at least until 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the court agreement, the 22 umpires are getting paid  
through Dec. 31, but if they lost, their salaries from Sept. 2 on 
would be subtracted from their termination pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignation strategy on July 14, a  
move designed to spur owners to start negotiations early for a 
labor contract to succeed the current deal, which expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when about two dozen umps, mostly in the  
AL, either failed to resign or quickly withdrew their resignations. 
All umpires then withdrew their resignations, but by then baseball 
hired 25 new umps from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of dissident umpires, blaming union leader Richie  
Phillips for the mess, is circulating cards asking the NLRB to hold 
an election to decertify the current union and certify a new one.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Urges Improved Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Future Asian-style currency crises could be  
avoided or their damage at least lessened if developing countries 
strive to improve the soundness of their financial systems, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that the serious global financial crisis of the  
past two years dramatically underscored the need for developing 
countries to pay attention to such issues as how they regulate 
their banks and whether they are pursuing the correct policies 
needed to build sound financial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Improving deficiencies in domestic banking systems in emerging  
markets will help to limit the toll of the next financial 
disturbance,'' Greenspan said in a speech to financial leaders 
gathered for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency crisis began in Thailand in July 1997, then jumped  
to Indonesia and South Korea later that year before leveling the 
Russian economy in August 1998 and forcing the devaluation of the 
Brazilian real in January of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failure of normal adjustment processes to contain the  
financial turmoil made this crisis longer and deeper than any of us 
had expected in its early days,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	To support his contention that sound financial systems can  
lessen turbulence, Greenspan pointed to the functioning of the U.S. 
economy during the recent instability. 
</P>
<P>
	After Russia defaulted on billions of dollars in foreign debt in  
August 1998 and a large U.S. hedge fund nearly collapsed, ``public 
capital markets in the United States virtually seized up,'' 
Greenspan said. Even top quality borrowers were unable to find 
takers for their bonds in a nervous market unwilling to take on any 
new risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed stepped in last year and cut interest rates by 0.75  
percentage point as a way to restore confidence and avert a severe 
credit crunch from dragging the United States into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the Fed's rate cuts were important, but he said  
it was ``not credible that this move was the whole explanation of 
the dramatic restoration of most, though not all, markets in a 
matter of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Greenspan said ``at least as relevant was the existence  
of backup financial institutions, especially commercial banks,'' 
which stepped in and provided funds for businesses that were no 
longer able to raise money in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the financial leaders that he believed this highlighted  
the importance of countries not only developing effective banking 
systems but also striving to have a sound bond markets so that if 
one system gets into trouble, investors will have an alternative 
source of money. 
</P>
<P>
	While banks replaced the bond market in 1998, it has often been  
the other way around, with borrowers forced to rely on capital 
markets to sell bonds when banks grow unwilling to make loans, a 
situation that most recently occurred during the 1990-91 recession, 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the economic problems that have plagued Japan for most  
of this decade showed that Japanese corporations are much more 
heavily reliant on banks for loans than American companies, which 
turn to the bond market more often. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Japanese government has tried to ease this credit  
crunch by supplying money to allow banks to get a massive overhang 
of bad loans off their books, Greenspan said the Japanese should 
also be diversifying their financial system to provide alternative 
means for raising credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diverse capital markets, aside from acting as backup to the  
credit process in times of stress, compete with a banking system to 
lower financing costs for all borrowers,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has raised interest rates twice since June 30 in an  
effort to slow the U.S. economy to a more sustainable growth rate 
and keep inflation under control. While many economists believe the 
Fed will boost rates for a third time when policy-makers next meet 
on Oct. 5, Greenspan offered no clues about the direction of 
interest rates in his speech Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks at a seminar sponsored by the IMF and World  
Bank were his first public comments since participating in a series 
of weekend meetings along with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers 
and finance ministers from the world's other wealthy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	After those talks on Saturday, the Group of Seven nations issued  
a joint statement saying they shared Japan's worries about the 
impact of a recent sharp rise in the value of the Japanese yen 
against the dollar.
