<HEADLINE> Court officials to look into fiduciaries' appointments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - There are enough questions about whether politics
are dictating how judges are assigning guardianships and other lucrative legal
work to warrant an inspector general's investigation, court officials say.
<P>
	   It is "absolutely clear" that lawyer appointments to the jobs puts the
integrity of the legal system at risk if the selections represent political
patronage made on the basis of party political connections, Chief Judge Judith
Kaye said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   An inspector general for Fiduciary Appointments in the Unified Court System
will be chosen within 30 days to make sure state rules about appointing
fiduciaries are being followed. Those rules ban the selections being made solely
based on political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   If improprieties are found, the inspector general will have the power to
refer judges to the state Commission on Judicial Conduct, lawyers to state
attorney disciplinary committees and either to prosecutors if warranted, state
Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said Lippman will tell administrative judges throughout the state to
examine whether the fiduciary appointments in their jurisdictions are violating
any state rules. And she said a "blue ribbon" panel will be formed to review the
fiduciary rules and see if they should be reworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "An independent judiciary depends on public trust in the integrity of the
judicial process," Kaye said. "Partiality and favoritism destroy that trust. As
chief judge, I will not allow that to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye made her pronouncements about fiduciaries during her State of the
Judiciary speech but her comments were written separately and not included in
the formal printed version of the address. That indicated it was a late addition
to the chief judge's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, The New York Times reported that two top officials in the
Brooklyn Democratic organization had written a letter in December contending
that judges in that borough were handing out fiduciary assignments based on
lawyers' ties to the Democratic Party. The two, Arnold Ludwig and Thomas Garry,
said they felt they were on the outs with the leadership and had been shut out
of consideration for appointment as guardians, receivers, referees and other
legal posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Lippman acknowledged that the charges in Brooklyn will "be something that'll
be on the top of the agenda" for the new inspector general. When asked if he
thought the contentions were valid, Lippman said, "there's really no way of
knowing."
</P>
<P>
	   He said no one has yet been selected for the post.

<HEADLINE> McCall backers form committee for possible governor's race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Prominent supporters of state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall are establishing an advisory committee to help promote the New York
Democrat's potential candidacy for governor in 2002.
<P>
	   "If I didn't think he was going to run, I wouldn't be putting forth this
effort," state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, one of the advisory
committee leaders, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman, a Syracuse-area Democrat, said the committee was being created with
McCall's "full knowledge and support."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, through a spokesman, declined to comment on creation of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, eldest son of former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, has also expressed interest in the Democratic nomination for
governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Gov. George Pataki has said he might be interested
in running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New York,
considered challenging Pataki in the 1998 governor's race, but backed down in
the face of the governor's healthy poll numbers and bulging campaign bank
account. Pataki won easy re-election. McCall also turned down a chance to run
for the U.S. Senate this year, a contest that has been taken up by Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Bragman, other leaders of the McCall advisory committee are
U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman and state
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, who is also Bronx Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said part of the advisory committee's job was to test the depth of
support for McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will run if it appears that he can run and win," Rangel predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall has already hired a veteran political operative to step up his
fund-raising efforts and within two weeks will set up a political website at the
address "McCall02.com"
</P>
<P>
	   McCall, a former state senator who served as a Citibank vice president
before becoming state comptroller, has said he expects to make an announcement
about running for governor shortly after this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman and others said the goal of the advisory committee was to lock up as
much support as possible early on for McCall. That could make life more
difficult for Andrew Cuomo, although Bragman and others insisted that wasn't the
goal of the advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   Bragman said that within the next two weeks a letter would be going out to
leading Democrats, labor leaders and others across the state asking them to get
behind McCall. The committee plans to hold meetings with possible supporters in
Buffalo, Albany and New York City in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   "He provides an opportunity to bring everybody together," Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the makeup of McCall's advisory committee leadership appeared
intended to demonstrate the comptroller's broad appeal. Rangel is one of
Congress' most influential black members, Ramirez is considered a major force in
the state's Hispanic political community, Shulman has strong ties to New York
City's Jewish community and has supported Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
while Bragman is considered a leader of the Democratic Party's more conservative
upstate wing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is an ordained minister who served as a deputy U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations under President Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose sixth state budget to the Legislature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki presents a proposed budget to the
state Legislature this morning that will be heavy on public education programs
and, apparently, light on the contentious issues which have prevented the 15
previous budgets in New York from being passed on time.
<P>
	   Riding years of budget surpluses, Wall Street prosperity, employment gains
and with no political war against the Legislature on the horizon, Pataki's sixth
budget could be his most harmonious as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's proposal will be for the 2000-01 fiscal year which begins April 1.
The state budget for the current year totals about $73.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The broad outlines of Pataki's spending proposal began to take shape in
December, when the Legislature and governor agreed to the $9 billion, 3 1/2-year
Health Care Reform Act 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   That program contained two elements crucial to a more orderly budget passage
in 2000. The first was a commitment to spend most tobacco settlement money due
New York state until 2003 on health care programs for the uninsured. The act
also included a cease-fire of sorts between the state Assembly and Pataki over
the possibility of significant Medicaid cuts over that period.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the spending of the tobacco settlement and Medicaid cuts had figured to
be chief battlegrounds in Albany this year over the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Joseph Bruno, leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said
Medicaid in particular was a highly divisive issue which helped account for past
budget impasses in Albany. Both he and state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a
Democrat, have said in the last week they see no reason why a budget cannot be
approved by the April 1 deadline this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki declared during his State of the State speech to lawmakers last week
that education would be the main thrust of his budget plan in 2000-01. He wants
to ensure that students get resources needed to improve themselves and that
schools are safe and intolerant of unruly pupils.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the tax-cutting proposals in his budget would center around the
gross receipts tax on energy - companies have long felt it is onerous and an
unfair disadvantage to doing business in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bruno tried to score a few last-minute points for budget reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he would ask Pataki not to call any of the "three-men-in-a-room"
budget meetings. Those are the sessions, much criticized by reformers and many
legislators, where the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority
leader sit behind closed doors and hash out the most important aspects of new
budgets and other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to ask the governor not to call any, and the governor is the
governor and he'll do whatever he sees fit," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said it would suit the governor fine if the
Legislature took his proposed budget, worked out its own budget in public in
conference committees and submitted it to Pataki for final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has always said that he favors an open process and that they
should have conference committees," Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature tried to devise a budget without Pataki's input via
conference committees in 1998, but was dismayed when Pataki vetoed hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's budget was not given final approval by the Legislature until
Aug. 14, due largely to squabbles over education and Medicaid spending. Past
year's budgets have been delayed because of fights between Pataki and the
Assembly over Workers' Compensation reforms and the continuation of New York
City rent control laws.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers 111, Clippers 106  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Lamond Murray scored 20 points against his former team and
Brevin Knight had 14 assists and hit some big free throws Monday night as the
Cleveland Cavaliers won their third straight, 111-106 over the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Sura added 20 points, rookie Andre Miller had 18 and Knight made seven
free throws in the final 2:16 for Cleveland, which needed to rally to win its
eighth straight over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Anderson, traded by the Cavs to Los Angeles for Murrray, led the
Clippers with 29 points. Rookie Lamar Odom had 28 before fouling out with 6:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs, who recently dropped 10 of 11, wanted to win before heading out on
a seven-game, 12-day West Coast road trip. This one was tougher than it should
have been, and if not for Miller providing an offensive spark in the third
quarter, the Clippers might have pulled away.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Kemp, bothered by a sprained foot, scored 17 points on 6-of-14 for
Cleveland, which made 12 straight free throws in the fourth quarter before
Knight missed the first of two with 23 seconds left and the Cavs up two.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight made the second, and after Troy Hudson's basket brought the Clippers
within one, Knight made two more to make it 109-106.
</P>
<P>
	   Clippers coach Chris Ford wanted his team to look for a 3-pointer, but
Hudson drove to the basket and missed a lay-in. Sura then made two more free
throws to close it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Nesby had 15 points and Hudson 14 for the Clippers, who made 10 of 18
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles' outside shooting enabled the Clippers to take an eight-point
lead into the fourth and Cavs coach Randy Wittman decided to play both point
guards -- Miller and Knight -- together for one of the first times all year.
</P>
<P>
	   Millers' 3 from the wing ignited an 11-2 run that gave the Cavs a 90-89 lead
with 8:17 remaining, but Cleveland went five possessions without scoring and the
Clippers tied it again on Nesby's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   However, with Odom on the bench, the Clippers struggled to score and when
they didn't they were forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs finished 29 of 39 from the line, including 20 of 24 in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, who had a 4-point play and spectacular layup earlier in the
quarter, went 5-for-5 from the floor and Los Angeles shot 74 percent as a team
in scoring 38 points in the third period to take an 85-77 lead.

<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - There are enough questions about whether politics

<P>
	   It is "absolutely clear" that lawyer appointments to the jobs puts the

<HEADLINE> Kaye calls for private collection agencies to go after fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Courts have not proven to be particularly good bill
collectors and it is time to turn that job over to the professionals, the
state's chief judge says.
<P>
	   Judith Kaye said private bill collectors will be hired to go after "every
penny we can" in court-ordered fines and surcharges. Six court jurisdictions
will be targeted at first, and Kaye said she'd like to expand the program
statewide if the returns are positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience has shown that governmental institutions are not equipped to
function as collection agencies and are therefore not particularly successful at
this task," Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye also called in her annual State of the Judiciary address Monday for
bolstering drug and community courts so they can handle many more misdemeanor
cases; establishing an inspector general to investigate whether the appointments
of fiduciaries and other lawyers are politically motivated; and continuing jury
reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration said private agencies would be used
at first to collect fines and surcharges imposed in six court jurisdictions:
Suffolk County Court, Suffolk District Court, Nassau District Court, Queens
state Supreme Court, New York City Criminal Court and Rochester City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Lippman, chief state administrative judge, said those courts were
picked because of the large amounts of outstanding payments due.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye proposed using the money the collection agencies raise to help pay for
an increase in the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who defend indigent New
Yorkers. Those fees are currently $40 an hour for in-court work and $25 an hour
for out-of-court time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye called those fee levels "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally
unrealistic" and said too many inexperienced lawyers are handling too many such
cases because they aren't worth the time of veteran lawyers. The entire legal
system suffers because of it, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   She proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an hour for felony
and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for non-felony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The president-elect of the state Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
Kathryn Kase, said Kaye was on the right track with her proposed fee increase.
But Kase said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless rates are raised to at least $100 per hour, we fear that competent
counsel will continue to flee the assigned counsel panels in urban areas where
overhead costs are higher than $60 per hour," Kase said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye acknowledged that low-level nonviolent misdemeanor offenders are a
problem to the police, the communities the offenders live in and to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Gov. George Pataki proposed prosecuting as a felony a fourth
misdemeanor charge against a person with three prior misdemeanor convictions. He
said some criminals had dozens of such convictions on their records for offenses
such as shoplifting, marijuana possession and disorderly conduct without ever
serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye advocated a different approach. She said the prosecution of misdemeanor
offenders often turns into "human recycling" because the court system doesn't
have the capacity to hold actual trials. Of the 375,000 arrest cases in the New
York City Criminal Court last year, for example, only 822 or 0.2 percent, were
resolved at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said the constant plea-bargaining serves neither defendants nor the
court system.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she will ask the Legislature to create 23 new Criminal Court
judgeships in New York City and also temporarily reassign state Supreme Court
justices to hear misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Kaye advocated changing the law so that more bench trials can
be held in misdemeanor cases and that more resources be given to drug and
community courts.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. James Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who chairs his chamber's
judiciary committee, said he favors putting more emphasis on drug courts and
other alternative forms of adjudicating cases to provide more room for trying
felony cases in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The decision to move the upcoming murder trial of
four police officers to Albany from the Bronx has angered activists and
lawmakers - both of whom have called on the U.S. Justice Department to monitor
the trial.
<P>
	   The state Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus argued that
moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid facing a
predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special treatment for
police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said Monday. "Because if
things do go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to
put into process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again."
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan and chairman of the caucus
expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and Hispanic jurors be
representative of the community. The caucus is also requesting that New York
City and Albany residents be given access and seats in the court room to monitor
the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department officials said they have been monitoring the case for
possible civil rights violations from the beginning and will continue to do so
at the trial stage.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests. Activists had planned to demonstrate outside the Bronx courthouse once
the officers went on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an extraordinary decision, a state appeals court moved the officers'
trial to Albany. In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be impossible
for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media treatment of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Diallo incident is another example that something is wrong with the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement agencies," Wright
said. "Now more than ever there is a need to take a look at how our police
officers are trained and prepared for the communities in which they perform
their duties."
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Pope, president of the Albany branch of the NAACP, compared the Diallo
trial to a recent incident in which 33-year-old Tracy Grady allegedly wrested a
gun from two Albany police officers and shot them before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the incident, police swarmed through a black neighborhood dressed
in combat fatigues and helmets, allegedly using excessive force and brutalizing
residents in their search for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned to make sure that no one thinks Albany is a safe haven for
police who have acted brutally and irresponsibly, whether in New York City or
right here in our own neighborhoods," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo supporters in Albany Monday announced the formation of a Capital
Region Justice for Diallo Committee. Its members said they will monitor the
trial, provide support for members of Diallo's family when they are in Albany
for the proceedings. The committee also said it will continue pushing for a
civilian review board to oversee the activities of Albany police.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris lobbyist's case referred to district attorney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A tobacco lobbyist who admitted breaking state
statutes and who was banned from working in the state now could face jail time
and a fine, state officials say.
<P>
	   The state Lobbying Commission referred the case of Philip Morris lobbyist
Sharon Portnoy, who admitted violating state lobbying laws, to Albany County
District Attorney Sol Greenberg for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission settled its investigation with Portnoy and Philip Morris by
banning the lobbyist from working in the state in the next three years and
fining the company $75,000. But it also has the power to ask for a criminal
investigation if it thinks violations were deliberate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commission believed that the violation was willful," said David
Grandeau, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission investigated Philip Morris for not reporting some of the
gifts it gave to state lawmakers. State law requires lobbyists and their clients
to disclose all expenses, with a specific description of those expenses that
exceed $75.
</P>
<P>
	   It is illegal in New York to give lawmakers and officials any gifts worth
more than $75 if they are intended to influence their official duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy, Philip Morris' chief lobbyist, allegedly treated more than 60
lawmakers and their aides to more than $12,000 in meals in the first half of
1996 alone but few of those were publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris officials have said they were unaware of the improper lobby
filing, would cooperate with the Lobbying Commission's investigation and
wouldn't violate the law again.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said the $75,000 fines it gave Philip Morris were the most it
could have handed down under state law.
</P>
<P>
	   The district attorney could charge Portnoy with falsely filing documents, a
Class A misdemeanor. The maximum penalty is a year in jail and fines of up to
$1,000, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenberg said Monday he had not yet reviewed the file from the Lobbying
Commission, so he couldn't properly comment on it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll look at what we have and we'll march from there," said Greenberg, who
also has to worry about the fallout of the Amadou Diallo police brutality case
being tried in his county this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission historically sends reports to the appropriate district
attorney, not the state attorney general, Grandeau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reacted angrily after hearing that the
commission referred the case to Greenberg, calling it "outrageous" that the
commission didn't ask for an investigation of Philip Morris itself. He said
asking for an investigation of Portnoy and not Philip Morris protects the
tobacco company from criminal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This action constitutes an abdication of the commission's statutory duties
and makes a mockery of statutory enforcement procedures," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer had earlier asked for the go-ahead to prosecute both Portnoy and
Philip Morris. It was unclear Monday whether Greenberg and Spitzer can share the
jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   That troubled Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our concern is that this doesn't fall into a prosecutorial black hole,"
Horner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the state Senate on Monday passed a resolution saying its members
would not accept gifts from lobbyists at all if Assembly members did so as well.
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno promised earlier that his Senate members
would not accept gifts anymore in light of the Portnoy case, and Democratic
senators soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic attempt to pass a rule binding the Republican-controlled Senate
to its promise failed.

<HEADLINE> Hurts so bad: Buffalo Bills fans lament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The Nashville, Tenn. chapter of the Buffalo Bills
Backers had a rough day Saturday.
<P>
	   The bar where they've held their events for the last three years took down
its Bills signs in solidarity with the Titans, and Bills fans faced ridicule
wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't even want to come to work on Monday," said Mary Dillon, a
Nashville-based Bills Backer. "At least in Buffalo people have family and
friends to help them through this."
</P>
<P>
	   By "this," Ms. Dillon refers not only to Saturday's 22-16 Titan victory, but
the trend of losses that makes being a Buffalo sports fan - no matter where they
live - so tough.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got to be a conspiracy," said John Stone, a Buffalo contractor and
sports fan. "Somebody - or something - just won't let us have it. It's an evil
force that lets us get close enough to taste a win, but then snatches it from
us."
</P>
<P>
	   Many Buffalo fans would say that the "evil force" wears stripes and makes
bad calls.
</P>
<P>
	   "The refs have something against us," said Kathy Hansen, president of the
Bills Backers of the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo, anti-referee feelings still run deep following Brett Hull's
game-winning goal for Dallas in the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. Bitter Sabres fans
still won't call it a real victory: Hull's foot was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   And Saturday just made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it was blatantly a great play that won the game, it would be easier to
swallow," Jacki DiPirro, president of the Nashville Bills Backers said. "I'm
tired of losing with controversial calls. I mean, I have a 'No Goal' sticker
right here on my wall in Nashville."
</P>
<P>
	   With 16 seconds left, Ms. DiPirro along with Bills fans everywhere
celebrated Steve Christie's 41-yard field goal, assuming it won the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But then it happened: Titan's tight end Frank Wycheck passed a disputed
lateral to Kevin Dyson who won the game with a 75-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was devastating," said Jacki DiPirro, president of the Nashville Bills
Backers. "To have that type of swing in emotion in 13 seconds is just
unbearable."
</P>
<P>
	   President of the Buffalo Bills Booster Club, John Opalka, has a new two-word
mantra for Buffalo fans: "What Lateral?"
</P>
<P>
	   "It hurts that human error is still a part of the game," said Opalka, who
thinks Buffalo's market size has something to do with its sports teams' bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a bad call like Hull's no goal happened in New York City, the media and
fans there would create such controversy that it would shatter the league," he
said. "Same thing with Saturday's backward pass."
</P>
<P>
	   It's logical to wonder how much more Buffalo fans can take. Scott Norwood's
"wide right" is still a sore subject around here, as are the three subsequent
Superbowl losses that followed it.
</P>
<P>
	   One area supermarket chain put "Flutie Flakes" on sale this week, a sign
that some think fan support might wane.
</P>
<P>
	   But Buffalo's fans remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "The promise of years to come keeps us going," Opalka said. "There's a new
core of strong players coming up, and as long as there are Buffalo Bills, we'll
be out there."

<HEADLINE> N.Y.'s 'Statue of Liberty' license plates on way out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Statue of Liberty won't herald cars from New
York anymore after the next two years.
<P>
	   New York's 14-year-old red, white and blue "Statue of Liberty" license
plates are being retired and replaced with plates with different colors, a new
numbering and lettering system, and new landmarks - Niagara Falls, the
Adirondacks and a small New York City skyline featuring the Empire State
Building.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Motor Vehicles will start distributing the new plates in
October. That means by October 2002, police will be able to easily tell who has
not renewed their license plates by simply looking for Lady Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	   "The DMV staff, with the help of law enforcement agencies, have designed a
beautiful plate which will result in the removal of thousands of illegal
vehicles from the road," DMV Commissioner Richard Jackson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   It is estimated that there as many as 700,000 expired or unauthorized
license plates on New York roads, officials said. New York license plates do not
have expiration dates on them.
</P>
<P>
	   The new blue and white tags features Niagara Falls to the left, the
Adirondacks in the middle and a New York City skyline with the Empire State
Building on the right. All of the landmarks are across the top of the plate in
dark blue with a light blue background. "New York" is superimposed in
all-capital white letters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have designed a new license plate that emphasizes the majestic beauty of
our Empire State," Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   "THE EMPIRE STATE," which was last seen on a general issue New York license
plate in 1963, returns with the new plates. It is centered on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two mottos have been used on general issue plates: "World's Fair" from
1938-40 and 1964-65, "Empire State" from 1957-63 and "The Empire State" from
1951-56.
</P>
<P>
	   The licensing pattern also changes with the Empire plate. Instead of letters
or numbers in groups of three divided by the Statue of Liberty, the new plates
will have three letters and four numbers split by a small silhouette of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue letters on the white background will be larger and easier to see,
to help law enforcement identify tag numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The new Empire plate will provide both police and citizens with an
outstanding tool to more accurately identify plate numbers of a criminal fleeing
the scene of a crime," State Police Superintendent James McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Statue of Liberty license plates were first issued in 1986 and were the
first New York general issue plates to carry a picture, instead of just letters
and numbers. The Legislature authorized those plates to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers will have to pay a one-time $5.50 fee for the new plates when they
renew their vehicle registration along with the standard two-year registration
fee.

<HEADLINE> Regent J. Edward Meyer retiring in March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - J. Edward Meyer, the state's longest-serving Regent,
says he will retire in March in part to help former New York Knick Bill Bradley
become the Democratic nominee for president.
<P>
	   "After 23 years, I'm hanging up my Regents' spikes," said Meyer, who will be
65 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who was first elected to the Board of Regents in 1977, said he felt
that campaigning for Bradley as a presidential delegate and working on the
Regents board would be a conflict of interest. In addition, "A lot of things I
fought for have been accomplished," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer listed finding current Education Commissioner Richard Mills,
developing a "meaningful" high school diploma and having a more visible Board of
Regents as some of the things he fought for.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said he was concerned about five years ago that Gov. George Pataki
would ask the Legislature to abolish the Board of Regents and that lawmakers
would agree.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that is now possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are chosen by joint sessions of the state Legislature. Because
Democrats dominate the 211 seats in the Legislature overall, that means
Democrats select and elect the Regents. Pataki, a Republican, has called for
more direct authority over the Regents and the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regents are in the middle of an effort to increase the education
standards in New York. Starting this year, seniors will have to be able to pass
at least one Regents exam before getting their high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout his tenure, he has advocated higher standards for students,
schools, colleges and the professions," Education Commissioner Richard Mills
said. "And he has consistently fought to provide the extra help people need to
reach those standards. We will miss his leadership."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said Bradley, whom he is supporting for the Democratic nomination over
Vice President Al Gore, supported him when Meyer first ran for Assembly in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley has been my friend for 30 years," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Bradley and Gore in a tight race in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer's retirement becomes official March 31. He said he does not know who
will replace him but has suggested to legislators that they choose a "layman,"
not a professional educator. "The board has to be strong and independent, and I
think a lay person could be better at that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who lives in Chappaqua in Westchester County, served two terms in the
Assembly and was also an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are not paid for their service on the board but they get expenses
when on official business.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The decision to move the upcoming murder trial of
four police officers to Albany from the Bronx has angered activists and
lawmakers - both of whom have called on the U.S. Justice Department to monitor
the trial.
<P>
	   The state Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus argued that
moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid facing a
predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special treatment for
police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said Monday. "Because if
things do go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to
put into process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again."
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan and chairman of the caucus
expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and Hispanic jurors be
representative of the community. The caucus is also requesting that New York
City and Albany residents be given access and seats in the court room to monitor
the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department officials said they have been monitoring the case for
possible civil rights violations from the beginning and will continue to do so
at the trial stage.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100

trial, provide support for members of Diallo's family when they are in Albany
for the proceedings. The committee also said it will continue pushing for a

	   Only two mottos have been used on general issue plates: "World's Fair" from
1938-40 and 1964-65, "Empire State" from 1957-63 and "The Empire State" from
1951-56.
</P>
<P>
	   The licensing pattern also changes with the Empire plate. Instead of letters
or numbers in groups of three divided by the Statue of Liberty, the new plates
will have three letters and four numbers split by a small silhouette of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue letters on the white background will be larger and easier to see,
to help law enforcement identify tag numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The new Empire plate will provide both police and citizens with an
outstanding tool to more accurately identify plate numbers of a criminal fleeing
the scene of a crime," State Police Superintendent James McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Statue of Liberty license plates were first issued in 1986 and were the
first New York general issue plates to carry a picture, instead of just letters
and numbers. The Legislature authorized those plates to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers will have to pay a one-time $5.50 fee for the new plates when they
renew their vehicle registration along with the standard two-year registration
fee.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris lobbyist's case referred to district attorney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A tobacco lobbyist who admitted breaking state
statutes and who was banned from working in the state now could face jail time
and a fine, state officials say.
<P>
	   The state Lobbying Commission referred the case of Philip Morris lobbyist
Sharon Portnoy, who admitted violating state lobbying laws, to Albany County
District Attorney Sol Greenberg for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission settled its investigation with Portnoy and Philip Morris by
banning the lobbyist from working in the state in the next three years and
fining the company $75,000. But it also has the power to ask for a criminal
investigation if it thinks violations were deliberate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commission believed that the violation was willful," said David
Grandeau, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission investigated Philip Morris for not reporting some of the
gifts it gave to state lawmakers. State law requires lobbyists and their clients
to disclose all expenses, with a specific description of those expenses that
exceed $75.
</P>
<P>
	   It is illegal in New York to give lawmakers and officials any gifts worth
more than $75 if they are intended to influence their official duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy, Philip Morris' chief lobbyist, allegedly treated more than 60
lawmakers and their aides to more than $12,000 in meals in the first half of
1996 alone but few of those were publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris officials have said they were unaware of the improper lobby
filing, would cooperate with the Lobbying Commission's investigation and
wouldn't violate the law again.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said the $75,000 fines it gave Philip Morris were the most it
could have handed down under state law.
</P>
<P>
	   The district attorney could charge Portnoy with falsely filing documents, a
Class A misdemeanor. The maximum penalty is a year in jail and fines of up to
$1,000, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenberg said Monday he had not yet reviewed the file from the Lobbying
Commission, so he couldn't properly comment on it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll look at what we have and we'll march from there," said Greenberg, who
also has to worry about the fallout of the Amadou Diallo police brutality case
being tried in his county this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission historically sends reports to the appropriate district
attorney, not the state attorney general, Grandeau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reacted angrily after hearing that the
commission referred the case to Greenberg, calling it "outrageous" that the
commission didn't ask for an investigation of Philip Morris itself. He said
asking for an investigation of Portnoy and not Philip Morris protects the
tobacco company from criminal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This action constitutes an abdication of the commission's statutory duties
and makes a mockery of statutory enforcement procedures," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer had earlier asked for the go-ahead to prosecute both Portnoy and
Philip Morris. It was unclear Monday whether Greenberg and Spitzer can share the
jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   That troubled Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our concern is that this doesn't fall into a prosecutorial black hole,"
Horner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the state Senate on Monday passed a resolution saying its members
would not accept gifts from lobbyists at all if Assembly members did so as well.
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno promised earlier that his Senate members
would not accept gifts anymore in light of the Portnoy case, and Democratic
senators soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic attempt to pass a rule binding the Republican-controlled Senate
to its promise failed.

<HEADLINE> Regent J. Edward Meyer retiring in March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - J. Edward Meyer, the state's longest-serving Regent,
says he will retire in March in part to help former New York Knick Bill Bradley
become the Democratic nominee for president.
<P>
	   "After 23 years, I'm hanging up my Regents' spikes," said Meyer, who will be
65 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who was first elected to the Board of Regents in 1977, said he felt
that campaigning for Bradley as a presidential delegate and working on the
Regents board would be a conflict of interest. In addition, "A lot of things I
fought for have been accomplished," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer listed finding current Education Commissioner Richard Mills,
developing a "meaningful" high school diploma and having a more visible Board of
Regents as some of the things he fought for.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said he was concerned about five years ago that Gov. George Pataki
would ask the Legislature to abolish the Board of Regents and that lawmakers
would agree.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that is now possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are chosen by joint sessions of the state Legislature. Because
Democrats dominate the 211 seats in the Legislature overall, that means
Democrats select and elect the Regents. Pataki, a Republican, has called for
more direct authority over the Regents and the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regents are in the middle of an effort to increase the education
standards in New York. Starting this year, seniors will have to be able to pass
at least one Regents exam before getting their high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout his tenure, he has advocated higher standards for students,
schools, colleges and the professions," Education Commissioner Richard Mills
said. "And he has consistently fought to provide the extra help people need to
reach those standards. We will miss his leadership."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said Bradley, whom he is supporting for the Democratic nomination over
Vice President Al Gore, supported him when Meyer first ran for Assembly in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley has been my friend for 30 years," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Bradley and Gore in a tight race in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer's retirement becomes official March 31. He said he does not know who
will replace him but has suggested to legislators that they choose a "layman,"
not a professional educator. "The board has to be strong and independent, and I
think a lay person could be better at that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who lives in Chappaqua in Westchester County, served two terms in the
Assembly and was also an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are not paid for their service on the board but they get expenses
when on official business.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Defends GOP on Isolationism  </HEADLINE>
   By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Republicans aren't isolationists, they just want to follow
the American tradition of being careful about getting involved in foreign
affairs, House Speaker Dennis Hastert told a group of business executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert cited Republican leadership in areas such as defense preparedness,
trade and the fight against drug trafficking as proof that they're willing to
get involved -- as long as it is in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
	   During a speech Monday to the Mid-America Committee for International
Business and Government Cooperation, Hastert said despite democratic ideals and
military power, the United States ``cannot, and we should not, try to impose our
will every place and on every occasion in the world. ... Even Americans cannot
solve all the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October, President Clinton said Republicans had fallen into ``a new
isolationism'' by defeating the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But protecting the country and its people is the necessary standard for
getting involved militarily, said Hastert, whose congressional district is west
of the Chicago area. He added that Republicans question the Clinton
administration's national security policies because of a lack of trust, not
necessarily a desire to stay out of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans are a free people who regularly make sacrifices on behalf of
others, but as a free people, Americans expect others to do their fair share,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Unveils New Minivans  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- After seeing the growth of its minivan sales slow down,
Chrysler has unveiled a 2001 model it hopes will be enough to keep customers and
win back defectors.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands we're famous for a few things. First
and foremost it's minivans," Chrysler president Jim Holden said at the North
American International Auto Show preview on Monday. "It's extremely important to
us."
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler AG spent $2.8 billion to develop the new versions of its
Chrysler and Dodge minivans.
</P>
<P>
	   The minivans are one of the staples of Chrysler's profits, and one of the
products most beloved within the company; Holden had spent time as head of the
minivan program before becoming Chrysler president last year. It's important
enough that after the merger between Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG in 1998,
Mercedes killed off a minivan it had been developing.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic formula for a successful minivan was set mostly by Chrysler in
1984; a front-wheel drive vehicle that drives like a car, with plenty of space.
Since then, the company has sold 8 million copies.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the 1990s, other automakers figured out the formula and had to rely
on nifty features like multiple cupholders, built-in child seats and power doors
to lure customers. Minivans also picked up an image as the driving choice for
suburban soccer moms. Sport utility vehicles offered similar room and a better
self-image for many drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales growth slowed. Chrysler kept up with the trends and held onto 40
percent of the market, but saw its toughest challenges emerge last year. Power
doors turned out to be a must-have feature, and Chrysler held off while
competitors added them. New models from Honda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. began
to capture customers away from Chrysler's aging designs, last updated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Honda's Odyssey was especially popular, and some dealers even had waiting
lists. Chrysler felt the blow; its U.S. minivan sales were down 4 percent last
year, to 503,830, and the company has recently increased incentives on all
models.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough and there are many, many competitors," Holden said. "It puts a
bigger obligation on us to invent and innovate, and that's what we did."
</P>
<P>
	   The new models -- the Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan and the Chrysler
Town &AMP; Country -- are completely new, but look fairly similar to their
predecessors. The sheetmetal has few changes, save for much larger headlights
that come in response to complaints of weak lighting from older models.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler leap-frogged into the power door battle with three per vehicle --
two on the sides and a power rear gate. When activated, the gate lets out two
seconds of warning beeps before opening. If something blocks its path opening or
closing, it stops. And it has a "finger-guard" -- a sensor running along the
seal between the door and the frame that also stops the gate if it detects an
object like a metal pen.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also touts a new design for power side doors. Chrysler engineers
wanted the doors to close smoothly under manual power, a problem they saw in
other designs. So they put the motor inside the door, and connected it to the
body with a special plastic linkage that looks like a thick bike chain running
below the door.
</P>
<P>
	   The frame was made stiffer for a more stable ride, and the engines were
reworked to improve power, with the strongest V6 now turning out 230 horsepower.
The interior also features a removable console that can go in the first or
second rows and contains ports for charging cell phones. Engineers also worked
to make the interior quiet enough that passengers in the third row could be
heard by the driver.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler did pass on adding one popular feature of Honda's minivan -- a
third row of seats that can be folded flat into the floor. Chrysler engineers
said the feature would have made the optional four-wheel-drive system
impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   The new models will be priced within the current range, from about $18,000
to $37,000, and will go on sale this summer. Holden said sales this year will
slow down while the company converts its plants to building the new models, but
believes sales will rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no other platform that controls 40 percent of its market," he said.
"There are certain points of the vehicle you don't want to mess with."

<HEADLINE> 2000 Auto Sales To Stay in Fast Lane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers probably will sell 1 million or so fewer cars and
trucks this year in the United States, but that doesn't mean it will be a bad
year, company economists say.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because last year's sales total of 17.4 million vehicles was an
all-time record that exceeded many predictions, economists for General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   If their latest forecasts were accurate, then 2000 would be the industry's
second-best year, the economists told a meeting of the Society of Automotive
Analysts during the North American International Auto Show media preview.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are very few inflation warning signals out there," said Ellen
Hughes-Cromwick, manager of Ford's corporate economic group. "The conditions for
the economy still remain solid. ... Most of the indicators are still flashing
green."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's U.S. sales record of 17.4 million included medium-duty and heavy
trucks; sales of passenger cars and light trucks alone totaled 16.9 million.
According to projections by Ms. Hughes-Cromwick and her GM and DaimlerChrysler
counterparts, the overall total will fall to between 16 million and 17 million
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Factors that could cause sales to drop this year include the possibility of
higher interest rates and households shifting a bigger share of their income
into savings, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   A trend toward stronger foreign currencies dating to the fall of 1998 could
boost the price of imports, particularly those from Japan, said G. Mustafa
Mohatarem, GM's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices will be "considerably higher" in 2000, said Mohatarem, who
pegged U.S. sales for 2000 at between 16 million and 16.5 million. At the same
time, he said, "Cars will be more affordable in 2000 than they've been in two
decades."
</P>
<P>
	   The influence of gas prices on consumers' vehicle choices has declined since
the oil shocks of the mid 1970s, when there was a wider gap between low- and
high-mileage cars, said W. Van Bussmann, chief economist of DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler Corp. unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping sales from slipping too far below last year's record levels, they
said, will be continued productivity gains driven by technological advances, and
another year of low inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "U.S. consumers really have enjoyed a golden age," said Bussmann, who
predicted that sales would total about 16.6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if U.S. vehicle sales in 2000 fall 1 million units below last year,
automakers and the public won't notice much of a difference, said Ms.
Hughes-Cromwick, whose own estimate was 16.5 million sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would not be that noticeable," she said. "With the possible exception of
autoworkers drawing less money by putting in less overtime at plants now
operating at more than 100 percent of capacity."

<HEADLINE> Brit Retailers Fight Wal-Mart Clout  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- When Asda Group PLC said it planned to add 14 supermarkets
and 6,000 employees in Britain, the tread of a giant was heard behind the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   That giant is Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer and the
owner of Asda.
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion announced Monday is modest, but analysts see Asda's growth
strategy as evidence of Wal-Mart's effort to squeeze its competitors in the
United Kingdom by expanding its presence, broadening its product range and
paring down prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart has pursued a similar strategy in Germany, where it opened its
doors two years ago. Last week, the Bentonville, Ark., company announced a fresh
round of price cuts on hundreds of items in its German stores, intensifying
pressure on its major competitors Metro AG and Karstadt AG.
</P>
<P>
	   British grocery chains have been bracing for a brawl ever since last summer,
when Wal-Mart paid $10.7 billion for Asda in a deal that shook up the country's
insular supermarket industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Its impact on sentiment has been massive. Everybody is terrified that the
world as we know it is about to change forever," said David Stoddart of the
brokerage Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   A lot of companies have demonstrated a new sense of urgency about cutting
prices and operating costs as a result, he said. "Everyone's wondering what Asda
is going to do next."
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers saw nothing new in Asda's latest plan and said the chain has
merely rehashed old ideas in hopes of scoring points against its competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Asda's announcement came at a time of intense scrutiny of the
country's supermarket industry. Consumers are alarmed by talk that prices are
unjustifiably high in "rip-off Britain," and the government's Competition
Commission is investigating the industry for possible evidence of price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is Wal-Mart beginning to set out its footprint in the U.K. market,"
said Jim Wood-Smith of London-based brokerage Greig Middleton. "It's going to
make life even more difficult than it currently is for Asda's competition."
</P>
<P>
	   Asda's access to Wal-Mart's deep pockets and expertise in cutting costs
gives it a big advantage, especially against other retailers that lack similar
global economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are generally 5 to 10 percent cheaper than our main competition,"
claimed Asda spokeswoman Zaria Pinchbeck.
</P>
<P>
	   And there's more to come: Asda says it will drop prices on 10,000 products
to levels seen in the United States by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Wal-Mart can come in and reduce prices on branded goods, consumers
should certainly benefit," said Delroy Corinaldi of the Consumers' Association,
a national watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
	   However, British customers want more than just low prices; Full-service meat
departments and short checkout lines also are important, analysts and consumer
activists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Headquartered in the northern city of Leeds, Asda has 232 stores and 100,000
employees. While Pinchbeck refused to divulge its latest financial figures,
Asda's annual sales have been estimated at $12.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   As Britain's third-largest grocery chain, with an estimated 16 percent share
of the grocery market, Asda has far to go before it can rival industry leader
Tesco PLC, which has 24 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Tesco slashed prices by a total of $608 million last year. It is also
expanding its Internet business and keeping more stores open for 24 hours a day,
spokesman Russell Craig said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's No. 2 chain J. Sainsbury PLC has come under relentless
pressure since Wal-Mart entered the fray, and there has even been speculation
that the company is a possible takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Sainsbury's spokesman Greg Dawson put a brave face on its efforts to hold
its own.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wal-Mart's an interesting addition to the U.K. retail market," he said. "We
don't fear them in any way."
</P>
<P>
	   Government rules on land use might yet do what wilting competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart's expansion plans depend on its ability to develop large sites for
new stores. But such sites are scarce in densely populated Britain, and planning
authorities have taken a dim view of similar developments in the past.

<HEADLINE> New Salmon Proposal Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal salmon proposal unveiled last month was
supposed to be good news for loggers, developers and other industries in four
states.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan offers exemptions from new federal salmon regulations, as long as
the industries abide by certain state and local rules in Washington, Oregon,
Idaho and California.
</P>
<P>
	   But some business leaders see big problems instead of a great deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The same proposal that carves out exemptions also says people who kill, harm
or harass 14 threatened salmon populations or their habitat could face one year
in jail and a $50,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Business owners who have grown used to the idea of land restrictions because
of salmon problems say the prospect of stiff penalties -- even for indirectly
hurting the fish -- is going too far.
</P>
<P>
	   "Northwesterners are now at the mercy of federal officials, accountable to
no one, and many northwesterners will dare not offend them," James Buchal, a
Portland, Ore., attorney who represents businesses on salmon issues, wrote in a
critique of the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal announced Dec. 14 will indeed result in more endangered species
prosecutions, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
	   But the prosecutions will be limited and targeted at the most egregious
violators who destroy salmon habitat, dump toxic chemicals in rivers and apply
pesticides so that they harm streams, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fisheries Service has neither the staff nor desire to aggressively track
down all violators across the 159,000 square miles the plan covers, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new proposal signals that the agency is serious about recovering the
fish, said Garth Griffin, a fisheries service biologist in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   "If something is listed, it's serious," Griffin said. "It has the
possibility of sometime going extinct."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Endangered Species Act, people who harm any of the nation's 934
endangered species -- plants and animals in danger of becoming extinct -- could
face jail time or fines.
</P>
<P>
	   Under most circumstances, people who do the damage are not exempt from
possible penalties unless they get a federal permit allowing them to "take," or
harm a species.
</P>
<P>
	   But the ESA does not extend the penalties to 263 threatened species,
including many of the listed salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. (Threatened
species are defined as likely to become endangered within the foreseeable
future.)
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 20 of the 26 salmon populations
listed under the ESA are threatened. The other six are endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fish and Wildlife Service, the federal agency primarily responsible for
enforcing the ESA, wrote regulations that make penalties identical for
threatened and endangered species. But the Fisheries Service, which enforces the
ESA for salmon, has no such regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the agency decides when crafting rules for individual listings
whether harming a threatened species should carry ESA penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fisheries Service's announcement on Dec. 14 was the first indication
that the agency intends to require penalties under new rules for 14 threatened
salmon stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's clearly a concern," said Laura Cleland of the Independent Forest
Products Association in Portland, saying some landowners worry about being
targeted by the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   But Griffin said the Fisheries Service's decision should not have been a
surprise. The agency calls for penalties in most rules it promulgates for
threatened species, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   If the newly proposed rules are adopted, harming 24 of the 26 salmon
populations in the four states could result in a penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fisheries Service has not yet drafted rules for the other two
populations because they were listed in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Fisheries Service prosecutions for ESA violations have been rare in
the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency brought just 19 cases against alleged endangered species
violators in the region in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That was down
from 23 prosecutions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists say landowners probably don't have much to worry about in
terms of Fisheries Service enforcement under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
	   While the rules call for penalties, the Fisheries Service has not
specifically said which activities -- such as logging too close to a stream, or
dumping fertilizer into a stream -- will most quickly draw prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
	   That has caused confusion, said Daniel Hall, director of the forest
biodiversity program at American Lands Alliance in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency "is telling landowners to be scared, but they're not telling them
what to be scared of," Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Fisheries Service plans 22 hearings on the proposed rules,
which begin Jan. 10 in Portland and run through Feb. 3 in San Luis Obispo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules could become final in June 2000.

<HEADLINE> Teen Indicted for Columbine Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By P. SOLOMON BANDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A federal grand jury on Monday indicted a Florida teen-ager
accused of sending a computer threat that shut down Columbine High School for
two days and Texas man who made unrelated threats in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Ian Campbell, 18, of Cape Coral, Fla., faces one count of sending
threatening communication over interstate commerce, said Jeff Dorschner, a
spokesman for the U.S. Attorney. The charge carries a penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. He is free on bail and due in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell was accused of using the screen name ``Soup 81'' to send an instant
message on Dec. 15 to Columbine sophomore Erin J. Walton, saying he was going to
``finish what begun.''
</P>
<P>
	   According the indictment, Campbell told Walton not to go to school because,
``if you go I don't want your blood on my hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students
and a teacher on April 20 before killing themselves in one of the nation's worst
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also said that Arthur Leon Thomas, 18, of Houston, was indicted
on three counts of sending threatening messages. Thomas allegedly sent
threatening letters to Columbine High School and to Jefferson County Sheriff
John Stone on Sept. 30, and a threatening e-mail to a Broomfield resident on
Nov. 2, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was not in custody Monday.

Hastert: Republicans Aren't Isolationists
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Republicans aren't isolationists, they just want to follow
the American tradition of being careful about getting involved in foreign
affairs, House Speaker Dennis Hastert told a group of business executives.
Hastert cited Republican leadership in areas such as defense preparedness, trade
and the fight against drug trafficking as proof that they're willing to get
involved -- as long as it is in the national interest. During a speech Monday to
the Mid-America Committee for International Business and Government Cooperation,
Hastert said despite democratic ideals and military power, the United States
"cannot, and we should not, try to impose our will every place and on every
occasion in the world. ... Even Americans cannot solve all the world's
problems."

Evidence of Europa Ocean Exists

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters
theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa,
scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest
flyby. The findings indirectly support the case for life beneath the moon's icy
crust. Some experts believe primitive organisms could survive just as they do
deep in the Earth's ocean near volcanic vents. "Certainly if you are going to
look for other environments where life might form or be able to survive, this
might be a good one," said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more, with two-thirds of the cut
going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.

<HEADLINE> Gay groups disappointed by first lady's position  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Influential gay groups are expressing
disappointment with Hillary Rodham Clinton for coming out against legal
recognition of homosexual marriages.
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate, said Monday
that she favors full benefits for partners in homosexual relationships but that
marriages should be between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to
the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been,
between a man and a woman," Mrs. Clinton said after a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Sweeney, spokesman for the Empire State Pride Agenda, said the
endorsement of benefits "rings a little hollow" when accompanied by the refusal
to recognize gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect and deserve from society the full support that married couples
receive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign in Washington said he was
disappointed in Mrs. Clinton's position on civil marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "While domestic partnership recognition is important and we continue to work
toward achieving that recognition, it still represents a separate-but-equal
doctrine," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is expected to be Mrs. Clinton's
opponent in the Senate race, had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Mrs. Clinton angered some gays by saying she would march in New
York City's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, which excludes the Irish Lesbian
and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics:
</P>
<P>
	   -Mrs. Clinton said she generally supports putting school systems under
mayoral control, a long-sought goal of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not against that," she said. "In general, I believe in having the
political leadership responsible for the biggest enterprise in the city."
</P>
<P>
	   But the first lady implied that Giuliani could be a roadblock to such an
arrangement in New York. Mayoral control worked in Chicago, she said, because
"nobody doubted that the mayor of Chicago really cared about the children of
Chicago - all the children of Chicago. ... If you've got a situation where
there's a doubt about that, then it might be difficult to bring about."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum noted that Giuliani has long supported
doing away with the Board of Education and added, "It is his political opponents
in New York, many of whom are close to Hillary Clinton, who have blocked that."
</P>
<P>
	   -Mrs. Clinton repeated an offer to "sit down with the Giuliani campaign to
talk about a way we could agree to ban soft money and independent expenditures,"
various ways of skirting fund-raising limits.
</P>
<P>
	   -Addressing the carpetbagging issue, the first lady said that because she
moved to New York only this month, "It's fair that people say to themselves,
'Well, I want to be sure that she's committed to New York, she cares about New
York and she's going to fight for New York.' And I think I will be able to
demonstrate all three of those."

<HEADLINE> Nasal Spray Lowers Ill Kids' Anxiety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- A nasal spray containing a drug similar to Valium reduced
anxiety in children undergoing painful cancer treatments, according to a study
in this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 43 cancer-stricken Swedish children found that those given
midazolam in a nasal spray prior to having a needle inserted into them for
intravenous treatments were calmer and more comfortable than children given a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the drug was tested only on children with cancer, researchers said
it could be used to ease anxiety in youngsters facing procedures for other
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's interesting for children who are very much afraid, where you otherwise
would have to hold them down to carry through the procedure or immunization or
whatever," said Dr. Gustaf Ljungman, lead author of the study and a pediatric
cancer specialist at Uppsala University Children's Hospital in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, the spray or a placebo was given before a needle was inserted
in an intravenous port, an opening left in cancer patients to avoid having to
insert an IV each time doctors need to administer a drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The children were later asked whether the spray had a calming effect,
whether it bothered them and if they would want the medication again. Parents
and nurses helped the children answer the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
	   The main drawback to the spray, Ljungman said, is that some children
reported a burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also noted that midazolam only reduced the children's anxiety and
not the pain associated with the treatment itself.

<HEADLINE> 54-Year-Old Woman Has Triplets  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA ASHTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- It's been 16 years since the birth of Arcelia Garcia's
last child and she is a grandmother many times over.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Mrs. Garcia said she didn't worry about her age -- 54-- when she
learned she was pregnant with triplets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To receive a child, no woman is too old,'' Mrs. Garcia said at a news
conference Monday at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital. ``My love for my children
that just came here is the same as for the first one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia, who lives in nearby Sunnyside, delivered three healthy girls --
Arianna, Brianna and CeCelia -- by Caesarean section at about 5 p.m. Saturday.
The babies were conceived without fertility drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia and her husband, Guillermo, 60, now have 11 children and 13
grandchildren, with two more grandchildren on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She just hit the Lotto,'' said Mrs. Garcia's third child, Guadalupe
Garcia, 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of Mrs. Garcia's eight older children attended the news conference
with their mother, who spoke in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia said learning last year that she would have triplets was a big,
but wonderful, surprise -- ``a shining star.'' Since their birth, she has seen
them three times.
</P>
<P>
	   Arianna was the first born and smallest at 3 pounds, 7 ounces. Brianna, the
second born, is in a crib and taking a bottle. She weighed 5 pounds, 12.5 ounces
at birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Third-in-line CeCelia, 5 pounds, 1.5 ounces, is in an incubator like
Arianna.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s bearing triplets is extremely rare, especially without
the aid of fertility drugs. Arceli Keh of Highland, Calif., who gave birth at
63, holds the record for the world's oldest mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very extraordinary case,'' said Dr. Diana Smigaj, Mrs. Garcia's
obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
	   The average age for menopause is 51, and Mrs. Garcia was showing some signs,
such as several consecutive missed periods, Smigaj said. A single ``menopause
baby'' isn't all that uncommon, but triplets are, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia's husband was at home Monday, but he had seen pictures of the
triplets, said son Francisco Garcia, 34, of Sunnyside.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's very proud,'' Francisco Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mrs. Garcia earlier said she planned to return to work on the family
farm soon, her children have already nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe after six years,'' said son Miguel Garcia, 35, of Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The babies were born in the 35th week of Mrs. Garcia's pregnancy. A
full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafaela Rodriguez, 29, was present when her three new sisters were born. She
said her first thoughts were: ``It's a miracle, for one, and I'm glad it's over
for my mom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved to
Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, in 1976. She has been a
U.S. citizen since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Pilgrim's Problems Unknown  </HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE MILLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- A week after Harvard Pilgrim Health Care was placed into
receivership, state regulators still don't know the extent of the financial
problems within the region's largest HMO.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how long it will take to feel we have found it all,''
Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their systems were hiding liabilities from them,'' Ruthardt said. ``If you
don't know how much your products cost, you don't know how to price them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The HMO was placed by a judge under state management Jan. 4, hours after it
revealed an accounting error that boosted its year-end losses by about $50
million, bringing total losses to more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Under receivership, a company is protected from creditors seeking payment of
debts while it comes up with a financial management plan.
</P>
<P>
	   At least some problems have been attributed to incompatible computer systems
that resulted from the merger of Harvard Community Health Plan and Pilgrim
Health Care in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the HMO closed its 125,000-client Rhode Island operation because of
massive losses there. The company has said its 1.1 million subscribers should
not worry about losing coverage or care.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Ruthardt and Attorney General Tom Reilly acknowledged the seriousness
of Harvard Pilgrim's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you're talking about 1 million people, you're talking about one-fifth
of the state,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
	   No other state, she said, has ever had to put into receivership a health
insurer that covered more than 28 percent of its market.

<HEADLINE> Police Shooting Splits Community  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- When 18-year-old Irvin Landrum Jr. was shot by
police during a traffic stop, it appeared to be a case of self-defense -- a
young man who pulled a gun and fired at officers.
</P>
<P>
	   A year after his death, this picturesque Southern California community is
divided by two, far different accounts of the same shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   On one side is Landrum's family and others who say that he was unarmed on
Jan. 11, 1999, and was shot by police trying to protect themselves from a
traffic stop gone bad. On the other are those who say allegations of a coverup
are driven by a disgruntled few in the community pursuing an agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard what happened, I said gun, traffic stop, Claremont?
Uh-uh. This doesn't make sense,'' said Obee Landrum, the teen's uncle. ``Then we
started asking questions, questions nobody wants to answer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police and city officials say they have been more than forthcoming with
information about the shooting, citing outside investigations by the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department and the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think at this point we are satisfied,'' said councilman Paul Held.
</P>
<P>
	   Once overshadowed by the earlier, more high profile shooting of Tyisha
Miller in nearby Riverside, the Landrum case has gained momentum in recent
months. The police shooting has prompted weekly demonstrations in front of City
Hall since August and an FBI investigation into possible civil rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We couldn't say anything because we didn't know what happened,'' Landrum
said. ``As far as the public was concerned, this was a young man with a gun who
shot at police. ... But that started to change when all these things came out.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles District Attorney's office found that the officers, Hany
Hanna and Kent Jacks, were not criminally culpable.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most disputed points is whether Landrum was armed the night he
was pulled over for speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   The two officers said Landrum drew a gun and fired, missing them. They then
fired 14 shots, hitting him three times -- once in the neck, chest and ankle. He
died six days later.
</P>
<P>
	   But tests conducted by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department revealed that
Landrum's gun was never fired and there were no fingerprints. Police have not
commented on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's investigators then said Landrum's unregistered gun was traced to a
collector, whose identity was not released at the time and whose widow said she
didn't know how the gun became involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   But months later, police went further, revealing that the gun collector was
former Ontario Police Chief Wayne Simmons, who died 11 years ago. Neither of the
officers involved in the shooting were reported to have worked for the Ontario
department.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief Robert Moody, who is retiring this month, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment. But at the time, he said the identity of the
collector was withheld because he was not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics point to two other incidents that also raised questions: The naming
of the two officers involved in the shooting as employees of the year and the
release of Obee Landrum's criminal record to the press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that brought it to a head. When the officers were named employees
of the year ... and trying to discredit Obee, it was a slap in the face,'' said
Mary Noonan, a resident and one of the city's harshest critics. ``It was then it
probably became clear to people that something was really wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   City spokesman Mike Maxfield acknowledged that officials made a series of
missteps, but dismissed the supposed conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hindsight is always 20/20. Maybe the city didn't take the best approach,''
he said. ``But these theories about a coverup are outlandish. There is nothing
to support them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Held and the council apologized for their actions and asked for
forgiveness for their handling of the shooting, and a meeting was held between
the family, community leaders and city officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we have begun ... a constructive process to address the issues of
insensitivity and begin the healing process,'' Held said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Landrum family has a federal lawsuit for wrongful death and
civil rights violations pending against city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't begin to heal until you come clean,'' Landrum said. ``We are
still waiting for the police and the city to come clean.''

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks Affordable AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- African countries say wealthy nations should make
HIV-fighting drugs available and affordable to residents of the continent, which
has been hardest hit by AIDS yet has virtually no access to treatments saving
lives in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
	   Many African health ministers and ambassadors attending a meeting of the
Security Council on Monday applauded a new initiative by the United States to
increase funding for AIDS prevention programs and vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting, Vice President Al Gore announced that the White House was
seeking an extra $150 million this year from Congress for vaccine research and
prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   African officials, however, said more money was needed, and that wealthy
nations had an ethical imperative to give Africans access to HIV-fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is immoral that the worst affected continent has the lowest access to
care,'' said Namibia's health minister, Dr. Libertine Amathila.
</P>
<P>
	   Many patents for HIV-fighting drugs are held by Western pharmaceutical
companies, which have lobbied to block cheaper, generic versions from being
manufactured. That has kept effective yet expensive drugs such as AZT and their
generic versions out of the hands of most Africans.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabwe's health minister, Dr. Timothy Stamps, said withholding such drugs
constituted a violation of Africans' basic human rights -- the right to health.
And he questioned whether the practice was a result of sheer ignorance or a
``new form of racial discrimination, another ethnic cleansing process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stamps was similarly incredulous that the industrialized world had just
spent what he said was $600 billion to ward off the Y2K computer bug ``to
eliminate the risk of some people losing some money, some places losing some
data and some people disrupting their busy schedules.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``To some of us in the real world, this only induces a sense of wonder that
intelligent beings in the metropolitan countries can be so oblivious, so color
blind, to what has happened in the African continent over the past 15 years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   AIDS is now the leading killer in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where poverty
and wars have already taken a heavy toll. In 1998, 200,000 people died as a
result of armed conflicts in Africa, compared with 2.2 million from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 23.3 million Africans are currently infected with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   ``War fuels the epidemic,'' Dr. Peter Piot, head of the joint U.N. Program
on HIV/AIDS, told the council in its first meeting ever on a health issue. ``But
undoubtedly the epidemic itself is now ... causing social and economic crises
which in turn threaten political stability.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to U.N. statistics, $165 million was spent on AIDS prevention in
Africa in 1996, while estimates suggest that between $800 million and $2.5
billion a year is needed to mount effective prevention campaigns on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States alone spends $10 billion annually in public and private
money for AIDS research, prevention, care and treatment for the 40,000 people
infected in America every year, the U.N. Development Program says.
</P>
<P>
	   The AIDS activist group ACT-UP said the administration could save millions
of African lives if it would stop pressuring poor countries and allow them to
access generic drugs that could reduce the cost of HIV-fighting medicines by as
much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An end to these U.S. pressure campaigns would cost taxpayers nothing,''
said a statement from ACT-UP.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization's members disrupted some of Gore's presidential campaign
outings last year to protest the administration's policy on AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ACT-UP similarly criticized Gore's $150 million spending announcement as a
``drop in the funding bucket.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's appearance at the United Nations also drew some questions from
reporters about whether the vice president was merely bolstering his campaign to
be the Democratic candidate for president by announcing some new U.S.
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke scoffed at such suggestions, saying what
was announced had no direct relation to the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Prices for Mint Oil Tumble Watched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SILVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Peppermint was the answer to Tim Butler's wheat and
vegetable woes for a time. He and his brothers started growing it five years ago
to rotate with their vegetable and rye grass crops.
</P>
<P>
	   "There wasn't any money in wheat," Butler said. Currently, his 2,000-acre
farm in Oregon has 900 acres of grass seed, 500 acres of row crops and 600 acres
of peppermint. But in the last five years prices have dropped considerably.
</P>
<P>
	   When he first started in the mint business, Butler got up to $18 a pound for
his mint oil. Now, he gets around $13, barely the break-even point for many
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Buyers estimate there are still more than 5 million pounds of mint oil left
in inventory. Annual sales in the United States are typically 9 million pounds.
Excess inventory has driven spot market prices down at a time when many
contracts are up for re-negotiation.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising prices for land and production have meant Oregon growers must control
costs to compete with growing global competition. Continued weak pricing for
other crops, such as potatoes and wheat, has prompted farmers in more areas to
do the same thing as the Butlers and try mint.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon's mint industry has shifted over the years. Production that used to
be concentrated in Central Oregon and the Willamette Valley is slowly being
overtaken by production in the eastern parts of the state and eastern Washington
and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   Peppermint oil produced in Oregon is used by companies such as Wrigley's,
Procter and Gamble Co. and Colgate for chewing gum, mouthwash and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been a lot of experimentation," said Doug Walker, an oil buyer for
Salem-based Essex Laboratories. "People are growing good peppermint in a lot of
places they didn't think they could."
</P>
<P>
	   Peppermint grown in the Willamette Valley and central Oregon continues to
draw higher prices, but buyers have become more price sensitive. "Some buyers
are blending less expensive oils to simulate Willamette Valley oil," Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mint production in the Willamette Valley has dropped sharply over the years.
At its peak in the late 1970s, the valley was harvesting about 30,000 acres of
peppermint. Last year Willamette Valley growers harvested about 12,000 acres. In
northeastern Oregon, mint production during the same period jumped from less
than 3,000 acres to around 17,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   The time it will take to absorb the nation's excess mint inventory could be
hard to figure. "If you get one major user that comes out with a new product
that uses a lot of oil, that surplus could be eaten up pretty quickly," said
Steve Weddle, a district manager for oil buyer A.M. Todd.
</P>
<P>
	   He said if prices improve, more growers will plant mint contributing further
to the oversupply.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to see some strengthening of prices for some of those other crops
if mint prices are going to improve, Weddle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Butler is hanging onto his peppermint production, and has continued to ramp
up production as he rotates between crops. There may be an oversupply of
peppermint, but it's still profitable. "I don't have a crystal ball," he said.
"We hope the situation is improving, but we've been hearing that for the last
several years."

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Hear Rape Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court confronts crucial questions of federal
versus state authority in a case that asks whether rape victims can sue their
attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for a former Virginia Tech student who says she was raped by two
football players are asking the justices in arguments today to reinstate a key
provision of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``State justice systems don't treat gender-motivated violence cases as
seriously as other cases,'' one of those lawyers, Kathy Rodgers of the NOW Legal
Defense and Education Fund, said at a recent news conference. ``This statute is
about discrimination. It's about civil rights. It does not tread on state
authority.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the former football players' attorneys say a lower court properly ruled
that Congress exceeded its authority when it gave rape victims the right to sue
their alleged attackers for monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The law ``displaces state prerogative in areas of traditional state
authority,'' lawyers for one of the football players contended in court briefs.
Allowing Congress to regulate non-economic conduct would ``authorize Congress to
regulate virtually anything,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration and 36 states are siding with Christy Brzonkala
and asking the court to reinstate the federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, who have increasingly tipped the balance of power away from
the federal government and toward the states, are expected to issue a ruling by
July.
</P>
<P>
	   The court in 1995 threw out the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which
made it a crime to possess a gun near a school. The justices said the law was
insufficiently linked to interstate commerce and usurped states' authority over
such crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied heavily on that ruling when it
threw out Brzonkala's lawsuit against the two football players. The appeals
court said Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and assure all
citizens of equal protection did not authorize it to enact the portion of the
Violence Against Women Act that let rape victims sue their attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala, who has allowed use of her name, became the first person to sue
under the federal law in 1995 when she sued Antonio Morrison and James Crawford.
She alleged the two athletes raped her in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala did not report the rapes for several months, and the men were
never charged with a crime. She said she became depressed after the alleged
attack and ultimately withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
	   Now 23, Brzonkala works at a restaurant. She is pursuing a separate lawsuit
against Virginia Tech, which she says protected the two men because they were
athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala generally has avoided speaking about the case in public. But at a
news conference last week, she said, ``Rape is like having your soul torn out
... Rape is a brutal form of discrimination -- women are raped because they are
women.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Violence Against Women Act also has criminal provisions, but those are
not at issue in today's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are U.S. vs. Morrison, 99-5, and Brzonkala vs. Morrison, 99-29.

<HEADLINE> Schools Cater To Nursing Your Aura  </HEADLINE>
   By CADONNA M. PEYTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The 20 students sit in a half-circle with their eyes
closed, giggling and whispering to themselves. Again and again, they yawn in
exaggerated fashion, then make sudden, animated outbursts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He-he ha-ha!'' one student shouts, before going into another yawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The instructor, Joel Hipps, enters the room and starts his twice weekly
class. Keep releasing ``all that energy that has accumulated over the week,'' he
tells them. When you have time, he adds, ``create your sun'' and ``grow your
roses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hipps teaches at the Southern California Psychic Institute, where students
learn how to read the thoughts of others and attain a better understanding of
their own feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   In essence, through meditation, they're seeking to develop their sixth
sense.
</P>
<P>
	   There is a nationwide surge in facilities known as enlightenment schools and
metaphysical institutions that cater to cultivating your aura, mirroring the
growth in psychic hot lines and infomercials that began about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there are no definitive numbers, school administrators suggest that
the growth is geographically diverse. The Advanced Metaphysical Studies in New
York has taught hundreds -- at $275 a semester -- to develop their psychic
abilities. The College of Metaphysics teaches 400 students in Clearwater, Fla.,
and has branches in Orlando, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   The students at the school in Anaheim sit in a large plain room, with a
single seat in the middle for Hipps. Some sit on pillows for more comfort, while
others remove their shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   The yawning, laughing and other exercises can go on for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was freaky at first,'' said Rychard Powers, who initially witnessed the
warm-ups a few weeks ago when he attended an open house. ``But then you find out
what they are doing and it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hipps and his wife, Barbara, started the school four years ago after
studying and teaching at the Berkeley Psychic Institute for nearly 20 years. Two
decades ago, the schools were unheard of, Hipps said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now it's almost everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The draw?
</P>
<P>
	   ``They learn how to find their own information,'' Hipps said. ``So they
won't have to go anywhere else for the answers.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the past 25 years, more than 100,000 people have taken meditation,
healing and intuition classes at the Berkeley school. The Clairvoyant Training
Program, one of the most popular, has trained 4,000 graduates in keen insight
and perception.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people have completed similar three-hour classes at the Southern
California school, where students meet once or twice a week and pay $150 for a
six-week course.
</P>
<P>
	   Kristin Stich said it took her almost 20 years to become ready to explore
her abilities. But after her first two classes 18 months ago, she wondered what
took so long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The progress I made was amazing,'' said Stich, a 33-year-old graphic
artist. ``By the second week, I began seeing auras.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stich said she has now advanced to seeing otherworldly flashing lights and
hearing the thoughts of babies before they're born.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I also have an ability to feel other people's feelings,'' she said. ``And
as my awareness grows, I can notice it more and more.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Broadcasters Irate at FCC  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious broadcasters, aided by some lawmakers, are
mobilizing a grassroots campaign against a federal ruling they fear could lead
to a suppression of the programming they can air.
</P>
<P>
	   While the decision by the Federal Communications Commission only impacts a
limited number of noncommercial television stations, it has prompted much
broader fears among religious broadcasters that the government is trying to pass
judgment on certain types of religious programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, in deciding a license transfer last month between a public
television affiliate and a religious TV station in Pittsburgh, determined that
not all programming dealing with religious matters qualifies as educational.
</P>
<P>
	   The distinction is important, because noncommercial TV broadcasters are
eligible for special licenses that entitle them to channels reserved for
educational programing. In its ruling, the FCC defined more clearly what a
station must do to qualify as an educational programmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the commission said broadcasters must devote 50 percent of
their regularly scheduled air time to educational programs. The commission also
defined what content would count as educational.
</P>
<P>
	   Programming ``primarily devoted to religious exhortation, proselytizing or
statements of personally held religious views and beliefs generally would not
qualify as 'general educational' programming,'' the FCC ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   And in a footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify
as ``general educational'' programming. The ruling made two exceptions: If the
service was part of a historic event, such as the funeral of a national leader,
or its purpose was to serve the educational or cultural needs of a community.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision has drawn fire from religious broadcasters and lawmakers, who
argue that such distinctions are arbitrary and may reflect a bias against
religious programming. The National Religious Broadcasters sent a letter to
1,200 of their members decrying the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The order contains a disquieting implication that the government may
restrict certain strains of religious speech -- disfavoring more passionate and
emotional expressions of faith -- while not constraining others that are more
'intellectual' and drained of human emotion,'' wrote Brandt Gustavson, the
group's president.
</P>
<P>
	   The group knows of 15 religious broadcasters holding noncommercial licenses
but believes there could be as many as 90 who would have to meet the FCC
standards or possibly lose their licenses. In addition, public broadcasting
stations that hold noncommercial licenses and air religious programming will
have to meet the new FCC criteria, said Karl Stoll, spokesman for the National
Religious Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The net effect, I think, will be less preaching of the gospel, less
programming of church services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FCC, about 373 television stations hold educational reserve
licenses nationwide. The commission estimates that about 20 of these are
religious broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of religious broadcasters operate on the commercial band and are
not covered by the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the FCC action has prompted accusations by lawmakers, including
members of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, that the
commission is trying to control the broadcasters' religious expression.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The commission has no business -- no business whatsoever -- singling out
religious programming for special scrutiny,'' Republican Reps. Michael Oxley of
Ohio, Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Chip Pickering of Mississippi and Cliff Stearns
of Florida wrote in a letter to FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``The policy you have
implemented amounts to an unconstitutional restriction on religious speech. This
type of content regulation and suppression is utterly unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy was ignited after religious broadcaster Cornerstone
Television applied for the reserve license held by a PBS affiliate in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's original criteria said reserved channels had to be ``used
primarily to serve the educational needs of the community'' and for ``the
advancement of educational programs.'' But the FCC had no further guidelines for
the term ``educational.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the course of reviewing the license swap, the commission tightened its
definition.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioners Harold Furchtgott-Roth and Michael Powell dissented from
issuing the new guidelines, saying it could open a ``Pandora's Box of problems
that will create confusion and litigation.'' But two other commissioners and
Kennard said the additional guidance would help the FCC enforce its rules.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors seek to draw direct link between bombings and U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A U.S. citizen who served as a messenger for Osama bin
Laden before the deadly bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 would
continue to communicate with terrorists if he were freed on bail, a prosecutor
says.
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald argued at a bail hearing Monday
that Wadih El Hage is "angry at the government" and would be motivated to pass
information along to bin Laden if he were given the chance.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand rejected the bail request after Fitzgerald
said that the Arlington, Texas, resident knows a lot about what the government
has learned about bin Laden because he sees evidence as he assists his lawyers
in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say El Hage once served as personal secretary to bin Laden, who
is among 17 men indicted along with El Hage in a conspiracy to attack Americans
in the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge agreed that El Hage still poses a danger to society and might
flee.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his argument against bail, Fitzgerald cited evidence that for the
first time tried to publicly link El Hage directly to the bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitzgerald said the government had offered proof in court papers that El
Hage returned to Texas in 1997 from a trip abroad and brought with him new
terrorism directives from bin Laden's group that made clear the organization's
violent objectives, especially in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ultimate results were the bombings which occurred in August 1998,"
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor said El Hage's role as a communicator in bin Laden's group
made it likely that, if freed on bail, he would try to tell the group the extent
of the government's knowledge of their activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge himself noted that if one agrees there is a "state of war between
the forces aligned with bin Laden and the United States," then obviously each
side would strive to learn of the other's plans.
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge also cited a more personal experience as he challenged El
Hage's lawyer to prove his client was not a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge noted the day last June when El Hage leaped over a railing and
charged toward him, getting within several feet before he was tackled by U.S.
marshals.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Schmidt, El Hage's lawyer, told the judge that his client offered no
resistance as marshals handcuffed him against a wall about 8 to 10 feet from
where the judge sat.
</P>
<P>
	   "No resistance?" the judge asked, clearly miffed by Schmidt's recollection.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was placed down and held," Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Were you in court that day? Is it your position Mr. Hage was not resisting
when he was held by the marshals over here?" the judge asked, pointing to the
corner of the courtroom nearest him, where several marshals had worked to hold
the agitated El Hage.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's my position," Schmidt answered.
</P>
<P>
	   "Very well, proceed," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt told the judge that prosecutors had failed in court papers to cite
"a single thing" that showed El Hage posed a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt asked for another hearing so prosecutors could call witnesses and
prove El Hage was a threat, but the judge rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge did agree, however, to require everyone responsible for El Hage's
prison conditions to consider ways his detention could be made more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   He also granted a request by prosecutors to allow a psychiatrist chosen by
the government to evaluate El Hage after the defendant's lawyers presented a
report by a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist that concluded El Hage may be
too damaged from solitary confinement to assist in his defense.
</P>
<P>
	   El Hage has been in solitary confinement for most of his time at a Manhattan
prison adjacent to the courthouse. Recently, he was given a roommate, though his
lawyer said he would prefer to be alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge agreed that El Hage should be permitted an extra few minutes
during his three monthly telephone calls home because of the size of his family.
He has seven children.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also told the warden for the Metropolitan Correctional Center that
the prison should consider providing El Hage with a plastic chair to sit on as
he reads thousands of pages of documents related to his case. He encouraged
everyone to see whether there were ways to "make the conditions of confinement
less onerous."

<HEADLINE> Senate, Assembly approve 20-year police retirement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate and Assembly simultaneously approved a
bill Monday to allow police officers and paid firefighters to retire with
pensions after 20 years and to give pensions to survivors whose spouses die
while off-duty.
<P>
	   Currently, municipal and city police officers and firefighters qualify for
retirement benefits after 25 years, and the survivors of deceased police
officers or firefighters receive a standard, lump-sum payment as life insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval of expanded benefits came despite opposition from municipal
officials who fear millions in higher costs because of the contributions they
have to make to the pension system.
</P>
<P>
	   William Dressel, director of the state League of Municipalities, called the
vote a major disappointment to his group but a triumph for police unions to
force a vote in both houses on the last day of the legislative session. He said
unions applied "incredible pressure to get this done."
</P>
<P>
	   The enhanced pension benefits were unanimously opposed by the state's
Pension and Health Benefits Review Commission, an advisory panel that counts
among its members Treasurer Roland Machold and Personnel Commissioner Janice
Mintz.
</P>
<P>
	   But advocates of the proposal said state estimates of a $52 million annual
cost were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, one sponsor, Sen. Diane Allen, R-Burlington, claimed during floor
debate that features of the bill permitting changes in how the pension system's
assets are used should allow municipal governments to avoid any higher costs.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not clear if the opposition from Machold and the pension commission
will translate into a veto from Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been some amendments. We are trying to get a handle on how
costly they are," said Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   The bills, S-1742 and A-2328, would require the pension fund to have $338
million more than is now available in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Machold's office concluded that plugging this hole would require annual
payments starting at $52 million, $39 million of it from municipal governments
and $13 million from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The costliest benefit, paying pensions to widows and widowers, would require
increased annual payments of $27 million into the pension system from cities and
towns, treasury officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   But bill sponsors and the Office of Legislative Services said steady growth
in the pension funds' Wall Street holdings may add enough value to offset any
need for higher payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, local police officers and paid firefighters can retire
after 25 years with an annual pension payment set at 65 percent of their highest
annual salary. If they wait until 30 years to retire, the pension is set at 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would allow retirement at 20 years with pension set at 50 percent
of salary.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, when police and firefighters die before retirement from
illness or an off-duty accident, spouses get a lump sum payment equal to 3 1/2
years' salary. The widow or widower of a police officer earning $50,000 a year
would receive $175,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill proposes giving spouses a lifetime pension at 50 percent of salary.
State troopers' families have this benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   One sponsor, Assemblyman John Kelly, R-Essex, said he kept the bill simple
by matching state police benefits. He said the 20-year retirement benefit would
not add cost nor would it trigger an exodus from the ranks, noting that few
troopers take advantage of early retirement.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Resists Voter Group  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For three years after leaving the Senate, Bill Bradley
lent his name to a voter-education group that asks federal and state candidates
to fill out a lengthy multiple-choice survey on issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, as a candidate for president, Bradley has the chance to fill out
Project Vote Smart's ``National Political Awareness Test'' himself. But to the
dismay of the nonpartisan group, Bradley is resisting. His campaign says the
test's multiple-choice format is too confining and leaves little room for
substance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also has declined to
complete the questionnaire on similar grounds. Republican George W. Bush and
Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan also have turned down the group's
entreaties.
</P>
<P>
	   Given his past affiliation with the group, it is Bradley's stance that has
most frustrated officials at Project Vote Smart's Montana headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The quandary we have with Senator Bradley,'' said board president Richard
Kimball, ``is that he reviewed it and approved it for other candidates, but did
not take it himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Tony Wyche said Bradley's campaign has made numerous attempts to
satisfy Project Vote Smart with written summaries of positions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've tried a couple different ways to make it happen,'' Wyche said.
``We've sent them fact sheets. We're hoping to find a way to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Project Vote Smart asks candidates to place a checkmark next to statements
that reflect their views on a range of issues. On education, for example, the
2000 presidential test presents 14 statements, such as ``support mandatory
teacher testing and reward teachers with merit pay,'' and asks candidates to
check all that apply.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization argues that a multiple-choice format gives voters a
side-by-side comparison of candidate positions. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee for president in 1988 and now a member of Project Vote Smart's board,
said candidates who feel confined by a multiple-choice question should check a
box, ``then star it and put some kind of addendum or appendix and explain your
position.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Project Vote Smart will release test results from more than 100
major and minor party presidential candidates. They must answer at least 70
percent of the questions to get a passing grade. The candidates' answers also
will be released.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the group's Web site only notes whether a candidate has answered
the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Sens. Orrin Hatch and John McCain
have done so. Bradley, Gore, Bush, Buchanan and Republican Alan Keyes have not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is probably the worst performing group of front-runners, by a long
shot, since 1990'' when the group began, Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by 40 leaders including former presidents Ford and Carter, Project
Vote Smart always has encountered some resistance to its issues test.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, only about 60 percent of congressional candidates got passing
grades. President Clinton and Republicans Buchanan and Forbes were among the
big-name presidential candidates who declined to fill out questionnaires in
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley is a unique case. Though he submitted his resignation last
month, his name and picture still appear on Project Vote Smart's Web site under
``founders.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group invited Bradley to join its board in 1996 as he prepared to leave
the Senate. He wrote back that he would be ``honored to support your efforts to
strengthen representative democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a board member, Bradley received periodic reports on Project Vote Smart
programs and annual budgets, as well as draft National Political Awareness
Tests. His silence always was interpreted as approval of the group's work,
Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Project Vote Smart supporters reached out to Bradley as a
candidate, encouraging him to fill out the questionnaire. During those
discussions, Bradley's staff learned he was still considered a member of the
Vote Smart board.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 7, Bradley wrote to the group that when he became a candidate for
president, ``I made an effort to resign from all the boards on which I sat. If
you do not believe that that has happened with Project Vote Smart's current
board, then please now consider this to be my resignation.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Recess With No Accord  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Israeli and Syrian delegates have returned home
for consultations with their governments ahead of another round of
land-for-peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks recessed on Monday without agreement on new borders or any other
major elements of a treaty still eluding them despite rigorous American
mediation.
</P>
<P>
	   After eight days of talks, there was no change in the Syrian or Israeli
stand on the borders issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria insists on a pullback to the June 4, 1967, border. Israel has not
specified exactly how much land it will give and Israeli leaders have rejected
Syria's withdrawal demand.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the delegates will hold consultations in Damascus before returning Jan. 19
for the third round of negotiations since mid-December.
</P>
<P>
	   As the two delegations packed to go home, State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin confirmed the border issue has not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we are working on it, and work will hopefully continue at the
resumption of the talks,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are on the right track,'' he said, without giving any indication on how
the gaps might be closed quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, other tough issues were not resolved in the talks, including
peace terms, division of scarce water and security measures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to declare that a major obstacle has been overcome in any of
the particular areas,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who intervened in the negotiations, some 70 miles from
the capital, for parts of five days and nights, is likely to play an active role
in the next round as well.
</P>
<P>
	   But complicating his schedule is the visit of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Jan. 20, a day after Israeli and Syrian negotiations reconvene.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has pledged to push for the outline of a final settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians by mid-February. Last week, the two sides
broke a deadlock on a partial Israeli pullback on the West Bank, but they are
only beginning to grapple with far tougher issues, including Palestinian demands
for a state with part of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic shape of an Israeli-Syrian treaty has been clear since Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office in July. Israel would surrender virtually
all the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau on the Syrian frontier, for peace,
provided security measures are found to take the place of the high ground Israel
has held since the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria insists on a pullback to the Sea of Galilee, thereby letting it
recover a stretch of land it captured in the 1950s. Another scenario would push
Israel back to borders set in 1923. Or patches of land might be swapped. But
Barak has not specified what line he wants drawn between Israel and an Arab
country with which Israel has fought three major wars.

<HEADLINE> Plan Sidesteps Agency Consolidation  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocacy groups are criticizing the Clinton
administration for writing a plan for improving food safety without proposing to
consolidate the dozen agencies that now have some responsibility for the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft strategic plan released recently by the President's Food Safety
Council instead offered several consolidation alternatives for discussion at a
public hearing Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The council, which is made up of officials from the agencies, ``seems to be
designed to fend off efforts to get a single food safety agency,'' Caroline
Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said Monday. ``The
council is comprised of exactly the people whose ox would be gored if an
independent agency were to be formed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, which is dated Friday, says the agencies responsible for various
food safety issues, ``have developed different systems for protecting the food
supply, and bring different strengths and shortcomings to the current system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan also lays out a series of general goals in risk assessment,
management and public communication.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The overarching goal of the plan is to improve public health by improving
the safety of the food supply,'' said Catherine Woteki, the Agriculture
Department's undersecretary of food safety. ``The council is now asking for
public comment for what organizational options would further our ability to
achieve those goals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Academy of Sciences in 1998 urged Congress to ``establish a
unified, central framework for managing food safety programs'' headed by a
single person.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Tucker Foreman of Consumer Federation of America also criticized the
plan for failing to propose specific goals for cutting cases of salmonella and
other pathogens.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Food Processors Association, which represents the food
industry, applauded the plan. ``What is needed is a single food safety policy,
rather than the creation of a single food agency,'' the group said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Most food safety responsibilities are handled by the Agriculture Department,
which is in charge of meat, poultry and eggs and some issues involving fresh
produce, and the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees other foods. But
agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, Commerce Department and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have a role.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Visits Britain  </HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister has faced egg-hurling protesters in
London and sharp criticism in Tehran over his two-day trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Kamal Kharrazi, the first Iranian Cabinet official to visit Britain
since the 1979 Islamic revolution, was scheduled to address the Royal Institute
of International Affairs before meeting business leaders to bolster trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharrazi on Monday shrugged off the protests by Iranian exiles, who hurled
eggs and paint at his limousine as he drove to a meeting with Prime Minister
Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   British Jews also held a vigil near Blair's Downing Street residence to
demand the release of 13 Iranian Jews arrested on spying charges a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranian communists yelled criticism outside the residence of British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, with whom Kharrazi held talks and dined Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the legitimate right of people who are not involved in terrorist
activities to express themselves,'' Kharrazi said at a joint news conference
with Cook.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said his ministry, heavily criticized by anti-Western protesters in
Tehran for accepting the British invitation, was paying a heavy price for the
London visit.
</P>
<P>
	   British officials said that, while they raised human rights issues in talks,
their main hope in bringing Kharrazi to London was that the trip would bolster
moderate elements in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, including in the United States, have said the invitation was given
prematurely because Iran continues to denounce Israel, criticize Middle East
peace talks and support Islamic extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty International said the Blair administration should encourage human
rights reforms in Iran, ``but should register sharp concern at the use of
special courts to hand down long sentences against some journalists and
newspaper owners.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said one protester was arrested during Monday's egg throwing
demonstration and charged with causing damage. The National Council of
Resistance in Iran, an exile group, claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain and Iran exchanged ambassadors in May for the first time since 1979.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 130, Nuggets 95  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 31 points, 19 rebounds and nine
assists, and Kobe Bryant scored 30 points Monday night as the Los Angeles Lakers
routed Denver 130-95 to run their winning streak to 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory avenged one of the Lakers' five losses this season -- a 93-82
defeat at Denver on Nov. 18, when Bryant was sidelined by a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers' 30-5 record is the NBA's best and they are on their longest
winning streak since 1990-91, when they won 16 straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant, who finished 12-of-18 from the floor, made his first eight shots and
scored 17 points as the Lakers rolled up a 43-18 first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
	   They were in clear control the rest of the way as they cruised to their
biggest margin of victory this season. It also was Denver's worst loss.
</P>
<P>
	   With Michael Jordan watching from a luxury suite, Bryant not only was
7-for-7 from the floor in the first quarter, he also provided enough spectacular
shots for a highlight film, spinning 180 degrees for a backward slam, sinking a
12-foot fallaway jumper when his body seemed almost parallel to the floor, and
hitting a 3-pointer with a defender all over him.
</P>
<P>
	   He finally missed for the first time midway through the second quarter, when
he was off on a follow of Travis Knight's miss. Bryant still scored 10 points in
the second quarter, including hitting a 34-footer that just beat the shot clock,
with five seconds remaining before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess led the Nuggets with 23 points, Ron Mercer had 18 and former
Lakers guard Nick Van Exel 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles led 72-47 at halftime and 107-76 after three.
</P>
<P>
	   After playing four games in a five-day stretch that ended Saturday night
with a come-from-behind win in Seattle, the Lakers looked well-rested against
the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   The blowout came after Los Angeles was pressed to keep the win streak going,
rallying from a 19-point deficit to beat Seattle 110-100 after coming from 13
points down to beat Charlotte 87-83 a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Since their loss at Denver on Nov. 18, the Lakers have won 23 of 25. Denver
is 14-11 since, counting the loss in the rematch.

<HEADLINE> Schools Leaving Big West Conference  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- New Mexico State University and the University of
North Texas are leaving the Big West Conference this year, one year before the
two schools were scheduled to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The schools' football teams will still play in the conference, but all other
sports will leave for the 2000-01 season to play in the Sun Belt Conference, Big
West Conference Council officials announced.
</P>
<P>
	   The two schools were supposed to leave beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. William Conroy, New Mexico State's president, and North Texas President
Dr. Alfred Hurley requested early withdrawal from the Big West, conference
officials said in a statement released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Board of Directors would need to give the plan final approval. Their
meeting will be held in a couple of weeks, Big West officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico State and North Texas will be classified as associate members of
the Big West Conference for the upcoming football season.
</P>
<P>
	   Four other teams will play football for the conference in the next season:
Arkansas State, also an associate member; Boise State, Idaho and Utah State.
</P>
<P>
	   With the two teams' departure for other sports, the Big West will have nine
full members for the 2000-2001 season: Boise State, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
Cal State-Fullerton, Long Beach State, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, Idaho,
Pacific and Utah State.

<HEADLINE> Nilsson Talking to Japanese Team  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN WALKER AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Free agent catcher Dave Nilsson, hoping to play for his native Australia in
the upcoming Sydney Olympics, is talking to a Japanese team about a contract for
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chunichi Dragons are "interested" in Nilsson and negotiating with his
agent, team spokesman Toshiro Ashiki said Tuesday. Ashiki said it was too early
to say when there could be a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson, 30, hit .309 with 21 home runs and 62 RBIs for the Milwaukee
Brewers last year and was a member of the NL All-Star team. He missed September
because of a broken right thumb.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally, a left-handed hitting catcher with power would attract attention
from most major league teams. But with Nilsson aiming at this year's Olympics --
the Games start in September, in the middle of the pennant race -- he has not
received any big offers.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson is a lifetime .284 hitter with 105 homers. He has spent his entire
eight-year career with Milwaukee, and received a standing ovation from Brewers
fans when he took his final at-bat at County Stadium in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson made it clear he wanted to play in the Olympics, and became a free
agent after the season. This is the first time American professional teams will
let players compete in the Olympics, but clubs are not expected to permit their
top stars take part.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Nilsson played for Australia's national team in an
international tournament. Last year, he bought the Australian Baseball League, a
professional circuit that plays games from October to February.
</P>
<P>
	   Nilsson also has played outfield and first base since making his major
league debut in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Chunichi, champions of the Central League, is searching for a big hitter in
case first baseman Takeshi Yamasaki does not recover quickly. He broke his left
wrist last September.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 107, Mavericks 94  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Scottie Pippen had 17 points, including three 3-point
baskets in the decisive third quarter, to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a
107-94 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers led 52-51 early in the third when Pippen hit his first 3-pointer
from the corner. Pippen hit two more long shots during the next three minutes as
the Blazers went on an 18-8 run from which the Mavericks didn't recover.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon Stoudamire and Detlef Schrempf also scored 17 points for Portland,
which has won 15 of its last 16 games against the Mavericks. Schrempf had 14
points in the fourth, when the Blazers took an 18-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 19 points and Cedric Ceballos added 18 points
and 11 rebounds. Rookie guard Damon Jones made four of his five 3-point baskets
in the fourth quarter, finishing with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers took a one-point lead at halftime, before pulling away in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Pippen, Stoudamire and Rasheed Wallace turned up the intensity at both ends
of the floor. Stoudamire scored 10 points in the third and also had a pair of
steals, while Pippen and Wallace each scored nine points. Pippen also had two
assists and a steal during Portland's run.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers led 78-67 entering the fourth, when their reserves took over.
The Mavericks closed the margin to seven points early in the fourth, but
Schrempf responded with two quick baskets and the rout was on. Later, Schrempf
made a pair of 3-point baskets.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones had three points entering the fourth, but got hot from 3-point range
when the outcome was settled. He made five of his six 3-point attempts in 24
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowitzki's shooting kept the Mavericks close in the first half. The
Mavericks trailed 38-30 when Nowitzki scored six points during a 10-0 run that
put them ahead 40-38 with 3:05 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Grant made two 15-foot jumpers late in the quarter to put the Blazers
ahead 46-45 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> UConn Women No. 1 in AP Poll  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Connecticut already has an outstanding women's basketball team. Now comes
the bad news for the rest of the country: The No. 1-ranked Huskies are likely to
get even better.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn has been winning lately without any help from Tamika Williams, the
team's third-leading scorer last season. Williams missed four games because of a
stress fracture in her left foot and played only a couple of minutes in the last
three, including Saturday's 74-67 victory at No. 2 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   Her return will only add to the Huskies' depth and talent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're pretty good," said Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, whose
team was a unanimous choice for No. 1 in Monday's voting. "I think we've got
people playing about as well as we would like for them to play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly, when Tamika is 100 percent later in the season, we'll be a lot
better off," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory at Tennessee showed off a physical side to the Huskies (12-0)
that wasn't always evident in the past. When Tennessee pushed, Connecticut
pushed back. The Tennessee players did not intimidate the Huskies, nor did the
crowd of nearly 21,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the toughest team mentally and physically that I've played for at
Connecticut," junior Shea Ralph said. "It's part of our game now. It's part of
who we are. This is the way we're going to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut wasn't always so tough last season, when it was a team of
talented but sometimes timid freshmen and sophomores. Those players have grown
up this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think people understand sometimes that we are big and strong in our
own right," Auriemma said. "We aren't just a bunch of girls who run around and
shoot jump shots."
</P>
<P>
	   Though Connecticut has led the poll all season, this was the first time it
received all 45 first-place votes from the national media panel. The Huskies'
1,125 points were 68 more than Tennessee, which held on at No. 2, just ahead of
North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
	   The last unanimous No. 1 was Tennessee in the 1998-99 preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee beat two Top 25 teams last week, Old Dominion and LSU, by wide
margins before losing to Connecticut. The Lady Vols finished 12 points ahead of
North Carolina State (14-0) in the voting. Louisiana Tech (10-2) stayed at No.
4.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State (12-2), which has won eight straight since a Dec. 5 loss to
Connecticut, climbed one spot to fifth and Notre Dame jumped two places to
sixth. Georgia remained seventh and was followed by Iowa State, Rutgers and
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn dropped five places after a 71-69 loss to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke, which has a 13-game winning streak, went from 14th to 11th. Then it
was Illinois, Tulane and UCLA, followed by North Carolina, Texas Tech, LSU,
Purdue, UC Santa Barbara and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas, Old Dominion, Oregon, Mississippi State and Boston College held the
final five places.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no newcomers. Arkansas State, which had been tied with Boston
College for 25th, fell out of the poll despite winning both its games during the
past week, against Western Kentucky and Arkansas-Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   The ranking last week was the first in school history for Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
	   Tulane (14-0), the third team still unbeaten, climbed from 19th to 13th for
the biggest jump in the poll. Purdue's fall from 12th to 18th was the biggest
drop. Losses to Penn State and Michigan gave the Boilermakers three in the last
four games.

<HEADLINE> College Bkb Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By DONNA TOMMELLEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jake Voskuhl got the early edge on fellow Texan
Chris Mihm in the matchup of big men.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 5 UConn got 21 points from Albert Mouring and a strong showing in the
post from Voskuhl and reserve center Souleymane Wane to beat the No. 15
Longhorns 77-67 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was frustrating. I couldn't even see the other guy coming, and by the
time I got into my shot, he was right there," Mihm said of Connecticut's inside
defense. "Jake did a great job of really fighting me out there and making it
hard to get the ball. I couldn't get into an offensive groove."
</P>
<P>
	   Voskuhl, the 6-foot-11 center from Katy, Texas, had 11 rebounds. He and Wane
helped neutralize the 7-foot Mihm and combined for four blocks and 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies finished with 11 blocked shots in Monday night's only game
involving a Top 25 team.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we couldn't do this last year," UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. "We
wouldn't block 10 shots against anybody. Two centers had 18 rebounds between
them. Souleymane's a much improved player. Jake's improved."
</P>
<P>
	   The win also marked the seventh straight double-digit game for Mouring, the
Huskies' 3-point specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was the second terrific game for Albert Mouring," Calhoun said,
referring to his career-high 22 against Pittsburgh and 21 against Texas. "He's
starting to feel more confidence in himself. The past six or seven games he's
been very consistent for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Calhoun also credited Mouring's ball-handling.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did more than just make points," Calhoun said. "He took some pressure
off Khalid El-Amin."
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin said he met with Mouring last week and had a heart-to-heart talk
with him.
</P>
<P>
	   "The day before the Pittsburgh game I told Albert I wanted to talk to him,"
El-Amin said of last Saturday's road victory. "I told him there was no way we
could do it without him. We needed him to shoot so people couldn't play a
box-and-1 on me or a zone against us. He's too good a shooter for that."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the talk, Mouring has gone 9-for-11 from 3-point range, and that
included making his first five against Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies (12-2) had won 11 straight games until losing to Notre Dame,
which played almost all zone, last week. Mouring's shooting seemed to relax the
Huskies in the first game in the Hartford Civic Center since then and helped
them to a 56-39 lead with 12:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Mouring's fifth 3 in as many attempts gave the Huskies their biggest lead in
the very physical game that featured a lot of whistles and little action, and it
seemed they would coast to the win.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Longhorns (9-4) went on a 15-3 run as Connecticut scored once in 11
possessions. They closed to 59-54 with 4:46 left on two free throws by Ivan
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when El-Amin, who led Connecticut to the national championship last
season, took over and was responsible for scores on the next three possessions.
</P>
<P>
	   He found freshman Tony Robertson on the break for a layup that made it
61-54. After Mihm scored for Texas, El-Amin and Voskuhl worked a nice
screen-and-roll play that saw the big man dunk for a 63-56 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas again answered on a hook shot by Mihm, but El-Amin extended the lead
by working the same screen-and-roll with Voskuhl. This time, the guard didn't
pass to the center and instead nailed a 3-pointer for a 66-58 lead with 3:01 to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Khalid was terrific," Calhoun said. "That's what he does for us. Teams
can't play him straight up or they get hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns closed to 71-67 on a 3-pointer by Wagner with 25 seconds left,
but Mouring and Edmund Saunders each made two free throws and Saunders scored on
a layup after a steal by El-Amin for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin had 14 points and eight assists. Voskuhl had nine points and 11
rebounds in his matchup with Mihm, which drew 22 NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, including eight points in the
final six minutes. Gabe Muoneke and Darren Kelly each added 12 points for Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas, which shot 33 percent (24-for-72), really hurt itself at the
free-throw line, going 13-for-25 as it had a three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   "They made some great defensive plays. I don't think there's anything wrong
with getting your shots blocked. The difference was when they had to make the
3s, they made them," Texas coach Rick Barnes said. "You dig yourself a hole when
you miss free throws, and it puts a lot of pressure on your offense."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut shot 44 percent (24-for-54), and led by Mouring's 5-for-6, went
6-for-10 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes and Calhoun went against each other 14 times when Barnes was coaching
at Providence, and those games were known for their physical style and emphasis
on defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "A couple of times, I thought I looked up and saw Michael Smith and Dickey
Simpkins and those guys," Calhoun said, referring to the former Providence
rebounding specialists. "It seemed like an old Big East battle for sure."

<HEADLINE> 1st Amendment No Shield for Rocker  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The First Amendment guarantees Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker the right
to free speech. What it doesn't give him is the right to be a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing after he was quoted in a
magazine denigrating blacks, foreigners and gays. Commissioner Bud Selig is
waiting for those test results before deciding whether to suspend or fine the
25-year-old left-hander.
</P>
<P>
	   While few support Rocker's opinions, some have defended his right to express
them based on the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. But the First
Amendment -- "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech" --
won't help Rocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Its message, honed over two centuries, is that while the government can't
stop you from speaking your mind, the Constitution provides no shield in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "The First Amendment only applies to state action. This isn't state action,"
said Harvard Law School professor Paul Weiler, who's planning to place Rocker
alongside former Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott in the next edition of his
casebook. "In terms of the law, his prospects are not great."
</P>
<P>
	   That's why private golf clubs are still allowed to discriminate in ways that
a public one could not. And that's why Rocker might be immune if he was a
pitcher at a public university, or a boxer licensed by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   In major league baseball, though, he's fair game.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker saved 38 games for the Braves last year. But he created a personal
rivalry with the city of New York during the NL Championship Series, calling
Mets fans "stupid" and accusing them of throwing batteries and insulting his
mother.
</P>
<P>
	   He went even further in a Sports Illustrated article last month, saying he
would never play for a New York team because he didn't want to ride a train
"next to some queer with AIDS." He bashed immigrants, saying "How the hell did
they get in this country?" He also called a black teammate a "fat monkey," spit
on a toll machine and mocked Asian women.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker later apologized and said he is not racist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Major League Agreement gives the commissioner the power to punish any
act considered "to be not in the best interests of the game of baseball." Other
commissioners have similar best-interests powers; some, such as those in the
NHL, NBA and PGA, also have the specific authority to punish players or
employees for speech detrimental to the league or sport.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the First Amendment couldn't protect Denver Nuggets guard Mahmoud
Abdul-Rauf when he refused to stand for the "Star-Spangled Banner," saying that
to do so would conflict with his Muslim beliefs. NBA rules required every player
to "stand respectfully" during the national anthem, and Abdul-Rauf eventually
found a way to do so without compromising his beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   And that's why the First Amendment couldn't protect Schott, suspended from
baseball for racist comments about blacks and Jews. Or then-Miami Dolphins
linebacker Bryan Cox, who was fined for making an obscene gesture at Buffalo
fans after enduring what he said was racial abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   And that's why the First Amendment won't protect Rocker, either, though the
collective bargaining agreement can send the matter to an independent
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
	   As the great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote: "A policeman may have
a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to
be a policeman."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 years later, the kernel of truth remains.
</P>
<P>
	   No one can lock Rocker up for saying what he wants. But the fans can refuse
to go to his games, and -- if that concerns them -- teams can refuse to sign him
and the league can ban him or take any other action the commissioner deems to be
in the best interest of baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   A baseball player may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he
has no constitutional right to be a baseball player.

<HEADLINE> Sele Spurns Orioles For Mariners  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   This was a curveball the Seattle Mariners weren't expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   His deal with Baltimore coming apart over his physical, Aaron Sele quickly
agreed Monday night on a $15 million, two-year contract with the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
	   "This thing is like a star falling out of the sky," new Mariners general
manager Pat Gillick said. "We're satisfied Sele is as healthy as he was when he
finished the season with the Rangers. He underwent a physical on behalf of us
with another physician, and our physician talked with that doctor and is
satisfied."
</P>
<P>
	   Sele, a 29-year-old right-hander with one of baseball's best curves, reached
a tentative agreement last Friday on a $29 million, four-year contract with the
Orioles, a deal that contained $8 million in payments deferred without interest.
</P>
<P>
	   But that agreement was subject to his passing a physical, and the contract
was never completed. The Orioles considered changes after the medical tests and
were still talking to Sele's agents on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the pitcher who lives in Kirkland, Wash., turned his
attention to the Mariners, one of baseball's busiest teams this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle spent much of the offseason considering trades for Ken Griffey Jr.,
but now seems likely to keep him. He is eligible for free agency after the
season, and the Mariners considered deals so they wouldn't wind up losing him
for nothing next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, having already signed free agents John Olerud, Arthur Rhodes, Mark
McLemore, Stan Javier and Japanese reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki, Gillick and the
Mariners might be sending Griffey a message that they are trying to win now.

	   "We do mean business and we do want to be competitive," Gillick said. "As we
all know, the Yankees and Cleveland are the cream of the crop in the American
League. But you never know what happens. If you win your division and get in the
playoffs, you never know what happens."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillick -- a former GM for Baltimore owner Peter Angelos -- began talks
after Adam Katz, one of Sele's agents, called him Monday. Just 6 1/2 hours later
-- after discussions over deals of two years, two years and an option, two years
and two options, and three years -- he completed negotiations to get Sele, who
went to Washington State.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract calls for a $1 million signing bonus and annual salaries of $7
million, with none of the money deferred.
</P>
<P>
	   According to another of Sele's agents, Tom Reich, there was a difference on
interpretation with the Orioles on medical tests. Sele has never undergone arm
surgery but was limited to six starts in 1995 because of shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dealing with Baltimore were very cordial from beginning to end and just
didn't work out," Reich said. "To me, Peter Angelos is a good guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Angelos did not return a telephone call seeking comment. After the 1998
season, the Orioles reached a $2.7 million, two-year agreement with reliever
Xavier Hernandez, but the deal came undone when the Orioles said he had a
shoulder injury. He then signed a $250,000 agreement with the Astros and won $2
million in a grievance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillick said Sele had a new physical Monday in California -- with Angels
physician Dr. Lewis Yocum, according to one source -- while negotiations were
taking place by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is going to be normal wear and tear," Gillick said. "You really have
to rely on your medical people. They know which bumps along the road you have to
watch for and which you can work through."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners, third in the AL West last season at 79-83, head into spring
training with perhaps the top starting rotation in their division, a group that
includes Jamie Moyer, John Halama and Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great talk in the winter," Gillick said. "You have to do it on the
field."
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle tried to sign Chuck Finley, wanting a left-hander who could beat the
best AL teams, but the Indians got him for $27 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the Mariners were just 1-9 against New York, 3-7 against
Cleveland and 5-8 against Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Sele was 18-9 with a 4.79 ERA with the Texas Rangers last year after going
19-11 with a 4.23 ERA in 1998. In his two years with Texas, Sele missed only one
start, and that was because of flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent the first five years of his major league career with the Boston Red
Sox and has a 75-53 career record.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a business where timing is very important. You only have a
very small window," Gillick said. "You have to react very quickly. Those who
hesitate, as they say, are lost."

<HEADLINE> $2.7B Sought for Health Programs  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is touting a $2.7 billion
administration plan aimed at getting millions of uninsured children health
coverage, a problem that has emerged as major issue in this year's presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is asking Congress for the money today to fund the
five-year effort to boost enrollment in federal health programs for children by
making it easier to sign up kids who are eligible for coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, campaigning in Iowa, planned to release a new report showing that 2
million children already have been enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance
Program, called CHIP, double the enrollment last year.
</P>
<P>
	   How to get insurance for 44 million Americans who don't have it has emerged
as the most significant point of debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore wants to expand CHIPS and Medicaid, a free insurance program for the
poor. Bradley has proposed scrapping both and instead giving poor families
subsidies to buy coverage through the federal workers' insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would make it easier for children in the federal school lunch
program to enroll in health plans and would allow child-care centers, homeless
shelters and welfare offices to enroll children immediately. It also would
require many states to simplify Medicaid application forms and let more 19- and
20-year-olds into the programs.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 11 million uninsured children in the United States, although more
than a third are eligible for Medicaid or for CHIP, which helps children whose
families earn too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative, which will be part of Clinton's 2001 budget request to
Congress next month, would build on these existing programs. It is much like
Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the new budget proposal would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow school lunch programs, which also serve low-income children, to
share information with Medicaid officials. A recent study found that almost 4
million uninsured children are in the lunch program, making it a prime place to
find them.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow child care centers, homeless shelters and welfare offices to enroll
kids right away while their applications for health coverage are being
processed.
</P>
<P>
	   --Require states that have simple CHIP applications also use simpler
applications for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   The problems of enrolling in Medicaid were highlighted in a new study
released today that shows many low-income parents whose kids are eligible for
Medicaid don't sign them up because they can't navigate through the complex
application process.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents say the process is too complex and want easier ways to sign up, such
as over the phone or after hours at schools or day care centers, according to
the study of 1,335 low-income parents by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and
the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   The study showed that two-thirds of the parents who have uninsured but
eligible kids have tried to enroll their children and over half of them were
unsuccessful because they found the process too difficult and gave up or because
they were denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Over half the parents surveyed said they'd be more likely to sign up if they
could do it after work or on weekends, automatically enroll kids in Medicaid
when they signed up for school lunch programs or sign up at more convenient
locations such as doctor's offices, clinics, schools or day care centers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they say is that they are working parents and the process is so
complicated and cumbersome, it requires them to go to enroll at places that are
not close to where they work or are not open when they can go,'' said Diane
Rowland, executive director at the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore wants to expand CHIPS to include children in families with higher
incomes and some parents. The White House is considering making a similar budget
request, but no decision has been made, a White House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new report notes that states are letting more children into the program
than the first year. Federal law allows into the program children whose
families' incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about
$33,000 for a family of four. Some states set the limit lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In March 1997, just four states covered youngsters up to 200 percent of
poverty. Today, 30 states are doing so or plan to.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Unveil Colombia Aid Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has decided on a two-year, $1.2 billion
aid program to help Colombia combat narcotrafficking, revitalize a moribund
economy and carry out a series of judicial and other reforms, an administration
official says.
</P>
<P>
	   The new program, fashioned by an interagency task force, was expected to be
made public today, said the official, who spoke Monday only on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   With coca production at record levels despite an ambitious eradication
program, Colombia has quickly emerged as the No. 1 priority for the Clinton
administration in Latin America. Assistance for the current fiscal year totals
about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the sense of urgency is the continuing failure of the Colombian
government to make headway in its war against a leftist insurgency that often
works in tandem with the country's drug lords.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid proposal reflects the close ties the administration has maintained
with Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who said in September the nation would
need $3.5 billion in outside assistance to confront its myriad problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Hill Republicans generally are eager to assist Colombia in its
struggle but they may have differences with the administration over how the
money should be spent.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP favors spending on counternarcotics activities while the
administration prefers that the spending be spread out over a range of programs,
consistent with the view of the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana believes no counternarcotics program is viable unless Colombian
farmers are given the opportunity to produce alternatives to narcotics plants,
such as coca.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal has funds earmarked for that purpose, the administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
	   There also will be money for protection of human rights workers and the
training of judges and prosecutors as part of an ambitious judicial reform
program. Steps also will be taken to revitalize the country's plummeting
economy, now in its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration welcomed the accession of Pastrana in August 1998 after
four years of unproductive ties when Ernesto Samper was president. He was
stripped of his U.S. visa because of suspicions of involvement with
narcotraffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials see Pastrana as a breath of fresh air, but there has been
little progress on such key issues as the drug war and the guerrilla insurgency
during his 17 months in office. Coca production is said to be skyrocketing as
new cultivation has more than offset the effects of a large-scale eradication
program.
</P>
<P>
	   To combat drug trafficking, funds are being earmarked for military forces
assigned to protect anti-drug police.
</P>
<P>
	   Any program to assist the Colombian military is expected to receive close
scrutiny from congressional Democrats, who already have forbidden U.S.
assistance to go to military units suspected of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   In anticipation of the administration's announcement, Carlos Salinas of
Amnesty International said Monday that any increase in aid to the Colombian Army
is a source of concern because of its links to rightist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These forces are responsible for most of the violations committed in
Colombia, including massacres,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But administration officials say Colombia's rights record is improving.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed assistance increase comes on the heels of a program, completed
last month, to train a 950-member Colombian counternarcotics battalion. The
training of several more also is planned.

<HEADLINE> National Monuments To Be Declared  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- On the 92nd anniversary of the
Grand Canyon's designation as a national monument, President Clinton is taking
``aggressive action'' to safeguard some of the nation's most picturesque open
spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   After a helicopter tour of the canyon and a hike along Tuweep Valley,
Clinton, with the most salient symbol of the American West's majesty as a
backdrop, was declaring three new national monuments and expanding another.
</P>
<P>
	   The lands already belong to the federal government. But the executive action
was being carried out, in some cases, despite protests from local and state
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is going to take aggressive action to protect America's
natural spaces,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said in advance of
Clinton's announcement today.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting on recommendations from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit
to name as national monuments a jagged 1,500-square-mile desert area dotted with
junipers known as the Grand Canyon-Parashant; Agua Fria, 71,000 acres
encompassing two mesas filled with Indian ruins, petroglyphs and other
prehistoric treasures north of Phoenix; and hundreds of rocks and small islands
along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pinnacles National Monument, located south of San Jose, Calif., which
was named a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, was expanded under
the order Clinton was signing today. Roosevelt also declared Grand Canyon a
monument in 1908. It later became a national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting under the Antiquities Act, passed by Congress in 1906 and
used by every president since to protect federal lands and, in the words of the
act, ``objects of historic and scientific interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action does not affect existing water and grazing rights and
mining claims, but does bar new ones on the designated lands. Hunting is
prohibited on the expanded section of the Pinnacles site and a ban on off-road
vehicles at the two Arizona sites becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision already has met with resistance in Arizona. Gov. Jane
Hull and her seven Republican colleagues who represent the state in Congress
wrote last week to urge Clinton not to act in the Grand Canyon and Agua Fria
areas. The Republicans want more public input into the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Siewert, noting that every president since Roosevelt has exercised his
authority under the Antiquities Act, said, ``This is an effort to protect land
that no one has any desire to see developed or mined.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Climb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices closed higher Tuesday, led by technology
issues and boosted by an overnight record closing on Wall Street. The U.S.
dollar was unchanged against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues closed at 18,850.92 points
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday, up 657.51 points, or 3.61 percent from
Friday. On Friday, the average closed up 25.14 points, or 0.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.32 yen in afternoon trading, unchanged from late
Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 105.20 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tokyo's stock market, prices rose sharply Tuesday following a new closing
high in the Dow Jones industrial average at 11,572.20 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow index rose 49.64, or 0.4 percent, topping Friday's record close of
11,522.56. The Nasdaq composite index rose 167.04, or 4.3 percent, to 4,049.66,
its biggest point gain ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Morning gainers in Tokyo included high-technology and communications issues
such as Sony Corp., which were boosted by gains in U.S. counterparts following
news of a proposed merger between America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   "Buying interest was strong throughout the session, with few profit-taking
orders," said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the TSE's First Section was estimated at 640.08 million shares, up
from 547.57 million shares Friday. Gainers overwhelmed losers 792 to 417, while
134 issues were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 79.81 points, or 4.99 percent, to 1,678.82 points. The TOPIX closed
down 10.58 points, or 0.66 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher throughout the day compared
with Monday's New York level as the demand for U.S. stocks supported buying of
the greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the dollar's relatively firm tone should be bolstered by
lingering expectations that the upcoming meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations will discuss the
yen's strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance officials from the G-7 - the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany,
France, Canada and Italy - are scheduled to gather in Tokyo on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.48 yen, down from 108.64 yen
late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7050
percent from Friday's finish of 1.7150 percent. Its price rose 0.08 point to
101.65.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Said Bungled Project  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A task force of scientists says development of the world's
largest laser has been marred by overly optimistic expectations, management
bungling and inadequate attention by senior officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1.5 billion Energy Department project at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory has been under intense scrutiny since last September, when it was
found to be three years behind schedule and facing $350 million in cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
	   Only six months earlier, the head of the California weapons laboratory had
told a congressional hearing the project was on schedule and within budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Ignition Facility project is an unprecedented array of
sophisticated and powerful lasers that are to be key to monitoring and
maintaining America's nuclear weapons without actual bomb testing.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Monday by a panel appointed by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
review the project found significant shortcomings in both management and how the
project was designed from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   While the panel said it had not uncovered ``any technical or managerial
obstacles'' to completing the project, ``serious challenges and hurdles
remain.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report said senior DOE officials and those at Livermore viewed the
3-year-old project as if it were conventional construction and failed to grasp
the complexities of fabricating and assembling a laser system 40 to 50 times
more powerful than anything now in use.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cos. Settle With FTC on Coupons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three companies have agreed to change coupon and cash
rebate programs that federal regulators called ``false and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., Memtek Products Inc. and UMAX Technologies reached
agreements with the Federal Trade Commission to compensate some consumers and
speed rebates to others.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announded Monday with Bumble Bee addressed a special label on the
face of its tuna cans that asked consumers to purchase the product with the
promise of a 75-cent coupon for their next purchase. Further details of the
program -- those requiring the consumer to buy five cans of tuna before
redeeming the coupon -- appeared on the inside label.
</P>
<P>
	   San Diego-based Bumble Bee has agreed to start a new $200,000 coupon
program, with 7.6 million coupons to be distributed nationally and to include
rebate details where consumers can see them.
</P>
<P>
	   Memtek Products Inc., a Santa Fe Springs, Calif.-based office printing and
audiovisual supplier promised purchasers of its 100-count package of computer
diskettes that they would receive a $29.99 rebate within 12 weeks after the
company received their requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Memtek, which sells Memorex brand products, also offered purchasers of their
blank audio and videotapes a $10 gift check, which were good for purchases of
prerecorded compact discs or videotapes at the electronics retailer Best Buy.
The gift checks were supposed to arrive within eight weeks of the consumer's
request.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC alleges that consumers received the rebates and gift checks several
months later than promised.
</P>
<P>
	   UMAX Technologies, a manufacturer of digital products, offered rebates up to
$50 on certain models of computer scanners. They were supposed to be paid to
consumers within 12 weeks of a request. But the agency said it often took up to
five months longer for customers to get their rebates.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Memtek and Fremont, Calif.-based UMAX have agreed to deliver rebates by
written deadlines or within 30 days if no time period is stipulated.

<HEADLINE> National Monuments To Be Declared  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- On the 92nd anniversary of the
Grand Canyon's designation as a national monument, President Clinton is acting
to safeguard some of the nation's most picturesque open spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   After a helicopter tour of the canyon and a hike along Tuweep Valley,
Clinton, with the most salient symbol of the American West's majesty as a
backdrop, was declaring three new national monuments and expanding another.
</P>
<P>
	   The lands already belong to the federal government but Clinton's action will
protect the designated areas from mining and some other uses. The executive
action was being carried out, in some cases, despite protests from local and
state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is going to take aggressive action to protect America's
natural spaces,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said in advance of
Clinton's announcement today.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting on recommendations from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
to name as national monuments a jagged 1,500-square-mile desert area dotted with
junipers known as the Grand Canyon-Parashant; Agua Fria, 71,000 acres
encompassing two mesas filled with Indian ruins, petroglyphs and other
prehistoric treasures north of Phoenix; and hundreds of rocks and small islands
along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pinnacles National Monument, located south of San Jose, Calif., which
was named a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, was expanded under
the order Clinton was signing today. Roosevelt also declared Grand Canyon a
monument in 1908. It later became a national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president's action was praised by environmentalists, some
Arizona state and local officials accused him of ignoring local interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it is totally disrespectful of the local community,'' said Mohave
County Supervisor Carol Anderson, whose district covers the monument area.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor of Fredonia, Ariz., a tiny community about 50 miles from the
monument boundary, said local people resent federal mandates and are worried
about effects on the ranching and timber industries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'll declare this monument. They'll go home, and we'll be left to take
care of it,'' Mayor Joy Jordan said before Clinton's declaration.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurent Gaudreau, a 73-year-old outdoor-gear salesman at the Canyon's South
Rim, disagreed. ``Once land is gone, it is gone forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting under the Antiquities Act, passed by Congress in 1906 and
used by every president since to protect federal lands and, in the words of the
act, ``objects of historic and scientific interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action does not affect existing water and grazing rights and
mining claims, but does bar new ones on the designated lands. Hunting is
prohibited on the expanded section of the Pinnacles site and a ban on off-road
vehicles at the two Arizona sites becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision already has met with resistance in Arizona. Gov. Jane
Hull and her seven Republican colleagues who represent the state in Congress
wrote last week to urge Clinton not to act in the Grand Canyon and Agua Fria
areas. The Republicans want more public input into the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Siewert, noting that every president since Roosevelt has exercised his
authority under the Antiquities Act, said, ``This is an effort to protect land
that no one has any desire to see developed or mined.''

<HEADLINE> Post Office Asks 1-Cent Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mailing a letter could cost another penny next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service's board of governors today launched the lengthy process
of raising postage rates, a step that could lead to new stamp prices early in
2001.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This request is just the right amount at the right time for the Postal
Service to maintain universal service and lead us into the new millennium with
the best performance, planning, technology and management systems in Postal
Service history,'' said Einar V. Dyhrkopp, chairman of the board of governors.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, a first-class stamp would go up a penny to 34 cents and
the cost of each additional ounce of first class would rise from 22 cents to 23
cents. Mailing a postcard would also go up a penny, to 21 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Priority mail would rise from $3.20 to $3.45 for the first pound, and the
first half-pound of express mail would increase from $11.75 to $12.30.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases are also contemplated for other classes of mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Major mailers have been expecting the step since last fall. Two of the post
office's main competitors in the delivery business -- Federal Express and United
Parcel Service -- recently announced rate increases to take effect in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, postal officials said rates would not be raised in 2000, noting
the $363 million profit for fiscal 1999. However, that was the lowest profit in
five years and the agency, like its competitors, faces rising fuel and wage
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike its competition, when the Postal Service wants to raise prices it
must seek permission from the independent Postal Rate Commission and provide
detailed supporting documents. The commission then holds hearings and issues its
decision; the process takes 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming commission approval, the matter would return to the postal
governors in November or December. The board traditionally has been reluctant to
impose higher rates before the Christmas mailing rush, so any rate rise is
unlikely before early 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The current 33-cent first-class rate took effect Jan. 10, 1999, a 1-cent
increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is a semi-independent federal agency. It does not receive
tax money for operations and is expected to make enough money to break even over
time. The agency still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   While the first-class rate for letters and postcards is the most visible
change for the public, rates also would rise for most other types of mail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the things a rate case is, is civil war,'' Neal Denton of the
Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers said, ``with each different mailing interest
trying to carve up the pie as to who should pay what in increased rates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Denton pointed to the impact on small, community-based nonprofit
organizations that need low rates to raise funds for their activities. He
speculated that increases for some small nonprofits could reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Del Polito of the American Association for Postal Commerce, said it is
his ``expectation that flat-size mail is probably going to come in for a
disproportionately larger increase, which means publications are going to be
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not a very propitious time for an increase,'' Del Polito said,
citing the growth in Internet commerce that offers alternatives to the Postal
Service.

<HEADLINE> Gary Glitter Is Freed From Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HORFIELD, England (AP) -- Glam rock singer Gary Glitter was freed from
prison today after serving half of a four-month sentence for downloading more
than 4,000 pornographic pictures of children from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Glitter, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was whisked out of Bristol
Prison by police, avoiding waiting reporters and photographers, after prison
officials said the 55-year-old singer had received death threats.
</P>
<P>
	   He later appeared before reporters in London's Regent's Park to make a
tearful statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I deeply regret doing what I was sent to prison for," he said. "I've served
my time I want to put it all behind me and live my life."
</P>
<P>
	   Glitter, who has sold 18 million records over the course of 25 years, was
jailed in November after pleading guilty to 54 charges of making pornographic
pictures.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested in 1997 after technicians at a Bristol computer store in
western England found indecent images on his computer's hard drive. Some of them
depicted prepubescent children being sexually abused and tortured.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his release, Glitter's name was added to a sex offenders' register. It
will remain on the register for seven years, and he will have to notify police
of any change of address.
</P>
<P>
	   Glitter's admission in November that he made indecent photographs of
children came hours after a jury found him innocent of eight counts of sexually
assaulting a teen-age fan almost two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The fan, now a 34-year-old mother of three, sold her story to a tabloid
newspaper after reading about his arrest on the porn charges.

<HEADLINE> The Walls Have Ears at Mass. Arena  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MANSFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- People going to concerts at the TweeterCenter arena
know what music they like -- and an electronic ear knows what music they like,
too, at least on their car radios.
</P>
<P>
	   A monitoring device installed last spring allows concert producer SFX
Entertainment to learn what radio station is playing in the car of anyone
driving into the arena's parking lot, valuable information for businesses
tracking marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   The equipment is legal, but some civil liberty experts are troubled.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's scary when you begin to invade the zones where people have an
expectation of privacy," said John Roberts, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The monitor, made by Mobiltrak, picks up the frequency of the station
playing on a passing car's radio by detecting emissions from the radio's
oscillator.
</P>
<P>
	   SFX, the world's largest concert promoter and venue operator, has installed
the system at 13 other facilities nationwide. Mobiltrak, based in Birmingham,
Ala., also has devices installed in Los Angeles, Phoenix and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't cross privacy boundaries, said Lucius Stone, Mobiltrak's director
of sales and marketing. "We purposely designed these things so we wouldn't know
whether a white car or a red truck or even a guy on a bike with a Walkman went
by," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But one critic, attorney Harvey Silverglate, worries that the technology
could be expanded to gather additional information, like the license plate of
the passing car or a photo of the driver.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you leave it to companies unaffected by any laws, they will go as far as
they can without notifying you, and use data as much as they can to make as much
money as they can," Silverglate said. "That's not necessarily a criticism, just
a reality in a free market."

<HEADLINE> U.S., India Reach Trade Agreement  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what the Clinton administration is hailing as a big
opportunity for U.S. exporters, India has agreed to remove decades-old trade
barriers from hundreds of U.S. products ranging from manufactured goods to food.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said India has made
commitments to remove 1,400 specific trade restrictions. Half of the
restrictions will be lifted within three months with the remaining restrictions
eliminated by April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eliminating these restrictions will provide -- for the first time in 50
years for some products -- market access opportunities for U.S. producers in key
sectors such as textiles, agriculture, consumer goods and a wide variety of
manufactured products,'' Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The timetable for removing the trade barriers was arrived at in negotiations
between the two countries which concluded on Dec. 28 but was not announced by
the administration until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations were launched after the United States won a case before the
World Trade Organization over India's current practices. A WTO appeals panel
last August rejected India's claims that the trade barriers were permitted under
WTO rules that allow restrictions for countries suffering international
balance-of-payment problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with the United States to set a timetable for removing the
import barriers followed similar agreements India had reached with the 15-nation
European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   India's balance-of-payments trade barriers were included on what the country
called a ``negative list,'' which included a wide range of consumer goods,
including food, clothing and household appliances.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly in early trading today as investors
took some profits from Monday's rally in Internet stocks but nudged blue chips
deeper into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 25.13 at 11,597.33, after reaching a new closing high of
11,572.20 on yesterday.

<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were barely higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index

<HEADLINE> Court Shields States in Age Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Further sapping the federal government's power over
states, the Supreme Court today shielded states against federal lawsuits by
employees who say they are victims of age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 5-4 vote in cases from Florida and Alabama, the court ruled that
Congress exceeded its authority when it allowed federal lawsuits against the
states under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   The law cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued in
federal courts, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining O'Connor were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Left in dissent were the
court's more liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   By identical votes in a series of recent decisions, the court ignited what
legal scholars have called a states' rights revolution by eroding the federal
government's power over states.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor's 28-page opinion for the court narrowed Congress' power to enforce
the 14th Amendment's equal-protection guarantee when seeking to protect people
discriminated against for reasons other than race, national origin and religion.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's decision did not discuss whether another federal anti-bias law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, could be enforced with federal lawsuits against
state employers. But the court's rationale seemed to rule out such enforcement
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``States may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the 14th
Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a
legitimate state interest,'' O'Connor said. ``The rationality commanded ... does
not require states to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests they
serve with razorlike precision.''
</P>
<P>
	   She added: ``In contrast, when a state discriminates on the basis of race or
gender, we require a tighter fit between the discriminatory means and the
legitimate ends they serve.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor said today's decision does not leave employees subjected to age
bias without any legal remedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``State employees are protected by state age discrimination statutes, and
may recover money damages from their state employers in almost every state of
the union,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens, writing for the four dissenters, said the 11th Amendment immunity
enjoyed by states does not limit ``Congress' power to regulate the American
economy.'' That power, he said, ``includes the power to regulate both the public
and the private sectors of the labor market.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens also blasted the court's five-member majority for what he called
``judicial activism.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the series of pro-states' rights decisions ``represents such a
radical departure from the proper role of this court that it should be opposed
whenever the opportunity arises.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the cases decided today, a federal appeals court ruled that the
age-discrimination act cannot be invoked against states and state agencies. That
ruling was upheld today -- spelling defeat for three separate groups of state
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the three disputes, 36 current and former faculty members and
librarians at Florida State University and Florida International University sued
the state board of regents in federal court, contending that age bias was why
they lost out on certain salary increases given to younger faculty members.
</P>
<P>
	   In another, two associate professors at the state-run University of
Montevallo in Alabama alleged that they had been wronged because younger faculty
members were treated more favorably when it came to salaries and promotions.
</P>
<P>
	   And in a third, Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson said he lost out on
a promotion because of discrimination based on, among other factors, his age.
</P>
<P>
	   The lead case is Kimel vs. Florida Board of Regents, 98-791.

<HEADLINE> Court: Speedy-Trial Rule Flexible  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States do not violate criminal defendants' right to a
speedy trial every time they fail to conduct a trial within the 180 days
required by a multistate agreement, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
</P>
<P>
	   A defense lawyer's agreement to hold the trial beyond that 180-day deadline
bars his client from later seeking to overturn a conviction based on
speedy-trial rights, the court said as it reinstated a New York man's
second-degree murder and robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's highest court had thrown out Michael Hill's convictions and
ordered the charges against him dropped. The state court said prosecutors failed
to bring Hill to trial within the time required by the Interstate Agreement on
Detainers, a 1957 compact among nearly all the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill was being held at the Lorain Correctional Institution in Grafton, Ohio,
in 1993 when New York authorities filed notice that he was wanted on charges of
murder and robbery in the shooting death of Michael Weeks in the Rochester
suburb of Gates on New Year's Eve 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill invoked the speedy-trial provisions of the interstate agreement but
pretrial maneuvering by his defense team put the deadline on hold for about
seven months.
</P>
<P>
	   But the deadline clock was running when in January 1995 prosecution and
defense lawyers met to set a trial date. The prosecutor said a May 1 trial date
had been discussed and when asked by a judge, Hill's lawyer said, ``That will be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hill later was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. But the New
York Court of Appeals said Hill had not waived his speedy-trial protection
because neither he nor any defense lawyer had made an ``affirmative request''
for a trial date beyond the 180-day deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for the nation's highest court today, Justice Antonin Scalia said,
``What suffices for a waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue.'' In
cases like Hill's, he said, ``absent a demonstration of ineffectiveness,
counsel's word on such matters is the last.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is New York vs. Hill, 98-1299.

<HEADLINE> Pataki proposes $76.8 billion budget for fiscal 2000-01  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki today proposed a state budget
totaling nearly $77 billion for fiscal 2000-01, saying the plan will continue
New York's march away from "economic crisis to a new era of confidence and
prosperity."
<P>
	   Counting federal funds and money from other sources, the governor's plan
represents a 5.5 percent spending increase from the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the state's General Fund - that money the state raises directly
through taxes and fees - would total $37.9 billion or 2.3 percent more than in
fiscal 1999-2000. The governor said that would keep the growth of that fund
beneath the projected increase in the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're on the right path - the path of limited government, controlled
spending, lower taxes and more jobs," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the governor said "the decisions we make today will determine whether
that prosperity is a fleeting moment or a legacy that stretches to the far end
of time."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki outlined the plan to state legislators in Albany late this morning,
starting the traditional weeks-long analysis of the spending plan by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The new state fiscal year begins on April 1, and the governor and
Legislature have failed for 15 straight years to pass a new budget on time. Last
year, the state went to Aug. 4 without a new budget and missed by a matter of
hours setting a record for budget-adoption futility.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the initiatives contained in Pataki's budget proposal had been
detailed before, either through the systematic budget "leaks" by Pataki's office
or in the governor's State of the State speech to the Legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
	   They include $700 million in tax cuts centering around the phase-out of the
state's gross receipts tax on utility bills; tripling the size of the state's
debt reduction reserve fund; making dramatic expansions of health insurance
programs for the poor and staying with the next scheduled round of phased-in
cuts under the "STAR" property tax reduction program.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were a few surprises.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki proposed the formation of a large new state agency, dubbed the
"Department of Justice," by consolidating the state Department of Correctional
Services, the Division of Parole, the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the
Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives, the Division of State
Police and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also proposed building a new 750-cell, 1,500-bed maximum
security state prison at an undetermined site.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the state should spend $12.9 billion on public education in
2000-01 or $355 million than in the current fiscal year. Much of that new money
would be in support of the governor's previously announced "Schools 2000"
initiative, which would provide more resources for children and teachers and
tougher student behavior standards to create better learning environments.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he was asking to increase money for pre-kindergarten classes by
40 percent and that he'd try again in 2000 to get the Legislature to rework the
state's expensive special education system.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's proposed 3.2 percent school spending increase is far less
than the Legislature has ultimately approved in recent years and is almost
certain to be higher by the time lawmakers pass a budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the tax-cut proposals from Pataki announced for the first time today
are a tax credit for the development of environmentally sound "green buildings,"
$25 million in tax cuts targeted for business development and a tax credit for
the builders of housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   Riding years of budget surpluses, Wall Street prosperity, employment gains
and with no political war against the Legislature on the horizon, Pataki's sixth
budget could be his most harmonious as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
and Pataki have all said in the last week that they had realistic hopes of
enacting a budget on time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Care Reform Act 2000 bill passed late last month contained two
elements crucial to a more orderly budget this year. The first was a commitment
to spend most tobacco settlement money due New York state until 2003 on health
care programs for the uninsured. The act also included a cease-fire of sorts
between the state Assembly and Pataki over the possibility of significant
Medicaid cuts over that period.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the spending of the tobacco settlement and Medicaid cuts had figured to
be chief battlegrounds in Albany this year over the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bruno said he would ask Pataki not to call any of the
"three-men-in-a-room" budget meetings. Those are the sessions, much criticized
by reformers and many legislators, where the governor, the Assembly speaker and
the Senate majority leader sit behind closed doors and hash out the most
important aspects of new budgets and other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to ask the governor not to call any, and the governor is the
governor and he'll do whatever he sees fit," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said it would suit the governor fine if the
Legislature took his proposed budget, worked out its own budget in public in
conference committees and submitted it to Pataki for final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature tried to devise a budget without Pataki's input via
conference committees in 1998, but was dismayed when Pataki vetoed hundreds of
millions of dollars in spending initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Rape Victims' Right To Sue Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices expressed doubts today about
whether Congress had the authority to enact a law allowing rape victims to sue
their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your approach ... would justify a federal remedy for alimony or child
support,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told Solicitor General Seth Waxman, who
asked the court to reinstate a key provision of the 1994 Violence Against Women
Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Goldscheid, representing a former Virginia Tech student who wants to
sue two football players she says raped her, argued along with Waxman that the
law is needed to combat gender-based violence -- ``one of the most persistent
barriers to women's equality and full participation in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such violence reduces national productivity and restricts women's choices in
jobs and travel, Goldscheid said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Antonin Scalia said all types of crime could have similar
effects.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldscheid's logic ``would allow general federal criminal laws on all
subjects because all crime affects interstate commerce,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael E. Rosman, representing the two former football players, said the
law encroaches on traditional state powers and does not come under Congress'
authority to regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices have trimmed the federal government's power in relation to the
states in a series of recent 5-4 decisions. It seemed likely that today's case
could follow the same pattern when decided sometime by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman said Congress found that ``archaic prejudices and improper
stereotypes'' about women were affecting the outcome of cases in state courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, formerly a pioneering women's rights advocate,
suggested that the Violence Against Women Act could be seen as an ``alternative
remedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress could be saying, ``We aren't taking over the states' domain. We are
just complementing what the states do,'' Ginsburg said. ``Why isn't that
satisfactory?''
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six states are siding with Christy Brzonkala, the former Virginia
Tech student, and asking the court to reinstate the federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The court in 1995 threw out the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which
made it a crime to possess a gun near a school. The justices said the law was
insufficiently linked to interstate commerce and usurped states' authority over
such crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied heavily on that ruling when it
threw out Brzonkala's lawsuit against the two football players. The appeals
court said Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and assure all
citizens of equal protection did not authorize it to enact the portion of the
Violence Against Women Act that let rape victims sue their attackers.
</P>

	   Brzonkala, who has allowed use of her name, became the first person to sue
under the federal law in 1995 when she sued Antonio Morrison and James Crawford.
She alleged the two athletes raped her in a dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala did not report the rapes for several months, and the men were
never charged with a crime. She said she became depressed after the alleged
attack and ultimately withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
	   Now 23, Brzonkala works at a restaurant. She is pursuing a separate lawsuit
against Virginia Tech, which she says protected the two men because they were
athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala generally has avoided speaking about the case in public. But at a
news conference last week, she said, ``Rape is like having your soul torn out
... Rape is a brutal form of discrimination -- women are raped because they are
women.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Violence Against Women Act also has criminal provisions, but those are
not at issue in today's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are U.S. vs. Morrison, 99-5, and Brzonkala vs. Morrison, 99-29.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors took profits from
Monday's rally in Internet stocks but pushed blue chips deeper into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
30.09 at 11,602.29, after reaching a new closing high of 11,572.20 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 5.17 at 1,452.43, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 13.28
at 4,036.39.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell 6 3/16 to 65 1/16. Lycos fell 3 31/64 to 76 33/64.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, fell
19 5/16 to 416 3/4. The Internet service provider was among the market's
strongest performers in 1999, and traders said the company will have to turn in
an especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business, fell
13/16 to 29 5/16 after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly
short of Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose 5 1/2 to 91 1/4,
buoying the Dow and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its
rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose 1 1/2 to 60 5/16, also benefiting from an upgrade from Credit
Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend appears to be continuing today, said Brian G. Belski, chief
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders suggested trading may be fairly quiet in the next two sessions as
investors await economic data due for release later this week. On Thursday, the
government will report on producer prices for December, as well as retail sales.
On Friday, the Labor Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely
watched gauge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of rising inflation hurt bonds today, sending the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond to 6.66 percent, from 6.58 percent late Monday. Rising bond yields
can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part because they can present an
appealing alternative to investors looking for stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 474.79 million shares, behind Monday's
midday pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies slipped 2.70 to 499.19.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska federal judge to hear complaint against Starr  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - A Connecticut lawyer's claims of misconduct
against former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will be heard by a federal
judge from Nebraska.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Warren K. Urbom of Lincoln, Neb., will handle Francis
Mandanici's complaints about aspects of Starr's investigation into President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Urbom was appointed by Chief Judge Roger Wollman of the 8th Circuit Court of
Appeals at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright of Little Rock confirmed Monday that
Urbom had been appointed, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Wright asked the 8th Circuit to appoint a judge to the case
because all the judges in Arkansas's Eastern District had excused themselves
from hearing it.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting the case, Urbom sealed the file, including the order
appointing him, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandanici has made repeated filings related to Starr's investigation, said
Monday he was happy the complaint is going through the system.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is my expectation that finally the merits of the allegations concerning
Mr. Starr's conflicts of interest and other matters will finally be resolved,"
Mandanici said.
</P>
<P>
	   Urbom, who is on senior status, has been a federal judge for 30 years and
was appointed in 1970 by President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Hiatt Steele and Stephen A. Smith, both once targeted by Starr in his
investigation of President Clinton, have joined Mandanici in their complaints
against Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   A former aide to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas, Smith pleaded
guilty in 1995 to a misdemeanor stemming from Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, a federal jury deadlocked 9-3 in favor of convicting Ms.
Steele, from Virginia, on charges that she obstructed Starr's investigation.
Starr decided not to retry Ms. Steele.

<HEADLINE> 'NYPD Blue' Finally Returns  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "NYPD Blue," the police drama mugged by its own network,
returns at last for a new season and in fine form.
</P>
<P>
	   After delaying the series' fall debut and even toying with removing "NYPD
Blue" from its longtime slot, ABC relented. The first of 22 episodes, a full
seasons' worth, airs 10 p.m. EST Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15th Precinct station house is alive again with lowlifes, victims and
hardworking cops trying to keep it together as they slog through the criminal
mud. Andy Sipowicz, one of television's most compelling and layered characters
as played by Dennis Franz, remains at the center of the action.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's episode focuses on a case of police brutality and attempted
cover-up that pits Sipowicz and partner Danny Sorenson (Rick Schroder) against
two uniformed officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Bochco, who co-created and produces the series with David Milch, is
taking an optimistic view of the delayed debut.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it brings real focus on the show in a way it might not otherwise
have had going into its seventh season," Bochco said. "And because of the
circumstances of its delay and the contentiousness of that situation, it really
flushed our loyal audience in a most gratifying way. ... (They) stood up and
made their feelings known to ABC."
</P>
<P>
	   Controversy is familiar turf for "NYPD Blue." The series started in 1993
with a rush of criticism and advertiser boycotts over the then-unusual use of
profanity and racy bedroom scenes, but it quickly won viewers with its solid
storytelling and cast.
</P>
<P>
	   There was worrisome times when star David Caruso bailed out in the second
year and again when Jimmy Smits left in 1998. But with Sipowicz as the bulwark,
chief steward Milch kept the show on track -- and Schroder proved a smart
addition.
</P>
<P>
	   Who would have thought then, given the show's creative consistency and
strong, top 20 ratings performance, that ABC would deliver a "tune-up" ("NYPD
Blue" parlance for a police roughing up) to its own series?
</P>
<P>
	   The network temporarily benched the show in favor of a tryout for "Once and
Again," a finely crafted domestic drama from the creators of "thirtysomething"
-- and a show co-produced by ABC and its parent company, Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   "NYPD Blue" was set to return at the beginning of November, but its absence
from the schedule lengthened as "Once and Again" drew respectable ratings
against CBS' surprise new hit "Judging Amy."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC was said to fear the CBS show could draw off female viewers if "NYPD
Blue" were opposite it. And, most importantly, building "Once and Again" into a
hit could pay off for Disney down the line in syndication profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Bochco heard rumors ABC was considering bumping his series to another
time period.
</P>
<P>
	   "It galls me on every level," the producer said last October. "First, in its
cynicism. It galls me in its disrespect. We have given the network a hit show in
that time slot for six uninterrupted years."
</P>
<P>
	   The flap came, ironically, one month after Franz won his fourth Emmy Award
for best actor in a drama. Bochco doesn't regret taking the issue public.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started squealing like a stuck pig," he said this month. "But it wasn't
about me, it was about the show. If I'd been squealing over 'Total Security' (a
fluffy, short-lived Bochco series), nine people in America would have cared."
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, ABC was bombarded with calls and letters from angry fans, he said.
Within days, the network announced that "NYPD Blue" would be coming back and in
its original berth. "Once and Again" shifts to Monday night beginning Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's cavalier treatment of the show and viewers aside, there is a benefit
in the delay.
</P>
<P>
	   "The one really terrific benefit in all of this, I think, is that we're
going to be on for 20 straight weeks, 22 hours," Bochco noted. "There's a couple
of weeks in which they'll actually double us up. ... Every week, you'll be able
to count on a fresh episode, no reruns."
</P>
<P>
	   Cast changes are ahead. Nicholas Turturro, who plays Detective James
Martinez, is leaving to develop a sitcom; Henry Simmon joins the cast as a new
detective, Baldwin James, a third of the way into the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance of the black James will set the stage for clashes with
Sipowicz, whose stormy relationship with Lt. Arthur Fancy (James McDaniel) has
already exposed the white detective's hostility toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Sipowicz's personal life provides dramatic and comedic fodder, as well,
including beautifully tender scenes with young son Theo and awkward moments as
the widower (wife Sylvia died in a courthouse shooting last season) begins
dating.
</P>
<P>
	   Is this the season of hope? "Let's not go crazy," Bochco said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Franz is itching to see the series back on the air after a
frustrating wait.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that we learn from watching the show, we learn what's working and
what's not," Franz said. "When we don't see the fruits of our labor, it's hard
to gauge any adjustments we have to make.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like you're caught in a vacuum, where you're just making this
product and it doesn't see the light of day."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC has an option for an eighth season of "NYPD Blue." If the network
passes, Bochco has expressed confidence another network will pick up the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Which would leave ABC open to charges of criminal negligence.

<HEADLINE> 3 New National Monuments Named  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Saying he is continuing the
``great journey'' of conservation started by Theodore Roosevelt, President
Clinton today marked the 92nd anniversary of the Grand Canyon's designation as a
national monument by safeguarding other picturesque open spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spent an hour watching the sun rise over the canyon's
multicolored ridges and plateaus, then took a helicopter tour of the canyon and
hiked along Tuweep Valley. He stood at Hopi Point, on the canyon's South Rim,
and declared three new national monuments and expansion of another.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was fitting that he made those declarations today, because
on Jan. 11, 1908, Roosevelt made the Grand Canyon a national monument,
protecting it from mining or other activities that he felt would mar it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of you who can see what is behind me can doubt the wisdom of that
decision,'' Clinton said. ``On this day, and in this place, we continue that
great journey.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lands already belong to the federal government but Clinton's action will
protect the designated areas from mining and some other uses. The executive
action was being carried out, in some cases, despite protests from local and
state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted on recommendations from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to
name as national monuments a jagged 1,500-square-mile desert area dotted with
junipers known as the Grand Canyon-Parashant; Agua Fria, 71,000 acres
encompassing two mesas filled with Indian ruins, petroglyphs and other
prehistoric treasures north of Phoenix; and hundreds of rocks and small islands
along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there is one thing that unites our fractious, argumentative country,
... it is the love we have for our land,'' Clinton said. ``The only thing we can
add to it is our protection.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pinnacles National Monument, located south of San Jose, Calif., which
was named a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, was expanded under
the order Clinton was signing today. Roosevelt also declared Grand Canyon a
monument in 1908. It later became a national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president's action was praised by environmentalists, some
Arizona state and local officials accused him of ignoring local interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it is totally disrespectful of the local community,'' said Mohave
County Supervisor Carol Anderson, whose district covers the monument area.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor of Fredonia, Ariz., a tiny community about 50 miles from the
monument boundary, said local people resent federal mandates and are worried
about effects on the ranching and timber industries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'll declare this monument. They'll go home, and we'll be left to take
care of it,'' Mayor Joy Jordan said before Clinton's declaration.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurent Gaudreau, a 73-year-old outdoor-gear salesman at the Canyon's South
Rim, disagreed. ``Once land is gone, it is gone forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting under the Antiquities Act, passed by Congress in 1906 and
used by several presidents to protect federal lands and, in the words of the
act, ``objects of historic and scientific interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action does not affect existing water and grazing rights and
mining claims, but does bar new ones on the designated lands. Hunting is
prohibited on the expanded section of the Pinnacles site and a ban on off-road
vehicles at the two Arizona sites becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision already has met with resistance in Arizona. Gov. Jane
Hull and her seven Republican colleagues who represent the state in Congress
wrote last week to urge Clinton not to act in the Grand Canyon and Agua Fria
areas. The Republicans want more public input into the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Siewert, noting that every president since Roosevelt has exercised his
authority under the Antiquities Act, said, ``This is an effort to protect land
that no one has any desire to see developed or mined.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Criticism of China  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, citing an intensified
crackdown on political dissent and religious freedoms in China, will seek a
resolution in the U.N. Human Rights Commission criticizing China's rights
record.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement today by the State Department came just a day after
President Clinton urged Congress to vote ``at the earliest possible time'' for a
trade deal that was negotiated with China last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``China's human rights record has continued to deteriorate,'' department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the past year, the government of China intensified its crackdown on
political dissent, initiated a campaign to suppress the Falun Gong, and
intensified controls on unregistered churches and on the political and religious
expression of ethnic minority groups, especially Tibetans,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said controls on the media and the Internet have been tightened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These actions taken as a whole are contrary to the direction that China
has been urged to take by the world. They are specifically contrary to
internationally recognized human rights standards, including the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China has signed,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. commission meets each March, and the United States normally waits
until much closer to the meeting before announcing its strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Rubin's announcement appeared to be aimed at showing Congress
that the administration is prepared to get tough on China's rights record at the
same time that it is pushing for closer trade ties. At issue this year is a
trade agreement that will allow China to join the World Trade Organization,
which sets rules for international commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign for congressional approval faces stiff resistance from
organized labor, environmental groups and their Democratic allies, who believe
that low wages and lax pollution standards in China will undercut American
workers. Religious groups are expected to raise objections about China's human
rights problems.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the deal with Beijing, China would join the WTO but would no
longer be subject to the annual spring debates in Congress on whether China's
rights record should preclude it from having normal access to U.S. markets for
its products.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the trade deal is good for the United States because U.S.
companies would gain better access to Chinese markets.

<HEADLINE> D'oh! Can It Be Simpsons' 10th?  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   "I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless
nothing." -- Homer Simpson, shortly after being fired.
</P>
<P>
	   "There, there, Homer. You'll find a job. You've caused lots of industrial
accidents and you've always bounced back." -- Homer's loving wife, Marge.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Overachiever" is hardly the word that comes to mind when one thinks of
Homer Simpson, but let's give the guy a little credit. After all, he did clinch
a number of awards at his high school reunion, including oldest car, most weight
gained, most hair lost, lowest-paying job, and most improved odor.
</P>
<P>
	   Homer may not be a big success in his world, but he's a runaway hit in ours.
Now the longest-running prime time entertainment show that's still on TV, "The
Simpsons" celebrates 10 years on the air this Friday with a bash that includes
getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   As if there were any need to confirm the huge role they have carved out in
American culture and the entertainment business. It's hard to imagine that a
decade ago parents were furious about the message the incorrigible,
wise-cracking Bart was sending their kids, or that then-President Bush held out
the Simpsons as an example of what was wrong with American families.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a long way from "The Tracey Ullman Show," when Homer, Marge and their
spikey-haired kids first penetrated our minds in 1987 with short animated
segments between comedy routines. Two years later they had a Christmas special,
and their first regular season began Jan. 14, 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the Simpsons and their screwball (but let's face it, all-too
familiar) approach to life have done much more than make animated shows safe for
thinking people again. They gave a huge boost to the Fox network in its critical
early years, a debt readily acknowledged by Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox
TV Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is that 'The Simpsons' is this network's flagship show.
It's largely responsible for putting this network on the map," Grushow said. He
said "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files" are the two most profitable series Fox
ever made.
</P>
<P>
	   The Simpsons also spawned a number of other prime time animated programs,
including "King of the Hill," and launched the career of Conan O'Brien, who was
a writer for "The Simpsons" when he was named to replace David Letterman as host
of "Late Night" in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Even people who work for the show are surprised it's lasted so long. After
all, creator Matt Groening was best known for the brutal, angst-ridden humor in
his cartoon strip "Life is Hell." Mother Jones magazine ran a cover story at the
time of the show's launch titled "TV is Hell: Can Matt Groening's Subversive
Humor Survive Prime Time?"
</P>
<P>
	   More than merely surviving, the Simpsons won an Emmy their first season and
caused a sensation among viewers. Not everyone was amused, though. Parents
worried about Bart claiming to be an "Underachiever -- and proud of it." Barbara
Bush called the show "the dumbest thing" she ever saw.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bush eventually came around, as did many other viewers initially put
off by the merciless satire of institutions like church, school, work and
family. Not to mention Homer's celebration of his own stupidity and his
seemingly inhuman appetite for donuts and beer.
</P>
<P>
	   With so much time having passed since the Simpsons first joined us, it's
fair to ask whether their popularity is a sign the show has toned down or
whether our culture has simply become more accepting of the Simpsons and their
special way of viewing the world.
</P>
<P>
	   To Mike Scully, the show's executive producer, the answer is clear: It's
American attitudes and culture that have changed, while the show has stayed
pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of controversy when the show first came on for its
portrayal of the dysfunctional family," Scully said. "But after 'Beavis and
Butthead' came along, suddenly we were 'Leave it to Beaver.' We've gone from the
show that parents didn't want their kids to watch to the one they sit down WITH
their kids to watch."
</P>
<P>
	   So what makes millions of us tune in every week? For many, it's the mixture
of high-brow humor with gut-wrenching laughs that gives the show its appeal. In
the same episode with clever references to Moby Dick or Shakespeare, Barney the
barfly will emit a beer belch so powerful it makes his lips flap like a pennant.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the day, though, the positive message of familial love pushes
through all the cultural satire.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll get complaints once in a while about Homer's drinking, but he isn't
presented as a role model. He's an idiot," Scully said. "People don't look up to
him for drinking too much or being lazy, but they look up to him for loving his
family."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most remarkable feats the show has pulled off is its sterling
reputation among intellectuals. Two prominent scientists have made guest
appearances on the show, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and Stephen Hawking,
the theoretical physicist whose brilliance has been compared with Einstein's.
Never mind that Homer initially mistook Hawking for Larry Flynt, the publisher
of Hustler magazine; both men use wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Scully explains the reasoning behind inviting Hawking on the show and having
him do a scene with Homer in Moe's bar: "It was a chance to get the world's
smartest man and the world's stupidest man together in the same place."
</P>
<P>
	   But perhaps the highest high-brow endorsement earned by the Simpsons came in
1998 when the American poet laureate, Robert Pinsky penned a reflection titled
"My Favorite Show" for The New York Times Magazine, saying the Simpsons
"penetrated to the nature of television itself."
</P>
<P>
	   How many more years have the Simpson got left? Executive producer Scully has
stopped predicting, having been wrong twice before.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess we'll get off the air when the American public asks us to."

<HEADLINE> Judge rejects attorney's guilty plea in money laundering case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A judge has thrown out a lawyer's guilty plea to
one money-laundering charge and expressed doubts about a second, saying the
government unwittingly relied on false testimony from informants.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Alvin W. Thompson on Monday said he believed the
government had been duped into investigating defense lawyer M. Donald Cardwell
by drug dealers offering false evidence for leniency.
</P>
<P>
	   "They attempted to make a mockery of our criminal justice system," Thompson
said. "They caused the government to invest enormous resources into an
investigation that was unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson's ruling stunned the courtroom. Cardwell stood and faced his wife,
smiled and quietly mouthed the word "Wow!"
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Cardwell had rejected Thompson's invitation to withdraw his
guilty plea to the more serious of the two counts. Cardwell, 66, had appeared
eager to end the ordeal and worried that the government might bring more serious
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cardwell's lawyer notified the court in writing Thursday that his client
had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardwell pleaded guilty in August 1998 to aiding and abetting an effort by
Edwin Gomez, a drug dealer, to launder illicit funds through the purchase of a
house in Windsor. He also admitted failing to report to the IRS within the
required 15 days a cash payment in excess of $10,000. He filed the report only
after learning he was a federal target.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson threw out the guilty plea on the first count, finding that Cardwell
needed to have a specific intent to break the law, not just a willful blindness
to Gomez' finances. The judge postponed sentencing on the second count until
Wednesday, saying he had similar doubts about Cardwell's guilt on that charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Overshadowing the two specific charges were broader claims of misconduct
brought against Cardwell by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA
described Cardwell as living a secret life for more than a decade, laundering
cash, protecting drug dealers from informants and even helping one dealer steal
cash and cocaine from rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   After a half-dozen hearings and a review of debriefing reports and a secret
tape recording of a client's conversation with Cardwell, Thompson said witnesses
and evidence were inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I conclude that Mr. Cardwell has proven conclusively that these allegations
are not true," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson said he may try Cardwell on the original
charges, seek a new indictment or drop the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said he would also check into any possible perjury by a government
informant.

<HEADLINE> Fed Judge To Hear Starr Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge from Nebraska has been named to
consider a misconduct complaint filed against former independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint seeks an investigation of Starr's handling of a criminal
contempt case against Whitewater figure Susan McDougal and Starr's testimony
before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee regarding President Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   It claims that Starr wanted to get Ms. McDougal to give false testimony
against the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Judge Roger Wollman of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis
selected U.S. District Judge Warren K. Urbom of Lincoln, Neb., to handle
complaints about Starr's investigation, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting the case, Urbom sealed the file, including the order
appointing him, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut lawyer Francis Mandanici, who has made repeated filings related
to Starr's investigation, said Monday he was happy his complaint was going
through the system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is my expectation that finally the merits of the allegations concerning
Mr. Starr's conflicts of interest and other matters will finally be resolved. It
is indeed unfortunate that these matters were not resolved prior to Mr. Starr's
efforts to impeach President Clinton,'' Mandanici said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was joined in the complaint by Julie Hiatt Steele and Stephen A. Smith,
both once targeted by Starr in his investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, a former aide to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas, pleaded
guilty in 1995 to a misdemeanor stemming from Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, a federal jury deadlocked 9-3 in favor of convicting Ms. Steele
on charges that she obstructed Starr's investigation of allegations by Kathleen
Willey that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. Starr decided not to retry
Ms. Steele, who lives in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright of Little Rock had asked the 8th
Circuit to appoint a judge to the case because all the judges in Arkansas's
Eastern District -- based in Little Rock -- had excused themselves from hearing
it.

<HEADLINE> 3 New National Monuments Named  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Saying he is continuing the
``great journey'' of conservation started by Theodore Roosevelt, President
Clinton today marked the 92nd anniversary of the Grand Canyon's designation as a
national monument by safeguarding other picturesque open spaces.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spent an hour watching the sun rise over the canyon's
multicolored ridges and plateaus, then took a helicopter tour of the canyon and
hiked along Tuweep Valley. Wearing a brown suede jacket and cowboy boots, he
stood at Hopi Point, on the canyon's South Rim, and declared three new national
monuments and expansion of another.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it was fitting that he made those declarations today, because
on Jan. 11, 1908, Roosevelt made the Grand Canyon a national monument,
protecting it from mining or other activities that he felt would mar it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of you who can see what is behind me can doubt the wisdom of that
decision,'' Clinton said. ``On this day, and in this place, we continue that
great journey.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lands already belong to the federal government but Clinton's action will
protect the designated areas from mining and some other uses. The executive
action was being carried out, in some cases, despite protests from local and
state officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he regrets that some people oppose his action, but feels most
Americans support his moves to protect pristine lands. ``We've tried to be --
and we will always be -- sensitive to the concerns and legitimate interests of
local people, but I think we've done a good job here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton signed the acts at a wooden desk in a dusty valley dotted with
sagebrush, with the Shivwitz Plateau rising behind him. Speaking to reporters,
he rebuffed critics who said he was taking action in order to build his legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This whole area of our national life has been very, very important to
me,'' Clintons aid. ``I talked about this when I ran for president and it's been
a big part of our administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton acted on recommendations from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to
name as national monuments a jagged 1,500-square-mile desert area dotted with
junipers known as the Grand Canyon-Parashant; Agua Fria, 71,000 acres
encompassing two mesas filled with Indian ruins, petroglyphs and other
prehistoric treasures north of Phoenix; and hundreds of rocks and small islands
along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there is one thing that unites our fractious, argumentative country,
... it is the love we have for our land,'' Clinton said. ``The only thing we can
add to it is our protection.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pinnacles National Monument, located south of San Jose, Calif., which
was named a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, was expanded under
the order Clinton was signing today. Roosevelt also declared Grand Canyon a
monument in 1908. It later became a national park.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president's action was praised by environmentalists, some
Arizona state and local officials accused him of ignoring local interests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it is totally disrespectful of the local community,'' said Mohave
County Supervisor Carol Anderson, whose district covers the monument area.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor of Fredonia, Ariz., a tiny community about 50 miles from the
monument boundary, said local people resent federal mandates and are worried
about effects on the ranching and timber industries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'll declare this monument. They'll go home, and we'll be left to take
care of it,'' Mayor Joy Jordan said before Clinton's declaration.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurent Gaudreau, a 73-year-old outdoor-gear salesman at the Canyon's South
Rim, disagreed. ``Once land is gone, it is gone forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was acting under the Antiquities Act, passed by Congress in 1906 and
used by several presidents to protect federal lands and, in the words of the
act, ``objects of historic and scientific interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action does not affect existing water and grazing rights and
mining claims, but does bar new ones on the designated lands. Hunting is
prohibited on the expanded section of the Pinnacles site and a ban on off-road
vehicles at the two Arizona sites becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's decision already has met with resistance in Arizona. Gov. Jane
Hull and her seven Republican colleagues who represent the state in Congress
wrote last week to urge Clinton not to act in the Grand Canyon and Agua Fria
areas. The Republicans want more public input into the decision.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adding To Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress in his 2001
budget for a $2.2 billion increase in spending for a national missile defense,
mainly for an expanded arsenal of interceptor rockets to be based in Alaska or
North Dakota, defense officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just a year ago the Clinton administration added $6.6 billion to the
Pentagon's missile defense budget, and officials now estimate deployment of such
a system will cost $12.7 billion in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon argues that the United States faces a growing threat from
missile attack. Several countries hostile to the United States, including North
Korea, Iran and Iraq, are said to be seeking a capability to launch
intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. satellites can detect missile
launchings anywhere on the globe, but the United States has no means of shooting
down long-range missiles in flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threat is real, (and) it will, in all likelihood, intensify in the
coming years as countries continue to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear
capabilities,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to decide as early as July whether to go ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the system is unlikely to provide a reliable defense against
ballistic missiles and that it will require the United States to withdraw from
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which many consider the bedrock of arms
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has recommended spending another $1.9 billion to pay for an arsenal of
100 interceptors, according to officials who discussed the matter on condition
they not be identified. The current budget pays only for 20 interceptors, which
would not be enough to quash an attack of more than a few long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to submit his budget to Congress on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also recommended adding $300 million for more testing, more spare
parts and construction of a second missile launcher for interceptor tests from
the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands. Those steps were among
numerous recommendations by a missile defense review panel headed by retired Air
Force Gen. Larry Welch, which said the program was on a ``highly demanding''
schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Welch report, published last November, said Clinton would be in position
to determine by July the feasibility of a national missile defense but not
whether the technology and equipment are ready to be deployed. The final version
of the interceptor, for example, is not scheduled to be tested in flight until
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   A prototype interceptor is to be launched from a missile range in the
Pacific next Tuesday. The test is designed to demonstrate the interceptor's
ability to receive in-flight targeting data from military satellites and radars,
then steer itself into the path of a mock warhead arching through space and
destroy it.
</P>
<P>
	   The first test of the prototype interceptor, last October, hit the target,
but the critical data links in that test were pre-programmed before the rocket
was launched. In next week's test, the interceptor is to receive data from a new
radar stationed on the Kwajalein range shortly before it separates from the
rocket booster, about 1,400 miles from its target in space.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has said there must be two successful intercept tests before it
starts construction of a missile defense site, most likely in Alaska. North
Dakota also is an option, but the Alaska site would cover a wider area.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says formal announcement next month  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she will
formally declare her Senate candidacy in early February and hopes to have the
president and daughter Chelsea at her side when she does.
<P>
	   "That's my timetable," the first lady said when asked during a stop at a new
supermarket in Rochester if she planned to make it official next month. "It will
take a while to get everybody organized to do it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who confirmed in November that she intended to run, said
Tuesday she wanted her husband and daughter on hand for the historic
announcement. No first lady has ever run for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to be sure that I've got their schedules coordinated, but that's
what I'm planning," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if daughter Chelsea would take time off from her studies at Stanford
University to help her mother campaign in New York, Mrs. Clinton said only,
"That's down the road."
</P>
<P>
	   In this year's Senate race, Mrs. Clinton is expected to face New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The mayor has yet to say when he will formally announce his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Mrs. Clinton and the mayor have been campaigning across New York and
raising money for the Senate race for months.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton again questioned whether Giuliani had the proper
temperament to get along in the clubby Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You want someone who has strong opinions and convictions about what will
work for New York, but who knows that everyday is not a pitched battle, that you
have to work with people," she said after touring a Tops supermarket in a
depressed area of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady continued to take the mayor to task for his battles with New
York City school officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly is clear that there have been so many controversies and
difficulties, the most recent being what's going on with the schools once again
- two school chancellors couldn't get along with him and are now gone," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, at the end of the day, that's a lot of wasted energy," Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady said that she, on the other hand, has demonstrated that she
is suited for the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is something that requires a person who is able to absorb a lot of
incoming fire," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the first statewide poll results since the first lady became a
New York resident last week weren't especially encouraging: She was still
trailing Giuliani and her favorable rating was 48 percent, down 20 percentage
points from February 1999, according to pollsters for Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll found Giuliani supported by 49 percent of registered voters
to Mrs. Clinton's 40 percent. Eleven percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-to-head findings in the telephone poll of 621 registered voters
conducted Sunday and Monday were identical to the institute's December poll. The
margin of error for the latest poll from the Poughkeepsie-based institute is
plus or minus 4 percentage points, so the race remains close.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, Mrs. Clinton again called on Giuliani to consider a mutual ban
on the use of unlimited "soft-money" donations in the Senate race. She has
already resorted to such funding and Giuliani has not ruled it out. The mayor's
aides have said they would like to see something in writing from the first lady
on that subject before responding.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will make it in writing if that would be received favorably by the mayor
and his campaign," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   During her stop at the supermarket, Mrs. Clinton purchased some sliced
cheese and turkey from the deli counter before heading off for an afternoon
appearance at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in nearby Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's for a little snack on the way to the college," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton used a $20 bill to pay for her $8.34 in purchases, chatting
briefly with cashier Charity Dennard who was working the check-out line.
</P>
<P>
	   "I loved it," Ms. Dennard said after handling Mrs. Clinton's purchases.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 41.49; Nasdaq Down 48.23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors took profits from
Monday's rally in Internet stocks but pushed blue chips deeper into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
41.49 at 11,613.69 after reaching a new closing high of 11,572.20 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were modestly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was off 8.49 at 1,449.11, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 48.23 at
4,001.44.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell 5 7/8 to 65 3/8. Analysts said investors were struggling with the
notion that AOL, a high-flying Internet leader that has commanded premium stock
prices, will now behave more like a traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, fell
27 3/16 to 408 7/8. The Internet service provider was among the market's
strongest performers in 1999, and traders said the company will have to turn in
an especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Lycos fell 6 to 74.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business, fell 
5/8 to 29 1/2 after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly
short of Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose 5 21/64 to 91
5/64, buoying the Dow and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its
rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose 2 1/16 to 60 7/8, also benefiting from an upgrade from Credit
Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend appears to be continuing today, said Brian G. Belski, chief
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders suggested trading may be fairly quiet in the next two sessions as
investors await economic data due for release later this week. On Thursday, the
government will report on producer prices for December, as well as retail sales.
On Friday, the Labor Department will release its Consumer Price Index, a widely
watched gauge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of rising inflation hurt bonds today, sending the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond to 6.67 percent, from 6.58 percent late Monday. Rising bond yields
can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part because they can present an
appealing alternative to investors looking for stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond yields are now hovering at the highest levels since Sept. 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 690.17 million shares, behind Monday's
afternoon pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.07 to 496.82.

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Inspires Activism  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asian Americans who felt targeted as a race in the 1996
Democratic fund-raising scandal have found a new cause in Wen Ho Lee, the former
Los Alamos scientist indicted on charges of mishandling U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Activism in support of Lee has grown among Asian-American groups, although
some are taking a cautious approach until they learn more about the government's
case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our parents told us don't make a fuss, stay out of the public eye. But
that advice serves no purpose in a diverse democracy,'' said Frank Wu, an
Asian-American advocate and law professor at Howard University.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters have created the Wen Ho Lee Defense Fund. The fund has raised
about $100,000 so far for his legal bills, much of it at a fund-raiser and rally
near San Francisco. Other similar events are planned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   The case also has given rise to several sites on the World Wide Web that are
providing commentary, news stories and a chat room on Lee's plight.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American
Legal Consortium, sees Lee's case as a ``watershed'' event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This community bought into the notion that if you work hard, pay attention
to your family, you will be accepted. This case says its not true,'' Narasaki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, a 60-year-old Taiwan-born researcher, is being held without bail for
allegedly copying classified data on nuclear weapons technology to computer
tapes, seven of which are missing. Lee has said he destroyed the tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment stops short of accusing Lee of passing classified information
to a foreign government, and the scientist has pleaded innocent to 59 counts
under the Atomic Energy and Espionage Acts. If convicted, the former employee of
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has sued the FBI and the Justice and Energy departments, alleging they
violated his privacy and wrongly portrayed him as a Chinese spy.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors deny their investigation was biased and maintain the
FBI's skepticism about Lee's statements was justified because he'd lied in the
past.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Choy, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Bar
Association, said that while the facts of the case are murky, news media have
painted Lee as a spy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A trial hasn't even started but Dr. Lee is being portrayed as a dangerous
foreigner,'' Choy said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Its a difficult situation for us at this point because nobody wants get
into a full defense of Wen Ho Lee on the merits of the case just yet,'' she
added. ``But we all want to make sure he gets his due process and a lot of us
feel he hasn't been treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lee advocates say the outpouring of support for him might not have been as
strong were it not for the Democratic fund-raising scandal of 1996, which
Asian-Americans say unfairly tainted them.
</P>
<P>
	   John Huang, a former Commerce Department official and the Democratic Party's
chief fund-raiser for the Asian-American population during the 1996 election,
plead guilty to conspiracy to make illegal contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike other minority groups, organizing noisy demonstrations and making
public appeals is new to Asian-Americans, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
	   It's easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
	   While American Indians, blacks and Latinos have long protested
discrimination found in school segregation, unequal voting rights, public
accommodations and low educational levels, many of the those conditions are
foreign to the nation's 10.2 million Asian and Pacific Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Asian Americans have the highest median family income of all major census
groups -- $49,100 -- and are the best educated. Asian Americans are also most
likely to live in a household with two parents. Still, according to Choy, the
last few years have brought home the sense that all is not well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are viewed as either invisible or as a model minority group,'' he said.
``But I think we are seeing we still have some ways to go for equal treatment.''

<HEADLINE> Post Office Asks 1-Cent Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expect to pay a penny more to send cards and letters
starting early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   And the cost of mailing magazines and catalogs is expected to go up
significantly -- proposals that are stirring up a hornet's nest in the business
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Sending post cards and letters would cost 21 cents and 34 cents respectively
under new rates proposed Tuesday by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We looked at it and held off as long as we could hold off,'' said Einar V.
Dyhrkopp, chairman of the postal board of governors. He said the new rates won't
take effect until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increases average about 6 percent over all classes of mail,
Dyhrkopp said. They now go to the independent Postal Rate Commission, which will
hold hearings before ruling on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases vary among the various types of mail and some of the proposals
were not sitting well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's devastating. The average increase for (magazines) looks to be about
15 percent, which is a terrible blow,'' said Jim Cregan of the Magazine
Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   While postal officials say they have seen little impact so far from the
growth of the Internet, Gene Del Polito of the American Association for Postal
Commerce says the proposed increases would make that happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they really wanted to do something to stimulate people's interest in
moving their business to the Web, I can't think of anything better they could
have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rate increases average about 14 percent for catalogs, Del Polito said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you happen to be L.L. Bean or Land's End or anybody who does business
by catalog, the message is clear: Make your website as interactive as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Denton of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers said the proposed increases
are also above average for small, local charities.
</P>
<P>
	   And National Newspaper Association President John Sturm complained that some
of the rates for heavier pieces of advertising mail, which compete with
newspapers, were proposed for a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are always quite concerned when ... there are rate decreases proposed
for certain segments of our competitors' business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is required by law to base its rates on the cost of
handling each type of mail.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the increase in the base rate for a first-class stamp, the
charge for each additional ounce would rise from 22 cents to 23 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Priority mail would rise from $3.20 to $3.45 for the first pound, and the
first half-pound of Express Mail would increase from $11.75 to $12.30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This request is just the right amount at the right time for the Postal
Service,'' said Dyhrkopp. He said the governing board began discussing rate
increases last fall, but decided it could wait until now to act ``and still not
go in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
	   Postmaster General William Henderson stressed that the 1-cent boost in first
class mail rates is below the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The post office has a $363 million profit in fiscal 1999, which ended last
September, and is expecting to be about $100 million in the black this year,
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those are the smallest profit margins in five years, however, and rising
costs would have led the agency into the red without the planned increase.
</P>
<P>
	   United Parcel Service, one of the post office's main competitors in the
delivery business, recently announced a rate increase. Another competitor,
Federal Express, announced a 3 percent fuel surcharge, which spokesman Jesse
Bunn described as temporary.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike its competition, when the Postal Service wants to raise prices it
must seek permission from the independent Rate Commission and provide detailed
supporting documents. The commission then holds hearings and issues its
decision; the process takes 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming commission approval, the matter would return to the postal
governors in November or December.
</P>
<P>
	   The current 33-cent first-class rate took effect Jan. 10, 1999, with a
1-cent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is a semi-independent federal agency. It does not receive
tax money for operations and is expected to make enough money to break even over
time. The agency still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years the agency had sought to delay rate increases as long as
possible, with the result that when they did occur they were 3 or 4 cents.
Henderson said large business mailers have indicated to the agency they prefer
smaller increases at more frequent intervals to the larger boosts.

<HEADLINE> Wallingford lawmaker to propose legislation mandating King holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) - State Rep. Mary Mushinsky is out to force her
hometown to honor Martin Luther King Jr. with an official holiday, saying
Wallingford should not be a national embarrassment.
<P>
	   The proposed legislation would require all municipalities to recognize King
Day. Of the state's 169 municipalities, only Wallingford currently keeps its
offices open.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar bill introduced by Mushinsky last year died in committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had gotten a promise from the chairmen last year that, if nothing
changed, they would reintroduce the bill, Mushinsky, a Democrat, told the
Record-Journal of Meriden. "Little has changed."
</P>
<P>
	   The state made Martin Luther King Day a state holiday in 1986. State law
gives towns and cities the option of closing municipal offices to commemorate
the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor William Dickinson has said he believes King was a hero, but that the
12 paid holidays city employees have now are enough. He has suggested the town's
unions give up another holiday if they wish to observe King Day. Only two school
unions have agreed to the holiday exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Alex Knopp, D-Norwalk, co-chairman of the Legislature's
Government Administration and Elections Committee, said he is disappointed
Wallingford had not changed its position. He said he would take up the bill
again in the session that begins next month.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are 168 municipalities that accept that accept the state decision and
found a way to accommodate the Martin Luther King holiday in their teacher and
municipal employees contracts," Knopp said. "It is hard to believe Wallingford
could not figure out some way to resolve this if the 168 other towns have done
so."
</P>
<P>
	   Though Town Hall remains open in Wallingford, residents hold a noontime
ceremony in one of the churches on King Day. Dickinson always attends the
service.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the principal issue in the whole matter, the honoring of Dr. Martin
Luther King, and we certainly are planning to do that," Dickinson said.

<HEADLINE> Send Elian back to Cuba, protesters say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark said Tuesday
that the United States has earned the disrespect of the entire world by keeping
Elian Gonzalez in Miami instead of returning him to his father in Cuba.
<P>
	   "If we care about family at all, we really need to return him to Cuba," said
Clark, one of several speakers at a rally calling for the 6-year-old boy's
return to his native country.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 20-minute rally, marred by a blustery wind, in front of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service building here, 11 people - including a
69-year-old blind man - were arrested for blocking the entrance and charged with
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued from an inner tube off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day, after a shipwreck that killed his mother, stepfather and
others fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy has been staying with his great-uncle and other relatives in Miami.
Last week, the INS ruled that Elian's father should have custody. But on Monday,
Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain
with his U.S. relatives until March 6 so the court can hear arguments from
Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle, who is seeking temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has touched off protests in Miami and in Cuba, where Fidel Castro's
government condemned Tuesday's ruling. Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has
demanded that his son be returned.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 people protesting Tuesday, most belonging to a group called The
Committee to Demand the Return of Elian to his Father in Cuba, agree with the
boy's father.
</P>
<P>
	   "He belongs with his father, his grandparents, in Cuba," said Clark, who was
not arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwin Lewinson, a professor emeritus of history at Seton Hall University,
was among the handful placed in plastic handcuffs and carted off in an NYPD van
for booking. Lewinson, who is blind, gave his seeing eye dog, Hooper, a golden
retriever, to a friend before boarding the van.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that this is a violation of international law to keep Elian in the
United States," said Lewinson, who has been arrested several times for taking
part in demonstrations. "If he had come from any other country he probably would
have been sent back immediately."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Luis Barrios, who teaches child psychology at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice, said he was concerned with Elian's psychological welfare.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian has been given toys, a puppy, but people here aren't concerned for
him," Barrios said. "This is a political game."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar rallies and acts of civil disobedience were slated to be held
nationwide through Thursday, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton's positive rating takes 11-month drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's new home seems to come with
the same old New York view.
<P>
	   The first statewide poll since Mrs. Clinton became a New York resident found
the first lady still trailing New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In addition,
Mrs. Clinton's positive rating of 48 percent is now 20 percentage points lower
than it was in February 1999, pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist Institute for Public Opinion's poll released Tuesday found
Giuliani supported by 49 percent of registered voters compared to Mrs. Clinton's
40 percent. Eleven percent remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   But the poll of 621 registered voters conducted Sunday and Monday shouldn't
been seen as a swing for Giuliani and a slide for Mrs. Clinton, said Marist
pollster Lee Miringoff. The numbers are identical to the institute's December
poll and show only slight, consistent changes over 12 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it represents that her trial balloons have come down to earth,"
Miringoff said. "It's been a steady erosion."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the numbers reflect the difficulty Mrs. Clinton has had in the
transition from celebrity to candidate, a switch Giuliani will soon have to
make. Miringoff also noted the mayor has had a good 12 months for politics and
photo opportunities, from a fighting mosquito-born disease to cheering on the
New York Yankees as they won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   Now voters will begin to take a harder look, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's not a lot of switching among voters," he said. "The best each has
going for each other is their opponent," Miringoff said, calling the trends more
consistent than swings for either. "Now it's up to mobilization."
</P>
<P>
	   The margin for error in the poll is 4 percentage points, so the race remains
close. This week's poll marks the first time public opinion didn't change since
Marist started polling the probable Senate campaign foes 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's positive rating dropped to 48 percent of those polled. In
December her rating was 52 percent, statistically unchanged when accounting for
the poll's margin of error. Her highest rating was 68 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
	   "The numbers initially were inflated by (President Clinton's) impeachment
and other factors," said her spokesman, Howard Wolfson. "And the daily attacks
by the mayor on Hillary have been unfortunate. But it's a long campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   "As New Yorkers get to know her," countered Giuliani spokesman Bruce
Teitelbaum, "the less they like her.
</P>
<P>
	   "New Yorkers agree that Mrs. Clinton's move to Chappaqua is motivated by
cynical politics, not by any concern for New York or New Yorkers," Teitelbaum
added.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll found that 80 percent of the voters surveyed felt Mrs. Clinton
moved to New York "just to run." But Teitelbaum wouldn't try to interpret
another finding: 59 percent of Giuliani supporters would "like to see someone
else run" compared to 38 percent of Mrs. Clinton's supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not surprising," said Mrs. Clinton's Wolfson, "given the mayor's
penchant for divisiveness." Wolfson said the poll shows Giuliani could not gain
ground against Mrs. Clinton despite spending almost $1 million on ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's favorable rating is 61 percent in the latest count, statistically
unchanged from December's 60 percent or last February's 61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adding To Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress in his 2001
budget for a $2.2 billion increase in spending for a national missile defense,
mainly for an expanded arsenal of interceptor rockets to be based in Alaska or
North Dakota, defense officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just a year ago the Clinton administration added $6.6 billion to the
Pentagon's missile defense budget, and officials now estimate deployment of such
a system will cost $12.7 billion in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon argues that the United States faces a growing threat from
missile attack. Several countries hostile to the United States, including North
Korea, Iran and Iraq, are said to be seeking a capability to launch
intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. satellites can detect missile
launchings anywhere on the globe, but the United States has no means of shooting
down long-range missiles in flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threat is real, (and) it will, in all likelihood, intensify in the
coming years as countries continue to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear
capabilities,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to decide as early as July whether to go ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the system is unlikely to provide a reliable defense against
ballistic missiles and that it will require the United States to withdraw from
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which many consider the bedrock of arms
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has recommended spending another $1.9 billion to pay for an arsenal of
100 interceptors, according to officials who discussed the matter on condition
they not be identified. The current budget pays only for 20 interceptors, which
would not be enough to quash an attack of more than a few long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to submit his budget to Congress on Feb. 7. Kenneth Bacon,
spokesman for Cohen, said Tuesday he could not discuss details of the budget in
advance, but he mentioned that the Pentagon's overall weapons procurement
account would increase to ``within a whisper'' of $60 billion, from $56 billion
in the budget year ending Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also recommended adding $300 million for more missile defense testing,
more spare parts and construction of a second missile launcher for interceptor
tests from the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands. Those steps were
among numerous recommendations by a missile defense review panel headed by
retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, which said the program was on a ``highly
demanding'' schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Welch report, published last November, said Clinton would be in position
to determine by July the feasibility of a national missile defense but not
whether the technology and equipment are ready to be deployed. The final version
of the interceptor, for example, is not scheduled to be tested in flight until
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   A prototype interceptor is to be launched from Kwajalein next Tuesday. The
test is designed to demonstrate the Raytheon Corp.-built interceptor's ability
to receive in-flight targeting data from military satellites and radars, then
steer itself into the path of a mock warhead arching through space and destroy
it.
</P>
<P>
	   The first test of the prototype interceptor, last October, hit the target,
but the critical data links in that test were pre-programmed before the rocket
was launched. In next week's test, the interceptor is to receive data from a new
radar stationed on the Kwajalein range shortly before it separates from the
rocket booster, about 1,400 miles from its target in space.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Bacon, asked about the Jan. 18 test, said although the overall
project is on track, it would be unrealistic to expect success from every
intercept test.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has said there must be two successful intercept tests before it
starts construction of a missile defense site, most likely in Alaska. North
Dakota also is an option, but the Alaska site would cover a wider area.

<HEADLINE> Court Shields States in Age Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whittling away more of the federal government's power
over states, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that state employees cannot go into
federal court to sue over age bias.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said Congress exceeded its authority when allowing
such lawsuits against the states under 1974 amendments to the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act of 1967. The ruling killed three separate federal cases from
Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal law cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being
sued in federal courts, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's ruling extended a series of recent decisions in which the court --
by identical votes each time -- ignited what legal scholars have called a
states' rights revolution by eroding the federal government's sway over states.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining O'Connor again were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Once again left in
dissent were the court's more liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said Congress does not enjoy the same power to enforce the 14th
Amendment's equal-protection guarantee when seeking to protect people against
age discrimination as it does when the bias is based on race, national origin,
religion or sex.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Older persons ... have not been subjected to a history of purposeful
unequal treatment,'' O'Connor said. ``Old age also does not define a discrete
and insular minority because all persons, if they live out their normal life,
will experience it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie McCann, an attorney for the AARP, accused the justices of making
protection against age bias ``a second-class civil right.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once you are old, there's no going back. In that way, it's just as
immutable as race,'' she said. ``The justices have lifetime tenure. It's easy
for them to say 'What's the big deal?'''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision did not discuss whether another federal anti-bias law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, could be enforced with federal lawsuits against
state employers. That determination must await some future ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The court announced its decision only minutes before hearing arguments in
another states' rights case -- a dispute over Congress' power to give rape
victims the right to sue their attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision in that Virginia case is expected by late June, and nothing in
the argument session indicated a shift in the court's previously stated, 5-4
distaste for Congress venturing into areas traditionally handled by the states.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's decision spelled defeat for three separate groups of state
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the three disputes, 36 current and former faculty members and
librarians at Florida State University and Florida International University,
including lead plaintiff J. Daniel Kimel Jr., sued the Florida Board of Regents.
They said age bias was why they lost out on certain salary increases given to
younger faculty members.
</P>
<P>
	   In another, associate professors Roderick MacPherson and Marvin Narz sued
state-run Montevallo University in Alabama. They alleged that younger faculty
members were treated more favorably when it came to salaries and promotions.
</P>
<P>
	   And in a third, Florida prison guard Wellingron Dickson said he lost out on
a promotion largely because of his age.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal law protects workers over 40.
</P>
<P>
	   In barring all three federal cases, the court said state employees subjected
to bias are not without any legal remedy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``State employees are protected by state age-discrimination statutes and may
recover money damages from their state employers in almost every state of the
union,'' O'Connor said. In a footnote, she then listed specific laws from 48
states.
</P>
<P>
	   But no law from South Dakota or Alabama was listed -- more bad news for the
two Montevallo teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``States may discriminate on the basis of age without offending the 14th
Amendment if the age classification in question is rationally related to a
legitimate state interest,'' O'Connor said. ``The rationality commanded ... does
not require states to match age distinctions and the legitimate interests they
serve with razorlike precision.''

<HEADLINE> Leader Wants No Gun Ri Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
   By KYONG-HWA SEOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Already close ties between the United States and
South Korea could improve if Washington conducts a thorough inquiry into an
alleged mass killing of refugees by American soldiers during the Korean War,
President Kim Dae-jung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The way the United States investigates what happened at No Gun Ri village in
July 1950 will affect the relationship between the two allies, Kim told U.S.
Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The No Gun Ri incident is a sensitive issue but all truth should be
clearly brought out so that South Korea-U.S. relations should not be damaged and
will instead be enhanced,'' Kim was quoted as saying by his chief spokesman,
Park June-young.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States remains South Korea's closest ally and still keeps 37,000
U.S. soldiers stationed in the country under a defense treaty designed to ward
off any threat from communist North Korea, which invaded the South in 1950. The
Korean War ended three years later without a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera arrived in South Korea on Sunday for talks on how to coordinate the
two governments' separate investigations of the No Gun Ri incident. On Monday,
Caldera and aides visited No Gun Ri and met a dozen villagers who say they
survived the alleged mass killing.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting Kim, Caldera said in a statement that the two countries agreed
that the review of No Gun Ri ``should be completed as expeditiously as possible
without sacrificing thoroughness and accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Caldera met Chung Hae-joo, South Korea's chief government
policy coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that survivors suffered grievously,'' Caldera said at a joint
news conference with Chung. ``The central claim of No Gun Ri makes it unique.
That is the claim that it was an intentional taking of innocent lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press, citing dozens of villagers and U.S. veterans, reported
in September that hundreds of Korean civilians were killed at No Gun Ri by
American soldiers who feared North Korean soldiers were infiltrating groups of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and South Korea had previously dismissed the claims, but
opened investigations after the AP report was published.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, South Koreans have come forward with more stories of alleged
mass killings of civilians by U.S. troops. Historians say Korean forces on both
sides of the conflict committed atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera told the AP on Sunday that the United States could not study ``every
firefight, every battle'' of the war. Caldera said all loss of life was
regrettable, but emphasized the need to establish whether civilians were killed
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
	   During the war, the United States led a 16-nation U.N. force in defending
South Korea against North Korea, which was backed by China and the Soviet Union.
About 55,000 Americans were killed and more than 8,000 are still listed as
missing.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High Star Toys Inc. will pay a $100,000 civil penalty for
importing children's toys and art materials that fail to meet federal safety
standards for labeling and small parts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which announced the decision
Tuesday, charged the company with importing for sale more than 55,000 toys and
auxiliary materials, including toy telephones with small parts but no warning
labels and stamp sets that did not identify hazardous ingredients.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the products, shipped between September 1995 and August 1999, were
sent to stores but were stopped at the docks where they were imported or at High
Star's Los Angeles warehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles-based company also signed a court order that prohibits
trafficking in mislabeled hazardous substances.
</P>
<P>
	   High Star Toys admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. In 1995, the
company paid a $45,000 civil penalty for importing toys with small parts.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Town Gives Up Goat Toss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANGANESES DE LA POLVOROSA, Spain (AP) -- Under pressure from animal rights
activists, the northwestern town of Manganeses de la Polvorosa will forgo the
annual tradition of tossing a goat from a bell tower, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tradition holds that the annual festival of St. Vincent -- the town's patron
saint -- cannot begin unless a goat is thrown 50 feet from the bell tower and is
safely caught in a tarp.
</P>
<P>
	   The event, which has attracted fierce protests from animal rights
campaigners in the past, was scheduled for Jan. 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The councilors of Manganeses, however, said the town will not take
responsibility for the ``behaviors of the participants in the spectacle,'' the
state news agency EFE reported.
</P>
<P>
	   According to EFE, the town was fined about $150 last year by the regional
government after the National Association of Animal Welfare and Protection filed
a complaint about the throw.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, protests against the goat-launch persuaded the local governor to
ban the toss, and villagers had to content themselves with using ropes to lower
the goat. A year later the ropes were abandoned and the ban defied. The ban is
still technically in place but is usually ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   The origins of the ritual are unclear, but according to one legend, a
priest's goat -- whose milk fed the poor -- accidentally fell from the bell
tower and was saved by villagers holding a blanket.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us appoints top executive from upscale FAO Schwarz as its  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Toys R Us Inc., a merchandiser to the masses, on Tuesday
picked the top executive from exclusive FAO Schwarz to try to lead it to a
recovery from sagging sales and profits.
<P>
	   John Eyler's appointment as president and chief executive of Toys R Us was
lauded by analysts because of his extensive background in the toy business. But
there was some concern on Wall Street whether he had the know-how to lead a
turnaround of a 1,500 store chain.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us shares fell as much as 9 percent in early trading Tuesday to
$11.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. By midafternoon, shares were down 62
1/2 cents, or by 5 percent, at $12.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler comes on board after a tough year for Toys R Us, with its sales and
profits coming under pressure. Once the nation's No. 1 selling toy chain, Toys R
Us now trails giant discounter Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Paramus, N.J.-based company warned that it would miss 1999
earnings forecasts and reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell 2
percent during the holiday season, due in part to some shortages of popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its business, Toys R Us has been renovating its U.S.
stores, creating a brighter layout that is easier to navigate. It also has been
stepping up its efforts on the Internet to better compete with online rivals
Amazon.com and eToys.
</P>
<P>
	   But both areas still need tremendous work.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has about three-quarters of its 710 U.S. toy stores left to
redesign. It also must drastically improve the delivery and customer service
systems of its Web sites, Toysrus.com, after many complaints during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a lot ahead of this company to do," said Margaret Whitfield, a toy
analyst at the investment firm Tucker Anthony. "I am anxious to see what Eyler
will do to get this company back on track."
</P>
<P>
	   Some concern over his appointment stems from the fact that Eyler comes from
a toy chain far different than Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
	   While Toys R Us is best-known for its super-sized stores stacked high with
toys like Barbie dolls and board games, FAO Schwarz fills its stores with
expensive toys, such as the $8,500 Mercedes kids cars or limited edition Steiff
stuffed bears.
</P>
<P>
	   FAO Schwarz doesn't run sales or discount promotions, and many of its 42
stores are located in posh addresses, such as on Fifth Avenue in New York and at
the high-end Forum Shops mall in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   While the differences in the Toys R Us and FAO Schwarz businesses raised
eyebrows, analysts also were quick to point out the successes that Eyler has had
since he joined FAO as its chairman and CEO in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He is credited with updating the upscale toy chain's image, improving its
profitability and boosting its selection of exclusive toy lines. About 70
percent of the toys found in FAO Schwarz aren't sold elsewhere, up from 30
percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Going to an FAO is always a first-class shopping experience. Parents and
kids walk out of there loving the experience they had in the stores," said Jim
Silver, publisher of The Toy Book, a toy industry trade magazine. "It would be
great if he could do the same at Toys R Us."
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler said he hoped Toys R Us could expand its exclusive deals with
toymakers. In addition, he said that he'd like to follow a practice at FAO
Schwarz of stocking products of smaller toymakers, businesses that have had
problems making inroads at large toy chains.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he'd like
Toys R Us to develop its own products.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts pointed out that Eyler's experience extends beyond brick-and-mortar
stores. FAO Schwarz, a division of Vendex NV of Amsterdam, Netherlands, also
operates a catalog and a Web site, and Eyler's expertise in those areas should
be an asset as Toysrus.com looks to improve its online business.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us has been operating without a permanent CEO since August, when
Robert Nakasone resigned abruptly. Since then, chairman Michael Goldstein has
been acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old Eyler will take the helm of Toys R Us on Monday. John
Barbour will remain CEO of Toysrus.com, reporting to Eyler.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its U.S. toy stores, Toys R Us also operates 454 international toy
stores, 205 Kids R Us clothing stores, 130 Babies R Us stores and 45 Imaginarium
specialty toy stores.

<HEADLINE> Man Sues Viacom Over Dog Theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Baltimore film producer has filed a $30 million lawsuit
accusing Viacom of stealing his dog.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Fisher claims that Steve and Blue, the characters in the popular
children's TV show "Blue's Clues," are based on a comic strip he developed as a
child in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said he began publishing "Steve and Bluey" in his hometown newspaper,
the Crofton Neighborhood Gazette, in 1989 when he turned 18, and produced a show
for cable and radio before submitting it to Viacom in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "He spent half his life developing this concept, these characters," said
Harold M. Walter, Fisher's attorney. "On his 18th birthday, he filed for the
copyright."
</P>
<P>
	   The Circuit Court lawsuit filed Jan. 7 says Viacom encouraged him for six
months, then told him the materials would be kept on file. Fisher took that to
mean the company wasn't interested. But three years later, a relative told him
the show was on Nickelodeon, which is owned by Viacom.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not saying that 'Blue's Clues' is Steve and Bluey, but the characters
are clearly based on Steve and Bluey," Walter said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Viacom attorney did not immediately return a call.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down '12.72; Nasdaq Down 75.77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as rising bond yields drew
investors away from stocks. Shares of Internet companies led the Nasdaq
composite index to a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 12.72 at 11,559.48, dipping below its record close
of 11,572.20, set Monday. Earlier in the session, the Dow had risen as much as
90 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was off 14.00 at 1,443.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 75.77 at
3,973.90.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks fell today as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.68
percent from 6.58 percent late Monday. The weakness in the bond market was
spurred by growing concerns that the robust growth of the U.S. economy will
force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1
and 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 in a bid to keep inflation from
escalating, and continued signs of economic growth have convinced many
economists that an increase in February is almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, the bond market has been much more sensitive than stocks
to the possibility of further rate hikes. Today, however, bond yields were
nearing the highest levels since Sept. 1997, drawing some investors away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising bond yields can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part
because they can present an appealing alternative to investors looking for
stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell 7 to 64 1/4. Analysts said investors were struggling with the
notion that AOL, a high-flying Internet leader that has commanded premium stock
prices, will now behave more like a traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, fell
33 7/64 to 402 61/64. The Internet service provider was among the market's
strongest performers in 1999, and traders said the company will have to turn in
an especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Lycos fell 7 47/64 to 72 17/64.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business, fell
7/16 to 29 11/16 after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly
short of Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose 4 3/4 to 90 1/2,
buoying the Dow and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its
rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose 1 13/16 to 60 5/8, also benefiting from an upgrade from
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend appears to be continuing today, said Brian G. Belski, chief
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 807.70 million shares, behind Monday's
afternoon pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.74 to 496.15.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A piece of one of the great rhythm &AMP; blues music
catalogs is on the auction block so Ronald Isley, a member of the Isley
Brothers, can pay back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Isley is in Chapter 7, or involuntary bankruptcy, due in large part to an
Internal Revenue Service claim of nearly $5 million. His assets are scheduled to
be auctioned Jan. 18 in bankruptcy court in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The most valuable property is his one-third interest in the Isley Brothers'
music catalog. Ronald and his two brothers, Rudolph and the late O'Kelly, wrote
more than 200 songs, including "Twist and Shout," "It's Your Thing" and "That
Lady."
</P>
<P>
	   EMI Recorded Music has put in a bid of $4.1 million to acquire Ronald's
portion of songwriter and publishing rights. Under a 1980 agreement, EMI already
owns a 50 percent interest in the publishing rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Isley, who opposes the sale, wants to work out a deal with the Pullman
Group. The company invented the Bowie bonds, named after rocker David Bowie,
under which music assets are pledged to secure bonds and the debt is repaid from
royalties.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal's birthday dinner raises $4 million for charity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A dinner honoring Cardinal John O'Connor's legacy on his
80th birthday has raised $4 million for charity.
<P>
	   Between 1,400 and 1,500 people are expected to attend the dinner Saturday at
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tickets were $1,000 a head but many of the guests
made additional contributions, according to the cardinal's spokesman, Joe
Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
	   The money will go to various Catholic charities, including the support of
parochial schools in the archdiocese. "That's been one of his top priorities, to
help preserve Catholic education in the archdiocese, so part of the money from
this will go to that," Zwilling said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Proceeds from the dinner will also be used to fund a seminary position named
for the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
	   The position, the John Cardinal O'Connor Distinguished Chair in Hebrew
Studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, is designed to educate future
priests about the shared scriptural heritage of Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   Fostering better relations between Catholics and Jews has been one of the
cardinal's priorities. On Yom Kippur last year, he sent a letter to Jewish
leaders expressing "my own abject sorrow for any member of the Catholic Church,
high or low, who may have harmed you or your forebears." Nobel Prize winner Elie
Wiesel published the letter in a New York Times ad, saying: "For the prince of
the church to say the things he does, it's very strong."
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner will feature tributes to the cardinal and a video about his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the clergy in the room will be seven cardinals, six archbishops and a
number of bishops from all over the country. The guest list includes some of the
men who have been mentioned as possible successors to O'Connor, including
Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis; Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the
archdiocese for the U.S. military; and Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former
top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the clergy are expected to be present when O'Connor presides over
Mass the next day at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal had a brain tumor removed in September and has missed a number
of public appearances, including Masses, since then.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor has hinted that he expects to be replaced soon by the pope. He
offered his resignation on his 75th birthday as the church requires but it was
not accepted then. Cardinals lose their power to vote for a new pope when they
turn 80, which has led to speculation that his resignation will be accepted
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is the oldest active bishop in the United States and as leader of
the New York Archdiocese's flock of 2.4 million, he is regarded as one of the
most powerful Catholics in America.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Asks 1-Cent Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expect to pay a penny more to send cards and letters
starting early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   And the cost of mailing magazines and catalogs is expected to go up
significantly -- proposals that are stirring up a hornet's nest in the business
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Sending post cards and letters would cost 21 cents and 34 cents respectively
under new rates proposed Tuesday by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We looked at it and held off as long as we could hold off,'' said Einar V.
Dyhrkopp, chairman of the postal board of governors. He said the new rates won't
take effect until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increases average about 6 percent over all classes of mail,
Dyhrkopp said. They now go to the independent Postal Rate Commission, which will
hold hearings before ruling on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases vary among the various types of mail and some of the proposals
were not sitting well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's devastating. The average increase for (magazines) looks to be about
15 percent, which is a terrible blow,'' said Jim Cregan of the Magazine
Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   While postal officials say they have seen little impact so far from the
growth of the Internet, Gene Del Polito of the American Association for Postal
Commerce says the proposed increases would make that happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they really wanted to do something to stimulate people's interest in
moving their business to the Web, I can't think of anything better they could
have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rate increases average about 14 percent for catalogs, Del Polito said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you happen to be L.L. Bean or Land's End or anybody who does business
by catalog, the message is clear: Make your website as interactive as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Denton of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers said the proposed increases
are also above average for small, local charities.
</P>
<P>
	   And Newspaper Association of America President John Sturm complained that
some of the rates for heavier pieces of advertising mail, which compete with
newspapers, were proposed for a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are always quite concerned when ... there are rate decreases proposed
for certain segments of our competitors' business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is required by law to base its rates on the cost of
handling each type of mail.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the increase in the base rate for a first-class stamp, the
charge for each additional ounce would rise from 22 cents to 23 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Priority mail would rise from $3.20 to $3.45 for the first pound, and the
first half-pound of Express Mail would increase from $11.75 to $12.30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This request is just the right amount at the right time for the Postal
Service,'' said Dyhrkopp. He said the governing board began discussing rate
increases last fall, but decided it could wait until now to act ``and still not
go in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
	   Postmaster General William Henderson stressed that the 1-cent boost in first
class mail rates is below the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The post office has a $363 million profit in fiscal 1999, which ended last
September, and is expecting to be about $100 million in the black this year,
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those are the smallest profit margins in five years, however, and rising
costs would have led the agency into the red without the planned increase.
</P>
<P>
	   United Parcel Service, one of the post office's main competitors in the
delivery business, recently announced a rate increase. Another competitor,
Federal Express, announced a 3 percent fuel surcharge, which spokesman Jesse
Bunn described as temporary.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike its competition, when the Postal Service wants to raise prices it
must seek permission from the independent Rate Commission and provide detailed
supporting documents. The commission then holds hearings and issues its
decision; the process takes 10 months.	   Assuming commission approval, the
matter would return to the postal governors in November or December.
</P>
<P>
	   The current 33-cent first-class rate took effect Jan. 10, 1999, with a
1-cent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is a semi-independent federal agency. It does not receive
tax money for operations and is expected to make enough money to break even over
time. The agency still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years the agency had sought to delay rate increases as long as
possible, with the result that when they did occur they were 3 or 4 cents.
Henderson said large business mailers have indicated to the agency they prefer
smaller increases at more frequent intervals to the larger boosts.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Does Better Than Anticipated  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER MUELLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- For now, the cheering over Brazil's resurgent
economy is mostly for what didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
	   The currency didn't collapse. Foreign investment didn't evaporate. Inflation
didn't go through the roof. Unemployment isn't getting worse, and the recession
wasn't as long as predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   All of which seemed inevitable a year ago, when panicky investors sent
billions of dollars out of the country. Facing economic ruin, Brazil let its
currency float freely against the dollar on Jan. 15, 1999, sending the real
plunging from 83 cents to 45 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the low point of a tailspin that began with the Asian crisis in
1997 and worsened with the Russian meltdown a year later. Brazil's no-win choice
appeared to be between high inflation or recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Somehow, Brazil avoided both -- Latin America's largest economy now is doing
better than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   But sidestepping disaster was just a first step. Experts say the economy
must grow 5.5 percent a year to keep pace with the number of Brazilians entering
the job market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One has to be gratified by the sense of confidence returning much more
rapidly than I think most people would have expected nine months ago,'' U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on a visit in December. But, he added:
``There are very large challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the run-up to Christmas and millennium celebrations, the signs of
improvement were evident.
</P>
<P>
	   Storeowners in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, reported sales were better
than in 1998. Alencar Burti, head of the Sao Paulo Commercial Association, said
retailers cited a host of positive factors, including falling lending rates,
lower unemployment and a generally improved economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
	   The auto industry turned out 31 percent more cars in November than a year
earlier. And manufacturers predict sales will jump nearly 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The euphoria was palpable at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, where the Bovespa
index last year shot up an astounding 70 percent in dollar terms. As Brazil
looks more like a good risk, foreign investors are arriving in droves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are anticipating what will happen,'' said Walter Stoeppelwerth of
the Fleming Graphus bank in Rio de Janeiro. ``They want to be in Brazil because
they think it's got a lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to expectations, foreign investors didn't abandon Brazil in the
dark days of 1999. Foreign direct investment came in at nearly $29 billion --
rivaling investment in China -- and should be only slightly less this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation was another pleasant surprise: It was 8.94 percent last year,
within the range promised under a $41.5 billion International Monetary Fund
bailout package. This year it's expected to be 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the credit for the turnaround goes to Central Bank President Arminio
Fraga, who took over in February. He rode herd on speculators and gradually cut
the prime lending rate from 45 percent to 19 percent. Despite a few bumps, the
currency slowly strengthened to around 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the weather helped -- a big harvest offset a slump in industry.
Economists who predicted the economy would shrink now say it grew slightly last
year, and could jump 3 to 4 percentage points in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Things are going a lot better than expected,'' said Alexandre Barros, head
of Brasilia-based consultants Early Warning. ``It may be a passing euphoria, but
people are more optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the jobless rate is 7.4 percent and isn't expected to improve this
year. Many workers earn close to the monthly minimum wage of $75.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF agreement has also left Brazil in a bind. The government has
promised large budget surpluses, which means tight spending and high taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   For many, the recovery has yet to take hold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crisis may be over for the president, but not here,'' said Maria
Pacheco de Oliveira, the manager of a mini-mart. ``This may be nonsense, but I
preferred the times of high inflation. At least people had money. Now, everyone
is broke.''

<HEADLINE> Former Prince Helps Flooded Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- The artist formerly known as Prince donated
$37,000 to the flood-ravaged town that bears his old name.
</P>
<P>
	   He contributed the money after reading articles about the devastation
wreaked on the town of 2,100 in September by Hurricane Floyd. Sam Knight,
Princeville zoning officer, said the money will pay for building materials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although $37,000 will not go very far when you talk about building
supplies, we're very grateful to him for thinking about us," Knight said. "Even
though you can't tell it from his music, he's a very religious man who wanted no
publicity about his gift to the town."
</P>
<P>
	   Prince sent a representative to town to assess its needs, town spokeswoman
Kim Burwell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurricane Floyd drenched eastern North Carolina with 20 inches of rain Sept.
16, practically wiping out Princeville. Almost 100 residents have returned since
water and sewage services were repaired.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court balks at city lawyer's claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Tough questions from appeals court judges greeted a
lawyer who said Tuesday that the First Amendment was not the issue at stake in
the city's attempt to cut funding for the Brooklyn Museum because of the
"Sensation" art exhibit.
<P>
	   "This is not a First Amendment case, your honor," said city attorney Leonard
Koerner in an argument over legal issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "It isn't?" snapped Justice John Walker of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Jon Newman, another member of the three-judge panel, called the
statement possibly "the most extraordinary thing" he had heard from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges reserved decision. They must consider whether to uphold a federal
judge's ruling in Brooklyn that found the city's decision to freeze its $7.2
million annual contribution to the museum violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   They also must determine whether the case belongs in state court rather than
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vowed to cut off the funding after a controversy
erupted over the exhibit, titled "Sensation: Young British Artists From the
Saatchi Collection."
</P>
<P>
	   Various groups had protested to the mayor about Chris Ofili's painting,
titled "The Holy Virgin Mary." The painting depicts Mary with African features
and includes a shellacked clump of elephant dung and magazine cutouts of female
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
	   The show opened on Oct. 2 and closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner had barely begun delivering his argument before the appeals court
panel when he faced a barrage of fast questions from Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge asked why the city had begun what amounted to eviction
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is it really the city's position that the Brooklyn Museum should take its
entire collection out of that building now?" Newman asked. "Your words and your
complaint say so but I'm not sure you mean it."
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner conceded that the city would like to negotiate a solution with the
museum, but only after a judge had found in its favor.
</P>
<P>
	   At the very least, he said, the city would like to stop funding the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   With that issue behind it, the appeals court then turned toward the city's
claim that the exhibit was not appropriate for school children and thus violated
the museum's pledge to help educate children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is every book in the New York Public Library appropriate for school
children?" Newman asked. "Is the library next?"
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner said the city would not attack the library for the content of its
books but would consider action if it housed an exhibit celebrating the Klu Klux
Klan or homophobia.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman, returning to the issue of educating children, said he was sure the
state Legislature in appropriating money for the arts did not intend for
exhibits to be only as exciting and provocative as children could handle.
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner said he suspected the Legislature did not anticipate an exhibit such
as the Brooklyn exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum attorney Floyd Abrams said the city wanted only to punish the museum
for its exhibit, ruining a 100-year relationship that included numerous
accolades from the city heralding the museum as one of the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams said even the notion that an eviction would force the museum to move
to California or to New Jersey was "so bizarre that it is a basis for
considering that this whole thing is nothing more than an effort to punish."
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner, though, said the case was about how far an institution can go with
the First Amendment and what its role is to the community and its children.
</P>
<P>
	   "We funded this museum," he said. "Let's assume that it celebrated the Klu
Klux Klan or the Holocaust or homophobia. I don't think the court would be
saying we'd be required to fund it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't be so sure," Newman said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki calls for a $78 billion state budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Quoting Ronald Reagan and boasting of his own record
as a fiscal conservative, Gov. George Pataki proposed Tuesday that New York
spend nearly $78 billion in its next fiscal year.
<P>
	   Pataki told state legislators that New York stands at a fiscal crossroads as
they consider his budget for the 2000-01 fiscal year beginning April 1. They can
either consolidate and further the gains the state has made in his five years as
governor or backslide into overspending and overtaxing, Pataki warned.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are the showcase of the future," Pataki said, quoting Reagan. "And it is
within our power to mold that future, this year and for decades to come. It can
be as grand and as great as we make it."
</P>
<P>
	   The aim, Pataki said in his own words, is to create the "kind of New York we
want our children to inherit."
</P>
<P>
	   A $78 billion budget would be 5.5 percent larger than the current
fiscal-year spending plan. Pataki conceded that would be more than the projected
inflation rate for the next year, but he said the numbers are skewed by the
inclusion of $2 billion in rebates due property taxpayers in fiscal 2000-01
under the "STAR" program.
</P>
<P>
	   Those rebates are classified as state spending when they really are not,
Pataki argued.
</P>
<P>
	   A better gauge, the governor said, is the proposed size of the state's
general fund - $37.9 billion. That fund is comprised of money generated through
state taxes and fees. Pataki said it would grow by only 2.3 percent in fiscal
2000-01, or by less than the expected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a budget this year which I think is just a great budget," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few surprises in Pataki's new spending plan: his office had
dribbled out the chief initiatives over the past several days or high points had
been outlined in his State of the State address to legislators last week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki, for the first time, did say the state would end the current
fiscal year with a budget surplus of $625 million. He urged the Legislature to
use any surpluses to reduce the state's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "If recent history teaches us anything, it's that government has the
capacity to gobble up $625 million in the blink of an eye," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor urged the Legislature to pass the centerpiece item in his $700
million tax-cut plan, a phase-out of the state's gross receipts tax on utility
bills. Pataki said lawmakers should eliminate the tax first for manufacturers,
retroactive to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Other new elements in Pataki's proposal called for the state to spend $12.9
billion on public schools - up $355 million or about 3 percent over the
current-year aid levels; tripling to $750 million the amount of money in reserve
for debt reduction; and instituting a debt reform package including the
elimination of taking on new debt without prior voter approval.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Pataki urged the creation of a new Department of Justice by merging the
Division of State Police, the Department of Correctional Services and other
agencies concerned with crime and corrections; the building of a new
maximum-security state prison at an undetermined site; the renewal of driver's
licenses once every eight years instead of five years and the entry of New York
into the multi-state lottery game known as Powerball.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next several weeks, legislators and their analysts will pore over
Pataki's proposal and hold budget hearings before each chamber will formulate
changes. It has been 16 years since lawmakers and the governor completed passage
on a new state budget prior to the April 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   It was quickly evident Tuesday that Pataki's education spending plan would
be the most controversial of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said that far from
providing for a $335 million school aid increase, the Republican governor's
budget would actually provide nearly $900 million less for schools by not
carrying over appropriated, but unspent, money from the current fiscal year to
the next one.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has given us nice rhetoric on education but he hasn't put the
dollars behind it," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver also was cool to Pataki's proposals to create a new state Department
of Justice, saying he was worried parole services would lose out under such an
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Democrat, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, questioned whether
Pataki was actually keeping general fund under the rate of inflation. McCall
said the governor was shifting some money "off-budget" so it wouldn't be
recorded as spending, even though the money will most likely be expended.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno,
said "by and large, we think the governor submitted a great budget." But Bruno
also said Senate Republicans think there should be more money for education and
more tax cuts than Pataki proposed.

<HEADLINE> General Mills To Donate Up to $1M  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- General Mills has launched a new campaign to fight
cancer, but this time the company isn't keeping the specifics of its offer under
wraps.
</P>
<P>
	   General Mills said Tuesday it will donate up to $1 million to the American
Cancer Society, 50 cents for each card mailed in by Oct. 1 from the outside of
specially-marked boxes of Cheerios, Wheaties and Total cereals.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is the first on-package fund-raising effort by the American
Cancer Society and marks the first time the organization has partnered with a
food company, General Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a cancer-fighting campaign by the Golden Valley-based company last year,
General Mills promised to donate 50 cents to breast cancer research for each lid
returned from specially marked containers of Yoplait yogurt.

<HEADLINE> Russians Probe Shooting at Embassy  </HEADLINE>
   By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Military prosecutors in Moscow launched a criminal probe
Tuesday into how a drunken Russian soldier sneaked into the U.S. Embassy
compound, prompting a U.S. Marine guard to shoot and wound him.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldier, 19-year-old Yevgeny Ivanov, broke into the compound Monday
evening and tried to take a car, which he then crashed, the Russian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. A Marine guard was involved in the
shooting, said an embassy spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was warned several times to stop. He was subdued by force,'' an embassy
statement said of the intruder.
</P>
<P>
	   The director general of the Sklifosofsky Hospital, Alexander Yermolov, said
Tuesday that the Russian soldier suffered five bullet wounds to his cheek, jaw,
chest and forearm and was in stable condition following an operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry said Ivanov was accompanied by another soldier from his
unit, whom it identified as 22-year-old Yevgeny Tailakov. It said Tailakov
stayed outside the embassy fence during the incident, fled and was detained
about two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Both soldiers had deserted their military construction unit, according to
Russian news reports. The Foreign Ministry said they were heavily intoxicated at
the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the driver aimed the car
at an embassy guard, who jumped on the hood. Diplomatic security agents ordered
the driver in Russian and English to stop, but the driver refused and rammed
several vehicles including the ambassador's limousine, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver then drove the car into an occupied guard booth and tried to run
down the guard as he fled, at which point ``several shots were fired at the
driver,'' Rubin said, without specifying who fired the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The military prosecutor's office in Moscow said it had opened a criminal
probe against Ivanov on suspicion of stealing a vehicle. If convicted, he faces
up to three years in prison, while desertion may add to his term.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement cited by the Interfax news agency, the prosecutor's office
said there were no immediate reason to suspect ``that the U.S. Marine who opened
fire at the soldier had acted inadequately.''
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the latest in a series of security incidents around the
embassy, an imposing yellow and white building that faces the busy Garden Ring
thoroughfare not far from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   On March 28, gunmen armed with grenade-launchers and an assault rifle
sprayed gunfire at the main building before being driven off by police firing
pistols.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack was believed linked to protests against NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia and followed several days of noisy demonstrations during which
protesters pelted the embassy with eggs and paint.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1995, an attacker fired a rocket-propelled grenade into an
empty embassy office less than a month after a bomb was found and dismantled
near the building. Another bomb damaged a car near the embassy about a year ago
following telephone threats over U.S. attacks on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Fox Hopes for Better Season  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fox hopes to clear away the rubble of its
disastrous television season through new deals with producers David E. Kelley
and Michael Crichton and by swearing off police chases and marauding animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The network has slumped badly in the ratings this year, with all of its new
fall series failing. Its only bright spot came Sunday, when the comedy "Malcolm
in the Middle" had a bigger audience than any Fox premiere in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandy Grushow, named two months ago to oversee the network, partly blames
Fox's downfall on shocking reality specials like "When Animals Attack."
</P>
<P>
	   They drew viewers, but at a price: They sealed Fox's image as a purveyor of
what Grushow called garbage.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just feel right now that we've got to get away from this stuff," he
said. "As powerful as it is in terms of giving us numbers, we believe it really
is hurting what we are trying to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow has pulled the plug on one particularly gruesome idea: Fox was
considering filming the crash of an empty 747 jet in the Mojave Desert as a
"sweeps" month stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Fox viewers won't see the genre completely disappear. Grushow said Fox
wants to concentrate on "entertainment reality," things like game shows or a
planned summer series that follows a real high school senior class.
</P>
<P>
	   And since Fox has already spent a lot of money developing the colorful film
clip specials, a few of them will make it on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just have to be real discriminating about what we put on the air," he
said, "more discriminating than we have been."
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow is also in charge of the production company Twentieth Century Fox
Television, an arrangement some consider a conflict of interest. It means he is
running a network at the same time he is overseeing Twentieth, which sells shows
to competing networks.
</P>
<P>
	   But it paid off with the announcement of a new deal with Kelley, the
Emmy-winning producer of "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice." Kelley will continue
his association with Twentieth Century Fox and give the Fox network the first
look at any series he develops.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox also said it had agreed with Crichton, producer of "ER" and creator of
"Jurassic Park," to produce a drama series that will begin this fall. Fox has
other drama development deals with "Titanic" director James Cameron and "Sex and
the City" producer Darren Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow said he doesn't know whether "The X-Files" will return for an eighth
season. It is not clear whether star David Duchovny could be persuaded to
continue, though co-star Gillian Anderson is signed for another year. Fox
intends to hold her to that deal if creator Chris Carter wants to continue even
without Duchovny, Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no better than 50-50, but our agenda is to get it back for an eighth
season," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox also hopes to keep viewers from fleeing during the summer rerun season
by beginning some fall shows early, presenting summer-themed "Beverly Hills
90210" episodes and running concert specials by Britney Spears and Santana.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military To Aid Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy amphibious landing ship USS Tortuga left its
Norfolk, Va., home base Tuesday en route to Venezuela to help clear a section of
coastal road damaged by devastating floods that hit Venezuela in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered two Navy ships to Venezuela, and
about 450 Marine and Navy engineers will be involved in the two-month aid
effort, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. The second ship is another
landing ship, the USS Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   About 12 miles of the road must be cleared to allow emergency relief to
reach coastal cities, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tortuga headed to Morehead City, N.C., to pick up engineering equipment
and is expected to arrive in Venezuelan waters early next week. After offloading
the equipment, the ship will sail to Roosevelt Roads naval station in Puerto
Rico to pick up Marine engineers and return to Venezuela, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nashville is to leave Norfolk on Wednesday and take the same route as
the Tortuga in providing engineers and equipment such as bulldozers, tractors
and engineering equipment. The Nashville is to remain off Venezuela to support
the road-clearing project until the end of February.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as investors jockeyed for price position a day ahead of
key reports by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

<P>
	   Corn prices dipped in a wave of farmer selling after reaching fresh
two-month highs in the morning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> SEC Settles Case Against Informix  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday it
has settled a case alleging that Informix Corp. fraudulently inflated company
revenues and earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC found that former Informix employees inflated revenues by $295
million and earnings by $244 million between 1994 and the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   No monetary fines or penalties were imposed against Informix, a database
software company based in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said Informix failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal
accounting controls. It said that as the fraud came to light, former Informix
managers committed fraud in trying to avoid a restatement of the company's
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
	   After replacing its former management, Informix and its auditors uncovered
more than $100 million of accounting irregularities and restated its financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Informix agreed to an SEC order to cease and desist from violating
securities laws, but did so without admitting or denying the findings. The SEC
said its investigation is continuing and that Informix has agreed to cooperate
with it.

<HEADLINE> Waco Photo Appears To Bolster FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An FBI photograph seems to discredit claims that flashes of
light filmed during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound were
gunfire from government agents, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Dispatch said the surveillance photo appears to have been snapped
within seconds of the time when a flash appears on a separate infrared tape at
11:24 a.m. on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians and their experts claim flashes on the infrared film
are muzzle flashes from FBI agents' guns. But the surveillance photo shows
nobody in the vicinity of the flashes.
</P>
<P>
	   It is part of a batch of photos the government recently turned over to John
C. Danforth and U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith, who is presiding over a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Branch Davidian survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth was appointed last year to investigate whether the FBI tried to
cover up is actions at the group's compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has admitted it fired incendiary tear-gas canisters into the
compound the day a fire killed about 80 members of the group but contends that
people inside started the fire and that agents did not fire weapons at the
people inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, the infrared tape taken aboard one FBI plane flying about
9,000 feet over the compound and photographs taken aboard another plane at a
lower altitude had not been compared.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveillance photographs were timed by the damage depicted on the
infrared tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Caddell, the lead awyer for the Branch Davidians, said he has not yet
seen the still photographs because the government has not handed them over to
the plaintiffs, but he was not impressed by the comparison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of times when that tank went in and out of the
building,'' he said. ``Being able to identify what time it is and whatever the
precise moment when someone was firing from the rear of the tank is very suspect
unless you've got a complete roll of film and you can see the entire sequence.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Said Helpful to Diabetics  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Elevated levels of insulin appear to make people prone to
blood clots, a finding that could explain why diabetics are so susceptible to
heart attacks and strokes, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   About 75 percent of people with the most common type of diabetes die of
heart attacks or strokes.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies have found that high blood pressure and low levels of
"good" cholesterol account for about half of the higher-than-normal risk of
cardiovascular disease in diabetics.
</P>
<P>
	   This new study -- published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association -- tried to determine what role elevated insulin levels play.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that exercise, which makes
the body more receptive to the effects of insulin, might improve a person's
ability to dissolve blood clots and possibly lower the risk of cardivascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "Exercise ought to be really, really encouraged," said Dr. James B. Meigs,
an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common form of diabetes -- type 2 -- afflicts about 14 million
Americans. They are resistant to insulin, the protein that helps the body use
sugar and other energy sources, and as a result they have elevated insulin
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1991 to 1995, Meigs and his colleagues studied about 3,000 people
enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study, a long-term examination of risk
factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants included diabetics, people with
its precursor condition and non-diabetics.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers found that non-diabetics who had elevated insulin levels
also had elevated levels of PAI-1 antigen, a chemical that impairs the blood's
ability to dissolve clots. The association was the same in diabetics and people
with the precursor condition, though their levels of insulin and the antigen
were even higher.
</P>
<P>
	   From that, Meigs suggested that "one effect of insulin resistance is to make
the blood less able to dissolve clots."
</P>
<P>
	   However, he and two outside experts agreed that is far from a firm
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no evidence of a cause and effect of anything," said Dr. Robert
Eckel, an endocrinologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center
in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Om Ganda of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston agreed but said the
study still has important implications.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really adds to a growing body of evidence that says insulin resistance
does contribute to increased risk for heart disease," Ganda said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meigs said his study should be followed by another looking at the effects of
exercise and other "insulin sensitizing" techniques.

<HEADLINE> Rape Victims' Right To Sue Studied  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices appeared to doubt whether Congress
can try to protect women against violence by letting rape victims sue their
attackers in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing arguments Tuesday in the case of a former Virginia Tech student who
wants to sue two football players she says raped her, the justices noted such
issues are traditionally left to state courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your approach ... would justify a federal remedy for alimony or child
support,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told Solicitor General Seth Waxman as he
asked the justices to reinstate a key portion of the 1994 Violence Against Women
Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Julie Goldscheid, the former student's lawyer, argued along with Waxman that
the federal law, thrown out by an appeals court, is needed because gender-based
violence restricts women's choices in jobs and travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Antonin Scalia said all types of crime could have similar effects.
Such logic ``would allow general federal criminal laws on all subjects because
all crime affects interstate commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael E. Rosman, representing the two former football players, said the
law encroaches on traditional state powers and does not come under Congress'
authority to regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Allowing Congress to enact such laws could ``relegate the states to a
trivial and unimportant role,'' Rosman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's highest court has increasingly tipped the balance of power away
from the federal government and toward the states in a series of 5-4 decisions,
including a ruling Tuesday that shielded state governments against federal
age-bias claims by their employees.
</P>
<P>
	   It seemed likely that the Violence Against Women Act case could follow the
same pattern when it is decided by this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the law's author, said after the argument session
that the court should show deference to Congress' conclusion that states were
not doing enough to protect rape victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Waxman told the justices Congress found that ``archaic prejudices and
improper stereotypes'' about women were affecting the outcome of cases in state
courts. The government's court brief contended violent crime against women costs
the nation at least $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, formerly a pioneering women's rights advocate,
suggested that the Violence Against Women Act could be seen as an ``alternative
remedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress could be saying, ``We aren't taking over the states' domain. We are
just complementing what the states do,'' Ginsburg said. ``Why isn't that
satisfactory?''
</P>
<P>
	   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist questioned whether people who sue
their attackers would fare any better in federal court than in state court.
Juries generally are drawn from similar pools of people, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six states are siding with Christy Brzonkala, the former Virginia
Tech student who said she was raped at school, and are asking the court to
reinstate the federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosman said Congress can use its interstate-commerce authority only to
regulate activity related to commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether Congress can prohibit people from
growing marijuana for their own use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think so,'' Rosman said, drawing a rebuke from Scalia, who said
that would mean ``the sky's the limit'' for unlawful commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is a followup to the Supreme Court's 1995 decision throwing out the
federal Gun-Free School Zones Act, which made it a crime to possess a gun near a
school. The justices said the law was insufficiently linked to interstate
commerce and usurped states' authority over such crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals relied heavily on that ruling when it
threw out Brzonkala's lawsuit against the two football players.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala, who has approved publication of her name, became the first person
to sue under the federal law in 1995 when she sued Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford. The men were never charged with a crime. She said she became depressed
after the alleged attack and ultimately withdrew from school.
</P>
<P>
	   Brzonkala is pursuing a separate lawsuit against Virginia Tech, which she
says protected the two men because they were athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Violence Against Women Act also has criminal provisions, but those were
not at issue in Tuesday's case.

<HEADLINE> Reasons for HIV Rebound Explored  </HEADLINE>
    By BRENDA C. COLEMAN AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- When potent drugs fail to keep HIV in check, the reason
might not be that the virus has become drug-resistant, as some doctors and
patients fear.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the AIDS virus may rebound because patients have stopped taking
their drugs properly or because their bodies have lost the ability to use the
medicines effectively, according to two studies published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts said those problems can be addressed by helping HIV patients
rigorously follow their course of treatment and possibly by increasing dosages,
something that is not generally done now.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher cautioned that the patients in the studies were all
relatively new to treatment, which may obscure the role drug resistance plays.
People who have been treated for a year or more may be more likely to have
drug-resistant viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   Antiviral drug combinations called "cocktails" have suppressed the virus
that causes AIDS in 60 percent to 90 percent of patients, researchers noted in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   But an estimated 30 percent to 60 percent of patients who take the cocktails
end up being considered treatment failures, either because the drugs never knock
the virus down to negligible levels or because after it is down, it rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers are not sure how big a role drug resistance plays. Concerns have
grown about it because a small percentage of newly infected HIV patients have
caught drug-resistant strains of the viruss. Researchers also know that HIV drug
regimens are complicated and difficult to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The new studies found that drug resistance did not appear to be the main
culprit when the virus rebounded in 58 HIV patients in France and in 26 U.S.
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients in both studies had been treated initially for three to six months
with a triple-drug regimen: zidovudine (marketed as AZT or Retrovir), lamivudine
(3TC, Epivir) and indinavir (Crixivan). Patients had been switched to
maintenance therapy on one, two or all three of the drugs before their virus
levels shot up.
</P>
<P>
	   The French study, in 1998, analyzed viral samples for genetic mutations
associated with drug resistance, looked at whether patients took all of their
medicine and measured blood levels of indinavir, an indicator of whether their
bodies were using antiviral medicines effectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Some mutations linked to drug resistance were found, but researchers blamed
the other factors more -- the failure to take medicine properly and inadequate
potency of drugs in the body.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1997-98 U.S. study, researchers led by Dr. Diane V. Havlir of the
University of California at San Diego found drug potency in the body seemed to
be more important.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to help the patient be well-adherent to the treatment," said Dr.
Francoise Brun-Vezinet, virology director at Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris
and head of the French study. She cautioned that drug resistance may play a
bigger role in patients who have had longer treatment with antiviral drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   An expert not involved in either study said the problem of potency in the
body might be best addressed if doctors who prescribe HIV drugs monitor blood
levels of the medicines and push doses as high as possible, short of causing
intolerable side effects.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not the medicine's fault. There may be differences in potency in
different patients" because different people's cells use the drugs differently,
said the expert, Dr. Roger J. Pomerantz, director of virology at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Missing snow is blessing for some, curse for others in upstate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Living in America's snowiest big city, Kelly
Underwood figured starting his own plowing business would be a great way to make
some extra cash during the winter when work slowed down in the moving business.
<P>
	   What he didn't figure on was a finicky Mother Nature, which has left upstate
New York wondering where winter is.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started last year, and of course, last year wasn't so great. But this
year has really been pathetic," Underwood said Tuesday as he watched the rain
fall on his bare driveway while temperatures hovered in the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
	   Underwood said he's been out plowing just twice so far this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not surprising because Syracuse, which averages 115 inches of snow,
has received just 20 inches of snow - nearly 30 inches below normal, according
to the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University. Last year,
Syracuse received 98 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the same story across upstate. With a paltry 1.6 inches of snow, Albany
is experiencing its least snowiest winter to date in 50 years; Buffalo its
second least snowiest winter in that span with just under 14 inches, about 28
inches less than usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Even upstate's Tug Hill region along eastern Lake Ontario - the snowiest
area east of the Rockies with an annual average of 220 inches - is virtually
snowless.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a little bit of snow in some spots but we're hurting, too," said
Bob Quinn, a director with the Tug Hill Commission. "This is highly, highly
unusual for us. Everybody up here is talking about the lack of snow."
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Tug Hill is a winter recreation paradise for skiers and
snowmobilers who come by the thousands from all over the Northeast and Canada,
no snow means no money for the small local businesses that cater to them.
</P>
<P>
	   "A situation like this has an immediate and critical impact," Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blame the lack of snow partially on La Nina - the cooling of ocean
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near Peru that alters storms tracks in the
Northeast. Blame it partially on global warming.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are contributing factors but weather is a cyclical event," said Keith
Eggleston, a climatologist at Cornell. "Don't worry. It all averages out. The
snow will come."
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate New York experienced a similar snow drought last winter when it
didn't receive its first substantial snowfall until late December. Then Old Man
Winter arrived with a vengeance. A series of lake effect storms during the first
two weeks of January hit Buffalo with 60 inches of snow over two weeks. In
March, another wintry blast piled 41 inches of snow on Rochester in a three-day
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse Public Works Commissioner Anthony Ilacquia has lived upstate long
enough to know winter can return from one day to the next. He noted that
forecasters were predicting colder temperatures and snow showers for later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have 10 weeks of winter left and January and February are typically the
heaviest snow months. I can tell you we're not taking off the plows just yet,"
Ilacquia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they haven't had any snow to remove from the city's streets,
Ilacquia's crews have remained busy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's actually a blessing to us. It lets us catch up with other things,
repairing our vehicles, keeping our fleet in good shape, repairing pot holes,
picking up Christmas trees. In a typical year, we put these things off," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, too, were making good use of winter's absence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liverpool Golf and Public Country Club remained open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel bad for the skiers but this is beautiful," said owner Rich Ajemian,
who estimated he's had close to 100 golfers daily during the warm, snowless
spell. "Heck, there's even a threesome out there today playing in the rain."
</P>
<P>
	   John Petrocci, a designer with Valley Grove Landscaping in Clay, N.Y., said
his company was taking advantage of the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this business, we're lucky if we get to the second week of December.
This has extended our working season by a month," Petrocci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there are those whose livelihoods depend on the snow and cold weather.
They weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to see a change in the weather. It's been so bleak," said Kerry
Metivier, the business marketing director at West Mountain Ski Area, located 30
miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we didn't have snow making machines we wouldn't be open," said Jane
Eshbaugh, a spokeswoman for Holiday Valley Resort in Ellicottville in western
New York.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court balks at city lawyer's claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Tough questions from appeals court judges greeted a
lawyer who said Tuesday that the First Amendment was not the issue at stake in
the city's attempt to cut funding for the Brooklyn Museum because of the
"Sensation" art exhibit.
<P>
	   "This is not a First Amendment case, your honor," said city attorney Leonard
Koerner in an argument over legal issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "It isn't?" snapped Justice John Walker of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Jon Newman, another member of the three-judge panel, called the
statement possibly "the most extraordinary thing" he had heard from the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges reserved decision. They must consider whether to uphold a federal
judge's ruling in Brooklyn that found the city's decision to freeze its $7.2
million annual contribution to the museum violated the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   They also must determine whether the case belongs in state court rather than
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vowed to cut off the funding after a controversy
erupted over the exhibit, titled "Sensation: Young British Artists From the
Saatchi Collection."
</P>
<P>
	   Various groups had protested to the mayor about Chris Ofili's painting,
titled "The Holy Virgin Mary." The painting depicts Mary with African features
and includes a shellacked clump of elephant dung and magazine cutouts of female
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
	   The show opened on Oct. 2 and closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner had barely begun delivering his argument before the appeals court
panel when he faced a barrage of fast questions from Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge asked why the city had begun what amounted to eviction
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is it really the city's position that the Brooklyn Museum should take its
entire collection out of that building now?" Newman asked. "Your words and your
complaint say so but I'm not sure you mean it."
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner conceded that the city would like to negotiate a solution with the
museum, but only after a judge had found in its favor.
</P>
<P>
	   At the very least, he said, the city would like to stop funding the museum.
</P>
<P>
	   With that issue behind it, the appeals court then turned toward the city's
claim that the exhibit was not appropriate for school children and thus violated
the museum's pledge to help educate children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is every book in the New York Public Library appropriate for school
children?" Newman asked. "Is the library next?"
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner said the city would not attack the library for the content of its
books but would consider action if it housed an exhibit celebrating the Klu Klux
Klan or homophobia.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman, returning to the issue of educating children, said he was sure the
state Legislature in appropriating money for the arts did not intend for
exhibits to be only as exciting and provocative as children could handle.
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner said he suspected the Legislature did not anticipate an exhibit such
as the Brooklyn exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum attorney Floyd Abrams said the city wanted only to punish the museum
for its exhibit, ruining a 100-year relationship that included numerous
accolades from the city heralding the museum as one of the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams said even the notion that an eviction would force the museum to move
to California or to New Jersey was "so bizarre that it is a basis for
considering that this whole thing is nothing more than an effort to punish."
</P>
<P>
	   Koerner, though, said the case was about how far an institution can go with
the First Amendment and what its role is to the community and its children.
</P>
<P>
	   "We funded this museum," he said. "Let's assume that it celebrated the Klu
Klux Klan or the Holocaust or homophobia. I don't think the court would be
saying we'd be required to fund it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't be so sure," Newman said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer team gearing up to build 20,000-seat soccer stadium in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Rochester Raging Rhinos, winners of the
nation's top soccer cup last fall, promised Tuesday to contribute $25.7 million
in private funds toward building a $44.1 million, 20,000-seat soccer stadium by
2001.
<P>
	   The project's success hinges on the ability of the A-League team's three
co-owners to persuade state, county and city governments to come up with the
balance - $18.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think this makes economic sense ... and we're willing to risk all of our
money to make this a done deal," said Rhinos president Frank DuRoss.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to convince the government officials that this project has legs,
that it's a good investment in the community," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rhinos are by far the biggest draw in professional soccer's second
division A-League with an average attendance of 11,551 last season. They are
campaigning to gain a slot in Major League Soccer, which is aiming to expand
from 12 to 14 teams by next year.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the stumbling block has been the Rhinos' home ground. Since their
inaugural year in 1996, they have played at 12,052-seat Frontier Field, a
seashell-shaped stadium built that year for minor league baseball's Rochester
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   For the MLS to invite them aboard, the Rhinos first need to build a
soccer-specific stadium with a capacity of at least 20,000 that would triple
their market to about 3 million by drawing fans from Syracuse, 75 miles east of
here, and Buffalo, 60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
	   Team officials unveiled architectural designs for a rectangular stadium they
expect to start building this summer to open for the 2001 season. They said they
have honed in on four possible sites - one near Frontier Field and the others in
the Rochester suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The stadium would be designed to play host to other sports, such as
lacrosse, field hockey and rugby, and also be used to stage music concerts,
drum-and-bugle competitions and various community events.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed stadium would be used for A-League competition if the Rhinos
don't win a place in the MLS, but DuRoss said the team's survival is at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Without government help, he said, "we'd have to reevaluate where we're at
and how we could survive in this marketplace without our own stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, success on the field has seemed easy to come by. The 1998
A-League champion Rhinos toppled the Colorado Rapids 2-0 in September to become
the first A-League team to win the U.S. Open Cup since MLS teams entered the
premier cup competition in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Pataki calls for a $78 billion state budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Quoting Ronald Reagan and boasting of his own record
as a fiscal conservative, Gov. George Pataki proposed Tuesday that New York
spend nearly $78 billion in its next fiscal year.
<P>
	   Pataki told state legislators that New York stands at a fiscal crossroads as
they consider his budget for the 2000-01 fiscal year beginning April 1. They can
either consolidate and further the gains the state has made in his five years as
governor or backslide into overspending and overtaxing, Pataki warned.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are the showcase of the future," Pataki said, quoting Reagan. "And it is
within our power to mold that future, this year and for decades to come. It can
be as grand and as great as we make it."
</P>
<P>
	   The aim, Pataki said in his own words, is to create the "kind of New York we
want our children to inherit."
</P>
<P>
	   A $78 billion budget would be 5.5 percent larger than the current
fiscal-year spending plan. Pataki conceded that would be more than the projected
inflation rate for the next year, but he said the numbers are skewed by the
inclusion of $2 billion in rebates due property taxpayers in fiscal 2000-01
under the "STAR" program.
</P>
<P>
	   Those rebates are classified as state spending when they really are not,
Pataki argued.
</P>
<P>
	   A better gauge, the governor said, is the proposed size of the state's
general fund - $37.9 billion. That fund is comprised of money generated through
state taxes and fees. Pataki said it would grow by only 2.3 percent in fiscal
2000-01, or by less than the expected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a budget this year which I think is just a great budget," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few surprises in Pataki's new spending plan: his office had
dribbled out the chief initiatives over the past several days or high points had
been outlined in his State of the State address to legislators last week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki, for the first time, did say the state would end the current
fiscal year with a budget surplus of $625 million. He urged the Legislature to
use any surpluses to reduce the state's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "If recent history teaches us anything, it's that government has the
capacity to gobble up $625 million in the blink of an eye," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor urged the Legislature to pass the centerpiece item in his $700
million tax-cut plan, a phase-out of the state's gross receipts tax on utility
bills. Pataki said lawmakers should eliminate the tax first for manufacturers,
retroactive to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Other new elements in Pataki's proposal called for the state to spend $12.9
billion on public schools - up $355 million or about 3 percent over the
current-year aid levels; tripling to $750 million the amount of money in reserve
for debt reduction; and instituting a debt reform package including the
elimination of taking on new debt without prior voter approval.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Pataki urged the creation of a new Department of Justice by merging the
Division of State Police, the Department of Correctional Services and other
agencies concerned with crime and corrections; the building of a new
maximum-security state prison at an undetermined site; the renewal of driver's
licenses once every eight years instead of five years and the entry of New York
into the multi-state lottery game known as Powerball.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next several weeks, legislators and their analysts will pore over
Pataki's proposal and hold budget hearings before each chamber will formulate
changes. It has been 16 years since lawmakers and the governor completed passage
on a new state budget prior to the April 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   It was quickly evident Tuesday that Pataki's education spending plan would
be the most controversial of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said that far from
providing for a $335 million school aid increase, the Republican governor's
budget would actually provide nearly $900 million less for schools by not
carrying over appropriated, but unspent, money from the current fiscal year to
the next one.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has given us nice rhetoric on education but he hasn't put the
dollars behind it," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver also was cool to Pataki's proposals to create a new state Department
of Justice, saying he was worried parole services would lose out under such an
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Democrat, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, questioned whether
Pataki was actually keeping general fund under the rate of inflation. McCall
said the governor was shifting some money "off-budget" so it wouldn't be
recorded as spending, even though the money will most likely be expended.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno,
said "by and large, we think the governor submitted a great budget." But Bruno
also said Senate Republicans think there should be more money for education and
more tax cuts than Pataki proposed.

<HEADLINE> Whitman pitches high-tech advances, environmental improvements in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman took a look at New Jersey's
future through the eyes of a newborn on Tuesday, saying the state must do more
to encourage a high-tech economy, improve education and protect the environment
for its next generation of residents.
<P>
	   The governor, heading into her final two years in Trenton, used her sixth
State of the State address to pitch a high-technology initiative that would
commit $96 million in state funds to lure new companies, aid colleges and train
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for environmental initiatives to target development in
cities and for increases in aid to the elderly and early childhood education.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman showed photos of four infants who were born on Jan. 1 - just after
the Y2K computer glitch-free dawn of the millennium - and urged lawmakers to
plan for the babies' future. Throughout her speech, she referred to the kind of
life they will lead if today's leaders do their job.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I enter the second half of my second term as governor, I want to
continue strengthening New Jersey in four key areas: expanding the economy,
improving education, protecting the environment and serving the elderly,"
Whitman said in prepared text. "Making progress on these ... will make a better
life for the four children you just met and for all the New Jersey children who
will call the 21st century their own."
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor, who last year abandoned a six-month U.S. Senate
effort that would have placed her on the campaign trail this year, told a joint
session of the state Legislature that she wants to "make sure prosperity
continues here in New Jersey long after this administration has completed its
work."
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come too far to see these accomplishments slip away because we rested
on our laurels," Whitman said. "The people of our state deserve a governor who
approaches the last two years of her tenure as if they were the first."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's biggest proposal is a $165 million to effort to encourage even
more high technology companies to settle in New Jersey. Her proposal would
commit $96 million in state funds, recycle $3 million in welfare grants, use $10
million in federal aid and draw $56 million from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "Promoting high technology is only a means to an end, and that end is jobs -
more jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs for all our families," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan includes grants to boost worker training - including training for
those attempting to get off welfare. It aims to garner federal technology grants
for colleges and help small high-tech businesses get a start. Whitman also wants
to set up "cyberdistricts" in cities to target specific areas for high-tech
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Alluding to her plan to preserve what remains of New Jersey's open space,
the governor said she'd like to target more business and development in the
cities. She proposed another $15 million to encourage cities to clean up sites
that can be developed for industry, and $3 million to preserve water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Whitman ordered the Department of Environmental Protection to
use stricter standards in reviewing requests for new sewer plants to make sure
they don't harm an entire region's environment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Saving land will help," said Whitman. "But it's just as important to
recognize that where we put sewers, roads and new buildings can affect an entire
watershed. ... (New) rules will encourage development where sewers and roads
exist or can be built without harming the environment."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman wants to spend $69 million more on public preschool programs in poor
districts to eventually provide full-day, full-year preschool to about 33,000
young students. The state is under court order to provide dollars for the
preschools, and critics say it is not doing an adequate job. The state Supreme
Court is reviewing current efforts to decide if the state is meeting the court's
mandates.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she wants to give new teachers additional mentoring from a
veteran educator during their first two years in the classroom. The state would
pay for the mentors' time, which would cost between $1,350 and $1,750 per
teacher. Currently, new teachers get a mentor for one year.
</P>
<P>
	   And she proposed more emphasis on character education for students.
</P>
<P>
	   "With so many horrible stories about youth violence in the news, we have to
renew our efforts to teach our kids values like respect and responsibility,
decency and civility," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also used the speech to nudge Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and
Senate President Donald DiFrancesco to end their dispute over the
multibillion-dollar question of school construction and reach and agreement on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The clock is ticking and too many schools are crumbling," Whitman said. "So
let's do it. Let's enact a funding plan that gives our children the safe and
sturdy schools they deserve."

	   Upstate New York experienced a similar snow drought last winter when it
didn't receive its first substantial snowfall until late December. Then Old Man
Winter arrived with a vengeance. A series of lake effect storms during the first
two weeks of January hit Buffalo with 60 inches of snow over two weeks. In
March, another wintry blast piled 41 inches of snow on Rochester in a three-day
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse Public Works Commissioner Anthony Ilacquia has lived upstate long
enough to know winter can return from one day to the next. He noted that
forecasters were predicting colder temperatures and snow showers for later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have 10 weeks of winter left and January and February are typically the
heaviest snow months. I can tell you we're not taking off the plows just yet,"
Ilacquia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they haven't had any snow to remove from the city's streets,
Ilacquia's crews have remained busy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's actually a blessing to us. It lets us catch up with other things,
repairing our vehicles, keeping our fleet in good shape, repairing pot holes,
picking up Christmas trees. In a typical year, we put these things off," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, too, were making good use of winter's absence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liverpool Golf and Public Country Club remained open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel bad for the skiers but this is beautiful," said owner Rich Ajemian,
who estimated he's had close to 100 golfers daily during the warm, snowless
spell. "Heck, there's even a threesome out there today playing in the rain."
</P>
<P>
	   John Petrocci, a designer with Valley Grove Landscaping in Clay, N.Y., said
his company was taking advantage of the weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this business, we're lucky if we get to the second week of December.
This has extended our working season by a month," Petrocci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there are those whose livelihoods depend on the snow and cold weather.
They weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to see a change in the weather. It's been so bleak," said Kerry
Metivier, the business marketing director at West Mountain Ski Area, located 30
miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we didn't have snow making machines we wouldn't be open," said Jane
Eshbaugh, a spokeswoman for Holiday Valley Resort in Ellicottville in western
New York.

<HEADLINE> Soccer team gearing up to build 20,000-seat soccer stadium in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Rochester Raging Rhinos, winners of the
nation's top soccer cup last fall, promised Tuesday to contribute $25.7 million
in private funds toward building a $44.1 million, 20,000-seat soccer stadium by
2001.
<P>
	   The project's success hinges on the ability of the A-League team's three
co-owners to persuade state, county and city governments to come up with the
balance - $18.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think this makes economic sense ... and we're willing to risk all of our
money to make this a done deal," said Rhinos president Frank DuRoss.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to convince the government officials that this project has legs,
that it's a good investment in the community," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rhinos are by far the biggest draw in professional soccer's second
division A-League with an average attendance of 11,551 last season. They are
campaigning to gain a slot in Major League Soccer, which is aiming to expand
from 12 to 14 teams by next year.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the stumbling block has been the Rhinos' home ground. Since their
inaugural year in 1996, they have played at 12,052-seat Frontier Field, a
seashell-shaped stadium built that year for minor league baseball's Rochester
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   For the MLS to invite them aboard, the Rhinos first need to build a
soccer-specific stadium with a capacity of at least 20,000 that would triple
their market to about 3 million by drawing fans from Syracuse, 75 miles east of
here, and Buffalo, 60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
	   Team officials unveiled architectural designs for a rectangular stadium they
expect to start building this summer to open for the 2001 season. They said they
have honed in on four possible sites - one near Frontier Field and the others in
the Rochester suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The stadium would be designed to play host to other sports, such as
lacrosse, field hockey and rugby, and also be used to stage music concerts,
drum-and-bugle competitions and various community events.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed stadium would be used for A-League competition if the Rhinos
don't win a place in the MLS, but DuRoss said the team's survival is at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Without government help, he said, "we'd have to reevaluate where we're at
and how we could survive in this marketplace without our own stadium."
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, success on the field has seemed easy to come by. The 1998
A-League champion Rhinos toppled the Colorado Rapids 2-0 in September to become
the first A-League team to win the U.S. Open Cup since MLS teams entered the
premier cup competition in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Cargill Hail 'Natural' Plastic  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A durable "natural" plastic made from corn rather than
petroleum is ready for commercial production and use in items from clothing to
food containers.
</P>
<P>
	   A partnership of Cargill Inc. and Dow Chemical Co. says its plastics and
fibers made from renewable resources perform as well as those made from
nonrenewable hydrocarbons and can be produced for about the same cost.
</P>
<P>
	   "To think that what is grown in a field can now be converted into plastic is
really quite amazing," said Jim Stoppert, president and chief executive of
Cargill Dow Polymers, the 50-50 joint venture between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Cargill is among companies that already use corn to produce ethanol, a
gasoline additive touted as reducing reliance on oil, but which relies on
federal subsidies to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Cargill and Dow have invested more than $300 million to build a new plastic
manufacturing plant in Blair, Neb., and continue product development. Production
is planned at the site of Cargill's corn wet milling plant, which began
producing ethanol and animal feed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   By reducing reliance on petroleum, producers hope to avoid being whipsawed
by rapid swings in oil prices. Just this past year, oil prices have doubled on
world markets, putting a squeeze on profits from producing plastic.
</P>
<P>
	   But plastic makers could find themselves at the mercy of volatile grain
markets, with prices rising if production is decimated by drought, as in 1988,
of widespread floods, as in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The plastics factory is to open at the end of 2001 and will produce more
than 300 million pounds annually of the plant-based plastic, called polylactide
or PLA.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the new plant will not increase the amount of corn ground by
Cargill in Blair because the corn on hand will be shifted to higher-value
products, such as the PLA, said Pat Gruber, CDP's vice president, technology and
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   However, farmers could reap huge benefits from the technology in the future,
and additional jobs could be created in rural areas as products from renewable
resources are developed, Stoppert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cargill-Dow partnership already has the capacity to make almost 9
million pounds of plant-based plastic per year at a Minneapolis-area plant. The
company plans to double that capacity this year and plans to begin construction
of a large plant in Europe in 2002. After that, CDP hopes to open a new plant
every 18 to 24 months and begin licensing the technology to others, Stoppert
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology has been in development for about 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2010, CDP expects to be producing more than 1 billion pounds of PLA
annually from plants around the world, Stoppert said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a very small number compared to the overall plastics industry," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   World consumption of the top five plastic resins totaled more than 220
billion pounds in 1996, according to statistics provided by the American
Plastics Council, which said consumption was growing at more than 5 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The production process, trademarked as NatureWorks, enables the company to
capture the carbon removed from the air by plants during photosynthesis. Carbon
is stored in plant starches, which can be broken down into natural plant sugars,
which then are used to make the PLA.
</P>
<P>
	   CDP now uses sugars from corn to make its new plastic because it is abundant
and inexpensive. The company's researchers are working on techniques to use the
process to create plastics from many other plants, including wheat, sugar beets
and agricultural waste such as corn husks and wood pulp.
</P>
<P>
	   Clothing containing the new plastic is wrinkle resistant, drapes better and
is more comfortable because it wicks moisture away from the body, Stoppert said.
Shirts containing PLA already are being worn in Japan and have been
well-received, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When used for packaging, the plant plastic is fully degradable, the company
said. The environment also benefits because production of PLA uses 30 percent to
50 percent less fossil fuel than is required to make conventional plastic
resins.

<HEADLINE> GM Stops Production of Electric Car  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has stopped production of its sleek EV1
electric car, citing waning interest from its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM vice chairman Harry J. Pearce said Tuesday that GM was shifting its
attention from all-electric cars to vehicles powered by hybrid fuel-electric
systems and fuel cells, which use hydrogen to create electricity. Pearce said
the company had a sufficient supply of EV1s on hand and said while GM could
build more, there was "no particular need."
</P>
<P>
	   GM will still lease EV1s in California and Arizona, but will "recycle" used
EV1s as their leases end, giving them new battery packs or other updates.
</P>
<P>
	   GM began building the EV1 in 1996, and hoped to eventually sell thousands of
battery-powered vehicles as pollution-free alternative transportation --
especially in warm-climate cities beset by smog.
</P>
<P>
	   It spent $350 million to develop the EV1, and promoted it heavily,
delivering some of the first vehicles to celebrities such as Sylvester Stallone.
It billed the EV1 as a household's second car for short trips, and set a goal of
leasing 100 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   But after an initial flurry of interest, few buyers came forward, and the
EV1s limitations became clear. EV1 leases cost between $400 and $600 a month,
and for their money, owners got a car with a range of 80 miles that needed
several hours to recharge.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 703 prospects who went through a special sales pitch for EV1s in the
first three months, nearly 80 percent decided against it. GM increased the EV1's
range, but sales didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, GM leased 137 EV1s, and has leased about 600 since 1996. Pearce
said the EV1 appealed mostly to die-hard fans of electric cars, and not a mass
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "Range, two seats, recharging...those are very real concerns that consumers
have," Pearce said. "We have spoiled customers with respect to motor vehicles.
They want normal range, they want four or five seats, they don't want to spend
any time recharging."
</P>
<P>
	   Pearce also said GM was working with Toyota Motor Co. on new power
technologies, and said a hybrid vehicle that would be a joint effort was
possible. Hybrids use an internal combustion engine mated to an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
	   GM and Toyota share a factory in California; Toyota will put a hybrid
version of its Echo compact, called the Prius, on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   GM also showed off its fuel cell technology Tuesday, unveiling a fuel cell
version of its high-efficiency Precept concept vehicle. The five-passenger sedan
has a range of 500 miles, and an equivalent of 108 miles per gallon of gasoline
based on federal testing standards, Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel cells are attractive because the only byproduct is water. One of the
biggest hurdles to using fuel cells has been ways to store liquid hydrogen in
the car; it has to be chilled to 430 degrees below zero. Instead of liquid
hydrogen, the Precept's fuel cell uses a gel-like chemical hydride that fills
tanks below the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a no-excuses vehicle," Pearce said. "When this vehicle is up and
running -- as I predict it will be by the end of the year -- this vehicle will
have performance of 9 seconds, zero to 60 (mph). It will have a top speed well
in excess of 120 miles per hour."
</P>
<P>
	   Byron McCormick, co-executive director of GM's Global Alternative Propulsion
Center, said fuel cells will be ready for production by 2004, but more work
needs to be done to build fueling stations and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to set the stage to get millions of these out there. ... You
don't clean the air by putting just a few of these on the roads," he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Faces Syria Deal Opposition  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- A confident Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Tuesday
he can sell a land-for-peace deal with Syria to the Israeli public, despite
growing opposition at home to a likely pullout from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   As Barak returned home after eight days of talks with the Syrians, two
ministers in his government were threatening to bolt rather than accept a a
withdrawal from the strategic plateau, and polls indicated public opinion was
hardening on the issue. On Monday night, more than 100,000 people demonstrated
in a Tel Aviv square against a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak remained unruffled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we bring an agreement that will secure Israel's defense, its future
and that of its children, most of the people in the square yesterday will be
with us on the agreement,'' he told Channel Two television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are reaching the decisive stage,'' he said, rejecting suggestions by
opponents that he slow down the talks. He agreed with the assessment by
President Clinton, who sponsored the talks in West Virginia, that a core
agreement could be in place in two months. The talks are set to resume next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak acknowledged he could not offer anything concrete from his journey --
but he said that was not the point of this round of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Israelis could expect any confidence-building measures from Syria,
he responded: ``At this stage, no.''
</P>
<P>
	   The benefit of this round, he said, was simply that ``for the first time
professional Israeli and Syrian teams met on security, water, normalization and
... borders.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the vigor of the opposition clearly spelled impending trouble for Barak,
who campaigned for office on a peacemaking platform, then put together a
broad-based government of dovish secularists, hawkish Orthodox Jews and
immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Despite his victory pledge to be ``the
prime minister of everyone,'' Barak's governing team appears to be crumbling
over the Syria issue.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll published Friday by the Yediot Ahronot daily indicated that in the
referendum Barak has pledged to call on a deal with Syria, 49 percent of
Israelis would favor exchanging almost all of the Golan for peace, with 44
percent opposed. A similar poll last month indicated 59 percent would favor
giving up almost all of the heights, while only 35 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's poll, conducted after the launch of the talks in Shepherdstown,
W.Va., had a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The shift in opinion has been seen partly as a result of the icy atmosphere
at the talks. Israeli columnists have repeatedly noted Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa's refusal to even shake Barak's hand.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Israeli leader said images were far less important than the ultimate
outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came to fight for Israel's security, not to play with smiles, hugs and
etiquette,'' Barak said. ``With an agreement, these things will come.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the emerging deal say the Golan is too important strategically
to risk, especially in a peace accord they say Syria might not keep.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, head of the settler-oriented National
Religious Party, said he would leave the coalition and work to defeat the peace
deal if Barak agreed to a withdrawal. Interior Minister Natan Sharansky said his
Russian immigrants party would also leave Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll published this week by the independent Machshov institute showed that
about 70 percent of immigrants from the former Soviet Union oppose giving up the
Golan. Their votes are seen as critical to the outcome of a referendum. The
Machshov poll, conducted before the Shepherdstown talks began, had a margin of
error of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Public opinion expert Tamar Hermann of Tel Aviv University said a closer
look at the poll results shows Barak has a chance to win over the doubters. She
said some of the concerns, like security and access to water sources, could be
answered in an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in 1981.
About 17,000 Israeli settlers live there.

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Module Launch Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The long-delayed International Space Station has been
postponed once again due to flaws in a booster rocket, while Russia's Mir space
station may get a new lease on life, space officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The launch of the crucial crew compartment for the multibillion-dollar,
16-nation space station has been long behind schedule because of the Russian
government's failure to provide funds for its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, when the module was almost ready, two crashes of Proton booster
rockets pushed officials to postpone the launch date again Tuesday. The Zvezda
(Star) module is to be carried into space by a Proton.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Gromov, spokesman for the Energia company that built the module, said
the crashes were caused by a manufacturing flaw in the rockets' second-stage
engines. The Voronezh Mechanical Works, which built the engines, promised to
replace them by the end of June, he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once the booster is ready, it takes about 45 days to prepare the module
for launch, so the earliest launch time is the end of August,'' he said. He said
the actual launch date would be pushed back even further because space officials
first want to launch refurbished Protons with less-precious cargos.
</P>
<P>
	   Gromov's statement means that the entire project likely will be thrown more
than two years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The station's first components were launched into space in November and
December 1998, but the first permanent crew may only begin its stint on the
station after the crew module is put into orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   A new launch date will be discussed next month, Gromov said. He said that
some software problems with Zvezda's computers also must be resolved before the
launch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, the Americans are not pleased with the delay, but they react
with understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Proton rockets crashed shortly after launch July 5 and Oct. 27. The
official investigation released by the Interfax news agency Tuesday said the
engines caught fire because they were contaminated by metal and mineral
particles.
</P>
<P>
	   While the new international station faced new delays, Russia's own Mir space
station may remain in orbit for longer than earlier planned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government decided last year to discard the aging station if private
investors fail to come up with funds to keep it aloft. The station has been
orbiting the Earth unmanned after its last crew left in August, and it was
expected that one final crew would go to the Mir to send it down around March.
</P>
<P>
	   No major funds have been found, but Gromov said Tuesday that a two-man crew
is now set to blast off for the station March 30. Their mission would last for
at least 45 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Gromov said the state-controlled Energia, which built the Mir and has been
running it since its launch in February 1986, is looking to a U.S. company named
Golden Apple to save Mir. He declined to provide more details.
</P>
<P>
	   If the U.S. firm backs off, Energia still hopes the government will change
its mind and pour more resources into Mir, the last remaining symbol of
once-glorious Soviet space program.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Zone May Be Resettled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's government has drafted a development plan for
contaminated land around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, calling for
resettling part of the area, a civil defense official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan suggests a partial revival of the so-called zone of alienation, an
area about 20 miles around Chernobyl that was evacuated after the 1986 fire and
explosion at the plant, the world's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists have discovered mutant plants and animals in the zone, and only a
few people now risk living in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   But, citing scientific work sponsored in part by the European Union, the
plan suggests some areas may be resettled and are suitable for growing potatoes,
said Volodymyr Kholosha, deputy emergency situations minister.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft document also has provisions for health care and radiation safety
for people living outside the zone.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, estimated to cost around $1.3 million for 2000, replaces a
previous five-year plan that will expire this year. A detailed version is due in
July.

<HEADLINE> Syria Radical Leader Wants To Quit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- George Habash, leader of the Syria-based radical
Palestinian faction the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, says he
wants to retire from his post as secretary-general, the group's spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Habash, a veteran Marxist ideologue, has led the group since its 1967
inception. Now 75, he has suffered heart problems and other ailments and last
year expressed a desire to give up his post, said Maher el-Taher, the group's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The group plans to hold a general congress this year, its first since 1993,
at which it would consider Habash's request, el-Taher said. To formally retire,
Habash needs approval from the group's General Conference of the Central
Committee, which also would appoint a successor.
</P>
<P>
	   The congress would be held in simultaneous meetings in Damascus and the
Palestinian territories. While a date hasn't been set, el-Taher said it would
probably be within six months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He believes in renewal of the group -- that new faces take over in leading
the front,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian pollsters have said the group's support has slipped in the
Palestinian territories from 12 percent to as low as 3 percent. El-Taher denied
that, and said membership numbers are secret.
</P>
<P>
	   After retiring, Habash is interested in establishing a think tank that would
focus on extracting lessons from the Palestinians' struggle, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Habash's chief aide is Abu Ali Mustafa, who returned to the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank in October. El-Taher wouldn't speculate on
whether Ali Mustafa would receive approval to take over the leadership, saying
it wasn't even clear whether Habash's resignation request would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ali Mustafa met last year with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to explore
the idea of the front joining negotiations with Israel, despite Habash's
opposition. Mustafa supports the peace process in general while Habash demands
Arafat annul the breakthrough 1993 Oslo peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The front is a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by
Arafat, and el-Taher said efforts to unify the PLO are continuing.

<HEADLINE> Where did snow go in Northeast's wimpy winter?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) - It was in the 50s again, and Voight Freeman
was hatless, gloveless, snowless and cheerless.
<P>
	   "I love blizzards. I love hurricanes. I love wild weather," the transplanted
Maine native said Tuesday while on a downtown Springfield errand. "I find it
exciting."
</P>
<P>
	   Her open zippered sweatshirt wasn't the only sign of this topsy-turvy
season. The high reached a record 50 degrees Monday in her home state at
Portland. Many golfers have kept their clubs handy, encouraged by 60-degree
temperatures in much of the Northeast just last week. And no measurable snow has
fallen yet on Boston, fracturing the previous record for a late first snow of
Dec. 22 set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Things are so mixed up that even a brown pelican - the kind that clowns for
tourists in Florida - missed a detour and somehow landed at a western
Massachusetts pond last week.
</P>
<P>
	   So it's official. Thanks largely to moderating ocean influences off both
coasts of North America, a gentle winter is caressing much of the Northeast in a
tepid embrace.
</P>
<P>
	   Meteorologists say the La Nina phenomenon of cooler Pacific waters has
straightened the high-altitude highway of rushing winds known as the jet stream,
leaving fewer pressure troughs to adorn television weather maps and promote
storms. The stronger jet stream is also shouldering frigid Arctic air to the
north.
</P>
<P>
	   On the East Coast, a temperature swing known as the North Atlantic
Oscillation has produced relatively high atmospheric pressure off Greenland,
also allowing the jet stream to take a straighter, calmer tack.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacific and Atlantic events are putting a double wimpy whammy on winter.
To Neal Strauss, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Taunton,
it's a bit surreal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do miss having us get pummeled by some heavy snow and gusty winds," he
said. "It makes it interesting around here."
</P>
<P>
	   He said global warming could also be contributing to the springlike winter.
The 1990s set records for warm winters in some places, possibly with help from
the warming tied to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, in most places, this season has not set records for being either dry or
warm. It's mostly the timing that's exquisite.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we've had the warm spells, that's when the rain came," said Curt
Osgood, meteorologist at Westover Air Reserve Base, outside Springfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses that sell snow-removal equipment, winter clothing and other
seasonal products have suffered and waited hopefully. Ski resorts have kept busy
and tried to make the best of supplementing nature with artificial snow. Chris
Field, assistant director of the Wisp ski school in McHenry, Md., said his
resort has managed pretty well but acknowledged he wouldn't mind a blast of
powder in the lowlands.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you get natural snow, people are wanting to get out and enjoy
winter sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But for many who must work outdoors, it's been an undisguised blessing. Dan
Wilson, who delivers legal papers as a courier, was wearing his fall jacket. The
Holyoke native smiled when asked about the weather. "Sneakers, light pants - I'm
enjoying it," he said. "As much as I like the snow, I'll take one year like
this."
</P>
<P>
	   However, forecasters advised Northeasterners against hocking skis or
worrying about too little snowmelt to replenish water supplies in the spring:
snow could fall as soon as Thursday. A couple inches was likely in southeastern
New England, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters say the weeks ahead could bring lots of old-fashioned, hip-deep
snow. The North Atlantic Oscillation is expected to shift back to a storm phase
around mid-January, and February is normally the snowiest month.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries Playing Second Fiddle  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's beginning to look like a lame-duck year. President
Clinton's schedule shows him performing some duties often left to the vice
president and the first lady -- both busy campaigning elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   A funeral, a White House prayer session, an environmental preservation
program, another unpacking and decorating session in Chappaqua, N.Y., and a
little Democratic fund-raising occupied much of the president's week.
</P>
<P>
	   True, Clinton has just finished the heavy business of husbanding Middle East
peace talks in Shepherdstown, W.Va. And the White House is busy shaping
Clinton's final State of the Union address, which aides say will be a major
summing-up of his time in Washington, as well as working out numbers for the
2001 budget plan that Clinton delivers to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is the lame duck long stretch, the final year of the Clinton-Gore
administration, and Clinton often finds himself home alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's duty by default,'' said American University government professor and
White House-watcher Richard Semiatin. It's not surprising, Semiatin said, that
Clinton is willing to stand in at ``ceremonial duties'' for his vice president
and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton has had such a close relationship with his vice president, and he
wants him to have enough time to campaign,'' Semiatin added. ``You have the
unprecedented situation with his wife running for Senate, and who's left holding
the bag when they're off campaigning?''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton seemed to enjoy himself the other day when he welcomed Muslim
clerics to the White House for a celebration to mark the end of the holy month
of Ramadan. Heretofore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presided at the annual
event, but as Clinton explained to his guests, she was out of town.
</P>
<P>
	   And he was clearly moved later Monday, when he tenderly laid a hand upon the
casket of retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. after eulogizing the crusading former
chief of naval operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton called Zumwalt a friend, and he might have attended the funeral no
matter what. Still, funerals are almost always the province of a vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, both Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were in New York, a
vital primary state in the presidential race Gore hopes to win in November and
the state where Mrs. Clinton hopes to be elected senator this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was there to deliver a major speech at the United Nations in New York
that may help mollify AIDS activists who have dogged his presidential campaign.
Gore pledged to put the African AIDS crisis on the world's security agenda and
outlined a new, $150 million U.S. effort to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton was also in New York in the morning, then returned to
Washington in time to attend the Zumwalt funeral. She later returned to New
York, where she said Tuesday she hopes to have her husband and daughter at her
side for a formal announcement of her candidacy next month.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Clinton used the Grand Canyon for a backdrop as he announced
establishment of new national monuments, a designation that the administration
says will help protect threatened lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has been the administration point man on the environment for seven
years, and he accompanied Clinton the last time the president visited the
majestic canyon. But Gore was in Iowa, site of the presidential caucuses less
than two weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
	   And Wednesday? Clinton is to address fellow Democrats in the afternoon,
where he will air some State of the Union themes, then it's back to the
Clintons' new house in suburban Westchester County, N.Y. The couple has more
boxes to unpack, and someone has to figure out where to hang pictures.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 126; Dow Down 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks gave up an early advance and finished lower today as
rising bond yields drew investors' attention. Shares of Internet companies led
the Nasdaq composite index to a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.12 to close at 11,511.08, down from
the new closing high set yesterday. Earlier in the session, the Dow had risen as
much as 90 points. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was off 126.98 at 3,922.69.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks fell as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.67 percent
from 6.58 percent late Monday. The weakness in the bond market was spurred by
growing concerns that the robust growth of the U.S. economy will force the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 in a bid to keep inflation from
escalating, and continued signs of economic growth have convinced many
economists that an increase in February is almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, the bond market has been much more sensitive than stocks
to the possibility of further rate hikes. Today, however, bond yields were
nearing the highest levels since Sept. 1997, drawing some investors away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising bond yields can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part
because they can present an appealing alternative to investors looking for
stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell. Analysts said investors were struggling with the notion that AOL,
a high-flying Internet leader that has commanded premium stock prices, will now
behave more like a traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, was
sharply lower. The Internet service provider was among the market's strongest
performers in 1999, and traders said the company would have to turn in an
especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Nervousness about corporate earnings spread well beyond the technology
sector. Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business,
fell after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly short of
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose, buoying the Dow
and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose, also benefiting from an upgrade from Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend continued today, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume was fairly heavy on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq,
continuing a string of volatile sessions this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hold on and enjoy the ride," said Charles White, president and portfolio
manager at Avatar Associates in New York. "The market is looking for some
direction, but there's still a lot of money on the sidelines and a lot of
interest in the stock market."

<HEADLINE> France Contraception Effort Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France unveiled a publicity campaign Tuesday aimed at making
women -- and especially teen-agers -- aware of their contraception options.
</P>
<P>
	   The $3.7 million initiative comes on the heels of a heated national debate
sparked in November after the government announced plans to make the
morning-after pill available to teen-age girls at school. That move was a bid to
cut the rate of unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   The new campaign, with the slogan, ``It's up to you to choose your
contraception,'' includes a series of television and radio spots, many aimed at
young people. A guide to birth control also will be distributed to millions of
high school and university students.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor and Solidarity Minister Martine Aubry launched the campaign Tuesday,
citing figures that show 23 percent of pregnancies in France end in abortion.
About 10,000 French girls under 18 become pregnant each year, and 6,000 of those
have abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign also will target France's overseas territories such as
Guadeloupe and Martinique where the abortion rate is even higher.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sex education is one of the missions of national education,'' said Deputy
Education Minister Segolene Royal, who unleashed the earlier debate when she
announced the morning-after pill measure.
</P>
<P>
	   School nurses have been given the go-ahead to distribute the pill, which
prevents the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, but only in cases
of extreme urgency.

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The U.S. military said American warplanes bombed an
Iraqi air defense system Tuesday after Iraqi forces fired on them during
routines patrols of the no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The planes attacked an Iraqi integrated air defense system after the Iraqi
forces opened artillery fire from sites near Mosul and Bashiqah, about 250 miles
north of Baghdad, the Germany-based U.S. European Command said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The planes, based in Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, all left the area
safely, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Iraqi News Agency confirmed the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hostile formations struck at service and civilian installations during
their flights over northern Iraq,'' it said. The agency did not say whether the
raids resulted in any damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and British planes have been patrolling no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq since the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect Kurds and
Shiites from the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq says the zones are a violation of international law and has frequently
challenged the allied planes there over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Waco Photo Appears To Bolster FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An FBI photograph seems to discredit claims that flashes of
light filmed during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound were
gunfire from government agents, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Dispatch said the surveillance photo appears to have been snapped
within seconds of the time when a flash appears on a separate infrared tape at
11:24 a.m. on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians and their experts claim flashes on the infrared film
are muzzle flashes from FBI agents' guns. But the surveillance photo shows
nobody in the vicinity of the flashes.
</P>
<P>
	   It is part of a batch of photos the government recently turned over to John
C. Danforth and U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is presiding over a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Branch Davidian
survivors. Danforth was appointed last year to investigate whether the FBI tried
to cover up its actions at the group's compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has admitted it fired incendiary tear-gas canisters into the
compound the day a fire killed about 80 members of the group but contends that
people inside started the fire and that agents did not fire weapons at the
people inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, the infrared tape taken aboard one FBI plane flying about
9,000 feet over the compound and photographs taken aboard another plane at a
lower altitude had not been compared.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveillance photographs were timed by the damage depicted on the
infrared tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians, said he has not yet
seen the still photographs because the government has not handed them over to
the plaintiffs, but he was not impressed by the comparison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of times when that tank went in and out of the
building,'' he said. ``Being able to identify what time it is and whatever the
precise moment when someone was firing from the rear of the tank is very suspect
unless you've got a complete roll of film and you can see the entire sequence.''

<HEADLINE> Kohl Successor Tries To Avoid Taint  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Fighting to avoid being swept up in the scandal engulfing
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a German opposition leader acknowledged Tuesday
that a suitcase full of cash he once got was not properly reported as a
political donation.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Wolfgang Schaeuble, the new leader of the conservative Christian
Democrats, insisted he did nothing wrong and would not resign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have absolutely nothing to hide,'' Schaeuble, who took over the party
after Kohl's 1998 electoral defeat, told dozens of journalists at the party's
interim Berlin headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble's revelation was sure to further weaken the conservatives, who had
been recovering steadily in local and state elections since their stunning loss
in federal elections in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Bonn, who are considering criminal charges against Kohl for
running illegal party accounts during the 1990s, gave Schaeuble some cover. A
spokesman said Tuesday that investigators saw no grounds for expanding their
investigation to include Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble's popularity has sunk in recent weeks, with opinion polls showing
most Germans don't believe his contention -- repeated Tuesday -- that he knew
nothing about Kohl's private slush funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder declined to say Tuesday what he thought of
calls for Schaeuble's resignation, but suggested the conservative party chairman
had damaged his own credibility by not discussing the 1994 incident sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Schaeuble denied that he had sought to hide his connection with
the donor who passed him a suitcase with $52,000: businessman Karlheinz
Schreiber, who is fighting extradition from Canada for suspected tax evasion in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of a 1991 cash handover by Schreiber of $520,000 to Kohl aides
touched off the scandal when investigators were unable to find any trace of the
supposed donation in party books.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Kohl admitted he had set up secret party accounts with money
from donors who demanded anonymity -- in violation of the party financing law
Kohl himself had passed while chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to possible charges of breach of trust against Kohl, a
parliamentary committee is investigating whether any of the money was given in
exchange for government favors -- a charge Kohl vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has said the money -- up to $1 million -- went to building up the
Christian Democratic party in the formerly communist eastern states after German
unification.
</P>
<P>
	   But his refusal to name the source of the funds, insisting he gave his word,
has kept the scandal alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble, who was the party's faction leader in parliament under Kohl, said
he gave the cash he got after a fundraising dinner from Schreiber directly to
the party's then-treasurer, Brigitte Baumeister.
</P>
<P>
	   She accepted responsibility Tuesday for failing to report it -- a violation
that could result in a fine against the party -- saying Schreiber had told her
he wanted to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble renewed his call to Kohl, his former mentor, to release all
information about the funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If everyone would behave as openly as I am doing,'' he said, ``then we
could quickly get to the bottom of this.''

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Boost Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New campaign fund-raising figures added up to good news
for House Democrats but bad news for the party's presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported Wednesday that it
had almost $20 million in the bank at the end of 1999 -- 10 times as much as two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Democratic National Committee reported having only $2.5 million on
hand -- well below the $4.5 million it had in the bank at the end of 1997. And
the Republican National Committee reported it had $10 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures include both hard money -- funds raised under federal limits
that can be used to directly aid candidates -- and soft money -- unregulated
contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals that is spent on
issue advertisements designed to build support for the party or a particular
nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democrats need just five seats to regain control of the chamber they
lost in 1995. The DCCC raised $33.4 million in 1999 compared with $14.6 million
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The environment's just great for us,'' DCCC spokesman Erik Smith said.
``The House committee used to be the last stop on the fund-raising train. Now,
it's the first stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Republican Congressional Committee declined to release its
numbers Wednesday. The disclosure reports are due at the Federal Election
Commission Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The DNC's fund-raising troubles could hurt Vice President Al Gore and former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley. Both candidates are limited to spending around $40
million in their quest for the presidential nomination because they are
accepting federal funds for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, in a drawn out contest for the nomination, Gore or Bradley could be
out of money months before the national convention while Republican front-runner
George W. Bush can continue spending money because he is not taking federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   In that case, the Democratic National Committee would be called upon to run
television commercials promoting the party and its candidates, the same way the
Republican National Committee helped back Dole when he reached the spending
limits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its flagging financial fortunes, the DNC has hired
three new finance chairs: Carol Pensky, former committee treasurer and founder
of its Women's Leadership Forum; Joel Hyatt, an unsuccessful Senate candidate
from Ohio and co-founder of Hyatt Legal Services who now teaches at Stanford
Business School; and Joe Cari Jr., former national finance chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC reported it had raised $58 million for 1999, slightly less than the
$60 million it took in during the same period two years earlier. But the party
had $10 million in the bank at the end of the year, more than three times the
$3.1 million it had at the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mugger makes high wire escape, disguise - and disappearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A mugger being chased by police ran into an office
building and leaped from a 19th floor window to the building next door, where he
stole a pizza deliverer's hat and apron and calmly vanished out the front door.
<P>
	   It began when police responded to a call about a street robbery at 59th
Street and Park Avenue around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday, said Deputy Inspector Donald
Feser. They chased the suspect to East 53rd Street, where he ran into the Banco
Santander office building.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a chase that befitted the movies. The elevator doors opened; the
suspect jumped in; the doors closed. He arrived at the 19th floor a step ahead
of police, who had to take another elevator.
</P>
<P>
	   Before they could catch up with him, he had darted through an office and
jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said that witnesses thought he had plummeted to his death, but
instead he landed on a window air conditioner at the office building next door.
It was unclear how many floors the man fell before grabbing the air conditioner.
But the space between the buildings where he jumped is about 10 feet to 15 feet
wide. At some point, a few floors below where he jumped, the two structures
join.
</P>
<P>
	   Police didn't know right away that he had landed unscathed and crawled
through the window into the neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
	   There, he encountered a delivery man from the Checkerboard Gourmet deli. The
thief took the delivery man's hat and apron and put them on in the elevator; he
emerged in the lobby disguised as the delivery man, raising little suspicion as
he sauntered out of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think anything of it. He just looked like your ordinary delivery
guy," said a security guard at the second building, who declined to give his
name. "We thought all the action was next door."
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, the scene at Checkerboard was business as usual as the workers
there coped with the lunch rush.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy grabbed my delivery man's hat and apron. He scared the hell out of
him," said Checkerboard manager Seth Novak. The delivery man, who only would
give his name as Salvador, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Admitted the no-nonsense police inspector: "This was not your usual
occurrence."

<HEADLINE> Post Office Asks 1-Cent Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Expect to pay a penny more to send cards and letters
starting early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   And the cost of mailing magazines and catalogs is expected to go up
significantly -- proposals that are stirring up a hornet's nest in the business
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Sending post cards and letters would cost 21 cents and 34 cents respectively
under new rates proposed Tuesday by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We looked at it and held off as long as we could hold off,'' said Einar V.
Dyhrkopp, chairman of the postal board of governors. He said the new rates won't
take effect until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increases average about 6 percent over all classes of mail,
Dyhrkopp said. They now go to the independent Postal Rate Commission, which will
hold hearings before ruling on them.
</P>
<P>
	   Increases vary among the various types of mail and some of the proposals
were not sitting well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's devastating. The average increase for (magazines) looks to be about
15 percent, which is a terrible blow,'' said Jim Cregan of the Magazine
Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   While postal officials say they have seen little impact so far from the
growth of the Internet, Gene Del Polito of the American Association for Postal
Commerce says the proposed increases would make that happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they really wanted to do something to stimulate people's interest in
moving their business to the Web, I can't think of anything better they could
have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rate increases average about 14 percent for catalogs, Del Polito said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you happen to be L.L. Bean or Lands' End or anybody who does business
by catalog, the message is clear: Make your Web site as interactive as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Denton of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers said the proposed increases
are also above average for small, local charities.
</P>
<P>
	   And Newspaper Association of America President John Sturm complained about a
proposal to cut some of the rates for heavier pieces of advertising mail, which
compete with newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are always quite concerned when ... there are rate decreases proposed
for certain segments of our competitors' business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is required by law to base its rates on the cost of
handling each type of mail.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the increase in the base rate for a first-class stamp, the
charge for each additional ounce would rise from 22 cents to 23 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Priority mail would rise from $3.20 to $3.45 for the first pound, and the
first half-pound of Express Mail would increase from $11.75 to $12.30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This request is just the right amount at the right time for the Postal
Service,'' said Dyhrkopp. He said the governing board began discussing rate
increases last fall, but decided it could wait until now to act ``and still not
go in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
	   Postmaster General William Henderson stressed that the 1-cent boost in first
class mail rates is below the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The post office had a $363 million profit in fiscal 1999, which ended last
September, and is expecting to be about $100 million in the black this year,
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those are the smallest profit margins in five years, however, and rising
costs would lead the agency into the red without the planned increase.
</P>
<P>
	   United Parcel Service, one of the post office's main competitors in the
delivery business, recently announced a rate increase. Another competitor,
Federal Express, announced a 3 percent fuel surcharge, which spokesman Jesse
Bunn described as temporary.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike its competition, when the Postal Service wants to raise prices it
must seek permission from the independent Rate Commission and provide detailed
supporting documents. The commission then holds hearings and issues its
decision; the process takes 10 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Assuming commission approval, the matter would return to the postal
governors in November or December.
</P>
<P>
	   The current 33-cent first-class rate took effect Jan. 10, 1999, with a
1-cent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The Postal Service is a semi-independent federal agency. It does not receive
tax money for operations and is expected to make enough money to break even over
time. The agency still carries a $3.5 billion accumulated deficit, built up over
many years of operating in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years the agency had sought to delay rate increases as long as
possible, with the result that when they did occur they were 3 or 4 cents.
Henderson said large business mailers have indicated to the agency they prefer
smaller increases at more frequent intervals to the larger boosts.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Does Well in Nielsens  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The return of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and the
premiere of "Malcolm in the Middle" drew television viewers in droves Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Back for an open-ended run, ABC's game-show sensation scored the No. 2 spot
in the ratings race for the week, behind only NBC's "E.R," according to Nielsen
Media Research figures.
</P>
<P>
	   A half-hour earlier, "Malcolm" attracted the largest audience (22.4 million
viewers) of any Fox premiere since "The Simpsons" debuted a decade ago. Taking
the No. 6 slot, this new comedy edged such stalwarts as NBC's "Friends" (No. 7),
CBS' "60 Minutes," (No. 8) and ABC's "The Practice" (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
	   Over on NBC, Sunday's premiere of yet another game show, "Twenty-One," won a
healthy 19th place.
</P>
<P>
	   But the week's other game shows didn't fare so well. Fox's three airings of
"Greed" ranked 38th, 39th and 42nd. And CBS' entry, "Winning Lines," took a
consolation prize in 60th place (though winning its time slot).
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 3-9, ABC won with an average 14.73 million viewers (9.5
rating, 15 share), while NBC averaged 12.94 million viewers (9.0 rating, 14
share) and CBS had 12.59 million viewers (8.7 rating, 14 share). Fox had 11.87
million viewers (7.5 rating, 12 share).
</P>
<P>
	   Among the emerging networks, UPN had 3.68 million viewers (2.5 rating, 4
share), while the WB had 3.16 million viewers (2.3 rating, 4 share). The Pax
network had 1.15 million viewers (0.8 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   In the evening news wars, "NBC Nightly News" was the week's frontrunner with
a total of 12.47 million viewers (9.1 rating, 17 share), while ABC's "World News
Tonight" totaled 11.79 million (8.4 rating, 16 share) and "CBS Evening News" had
10.14 million (7.5 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings were:
"E.R.," NBC, 11.0; "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, 10.8; AFC
Wildcard Post-game Show, CBS, 10.5; Sugar Bowl: Florida State vs. Virginia Tech,
ABC, 10.4; "Frasier," NBC, 9.3; "Malcolm in the Middle," Fox, 8.6; "Friends,"
NBC, 8.6; "60 Minutes," CBS, 8.5; Sugar Bowl Pre-game Show, ABC, 7.6; "The
Practice," ABC, 7.4.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 127; Dow Down 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks gave up an early advance and finished lower today as
rising bond yields drew investors' attention. Shares of Internet companies led
the Nasdaq composite index to a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.12 to close at 11,511.08, down from
the closing high set yesterday. Earlier in the session, the Dow had risen as
much as 90 points. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was off 127.04 at 3,922.63, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 19.01 to 1,438.59.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,091 down, 1,028 up and 436 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock
Market, five stocks fell for every three that rose.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.25 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.03 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.28 to 492.61.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks fell as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.67 percent
from 6.58 percent late Monday. The weakness in the bond market was spurred by
growing concerns that the robust growth of the U.S. economy will force the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 in a bid to keep inflation from
escalating, and continued signs of economic growth have convinced many
economists that an increase in February is almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, the bond market has been much more sensitive than stocks
to the possibility of further rate hikes. Today, however, bond yields were
nearing the highest levels since Sept. 1997, drawing some investors away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising bond yields can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part
because they can present an appealing alternative to investors looking for
stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell. Analysts said investors were struggling with the notion that AOL,
a high-flying Internet leader that has commanded premium stock prices, will now
behave more like a traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, was
sharply lower. The Internet service provider was among the market's strongest
performers in 1999, and traders said the company would have to turn in an
especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Nervousness about corporate earnings spread well beyond the technology
sector. Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business,
fell after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly short of
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose, buoying the Dow
and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose, also benefiting from an upgrade from Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend continued today, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume was fairly heavy on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq,
continuing a string of volatile sessions this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hold on and enjoy the ride," said Charles White, president and portfolio
manager at Avatar Associates in New York. "The market is looking for some
direction, but there's still a lot of money on the sidelines and a lot of
interest in the stock market."

<HEADLINE> Algeria Leader Pardons Militants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- President Abdelaziz Bouteflika gave a blanket pardon
Tuesday to members of the Islamic Salvation Army, two days before the deadline
for all Islamic militants to lay down arms.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's office also said in a statement that the insurgency movement
had decided to ``definitively dissolve itself.'' More than 100,000 people have
died since the army canceled 1992 legislative elections that the Islamic
Salvation Front party was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The decree exonerates the militants, opening the way for a ``complete and
total reintegration into Algerian society,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The militant group, whose size is unknown, had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The amnesty appears to open the way for Islamic Salvation Army members to
cooperate with security forces in tracking down Islamic extremists who refuse to
give up their battle for an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouteflika's actions came a week after the militant group froze its deal
with Algerian authorities under which some members would turn in weapons and get
full amnesty and others would reportedly help security forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is the military wing of the banned Islamic Salvation Front party.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement from the president's office said the pardon resulted from the
1997 unilateral cease-fire declared by the militant group and the definitive
cease-fire called after Bouteflika took office in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Another militant group, the Armed Islamic Group, has refused Bouteflika's
peace plan, passed in a September referendum, that calls for insurgents who have
not killed, bombed or raped to turn in weapons by Thursday and receive a partial
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has vowed to eradicate active insurgents after that date.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Islamic Salvation Army froze its deal with authorities,
claiming it was not being honored, according to a spokesman for the Salvation
Front's executive branch in exile, Abdelkrim Ould Adda.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal, he said, was for 600 wounded or older militants to return to
civilian life. Those remaining would reportedly help security forces.

<HEADLINE> Four Va. Sgts. Face Sex Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Four Army staff sergeants -- three men and one
woman -- face court-martial in a sexual misconduct case involving trainees.
</P>
<P>
	   The four, charged Monday, were based at Fort Eustis, where they trained
soldiers in such skills as truck driving and aviation maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those charged was instructor Leroy Barnwell, 26, accused of making a
false statement and inappropriate advances toward female students; drill
sergeant Reginald Blanding, 32, accused of obstruction and sodomy; and
instructor Julio Jaramillo, 27, accused of obstruction of justice, indecent acts
and sodomy.
</P>
<P>
	   Drill sergeant Diane Cooper, 28, was charged with making a false statement
and forgery. She is accused of wrongfully having a personal relationship with a
student she married two weeks after training ended and lying to investigators
about it.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jury selection underway in police officer's murder trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of a
New Milford police officer charged with murder for shooting an unarmed suspect
in the back at point-blank range.
<P>
	   Scott Smith, 23, is the first police officer in Connecticut to be charged
with murder for killing someone in the line of duty. Smith has said he thought
27-year-old Franklyn Reid was reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid was shot once in the back on Dec. 29, 1998. Wanted on five arrest
warrants, Reid had fled on foot when police tried to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
	   No weapon was found on Reid, who was wanted for failure to appear on a
telephone harassment charge and had previously served three years in prison
sentence for assault and sexual assault. But a knife was found in his jacket,
which was lying nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection began in a courtroom markedly quieter than in the past. Other
proceedings in the case have drawn crowds of uniformed officers protesting the
prosecution of Smith. There was no sign of protest Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   By Tuesday afternoon, two jurors had been chosen. One was a woman, a retired
annuities manager for an insurance company. The other was a man, a mechanical
engineer.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen prospective jurors were excused for a variety of reasons,
including work and family commitments and acquaintance with potential witnesses
or someone involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the jurors were excused because they said they had already formed an
opinion as to Smith's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor, Waterbury State's Attorney John Connelly, rejected a man who
said that when he hears about such cases he generally assumes police fired in
self-defense. Smith's attorney, John Kelly, rejected a woman who said she and
her husband had once had a bad experience with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Connelly, in his questions to the potential jurors, repeatedly noted that
Smith, who is white, was accused of shooting Reid, a black man, in the back.
Kelly asked potential jurors if the fact that Kelly shot Reid in the back would
make them tend to believe he was guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorneys must select 12 regular jurors and four alternates. A pool of
30 was called for Tuesday's interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid's father, mother, grandfather and nephew sat in the front row behind
the prosecutor's table. Smith's mother and girlfriend were on the other side of
the aisle.
</P>
<P>
	   Reid's parents, Pearlylyn and Dwight Reid Sr., said they hoped justice would
be served. In the past, Mrs. Reid has said she thought race may have been a
factor in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe in the justice system and we hope that jurors ... will come in
here with a clear mind," she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Charles Gill said he expects the trial to start on Feb.
23 and to continue until at least the middle of March.

<HEADLINE> Acura Unveils New SUV Prototype  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Imagine tapping into the Internet for fishing reports from
the thickest woods in your Acura or merrily bowling over teeth-jarring terrain
-- in a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
	   Wonder no more, say the two foreign luxury carmakers who announced Tuesday
they're racing into the red-hot sport utility vehicle segment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no secret we're showing up for the SUV party a little late, so we're
making sure we're showing up prepared," Dick Colliver, American Honda's
executive vice president of sales, said in unveiling Acura's prototype of a
production-bound SUV during the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura -- Honda Motor Co.'s luxury division -- said the MD-X that could
arrive in showrooms this August should compete head-to-head in the mid-sized,
luxury SUV segment with the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes Benz's M-Class.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truck market now is 50 percent of the market, and we don't have a
vehicle in there," Coliiver said. "You've got to understand consumers and what
they want, then develop vehicles for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura's V6-powered SUV will sport four-wheel-drive, a Global Positioning
System -- a navigation system using a series of satellites to pinpoint exact
locations on Earth -- and integrated cellular Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   The SUV's production version will debut in April at the New York Auto Show,
said Colliver, who expects about 30,000 to sold in the first year. No price has
yet been announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to be outdone, independent performance-car maker Porsche AG announced a
2002 launch of its SUV that will be slightly wider and lower than the
DaimlerChrysler AG's Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be the heart and soul of Porsche," said Frederick Schwab, chief of
the German company's North American operations. "We're gonna be coming a bit
late, but most niche markets don't enter at the beginning."
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation, he said, Porsche's dealers -- 194 of them in the United
States -- plan to spend $250 million renovating and enlarging dealerships to
make room for the SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   In other unveilings Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mitsubishi Motor Corp. introduced the convertible Spyder version of its
Eclipse sports car, featuring an optional 200-horsepower engine, priced starting
at $23,400; a redesigned Montero sport utility; and the SSS concept vehicle, a
passenger car with sufficient storage space for the Japanese automaker to dub it
an "enhanced utility sedan."
</P>
<P>
	   --Audi introduced a long-wheelbase version of its luxury flagship A8 sedan.
The 2000 A8L will be in U.S. showrooms this spring and retail for $67,900, said
Len Hunt, the company's vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   --Jaguar pulled the wraps off a concept roadster that would be the
most-compact offering by the British luxury carmaker in more than four decades.
No price or production time frame have been set.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Sets Price for New Car-Van  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG will begin selling the Chrysler PT
Cruiser, a small car-van combination, this spring for as little as $16,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Resembling a modern version of a 1930s wagon, the PT Cruiser's base price
includes air conditioning and a cassette player. The top-of-the-line Limited
model, with several options including leather seats, will carry a price tag of
$19,995.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler Chairman Robert Eaton announced the plans for the new
car-van on Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show media preview.
</P>
<P>
	   The German-American automaker plans to build slightly more than 100,000 PTs
this year -- 60,000 for the North American market, the rest for Europe.
Production at the Toluca, Mexico, assembly plant eventually could reach 180,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The PT Cruiser is the latest in a line of concept vehicles that
DaimlerChrysler has built, rather than merely used to turn heads at auto shows
in Detroit and elsewhere. Its Viper high-performance coupe and Prowler roadster,
both in limited production, both made their debuts as concept cars.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler on Tuesday also showed off the Chrysler GT Cruiser and
Chrysler Panel Cruiser, two modified versions of the PT that Eaton called
examples of ways that PT owners might customize their vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Deemed Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors have determined that former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet is unfit to stand trial, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said the unanimous conclusion of a four-member medical team
who examined Pinochet on Jan. 5 was that he was ``at present unfit to stand
trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt that he should not
extradite Pinochet to Spain until hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention in Britain since his
arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was arrested on a Spanish
warrant for alleged human rights abuses committed during his 17-year rule in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement followed a Jan. 5 medical examination done at the Chilean
government's request. The general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric
specialists during a seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north
London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical tests -- which could lead to a release on humanitarian grounds
-- may represent Pinochet's best chance of putting an end to his legal battle.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, including Spanish citizens, were killed or disappeared
after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight to block his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited to Spain. A hearing is scheduled to begin on March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw must ultimately decide whether to extradite Pinochet to Spain or allow
him to return to Chile.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Boost Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New campaign fund-raising figures added up to good news
for House Democrats but bad news for the party's presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported Tuesday that it had
almost $20 million in the bank at the end of 1999 -- 10 times as much as two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Democratic National Committee reported having only $2.5 million on
hand -- well below the $4.5 million it had in the bank at the end of 1997. And
the Republican National Committee reported it had $10 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures include both hard money -- funds raised under federal limits
that can be used to directly aid candidates -- and soft money -- unregulated
contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals that is spent on
issue advertisements designed to build support for the party or a particular
nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democrats need just five seats to regain control of the chamber they
lost in 1995. The DCCC raised $33.4 million in 1999 compared with $14.6 million
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The environment's just great for us,'' DCCC spokesman Erik Smith said.
``The House committee used to be the last stop on the fund-raising train. Now,
it's the first stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Republican Congressional Committee declined to release its
numbers Tuesday. The disclosure reports are due at the Federal Election
Commission Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The DNC's fund-raising troubles could hurt Vice President Al Gore and former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley. Both candidates are limited to spending around $40
million in their quest for the presidential nomination because they are
accepting federal funds for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, in a drawn out contest for the nomination, Gore or Bradley could be
out of money months before the national convention while Republican front-runner
George W. Bush can continue spending money because he is not taking federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   In that case, the Democratic National Committee would be called upon to run
television commercials promoting the party and its candidates, the same way the
Republican National Committee helped back Dole when he reached the spending
limits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its flagging financial fortunes, the DNC has hired
three new finance chairs: Carol Pensky, former committee treasurer and founder
of its Women's Leadership Forum; Joel Hyatt, an unsuccessful Senate candidate
from Ohio and co-founder of Hyatt Legal Services who now teaches at Stanford
Business School; and Joe Cari Jr., former national finance chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC reported it had raised $58 million for 1999, slightly less than the
$60 million it took in during the same period two years earlier. But the party
had $10 million in the bank at the end of the year, more than three times the
$3.1 million it had at the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adding To Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to ask Congress in his 2001
budget for a $2.2 billion increase in spending for a national missile defense,
mainly for an expanded arsenal of interceptor rockets to be based in Alaska or
North Dakota, defense officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Just a year ago the Clinton administration added $6.6 billion to the
Pentagon's missile defense budget, and officials now estimate deployment of such
a system will cost $12.7 billion in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's request to pour more money into missile defense is likely to meet
with favor in Congress, where Republicans have pushed the administration for
years to move more quickly to deploy such a system. A much more ambitious
missile defense project initiated by President Reagan in 1983, called the
Strategic Defense Initiative but informally known as ``Star Wars'' for its
futuristic weaponry, withered after Reagan left office. The idea died early in
Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the past year, the Pentagon has argued that the nation faces a
growing threat from missile attack. Several countries hostile to the United
States, including North Korea, Iran and Iraq, are said to be seeking a
capability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. U.S. satellites can
detect missile launchings anywhere on the globe, but the United States has no
means of shooting down long-range missiles in flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The threat is real, (and) it will, in all likelihood, intensify in the
coming years as countries continue to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear
capabilities,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to decide as early as July whether to go ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the system is unlikely to provide a reliable defense against
ballistic missiles and that it will require the United States to withdraw from
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which many consider the bedrock of arms
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen has recommended spending another $1.9 billion to pay for an arsenal of
100 interceptors, according to officials who discussed the matter on condition
they not be identified. The current budget pays only for 20 interceptors, which
would not be enough to quash an attack of more than a few long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is to submit his budget to Congress on Feb. 7. Kenneth Bacon,
spokesman for Cohen, said Tuesday he could not discuss details of the budget in
advance, but he mentioned that the Pentagon's overall weapons procurement
account would increase to ``within a whisper'' of $60 billion, from $56 billion
in the budget year ending Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also recommended adding $300 million for more missile defense testing,
more spare parts and construction of a second missile launcher for interceptor
tests from the Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands. Those steps were
among numerous recommendations by a missile defense review panel headed by
retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, which said the program was on a ``highly
demanding'' schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Welch report, published last November, said Clinton would be in position
to determine by July the feasibility of a national missile defense but not
whether the technology and equipment are ready to be deployed. The final version
of the interceptor, for example, is not scheduled to be tested in flight until
2003.
</P>
<P>
	   A prototype interceptor is to be launched from Kwajalein next Tuesday. The
test is designed to demonstrate the Raytheon Corp.-built interceptor's ability
to receive in-flight targeting data from military satellites and radars, then
steer itself into the path of a mock warhead arching through space and destroy
it.
</P>
<P>
	   The first test of the prototype interceptor, last October, hit the target,
but the critical data links in that test were pre-programmed before the rocket
was launched. In next week's test, the interceptor is to receive data from a new
radar stationed on the Kwajalein range shortly before it separates from the
rocket booster, about 1,400 miles from its target in space.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Bacon, asked about the Jan. 18 test, said although the overall
project is on track, it would be unrealistic to expect success from every
intercept test.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has said there must be two successful intercept tests before it
starts construction of a missile defense site, most likely in Alaska. North
Dakota also is an option, but the Alaska site would cover a wider area.

<HEADLINE> France Train Murder Suspect Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A man suspected of a series of grisly slayings on night trains
in France was arrested in Portugal on Tuesday after fleeing there to escape a
nationwide manhunt, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sid Ahmed Rezala, 20, went into hiding when French police said he was a
suspect in the killings of two women, one French and one British. He later
became a suspect in a third slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Rezala was surrounded by armed police and arrested in Barreiro, about 12
miles south of Lisbon, Portuguese police said. He had been in Portugal for a
week, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been staying in Barreiro with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and
was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands, police
inspector Luis Neves said. Rezala did not resist arrest, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities were able to locate Rezala in part because he used his cellular
phone to make calls from Portugal to his girlfriend, whose phone was bugged,
according to Frederic Desaunettes, an investigating magistrate in Dijon, France.
</P>
<P>
	   Rezala is suspected in the Dec. 14 murder of Corinne Caillaux, a 36-year-old
Frenchwoman, whose stabbed body was found in a bathroom of the night train from
Calais to Ventimiglia, Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   He is also the prime suspect in the killing of English law student, Isabelle
Peake, whose body was found Oct. 13 beside a railroad track. She had been a
passenger on the night train from Limoges to Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Rezala was suspected in a third murder after police found the body of
20-year-old Emilie Bazin, reportedly an acquaintance of the suspect, under a
coal pile in the basement of an old building in Amiens, north of Paris, on Dec.
17.
</P>
<P>
	   Neves said Rezala would appear for an extradition hearing at a court in the
city on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rezala was freed in June from a prison near Marseille where he had served
time for ``violence with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Rezala's family were relieved to hear of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the result we have been hoping for since the beginning of this case
and it's also what his family wanted, after going through a month of suffering
caused by repeated questioning,'' said Jean-Claude Richard, one of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, police detained six of Rezala's family for questioning. His
parents had urged him to return to France and give himself up.

<HEADLINE> White House Vows Not To Push Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to massive demonstrations in Israel against
surrendering the Golan Heights, the Clinton administration on Tuesday vowed not
to push for a deal with Syria that fails to meet Israel's security needs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't push them to make decisions that they believe will be against
their interests,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``We wouldn't
want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   With Israel-Syria negotiations in recess until Jan. 19, the administration
is asking the two sides for recommendations on how to proceed and for revisions
in a seven-page U.S. document that could become the basis for a land-for-peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is hosting the negotiations with the proposition that
Israel should exchange territory for diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has indicated his willingness to pull back and
give up virtually all of the land. The negotiations with Syria at Shepherdstown,
W.Va., stalled Monday over how far back Israel would retreat.
</P>
<P>
	   Surrendering the Golan Heights would mean dislodging some 18,000 Israelis
who live on the plateau, their dairy farms, industries and wineries and
stripping Israel of a safeguard to surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
	   That prospect brought out some 100,000 demonstrators in Tel Aviv's Rabin
Square Monday night to urge Prime Minister Ehud Barak to hold on to the
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the demonstration was no surprise. And he reminded reporters that
Barak had promised to hold a national referendum on any deal he strikes with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We recognize that this is an extraordinarily difficult issue for Israel
and that they are going to have to make a national decision about how to proceed
if an agreement is reached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to the sentiments expressed by the demonstrators, many of whom
based their opposition on security rather than religious grounds, Rubin said
``we cannot urge the parties to go faster in pursuing this agreement than they
are comfortable with. It's their decision. They're the ones that are going to
have to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration always understood the Golan Heights issue raised ``a lot
of serious debate'' both in Israel and Syria, he said. ``We'll have to see how
that opposition unfolds in the coming days and weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, he said, ``it's Israel that has to judge its needs and we can't
make these decisions for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Departing Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval said, meanwhile, he did not
expect an agreement to be reached at the next round of Israel-Syria talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hopefully, we will reduce the points of disagreement until we reach the
common denominator on most issues,'' he said in a talk at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are on the Golan because of security questions in the past,'' Shoval
said, referring to cross-border attacks before Israel won the highground in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does no good to just return to the status quo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria is demanding Israel relinquish the territory, and pull back to the Sea
of Galilee. Syria thereby would recover territory it lost to Israel in the
1950s, as well as in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless the Israeli public sees with its own eyes that there is a change of
attitude by the Syrians in dealing with Israel... some sort of confidence
building measures... who knows how they will vote?'' Shoval said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, five members of the Senate Appropriations Committee arrived in
Israel to assess costs of a peace treaty and tour the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An Israeli-Syrian peace treaty is imperative for the region and the world,
but there is no blank check that is going to come out of the U.S. treasury,''
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said..

<HEADLINE> Cuba Civil Rights Said Worse  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's civil rights situation worsened during the last six
months of 1999, with a slight increase in the number of people submitted to the
Cuban justice system for political crimes, a leading human rights organization
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizardo Sanchez, president of the outlawed Cuban Commission of Human Rights
and National Reconciliation, said the organization's latest survey showed 344
people were sanctioned or otherwise legally processed for political reasons
during the last half of the year, up from 324 during the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 percent of those processed during the last half of 1999 could be
classified as prisoners of conscience under criteria established by many
international human rights groups, Sanchez said in a statement faxed to foreign
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez did not immediately return a
call seeking comment Tuesday. The Cuban government's position is that it holds
no political prisoners, only common criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I consider that the situation for civil and political rights in Cuba has
worsened over the past year... owing to that Cuba continues to be the only
closed society in this hemisphere,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been no significant release of prisoners, the number of people
sanctioned or processed for political motives increased. During the year, there
took place the widest waves of repression over the past decade,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez, who himself spent many years in Cuban prisons, is among the
communist island's best known opposition activists. The commission he heads
issues a report on civil rights every six months, along with a list of people it
considers to be imprisoned for political motives.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the detentions occurred in what Sanchez characterized as ``a wave of
repression'' in the days before the Ibero-American summit of heads of state in
November. At the time, President Fidel Castro charged that government opponents
were trying to undermine the event.
</P>
<P>
	   While many detentions were for a few hours or days, at least 17 people
picked up for political motives in November and December remain behind bars,
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   They include Dr. Oscar Biscet, arrested for displaying the Cuban flag upside
down in a sign of defiance of the communist government.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says formal announcement next month  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she will
formally declare her Senate candidacy in early February and hopes to have the
president and daughter Chelsea at her side when she does.
<P>
	   "That's my timetable," the first lady said when asked during a stop at a new
supermarket in Rochester if she planned to make it official next month. "It will
take a while to get everybody organized to do it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who confirmed in November that she intended to run, said
Tuesday she wanted her husband and daughter on hand for the historic
announcement. No first lady has ever run for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to be sure that I've got their schedules coordinated, but that's
what I'm planning," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if daughter Chelsea would take time off from her studies at Stanford
University to help her mother campaign in New York, Mrs. Clinton said only,
"That's down the road."
</P>
<P>
	   In this year's Senate race, Mrs. Clinton is expected to face New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The mayor has yet to say when he will formally announce his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Mrs. Clinton and the mayor have been campaigning across New York and
raising money for the Senate race for months.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton again questioned whether Giuliani had the proper
temperament to get along in the clubby Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "You want someone who has strong opinions and convictions about what will
work for New York, but who knows that everyday is not a pitched battle, that you
have to work with people," she said after touring a Tops supermarket in a
depressed area of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady continued to take the mayor to task for his battles with New
York City school officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly is clear that there have been so many controversies and
difficulties, the most recent being what's going on with the schools once again
- two school chancellors couldn't get along with him and are now gone," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know, at the end of the day, that's a lot of wasted energy," Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady said that she, on the other hand, has demonstrated that she
is suited for the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is something that requires a person who is able to absorb a lot of
incoming fire," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the first statewide poll results since the first lady became a
New York resident last week weren't especially encouraging: She was still
trailing Giuliani and her favorable rating was 48 percent, down 20 percentage
points from February 1999, according to pollsters for Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist poll found Giuliani supported by 49 percent of registered voters
to Mrs. Clinton's 40 percent. Eleven percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The head-to-head findings in the telephone poll of 621 registered voters
conducted Sunday and Monday were identical to the institute's December poll. The
margin of error for the latest poll from the Poughkeepsie-based institute is
plus or minus 4 percentage points, so the race remains close.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, Mrs. Clinton again called on Giuliani to consider a mutual ban
on the use of unlimited "soft-money" donations in the Senate race. She has
already resorted to such funding and Giuliani has not ruled it out. The mayor's
aides have said they would like to see something in writing from the first lady
on that subject before responding.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will make it in writing if that would be received favorably by the mayor
and his campaign," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   During her stop at the supermarket, Mrs. Clinton purchased some sliced
cheese and turkey from the deli counter before heading off for an afternoon
appearance at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in nearby Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's for a little snack on the way to the college," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton used a $20 bill to pay for her $8.34 in purchases, chatting
briefly with cashier Charity Dennard who was working the check-out line.
</P>
<P>
	   "I loved it," Ms. Dennard said after handling Mrs. Clinton's purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in Geneva, at a forum on community service, Mrs. Clinton told a crowd
of more than 2,000 in a Hobart and William Smith Colleges fieldhouse that
"service is at the very core of who we are as Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   She said, "It really does help America if you help that third grader learn
to read."

<HEADLINE> SEC Settles Case Against Informix  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, who have been pushing for more
accurate financial reporting by big companies, on Tuesday accused database
software maker Informix Corp. of fraudulently inflating its revenues by $295
million and its earnings by $244 million over several years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Informix agreed
to refrain from future violations and to cooperate with the SEC's continuing
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., neither admitted to nor denied the
SEC's allegations in its administrative order that the company, through former
employees, violated the securities laws and financial bookkeeping and reporting
rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company is gratified to have resolved the investigation," Informix
chairman Robert J. Finocchio, Jr. said in a statement. "The company has closed
the book on the past and now can concentrate on the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said Tuesday that Informix filed "materially false and misleading"
periodic corporate reports with the agency from 1994 through the first quarter
of 1997, that its books and records were falsified during that time, and that it
failed to use an adequate system of internal controls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though many of the company's violations originated overseas, we have
the ability to investigate such misconduct," Thomas Newkirk, an associate
director of enforcement at the SEC, said in a telephone interview. "Our
investigation as to the possible misconduct of individuals continues."
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move last May, Informix and its former auditors, Ernst &AMP; Young
LLP, agreed to pay $142 million -- more than twice what the company earned in
1998 -- to settle a lawsuit by shareholders alleging that the company misstated
revenues and traded on inside information. There also was no admission or denial
of wrongdoing in the private settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, approved by a court last month, called for Informix to pay
about $3.2 million in cash, $13.8 million in insurance payments on behalf of
several current and former officers, and 9 million shares of company stock worth
about $91 million. Ernst &AMP; Young is paying $34 million. The money is going to
compensate people who held company stock from early 1995 to late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Informix has operations in several countries. The SEC said its apparent
growth in revenue and earnings "largely was the result of the use of a multitude
of fraudulent and other improper practices."
</P>
<P>
	   The practices included backdating sales agreements, and recording revenue
from disputed claims against customers and from transactions with customers that
were not creditworthy, the SEC said in its order.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has been pushing publicly traded companies to improve their
financial reporting and avoid manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street
analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC in September accused 68 people and companies -- including Hall of
Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- of accounting fraud
in the first nationwide "sweep" against inflating earnings and other alleged
reporting misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   And last June, chemicals maker W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. agreed to set up a $1
million educational fund as part of a settlement of the SEC's allegations that
it fraudulently manipulated earnings of a former subsidiary. The regulators also
signed a related settlement with two partners of W.R. Grace's auditing firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
</P>
<P>
	   W.R. Grace and the two partners neither admitted to nor denied the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Ford Introduces New Small SUV  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. fired off another shot Tuesday in the battle
for sport utility vehicle buyers, unveiling a new small SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford plans to produce more than 100,000 versions of the Escape -- on sale
this summer -- and its mechanical twin, the Mazda Tribute.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford division president Jim O'Connor said the Escape would enter the
fastest-growing part of the SUV market, and would complement Ford's four other
SUV models.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why do we have so many SUVs? Because every time we add a new SUV we are
able to connect with new customers, increase our sales and increase our
profits," O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Escape and its competitors are aimed at being the first SUVs for many
buyers. The Escape will compete against Honda's popular CRV, the Toyota RAV4 and
models from several other foreign automakers.
</P>
<P>
	   While the market for small SUVs has been growing fast, domestic automakers
have been slow to jump into the fray with all-new models. Chevrolet sells a
version of the Suzuki Grand Vitara.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Honda and Toyota's models, the Escape is built on a car-like structure
for a ride that is better than a traditional truck. The four-door comes in
front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive variations. The Escape's optional
four-wheel-drive system kicks in automatically if the front wheels begin to
slip.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford will offer a three-liter, 200-horsepower V6 engine in more expensive LS
and ES models. The DX includes a 130-horsepower, 2-liter 4-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
	   At 14 feet, 4 inches long and 6-feet wide, it is 5.5 inches longer overall
than the Jeep Cherokee and 2 inches longer at the wheelbase. With back seats
folded down, it has 71.7 cubic feet of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford did not announce pricing for the Escape, but said it would be
"competitive." The CRV is priced between $18,000 and $20,000, while the RAV4
sells for $16,000 to $18,000.

<HEADLINE> The chances suddenly aren't so bad for an on-time budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Lawmakers and the governor have failed to enact an
on-time state budget for 15 straight years. But that losing streak may end this
year in the wake of Gov. George Pataki's latest budget proposal, politicians
agreed Tuesday.
<P>
	   "All the pieces of the puzzle are in the right place to pass an on-time
budget this year," said Republican state Sen. Nicholas Spano of Westchester
County.
</P>
<P>
	   The main culprits behind the most recent five overdue budgets - Pataki,
Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Democratic Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver - all insist that this is the year for a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the budget wasn't finished until Aug. 4, only hours before it
would have become the latest budget in state history. State budget are supposed
to be enacted by April 1, the beginning of the state's fiscal year, but there
are no penalties for the Legislature and governor for failing to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people don't think the leaders will succeed in being on time in 2000,
either.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I had a ranch, I wouldn't bet it," said Blair Horner of the New York
Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   But the politicians all say there's reason for real hope this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at this budget, I think it's a very sound budget and I would
hope the Legislature would not feel the need to make any dramatic changes,"
Pataki said. "And if that's the case, there's no reason why the changes that
they produce shouldn't and can't be made in an open and prompt manner and I
would hope that will be the case."
</P>
<P>
	   When reminded by a reporter that he says that every year, Pataki added: "I
feel more so this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Silver and Bruno did agree that Pataki has given them a better place to
start from with his budget proposal Tuesday. They say it will allow them to come
to an end product faster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe it should," Silver said. "It certainly has a better foundation."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki proposed Tuesday that New York spend nearly $78 billion in its next
fiscal year, 5.5 percent more than the current fiscal-year spending plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno agreed with Silver's assessment of an on-time budget's chances.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has established a pretty good base," Bruno said. "I think this
year will be better than other years."
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, this is also an election year for the Senate and the Assembly.
The quicker they finish the budget, the quicker they get home and start raising
money full-time and campaigning for re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the budget was finished on April 14 in 1998, the last time the
Legislature was up for re-election. Legislators have never gone past July 13
without a budget in an election year.
</P>
<P>
	   "And this is a uniquely important election," Horner pointed out.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2002 Legislature will decide how to redistrict the state after the 2000
Census and the advantage in redistricting goes to the party that controls the
Assembly and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature that's in power in 2002 will be the Legislature who will be
in power for the next 10 years," Horner said. "They'll want to get out of Dodge
and get home as soon as they can."
</P>
<P>
	   While the process has not changed - Bruno suggested ending the "three men in
a room" process last week under which Pataki, Silver and Bruno meet privately
and agree to the key aspects of budgets. But Pataki and Silver would not
immediately commit to it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of going home for good for the rest of the year after finishing the
budget last August, the Legislature returned to Albany several times to hash out
the Health Care Reform Act, New York's one-of-a-kind subsidy system to fund
cash-shy aspects of the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the HCRA deal, Pataki and the Legislature agreed to a three-year
continuation of Medicaid cost containment programs worth about $1 billion a
year. Cost containment has been at the center of budget battles for years.
</P>
<P>
	   "It think that was a very, very important part of HCRA," Pataki said. "It
doesn't just make this year's budget process easier, it makes the budget process
easier for the next three years because that last year was probably the most
difficult issue, whether or not to continue the cost containment and that is now
resolved."
</P>
<P>
	   However, it won't be completely smooth sailing this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno and Silver both criticized Pataki's education proposal. Pataki called
for $12.9 billion for education, a record amount. But Silver and Bruno both want
more, pointing out that the governor is not seeking to fund certain programs
from the current year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the things that were left out included class-size reductions,
pre-kindergarten programs and increased teacher salaries, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the members of the conference will take those education cuts
lightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno was more charitable. "Now is not the time to cut back on our support
for secondary education," he said.

<HEADLINE> Acura Unveils New SUV Prototype  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Imagine tapping into the Internet for fishing reports from
the thickest woods in your Acura or merrily bowling over teeth-jarring terrain
-- in a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
	   Wonder no more, say the two foreign luxury carmakers who announced Tuesday
they're racing into the red-hot sport utility vehicle segment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no secret we're showing up for the SUV party a little late, so we're
making sure we're showing up prepared," Dick Colliver, American Honda's
executive vice president of sales, said in unveiling Acura's prototype of a
production-bound SUV during the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura -- Honda Motor Co.'s luxury division -- said the MD-X that could
arrive in showrooms this August should compete head-to-head in the mid-sized,
luxury SUV segment with the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes Benz's M-Class.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truck market now is 50 percent of the market, and we don't have a
vehicle in there," Colliver said. "You've got to understand consumers and what
they want, then develop vehicles for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura's V6-powered SUV will sport four-wheel-drive, a Global Positioning
System -- a navigation system using a series of satellites to pinpoint exact
locations on Earth -- and integrated cellular Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   The SUV's production version will debut in April at the New York Auto Show,
said Colliver, who expects about 30,000 to sold in the first year. No price has
yet been announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to be outdone, independent performance-car maker Porsche AG announced a
2002 launch of its SUV that will be slightly wider and lower than the
DaimlerChrysler AG's Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be the heart and soul of Porsche," said Frederick Schwab, chief of
the German company's North American operations. "We're gonna be coming a bit
late, but most niche markets don't enter at the beginning."
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation, he said, Porsche's dealers -- 194 of them in the United
States -- plan to spend $250 million renovating and enlarging dealerships to
make room for the SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   In other unveilings Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mitsubishi Motor Corp. introduced the convertible Spyder version of its
Eclipse sports car, featuring an optional 200-horsepower engine, priced starting
at $23,400; a redesigned Montero sport utility; and the SSS concept vehicle, a
passenger car with sufficient storage space for the Japanese automaker to dub it
an "enhanced utility sedan."
</P>
<P>
	   --Audi introduced a long-wheelbase version of its luxury flagship A8 sedan.
The 2000 A8L will be in U.S. showrooms this spring and retail for $67,900, said
Len Hunt, the company's vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   --Jaguar pulled the wraps off a concept roadster that would be the
most-compact offering by the British luxury carmaker in more than four decades.
No price or production time frame have been set.

<HEADLINE> Bayer Settles Ad Suit for $1M  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Think taking aspirin can prevent a heart attack? It can
reduce some risk -- but not for everybody. The distinction is costing Bayer
Corp. $1 million, the tab for a consumer education program announced Tuesday to
settle government charges that Bayer's advertising oversold aspirin's benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Aspirin is not appropriate for everyone, so be sure to talk to your doctor
before you begin an aspirin regimen," say the full-page ads Bayer must run in
four national magazines between February and May.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayer also will distribute free consumer brochures titled "Aspirin Regimen
Therapy: Is it right for you?"
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement aims to clear up confusion about who can truly benefit from
taking aspirin daily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission charged that a series of Bayer ads made
unsubstantiated claims that regular aspirin use could help the general
population prevent heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, while aspirin can be a powerful heart protector for some people at
high risk of a heart attack or stroke -- and also can reduce the risk of death
during a suspected heart attack -- it's not recommended for just anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little evidence that it prevents a heart attack in someone who
doesn't already have vascular disease, said Dr. Rodman Starke of the American
Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   It has side effects that can harm some people.
</P>
<P>
	   And the dose for heart patients isn't the same as what people pop for a
headache.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the Food and Drug Administration insists aspirin therapy for
heart attacks and strokes be done under the direction of a doctor -- and why the
FTC carefully checked for accuracy the $1 million consumer education campaign
Bayer is running to settle the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people have conditions that aspirin may make worse," Bayer
acknowledges in the consumer brochures. It adds: "For healthy people without any
symptoms of heart disease, the risks of an aspirin regimen may outweigh the
benefits."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bayer will pay $30,000 to both New York and Connecticut to
settle similar state charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The message is "very simple: Talk to your doctor," said Dr. George Sopko, a
National Institutes of Health cardiologist, who worries Bayer's earlier ads
implied simply taking aspirin, instead of dieting and exercising, was enough
therapy. "Aspirin is only part of it. It is not 'the' therapy."
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement actually surprised the heart association's Starke, who said
he saw the ads and didn't consider them terribly misleading -- but nonetheless
welcomed the consumer campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is going to promote the use of aspirin in those people who should be on
it, and help protect those people who shouldn't be on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   So who should consider aspirin?
</P>
<P>
	   --Anyone who has previously had a heart attack, a "mini-stroke" or an
ischemic, or clotting, stroke; anyone with the chest pain called angina; or
anyone who has had an angioplasty or coronary bypass operation, the new Bayer
brochures advise.
</P>
<P>
	   --If you suspect you're having a heart attack, seek emergency medical care
immediately. But because studies show aspirin reduces the risk of death during a
suspected heart attack, talk to your doctor now about whether taking aspirin
while awaiting the ambulance would be a good idea, the brochures say.
</P>
<P>
	   On the down side:
</P>
<P>
	   --Aspirin use can slightly increase the risk of another type of stroke, a
hemorrhagic or bleeding stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   --Regular aspirin use can cause such side effects as stomach ulcers or
bleeding, particularly in people who have three or more alcoholic drinks a day,
the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
	   --Doctors also consider whether patients have bleeding disorders like
hemophilia, take other blood-thinning medicine such as Coumadin, or have reduced
liver or kidney function or uncontrolled high blood pressure before they
prescribe daily aspirin.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Moscow Deputy Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a former spokesman for Boris Yeltsin,
has resigned as deputy head of the Moscow city government, the Interfax news
agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, citing Deputy Mayor Valery Shantsev, said Yastrzhembsky resigned
Monday. The report did not state a reason for the resignation and telephone
calls to the Moscow mayor's office went unanswered Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky, a onetime diplomat, became a familiar face worldwide in his
two years as spokesman for the president. He was at Yeltsin's side almost
continually in public and was frequently called on to explain the president's
sometimes erratic behavior and incongruous remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeltsin fired him in September 1998 after Yastrzhembsky pushed for Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to be named prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   He became Luzhkov's chief official for Moscow's contacts with foreign
governments and with other Russian regions.
</P>
<P>
	   He also became head of TV Tsentr, a television channel partially owned by
the city. He will remain in that post, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Apply for Belgian Amnesty  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Hundreds of illegal immigrants lined up to apply
for residency in Belgium on Tuesday, the second day of a three-week government
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
	   Brussels alone saw 1,300 applicants on the first day of the amnesty Monday.
Hundreds more turned up Tuesday in the capital and other big cities such as
Antwerp and Ghent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Antoine Duquesne expects about 20,000 illegals to request
residence permits before the amnesty period ends Jan. 28. The government
estimates 60,000 illegal immigrants live in the country, mostly from Asia,
Africa and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   To ensure more illegal immigrants don't enter during the amnesty, Belgium
re-imposed passport checks and other border controls lifted in 1995 as part of
an accord with its European Union neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found 12 Kurdish stowaways on a Dutch truck in Ghent. Few illegals
were found elsewhere, despite vehicle searches by police dogs and infrared
scanners.
</P>
<P>
	   Trucks and cars waited up to eight hours. The line was 12 miles long near
Eupen on the German side of the border and six miles long near Borsem on the
Dutch side of the border. A blockade by French truck drivers protesting proposed
work rules complicated the situation for a second day on the French border.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium authorities have not said how long the border controls will last.

<HEADLINE> China Rebuffs Pleas Over N. Koreans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Rebuffing South Korean requests, Beijing said Tuesday that
seven North Koreans who fled their hunger-stricken communist country had crossed
into China illegally and could not be regarded as refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's National Red Cross Society last week urged its Chinese
counterpart not to repatriate the seven North Koreans, saying they fear they
could be killed if returned to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao did not say where the seven
are now or whether they have been repatriated. But he made clear that Beijing
views them no differently from thousands of other North Koreans who have crossed
illegally into China in search of food in recent years. If caught, they are
usually returned to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Chinese side does not view them as refugees,'' Zhu said of the North
Koreans deported by Russia to China in December, two months after they fled to
Russia through China.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea had urged Russia to let the North Koreans travel to the South,
while North Korea asked that they be returned to their home country.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean human rights groups say thousands of North Koreans are living
in northeastern China after fleeing the widespread hunger in their country.
Those forcibly repatriated face torture and in some cases execution, they say.

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks gave up an early advance and finished
lower today as rising bond yields drew investors' attention. Shares
of Internet companies led the Nasdaq composite index to a steep
decline. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.12 to close at
11,511.08, down from the closing high set yesterday. Earlier in the
session, the Dow had risen as much as 90 points. The Nasdaq,
meanwhile, was off 127.04 at 3,922.63. Stocks fell as the yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.67 percent from 6.58 percent
late yesterday. The weakness in the bond market was spurred by
growing concerns that the robust growth of the U.S. economy will
force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next

	   BERLIN (AP) -- America Online Inc. and media giant Bertelsmann AG
plan to continue their cooperation in the wake of AOL's mega-deal
with Time Warner. But the head of the German company said today he
will leave AOL's board to avoid a conflict of interest. Privately

fraudulently inflated company revenues and earnings. The SEC found
that former Informix employees inflated revenues by $295 million
and earnings by $244 million between 1994 and the first quarter of
1997. No monetary fines or penalties were imposed against Informix,
a database software company based in Menlo Park, Calif. The SEC
said Informix failed to devise and maintain sufficient internal
accounting controls. It said that as the fraud came to light,
former Informix managers committed fraud in trying to avoid a
restatement of the company's financial statements. Informix
eventually restated its financial statements. It did not admit or
deny the findings, it agreed to cooperate with a continuing
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters To Create Ethics Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY DON BABWIN Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Teamsters president James P. Hoffa says the union,
which has been under federal supervision for a decade, can police itself now.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoffa appeared Tuesday before representatives of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters' 1.4 million members and left with their unanimous
approval to establish a code of conduct for union members.
</P>
<P>
	   The representatives also supported creation of an ethics board and a study
of the union's efforts to sever ties with organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to move ahead and do this study and verify the fact we are
corruption free, we are free of influence of organized crime and we are ready to
talk to the federal government," Hoffa said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoffa won the Teamsters' presidency on pledges to root out corruption and
work to end the federal oversight, which the union agreed to in 1989 to avoid
racketeering charges brought by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has spent $83 million to support the federal monitoring, Hoffa
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that more than 100 officers and members have been kicked out for
associating with alleged organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department spokesman said government officials have met with
Teamsters, but gave no indication the department is willing to drop its
oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope that the IBT's efforts to develop and implement an effective
anti-corruption program are successful," Shirah Neiman, deputy U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. "We look forward to
continuing to work with the union under the consent decree to ensure that
progress in ridding the IBT of corruption and organized crime continues."
</P>
<P>
	   Hoffa said a task force of some 20 Teamsters will oversee the code of
conduct. A first draft is expected by April 15, and the final draft is expected
to be approved by Aug. 15, said union spokesman Chip Roth. Hoffa said
implementing the entire plan would be completed in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said the union has informed several federal agencies about its plan. He
said the union will ask federal agencies for input on the code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading the anti-corruption effort is Edwin H. Stier, a former federal
prosecutor hired by Hoffa last year. Stier said he doesn't believe organized
crime controls the union.
</P>
<P>
	   "The question is, Are there pockets of organized crime influence within the
union?" Stier said after the meeting. He said that if that was the case, they
had to be identified and removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Hoffa or Stier gave specific provisions to be included in the code
of conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stier said he expected "some very specific provisions in there dealing
with how you handle the assets of the union, what procedures you have to follow
to spend the union's money." He said he also expected provisions to cover union
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Hoffa wrote a letter to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, saying
he believes the union can demonstrate that it doesn't need the federal
government looking over its shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Rebels, Gov't Clash in Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels and government forces loyal to
President Laurent Kabila fought on swampy islands on the Congo River on Tuesday,
despite efforts to secure a truce in the 16-month war in Africa's third-largest
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Ugandan-backed rebel Congolese Liberation
Movement, accused government troops on Tuesday of violating a five-month
cease-fire by overrunning the small fishing village of Kwalungu.
</P>
<P>
	   Bemba said his troops, some of whom were based on Kwalungu, retaliated by
recapturing nearby Konya, 275 miles northeast of the capital, Kinshasa, killing
21 government soldiers and taking 15 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This river has many islands, and the enemy is hiding there. We're flushing
them out,'' Bemba told The Associated Press by satellite telephone from his
headquarters in Gbadolite in northern Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   State-run radio in Kinshasa confirmed the capture of Kwalungu, but made no
mention of reported losses or the fighting at Konya. Kabila dismissed the
rebels' claims of cease-fire violations, saying that Congo doesn't pay credence
to claims from ``traitors of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila reiterated his oft-repeated stance that ``rebels do not exist in
Congo ... the perpetrators of the aggression are pawns of Uganda and Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three rebel factions completed a peace accord with Kabila and his allies in
August that calls for a cease-fire, the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and the
withdrawal of foreign troops. But fighting has persisted, especially in northern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has invited key
players in Congo's war for talks in New York on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila on Tuesday confirmed he would attend the talks, state Voice of the
People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders of Uganda, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia also have said they
will attend. Also set to participate are Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of
the Organization of African Unity, and former Botswana President Ketumile
Masire, the OAU's special envoy to the Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano called for a summit of the
Southern African Development Community to discuss the Congo peace process.
Chissano, who is the SADC chairman, called for the meeting to be held on Jan. 16
in Maputo, the Mozambican capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The three Congolese rebel factions who recently agreed to cooperate
politically and militarily announced a meeting in the northern city of Kisangani
on Feb. 4 to decide on a common front against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
	   Kisangani has been contested by all three rebel groups, and was the scene of
heavy fighting among them in mid-August.

<HEADLINE> TV Movie on Ali Not the Greatest  </HEADLINE>
    By ED SCHUYLER JR. AP Boxing Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "And now, the main event."
</P>
<P>
	   That was the introduction to "King of the World," Monday night's ABC-TV
movie about how Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared with the documentaries about Ali, this film is strictly a
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
	   As a boxing drama, it wasn't bad, with credible fight scenes.
</P>
<P>
	   As a character study, it was a bit disjointed and shallow. But with less
than two hours to cover a lot of ground, there wasn't nearly enough time to
portray a figure as complicated as Ali.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Ali is shown being knocked down by Sonny Banks. Then, after
six commercial plugs and promos for a movie and two TV shows, he is shown
getting up at the count of six. Talk about a long count.
</P>
<P>
	   The two stars of the movie, which was based on David Remnick's book, "King
of the World," and other published accounts, are Terrance Howard and Steve
Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris needs to say little in the role of Liston -- just glare and act
sullen. Glaring and sullen behavior were developed into an art form by Liston,
but Harris does as well as could be expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard performs capably as the brash young Clay -- Clay didn't become Ali
until about a month after he beat Liston in 1964. Of course, nobody plays the
fighter better than Ali himself in such documentaries as "When We Were Kings"
and "Muhammad Ali, the Whole Story."
</P>
<P>
	   The makers of those documentaries had a huge advantage over any producer of
a made-for-TV movie: Ali is a natural-born actor.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris does a solid job in portraying Ali apparently coming apart
emotionally at the weigh-in before his heavyweight championship challenge to
Liston. In real life, it was one of the greatest spur-of-the moment performances
in the history of mind games.
</P>
<P>
	   Remnick's book covers the period from Liston's one-round knockout of Floyd
Patterson in their first fight in 1962 to Ali's 12th-round technical knockout of
Patterson in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie ends after Ali wins the title when Liston quits on his stool after
sixth round at Miami Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Ali's penchant for predicting the rounds he would win and for quoting corny
poetry are touched on. But the movie mainly dwelled on his friendship with
Malcolm X, the buildup to the Liston fight, and the fight itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The best scenes were those with promoter Bill MacDonald speaking to Ali
three days before the Liston bout. MacDonald says reports that Ali had become a
member of the Nation of Islam were hurting the match. He said the fight would be
canceled unless Ali denies them. Ali refuses, knowing he might not get another
shot at the title.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight is saved when a publicist (the late Harold Conrad) goes to Malcolm
X's motel and convinces him to get out of town until the night of the fight.
Malcolm complies.
</P>
<P>
	   The big fight scene takes place in Ali's corner after the fourth round.
Something gets into Ali's eyes during the round and he is blinded. It's been
argued that a substance was intentionally put on Liston's gloves, but that has
never been proved.
</P>
<P>
	   In the corner, Ali tells trainer Angelo Dundee to cut off his gloves because
he can't continue. Dundee washes the eyes and pushes Ali out for the fifth
round. Ali's eyes eventually clear and he goes on to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The next day, Ali confirms he belongs to the Nation of Islam. He becomes
Cassius X, and then on March 6 he is given the name Muhammad Ali by Elijah
Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam.

	   COMMON CURRENCY: Americans favor a common currency for North America. A
survey sponsored by Coinstar Inc. found 43 percent of Americans would support an
agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico to create one currency for
the three nations akin to the euro that is shared by 11 European nations. The
survey also found 25 percent of respondents would like to adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   That Americans show interest in a common currency may indicate fears about a

	   UNSAFE HOME WORK?: Although the number of Americans who telecommute has
multiplied over the past decade, a survey by the American Management Association
survey found that most companies provide no support for these employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 7 percent of telecommuters at U.S-based corporations have been formally
trained to work outside their normal office environment, according to an AMA
survey. The study, which polled 1,265 executives of AMA member organizations,
found half the workers were not supplied with the necessary equipment to work
from home.
</P>
<P>
	   The AMA offered some advice to ease telework difficulties, such as providing
adequate hardware, software and remote access capability, establishing clear
requirements and expectations, and encouraging teleworkers to set ground rules
with their family members for working at home.

<P>
	   TOP NEGOTIATIONS: Companies are so eager to find and keep top executives
that they're guaranteeing new employees a variety of benefits including bonuses,

	   According to a recent survey of 450 firms by Exec-U-Net, an online
recruiting and management services firm, 40 percent of the companies offer
sign-on bonuses, up from 35 percent from the previous year and 45 percent offer

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Beats Profit Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Fourth-quarter profits at Yahoo! Inc., the world's
leading Web destination, beat Wall Street expectations for the 15th consecutive
quarter on strong holiday sales and advertising fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $44.7 million, or 15
cents a share, from $3.8 million, or 1 cent a share the same period a year ago.
Excluding amortization and goodwill costs, earnings were $57.6 million, or 19
cents a share -- 4 cents above analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's earnings were released after the close of regular trading
Tuesday. Yahoo!'s stock finished down $38.68 3/4, or 8.9 percent, at $397.37 1/2
on the Nasdaq Stock Market as investors worried Internet company growth rates
will slow in a wave of mergers that might follow America Online's announcement
Monday it will purchase media giant Time Warner Inc. for $146 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings report didn't seem to assuage investors, however, who pushed
shares down to $375 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the company announced a two-for-one stock split effective Feb.
14. Yahoo! has about 263 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the quarter rose to $201.1 million from $91.3 million as the
company collected higher advertising fees and saw increased business from
e-commerce during the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
	   During December 1999, Yahoo! reported its global audience grew to more than
120 million unique users, double the 60 million users it served in the same
period of 1998. The number of unique users a week averaged 3 million a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Also during December, Yahoo!'s traffic increased to an average of 465
million page views per day, a figure sharply higher than analyst estimates of
424 pages views per day and nearly three times the average of 167 million page
views per day in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures are significant because about 30 percent of Yahoo! revenue
stream comes from money its charges companies for slotting and placement when
users are conducting searches for a particular item and by taking a percentage
of each sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo! accounts for 56 percent of all search engine referrals, five times
its nearest competitor, and up from 38 percent at the beginning of 1999,
according to Media Metrix, which measures Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   The gains come at the expense of such portals as Lycos, AltaVista, Go! and
Excite. Microsoft Corp. and America Online also have gained market share, but
remained well behind Yahoo! through November, Media Metrix reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Yahoo! is emerging as the disproportionate winner in the portal space,"
Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget said in a report to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income rose to $61.1 million, or 20 cents a share,
compared to a net loss of $12.7 million, or 6 cents a share in the year-ago
period. Net revenue rose to $588.6 million, from $245.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen; Down Vs. Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Tuesday, rising against the yen but
falling against the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.99 Japanese yen, up
from 105.20 yen late Monday. The euro was quoted at $1.0322, up from $1.0259.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar broke free of its traditional pattern of following the direction
of the U.S. stock markets, which turned lower Tuesday. Instead, its mixed
movement was directed by global circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dollar is like a residual of developments abroad. It's big picture
stuff," said Marc Chandler, chief currency trader for Mellon Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler said currency traders are selling yen ahead of the Group of Seven
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of major industrial nations
that is scheduled for Jan. 22 in Tokyo. Japan is believed to be the only member
of the group not in favor of raising global interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the yen has also fallen as rumors persist that large U.S. hedge
fund managers are betting that the dollar will rise against the Japanese
currency, Chandler added.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro rose Tuesday on optimism for Europe's fledgling single economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5603 Swiss francs, down from 1.5685, and
1.4567 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4551. The British pound rose to $1.6477 from
$1.6369.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8948 German marks, down from 1.9065; 6.3549
French francs, down from 6.3940; and 1,875.87 Italian lire, down from 1,887.39.

<HEADLINE> IMF Issues Capital Controls Report  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nations can use capital controls to stabilize chaotic
financial markets but should not try them as a way of avoiding painful economic
reforms, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF issued a 60-page report analyzing how capital controls -- limits
imposed by governments on the flow of money across borders -- were used in
recent years, including the two-year-long global financial crisis that began in
Thailand in 1997 and pushed a number of countries into steep recessions.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF concluded that capital controls were useful in some circumstances to
provide a "temporary breathing space" for nations to implement economic reform
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The report represented one more step the 182-nation lending agency has taken
away from its previously held strong opposition to the use of capital controls.
The IMF in the past had argued that countries would be punished for using
capital controls because it would scare away future foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was highlighted during the Asian financial crisis by Malaysia,
which imposed capital controls to deal with its currency problems against the
advice of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
	   While Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia accepted IMF advice in return for
multibillion-dollar loan packages as their economies sank, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad rejected the IMF formula and announced he would impose
capital controls for a temporary period until his country's financial situation
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
	   IMF officials and the Clinton administration warned that Malaysia was
running the risk of becoming an economic pariah by its actions. However,
Malaysia's capital controls, which temporarily restricted foreigners from
repatriating their investments, were successful in stabilizing the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, Mahathir recalled the forecasts of economic doom and said
Malaysia had employed the "Sinatra principle. We did it our way."
</P>
<P>
	   In its report, the IMF conceded that "the controls gave the Malaysian
authorities some breathing space to address the macroeconomic imbalances and
implement banking system reforms."
</P>
<P>
	   In the other case studies, the IMF found that capital controls offered some
benefits in dealing with panicked markets. But the report stressed, "No single
capital control measure was effective across all countries at all times."
</P>
<P>
	   Stefan Ingves, director of the IMF's monetary affairs department, said that
the IMF had not changed its basic view that in the long-run capital controls
were bad for a nation because they discouraged foreign investment. But he said,
"In the short-term they may be helpful" to give countries time to implement
needed reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the countries studied in the IMF report were Malaysia, Spain,
Thailand, Romania, Russia, Venezuela, China, India, Argentina, Kenya and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Declared Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand
trial on human rights abuse charges, the government announced Tuesday, opening
the possibility that the former Chilean dictator could win his battle against
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said the four-member medical team who examined Pinochet on
Jan. 5 unanimously agreed that he was too ill to face trial, ``and that no
change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   They did not immediately make available details on why he was considered
unfit. But The Sunday Times reported in London last weekend that the doctors had
found Pinochet was suffering from a viral infection, diabetes, heart disease and
the effects of two mild strokes. His diabetes reportedly has caused a loss of
sensation in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could halt efforts to try Pinochet in connection with the
disappearances and killings of thousands of Chileans during his 17-year rule
there. He could be released on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt that he should not
extradite Pinochet to Spain until hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The news was greeted with protest and support in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Organization of Relatives of Missing Detainees, a group
dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the Pinochet
dictatorship, said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous frustration and sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated,'' said Mireya Garcia, vice president of the organization. ``We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   An official with the Pinochet Foundation, an organization of Pinochet
supporters, said only this when told the news by the AP: ``Are you sure? This is
wonderful. Let me go tell the others,'' he said, refusing to give his name.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from human rights groups or government
officials in Spain, where the announcement came near midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention in Britain since his
arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was arrested on a Spanish
warrant for alleged human rights violations committed during his rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's medical exam was done at the Chilean government's request. The
general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric specialists during a
seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, including Spanish citizens, were killed or disappeared
after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight to block his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited to Spain. A hearing is scheduled to begin on March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw must ultimately decide whether to extradite Pinochet to Spain or allow
him to return to Chile.

<HEADLINE> Conjoined twins from Dominican Republic separated in NJ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - In the first operation on conjoined twins in New
Jersey, doctors have separated two 7-month-old sisters from the Dominican
Republic who shared a liver.
<P>
	   Nasmil and Jazmin Campusano, who had spent every moment of their lives
connected at the chest, were sleeping in separate rooms under crocheted quilts
at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center Tuesday, one day after the five-hour
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The girls were in critical but stable condition and were hooked to
ventilators, but had begun to breathe a little on their own, doctors said.
Doctors said the twins, who were born with their other organs separated, would
probably leave the hospital in two weeks and return to the Dominican Republic in
six.
</P>
<P>
	   George Garrow, a St. Joseph's pediatric surgeon, said both girls had a good
chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said the surgery had few complications, particularly because the
sisters had separate hepatic portal veins, which bring blood from the intestines
to the liver. Only a small amount of artificial skin was needed to cover the
stomach of one of the twins, lead surgeon Victor Valda said.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgery gave Nasmil 60 percent of the shared liver and Jazmin 40
percent, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The girls' mother, 20-year-old Xiamara Frias de Campusano, stood with her
arms folded near her babies in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
	   "Faith in God," she said in Spanish when asked how she got through the
operation. She said she didn't know what she would tell her children about how
they were born once they get older.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't thought about that. I have no idea how to tell them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births, when a
fertilized egg destined to become identical twins does not entirely split in
two. In 70 percent of cases, conjoined twins are female. In three out of four
cases, the twins are stillborn or die within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Frias de Campusano gave birth to the girls prematurely and by Caesarean
section on May 25 in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   A doctor there called Evelyn Dudziec, executive director of Healing the
Children, an agency based in Kinnelon, Morris County, that helps provide medical
treatment to children around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization brought the twins here nine days after their birth and gave
them to a host family, Cathy and Ed Queenan of Cranford, while they awaited
their surgery. Doctors said the twins, who weighed 7 pounds, 8 ounces together
at birth, had to be bigger before the operation could be performed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Queenans learned how to hold and feed the twins at the same time and put
them sideways in a custom-made wooden box when they took them out in the car.
Although they were joined together, the girls had different personalities, Mrs.
Queenan said. Nazmil was quiet while Jazmin was more outgoing, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've always been separate human beings," Mrs. Queenan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Frias de Campusano arrived in New Jersey several days before the
surgery. Her husband, Franklin Campusano, remained in the Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE> International Paper To Cut Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- International Paper Co., the world's largest manufacturer
of paper and other wood products, said Tuesday it will cut 2,000 jobs, or about
2 percent of its work force, in a move to improve profits.
</P>
<P>
	   International Paper spokesman Jack Cox said the jobs cuts will be "across
the board," both in the United States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to look at every operation to make sure they are profitable," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also will look at the location of its facilities to determine if
they are close enough to customers, and at production capacity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cattle Prices at 2 1/2-Year High  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil futures staged their first big rally of the year Tuesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange on the strongest sign yet that OPEC will extend
production cutbacks that have tightened world supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, orange juice prices slipped after the government issued a
higher-than-expected estimate of Florida's crop, and cattle prices hit a 2
1/2-year high.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices surged after Iran's deputy oil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, said
leading producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
want to keep the cuts going for at least another quarter beyond their scheduled
March 31 expiration.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran heads OPEC's output monitoring committee, which meets Friday in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments in London helped drive crude for February deliver $1.10 higher
to $25.77 a barrel on the New York Merc, after North Sea Brent had risen 89
cents to $24.62 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London.
</P>
<P>
	   With prices going OPEC's way -- higher -- analysts suspect the cuts may be
extended beyond the second quarter too. Thirty-dollar-a-barrel oil, once
unthinkable, is possible within months if not weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's going to be steady, and higher," said Bill O'Grady, energy
analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's high oil prices still can't be compared to the soaring level of the
late 1970s and '80s, he said. A price of $30 now would be the equivalent of
roughly $22 a decade ago after taking inflation into account.
</P>
<P>
	   Other energy commodities also jumped. February heating oil rose 2.03 cents
to 66.75 cents a gallon, February gasoline rose 1.76 cents to 68.72 cents a
gallon and February natural gas rose 4.4 cents to $2.26 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute released weekly
supply figures that showed a rise in U.S. oil stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   API reported that U.S. crude oil stores rose by 1.711 million barrels to
294.809 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. gasoline inventories rose by 4.082 million barrels to 194.595 million
barrels. Refineries operated at 85.8 percent capacity, down from 89.7 a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of frozen concentrated orange juice rose to a five-month high and
then fell to 82.20 cents a pound, down 1.95 cents for the day, on the New York
Merc.
</P>
<P>
	   The reversal came after the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated the
Florida orange crop, the nation's biggest, at 219 million boxes -- up 5 million
boxes from last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall U.S. orange forecast for 288.7 million boxes is up sharply from
the 226.3 million count of the 1998-99 crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Cattle prices, 14 percent higher than a year ago, jumped to their highest
price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange since August 1997 before giving up most
of the day's gains. The increase may reflect growth in consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle rose 0.10 cent to 70.87 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Judge, Elian's Family Linked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A spokesman for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives worked as a
paid political consultant for the judge who granted temporary custody of boy to
his great-uncle in defiance of an immigration ruling that the boy be returned to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, who has spoken on behalf of the 6-year-old boy's
relatives, said Tuesday he was paid $10,000 by the judge, Rosa Rodriguez, during
her 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled Monday that Elian's Miami relatives had shown that the boy
would face ``imminent and irreparable harm'' if he were returned to Cuba,
including the ``loss of due process rights and harm to his physical and mental
health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, who runs a public relations firm, said he hasn't spoken with the
judge in 18 months and that he has worked as a consultant on numerous campaigns.
He said his work for the judge did not influence her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is absurd that anyone could influence anyone in this case,''
Gutierrez said. ``I'm not a part of this lawsuit. ... I'm not getting paid. I'm
a community activist trying to help out like millions of community activists in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez did not comment but her office said she would issue a statement
later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the judge's campaign also paid his wife, Maritza, for
services provided by her advertising agency, though he did not know how much.
His wife's business has not participated in the effort to keep Elian in the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that he should be
returned to his father in Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge should have disclosed her relationship with Gutierrez
and recused herself from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was an appearance of impropriety and it should have been a basis for
her to recuse herself from the case,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, an attorney representing Elian's relatives, said Gutierrez
has stayed away from court to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have every confidence that she made this decision independently,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, attorneys for Elian's relatives refiled a petition seeking
political asylum for Elian, even as questions remained as to the whether the INS
would consider the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS was reviewing Rodriguez's ruling to see what effect it has on the
agency's decision last week to return Elian to his father, said Russ Bergeron,
an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March
6 so the court can hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle, who is
seeking to become Elian's guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, a member of the legal team, said the attorneys would wait for a
reaction from INS officials to the judge's ruling before taking further action.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian returned to school Tuesday, saying he didn't have time to
do his homework because he had stayed up too late Monday.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Does Well in Nielsens  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The return of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and the
premiere of "Malcolm in the Middle" drew television viewers in droves Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Back for an open-ended run, ABC's game-show sensation shared a No. 4 berth
in the ratings race for the week, according to Nielsen Media Research figures.
</P>
<P>
	   A half-hour earlier, "Malcolm" attracted the largest audience (22.4 million
viewers) of any Fox premiere since "The Simpsons" debuted a decade ago, taking
the No. 14 slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Over on NBC, Sunday's premiere of yet another game show, "Twenty-One," won a
healthy 18th place.
</P>
<P>
	   But the week's other game shows didn't fare so well. Fox's three airings of
"Greed" ranked 41st, 43rd and 49th. And CBS' entry, "Winning Lines," took a
consolation prize in 56th place (though winning its time slot).
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 3-9, ABC won with an average 14.73 million viewers (9.5
rating, 15 share), while NBC averaged 12.94 million viewers (9.0 rating, 14
share) and CBS had 12.59 million viewers (8.7 rating, 14 share). Fox had 11.87
million viewers (7.5 rating, 12 share).
</P>
<P>
	   Among the emerging networks, UPN had 3.68 million viewers (2.5 rating, 4
share), while the WB had 3.16 million viewers (2.3 rating, 4 share). The Pax
network had 1.15 million viewers (0.8 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   In the evening news wars, "NBC Nightly News" was the week's frontrunner with
a total of 12.47 million viewers (9.1 rating, 17 share), while ABC's "World News
Tonight" totaled 11.79 million (8.4 rating, 16 share) and "CBS Evening News" had
10.14 million (7.5 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan 3-9, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings were:
"E.R.," NBC, 19.5; Sugar Bowl: Florida State vs. Virginia Tech, ABC, 17.5; AFC
Wildcard Post-game Show, CBS, 17.0; tied: "Frasier," NBC, and "Who Wants to be a
Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, both 16.4; "Friends," NBC, 14.9; "60 Minutes," CBS,
14.7; Sugar Bowl Pre-game Show, ABC, 12.9; "Stark Raving Mad," NBC, 12.7; "Law &AMP;
Order," NBC, 12.6.

</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch Internet analyst Henry Blodget said AOL's share price may fall
as low as 55 in the wake of the decision to acquire Time Warner Inc. But within
a year, AOL shares should reach 90, Blodget told clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on Coke stock to "strong buy"

<HEADLINE> Government Bonds Fall Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell for a second consecutive
session Tuesday, sending long-term yields surging up to a 28-month high, as a
new round of corporate bond sales cut demand for U.S. Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell 1 3/32 points, or $10.93 3/4 cents per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
6.67 percent from 6.58 percent late Monday. That's the highest closing yield for
long-term Treasurys since the 6.69 percent of Sept. 11, 1997
</P>
<P>
	   Competition from new sales of corporate bonds, which pay higher yields than
the less-risky government bonds, hurt demand for Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors Acceptance Corp. priced a $2.5 billion deal on Tuesday. Ford
Motor Credit Corp. and DaimlerChrysler North American Holdings also plan to
offer billion dollar bond deals this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Other deals upcoming include $8 billion in two-year and 10-year notes from
Fannie Mae and a World Bank offering of $3 billion in five-year notes.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without these distractions, bond traders have been edgy in advance of
next month's meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times last year. There are expectations of
another boost in rates to cool off the economy and keep inflation under control
now that fears of a Year 2000 computer disaster have dissipated. But analysts
are divided on how much higher rates will go.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors will get a better reading on inflation later this week when the
federal government issues reports on wholesale and consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 5/32
point to  1/4 point and intermediate maturities fell 7/16 point to 23/32 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.42 percent as the discount rose
0.03 percentage point from Monday's auction to 5.27 percent. Six-month yields
were 5.63 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point from the weekly
auction to 5.40 percent. One-year yields were 6.09 percent as the discount rose
0.04 percentage point from late Monday to 5.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.25 percent, down from 5.87 1/2 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index

<HEADLINE> Lexus Unveils New Sedan  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Saying it created its newest luxury sedan by researching
drivers' minds, the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Co. on Tuesday unveiled its
2001 LS 430 as the company's key to the global luxury market.
</P>
<P>
	   "This car wasn't designed by engineers for engineers," said Bryan
Bergsteinsson, vice president and general manager of the Lexus Group. "We spent
literally thousands of hours talking with our customers and our dealers to
discover their dream car."
</P>
<P>
	   The result is an update of Lexus' popular LS 400 that features luxury
touches such as a rear-seat beverage cooler, power trunk closer and massagers in
the power-adjustable rear seats.
</P>
<P>
	   Other items include an adaptive cruise control that uses a laser to maintain
distance behind other cars; a sonar system that warns of nearby objects when
parking; and an auto rain sensor that activates the windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
	   The new LS 430's undercarriage is completely flat to lower the car's drag
coefficient to 0.25 -- the lowest of any sedan in the world, Lexus says. A new
4.3-liter V8 with 290 horsepower accelerates the car from 0 to 60 mph in 6.2
seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The new sedan should go on sale in October for slightly more than the LS
400's $54,000 price, Bergsteinsson said. The company's goal is to sell about
25,000 of the new models in the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lexus has been a success for Toyota since it was created in 1990. It sold
185,890 cars and sport utility vehicles last year, giving it second place in
sales by a luxury brand behind the Mercedes-Benz division of DaimlerChrysler AG.
Had Lexus been able to build more of its popular RX300 SUVs, it might have been
first.
</P>
<P>
	   But the luxury sedan market is most crucial, Bergsteinsson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're the only luxury brand with two distinct SUVs, but the sedan business
is always very important for us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Where have all the snow flakes gone - and why?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) - Why is the Northeast having such a wimpy,
hatless, snowless winter?
<P>
	   Meteorologists say it is due to La Nina, the notorious Pacific Ocean
cool-off, combined with a complex weather pattern over the North Atlantic, and
perhaps even global warming, too.
</P>
<P>
	   But they advise against putting your skis in hock just yet, because
conditions may be about to change.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been a tepid winter so far in the Northeast. No measurable snow has
fallen yet on Boston, breaking the previous record for the latest date for the
season's first snow, Dec. 22, set in 1998. Portland, Maine, had a record high
temperature of 50 degrees Monday, and readings hit 60 in much of the Northeast
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Eastern Lake Ontario - usually the snowiest area east of the Rockies, with
an average of 220 inches a year - is virtually snowless so far this year.
</P>
<P>
	   With a paltry 1.6 inches of snow, Albany, N.Y., is experiencing its least
snowy winter in 50 years. Buffalo, famous for its towering drifts, has gotten
just under 14 inches, about 28 inches less than usual for this point in the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Heck, there's even a threesome out there today playing in the rain," Rich
Ajemian said Tuesday at the Liverpool Golf and Public Country Club outside
Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Meteorologists say the La Nina phenomenon, in which cool water sloshes
across the Pacific to replace the warm water that produced El Nino, has
straightened the kinks out of the high-altitude highway of rushing wind known as
the jet stream.
</P>
<P>
	   That straight flow makes fewer of the low-pressure troughs that promote
storms. It also blocks frigid arctic air that otherwise would spill southward.
</P>
<P>
	   On the east side of North America, a complex weather system known as the
North Atlantic Oscillation has produced relatively high atmospheric pressure off
Greenland, which also forces the jet stream into a straighter course and has
effects that extend back into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Global warming could also be contributing to the springlike weather, said
Neal Strauss, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Taunton.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1990s set records for warm winters in some places, possibly with help
from the warming that has been linked to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the country, in fact, this winter has brought "weird, wacky
weather," said Mark Tobin, meteorologist at AccuWeather, based in State College,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the weather had been warmer and drier than usual in the Southeast
The Plains have also been unseasonably warm, with little or no snow. Not even
Colorado has seen a big winter storm.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter typically brings rainy weather to California, but only northern and
central parts of the state have seen any precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Strauss isn't all that fond of the mild weather.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do miss having us get pummeled by some heavy snow and gusty winds," he
said. "It makes it interesting around here."
</P>
<P>
	   It may get interesting again fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow could fall in the Northeast as soon as Thursday, when a couple inches
is likely even in southeastern New England.
</P>
<P>
	   That would be a boon for suffering businesses that sell snow-removal
equipment, winter clothing and other seasonal products.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you get natural snow, people are wanting to get out and enjoy
winter sports," said Chris Field, assistant director of the Wisp ski school in
McHenry, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday and Saturday, temperatures are expected finally to dip down to
zero or below in some inland areas.
</P>
<P>
	   And forecasters say the weeks ahead could bring lots of the kind of snowfall
New England is famous for. The North Atlantic Oscillation is expected to shift
back to a storm phase around mid-January, and February is normally the snowiest
month.

<HEADLINE> Bank One Predicts Profits To Fall  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp., the nation's fourth largest bank, expects
its profits to fall sharply in 2000 due to continuing woes with its credit-card
unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One said Tuesday that earnings for the current year are likely to be
$2.80 to $3 a share, a steep drop from the $3.45 a share it now foresees for
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   It also said it would take a $725 million charge in the fourth quarter as a
result of its woes with its First USA unit, the nation's No. 2 credit-card
issuer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One shares fell as much as 5 percent to $28.62 1/2, an all-time low.
But it recovered in late trading, falling just 25 cents to $30 as of 5:15 p.m.
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Bank One's stock is less than half what it was trading for last
August, just before the credit-card problems emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement underscored that despite the departure of three top
executives, there is no quick fix for the bank, which until last summer was
riding high thanks to fast growth in its First USA credit division.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's going to take more than four quarters to turn this around and
get it growing at the speed of the rest of the company," Katrina Blecher, an
analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co., said of First USA.
</P>
<P>
	   Verne Istock, president and acting chief executive officer since John
McCoy's resignation last month, insisted that "all our businesses, except credit
card, continue to be solidly in line with our stated growth and return goals."
He forecast earnings growth of 10 percent to 12 percent in all those lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Blecher agreed, saying the bank and its stock may have reached bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Excluding the credit card, it's a very nice company," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank One, in a statement issued in Chicago before executives met with
analysts and investors in New York, said it expects earnings to be about $900
million, or 78 cents per share, for the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion, or
$3.45 per share, for the full year. A consensus of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Associates had pegged quarterly earnings most recently at 79 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
	   First USA's problems emerged in August, the result of squeezed profit
margins and issuing too many low-interest cards. The head of First USA, Richard
Vague, resigned in October and vice chairman Richard Lehmann announced his
retirement in fallout from the credit-card troubles. McCoy followed them two
months later.
</P>
<P>
	   Istock remains a strong candidate to succeed McCoy in the permanent chief
executive's job, although Bank One announced separately Tuesday that it has
retained Russell Reynolds Associates to conduct the search for a CEO.

<HEADLINE> Mugger makes high wire escape, disguise - and disappearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A mugger being chased by police ran into an office
building and leaped from a 19th floor window to the building next door, where he
stole a food deliverer's hat and apron and calmly vanished out the front door.
<P>
	   It began when police responded to a call about a street robbery at 59th
Street and Park Avenue around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday, said Deputy Inspector Donald
Feser. They chased the suspect to East 53rd Street, where he ran into the Banco
Santander office building.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a chase that befitted the movies. The elevator doors opened; the
suspect jumped in; the doors closed. He arrived at the 19th floor a step ahead
of police, who had to take another elevator.
</P>
<P>
	   Before they could catch up with him, he had darted through an office and
jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, police said the man fit the description of a suspect wanted
for eight knife-point robberies in midtown Manhattan that have occurred since
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   When their target jumped, police said that witnesses thought he had
plummeted to his death, but instead he landed on a window air conditioner a
floor below at the office building next door, said Inspector Bruce Smolka with
the Manhattan Detective Borough.
</P>
<P>
	   As the man attempted to gain access to the building, a woman inside saw him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said 'I have to get out of here,' and she pointed to a way he could get
access," Smolka said.
</P>
<P>
	   The man was able to get in the rear of the building. Inside, he encountered
a delivery man from the Checkerboard Gourmet deli. The thief took the delivery
man's hat and apron and put them on in the elevator; he emerged in the lobby
disguised as the delivery man, raising little suspicion as he sauntered out of
the building.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think anything of it. He just looked like your ordinary delivery
guy," said a security guard at the second building, who declined to give his
name. "We thought all the action was next door."
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, the scene at Checkerboard was business as usual as the workers
there coped with the lunch rush.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy grabbed my delivery man's hat and apron. He scared the hell out of
him," said Checkerboard manager Seth Novak. The delivery man, who only would
give his name as Salvador, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Smolka said the suspect is believed to have committed one robbery on
Saturday, four on Monday and three Tuesday morning in the span of 30 minutes. A
total of $500 was taken from victims, he added.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Trumps Telenor Bid  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC agreed Tuesday to pay $2.4
billion for Ireland's Esat Telecom Group PLC, in a friendly deal that topped a
hostile bid by Norwegian rival Telenor ASA.
</P>
<P>
	   Esat, Ireland's second-largest phone company, accepted BT's all-stock offer
within 15 minutes of its being announced.
</P>
<P>
	   BT, which has the biggest fixed-line network in Britain, said its offer
represents a premium of 17.6 percent over Telenor's bid of $85 for each Esat
American depository share.
</P>
<P>
	   Through a subsidiary, BT Hawthorn Ltd., BT offered to pay $100 for each Esat
American depository share and $50 for each regular Esat share.
</P>
<P>
	   Each Esat foreign share is worth two regular shares.
</P>
<P>
	   Telenor increased its original offer on Dec. 23 to the equivalent of $42.50
for each regular Esat share. The Norwegian company will not increase its offer
or extend it beyond Friday, said Dag Melgaard, a Telenor spokesman speaking from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
	   Esat is Ireland's No. 2 operator of fixed-line and mobile phones, after
market leader Eircom, the former state-owned phone monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   Ireland is one of Europe's fastest-growing phone markets, and BT said the
country's geographical proximity to Britain enhanced the deal's appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition was a logical move for BT, which is eager to expand its
presence in Europe's wireless business market, said Ian Johnston, head of
telecommunications research at U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   Although BT is paying a "significant" premium over Telenor's offer, the
British company can claim a share of the high volume of phone traffic between
the United States and Ireland, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Telenor owns 49.5 percent of Esat Telecom's mobile operator, Esat Digifone.
BT said that it was prepared to continue working with Telenor in this GSM mobile
phone business.
</P>
<P>
	   Esat chairman and chief executive Denis O'Brien will keep his job at the
company, BT said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Esat shares rose $3.12 1/2 to $97 in trading at 4 p.m. on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   BT's share price slipped 34 pence, or 3 percent, to $18.86 (1,179 pence) in
London.

<HEADLINE> SEC Settles Case Against Informix  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators, who have been pushing for more
accurate financial reporting by big companies, on Tuesday accused database
software maker Informix Corp. of fraudulently inflating its revenues by $295
million and its earnings by $244 million over several years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Informix agreed
to refrain from future violations and to cooperate with the SEC's continuing
investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., neither admitted to nor denied the
SEC's allegations in its administrative order that the company, through former
managers and other ex-employees, violated the securities laws and financial
bookkeeping and reporting rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company is gratified to have resolved the investigation," Informix
chairman Robert J. Finocchio, Jr. said in a statement. "The company has closed
the book on the past and now can concentrate on the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC said Tuesday that Informix filed "materially false and misleading"
periodic corporate reports with the agency from 1994 through the first quarter
of 1997, that its books and records were falsified during that time, and that it
failed to use an adequate system of internal controls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though many of the company's violations originated overseas, we have
the ability to investigate such misconduct," Thomas Newkirk, an associate
director of enforcement at the SEC, said in a telephone interview. "Our
investigation as to the possible misconduct of individuals continues."
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move last May, Informix and its former auditors, Ernst &AMP; Young
LLP, agreed to pay $142 million -- more than twice what the company earned in
1998 -- to settle a lawsuit by shareholders alleging that the company misstated
revenues and traded on inside information. There also was no admission or denial
of wrongdoing in the private settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, approved by a court last month, called for Informix to pay
about $3.2 million in cash, $13.8 million in insurance payments on behalf of
several current and former officers, and 9 million shares of company stock worth
about $91 million. Ernst &AMP; Young is paying $34 million. The money is going to
compensate people who held company stock from early 1995 to late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Informix has operations in several countries. The SEC said its apparent
growth in revenue and earnings "largely was the result of the use of a multitude
of fraudulent and other improper practices."
</P>
<P>
	   The practices included backdating sales agreements, and recording revenue
from disputed claims against customers and from transactions with customers that
were not creditworthy, the SEC said in its order.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has been pushing publicly traded companies to improve their
financial reporting and avoid manipulating their earnings to meet Wall Street
analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC in September accused 68 people and companies -- including Hall of
Fame quarterback and Atlanta businessman Fran Tarkenton -- of accounting fraud
in the first nationwide "sweep" against inflating earnings and other alleged
reporting misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   And last June, chemicals maker W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. agreed to set up a $1
million educational fund as part of a settlement of the SEC's allegations that
it fraudulently manipulated earnings of a former subsidiary. The regulators also
signed a related settlement with two partners of W.R. Grace's auditing firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
</P>
<P>
	   W.R. Grace and the two partners neither admitted to nor denied the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Plans Slow Burn Paper  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette company,
plans consumer tests of a slower-burning paper that may reduce the risk that a
dropped or discarded cigarette will start a fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand announced Tuesday that it
expects to start the tests of the paper with its Merit cigarettes within six
months. It has yet to select the test markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our goal is to manufacture and market cigarettes that are less likely to
cause fires when carelessly handled and that are acceptable to consumers," John
Nelson, senior vice president of operations for Philip Morris USA, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials say cigarettes account for more fatal home fires than any
other single consumer product.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement was welcomed as long-overdue by safety groups. Critics said
experts concluded years ago that it was technically feasible to make such
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is tragic that it has taken so long," said Andrew McGuire, executive
director of the Trauma Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that has pushed
for development of cigarettes less likely to start fires.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philip Morris officials said it has been hard to find a solution that
can work on the fast-moving machinery used in making billions of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   About 900 people, including 140 children, were killed in home fires in 1997,
the most recent year for which the Consumer Product Safety Commission had
figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris has come up with a system in which two slim bands of paper are
attached to the inner surface of the regular paper that wraps a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Carnovale, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, said the bands slow the
rate at which the cigarette burns when the lit portion passes over the bands.
Under test conditions, she said that has made it less likely that the cigarette
would ignite certain types fabrics, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said smokers usually can't see the bands and find no difference in the
taste or effort required to inhale. She said the bands and slower burn rate
don't add to the health risks of smoking for smokers or those near them.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the bands may cause cigarettes to go out if left unattended in
an ashtray, and the consumer tests are needed to determine whether smokers
object to that.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, she said Philip Morris wants to know whether making a cigarette
that is less likely to set the couch on fire makes smokers more careless about
they handle their cigarettes. "It can't change behavior. It is still a lit
cigarette and people should not smoke in bed," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said consumer tests typically take six months to a year, and said the
test will not likely be expanded to the company's other brands before then.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Brown, chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said Philip
Morris briefed her staff about the new technology last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "They spoke to us generally about it, but they didn't share technical date
and we don't know if the cigarette will really work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency cooperated with a study that concluded in 1984 that it was
technically feasible and commercially viable to make cigarettes that were less
likely to start fires, said agency spokesman Russ Rader.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris' two main rivals will be watching the test closely.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nations' second-biggest, has been unable to
come up with a cigarette that is both less likely to start a fire and is
acceptable to consumers, spokesman Seth Moskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which ranks third, is working on it as
well, said spokesman Steve Kottak. "It is very difficult to make a smokable
fire-safe cigarette," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco critic Kathryn Kahler Vose, a spokeswomen for the Campaign for
Tobacco Free Kids, questioned the timing of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome a cigarette that will reduce deaths from cigarettes, but the
timing is curious," she said, noting that Philip Morris's parent is in the midst
of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to improve its image.

<HEADLINE> Acura Unveils New SUV Prototype  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM SUHR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Imagine tapping into the Internet for fishing reports from
the thickest woods in your Acura or merrily bowling over teeth-jarring terrain
-- in a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
	   Wonder no more, say the two foreign luxury carmakers who announced Tuesday
they're racing into the red-hot sport utility vehicle segment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no secret we're showing up for the SUV party a little late, so we're
making sure we're showing up prepared," Dick Colliver, American Honda's
executive vice president of sales, said in unveiling Acura's prototype of a
production-bound SUV during the North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura -- Honda Motor Co.'s luxury division -- said the MD-X that could
arrive in showrooms this August should compete head-to-head in the mid-sized,
luxury SUV segment with the Lexus RX 300 and Mercedes Benz's M-Class.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truck market now is 50 percent of the market, and we don't have a
vehicle in there," Colliver said. "You've got to understand consumers and what
they want, then develop vehicles for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Acura's V6-powered SUV will sport four-wheel-drive, a Global Positioning
System -- a navigation system using a series of satellites to pinpoint exact
locations on Earth -- and integrated cellular Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   The SUV's production version will debut in April at the New York Auto Show,
said Colliver, who expects about 30,000 to sold in the first year. No price has
yet been announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to be outdone, independent performance-car maker Porsche AG announced a
2002 launch of its SUV that will be slightly wider and lower than the
DaimlerChrysler AG's Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be the heart and soul of Porsche," said Frederick Schwab, chief of
the German company's North American operations. "We're gonna be coming a bit
late, but most niche markets don't enter at the beginning."
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation, he said, Porsche's dealers -- 194 of them in the United
States -- plan to spend $250 million renovating and enlarging dealerships to
make room for the SUV.
</P>
<P>
	   Suzuki also unveiled the XL6, a concept sport utility vehicle that is 17.3
inches longer than its Grand Vitara compact SUV. A version of the six-passenger,
four-wheel-drive XL6 will go into production this fall for the North American
market, the Japanese automaker said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other unveilings Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mitsubishi Motor Corp. introduced the convertible Spyder version of its
Eclipse sports car, featuring an optional 200-horsepower engine, priced starting
at $23,400; a redesigned Montero sport utility; and the SSS concept vehicle, a
passenger car with sufficient storage space for the Japanese automaker to dub it
an "enhanced utility sedan."
</P>
<P>
	   --Audi introduced a long-wheelbase version of its luxury flagship A8 sedan.
The 2000 A8L will be in U.S. showrooms this spring and retail for $67,900, said
Len Hunt, the company's vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   --Jaguar pulled the wraps off a concept roadster that would be the
most-compact offering by the British luxury carmaker in more than four decades.
No price or production time frame have been set.
</P>
<P>
	   --Nissan unveiled its 2000 Sentra, which should be available this spring.
The car is 6.5 inches longer and about an inch wider and taller than its
predecessor but will be priced lower, said Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan
Design International. The new model uses a more chiseled appearance and a
redesigned interior to try to step away from Sentra's stereotype as an
entry-level sedan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Subaru showed off its 2001 Forester, what it calls a "best of both worlds"
SUV that offers all-wheel-drive ruggedness with the comfort and handling of a
passenger car. The new model, set to appear in March, introduces intermittent
wipers, a digital temperature gauge and three-point seat belts for every
passenger. A power moon roof and side air bags will be available as options.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co. Accused Over Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-tobacco advocates on Tuesday accused Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. of violating an agreement to stop advertising to
children even as the company announced a series of public forums to promote
"open dialogue" about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, advocates complained the company has placed ads in
magazines like Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone, Spin, Vibe and Sport -- all of
which have a significant readership within the age range of 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Data from Simmons Market Research Bureau show youth readership levels of
22.5 percent for Sports Illustrated, 28 percent for Rolling Stone, 32 percent
for Spin, 42 percent for Vibe and 33 percent for Sport, according to the
advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups, which include the American Cancer Society and American Heart
Association, also detailed their concerns in a paid advertisement in The
Washington Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Brown &AMP; Williamson is serious about acting responsibly, it needs to move
forward with these concrete actions to reduce youth smoking," the groups wrote.
"If you fail to act, your statements of concern about youth smoking can only be
seen as a hollow public relations gesture rather than meaningful corporate
change."
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the
groups have similar concerns about other tobacco companies but chose Brown &AMP;
Williamson to highlight the issues because the company's chief executive
officer, Nick Brookes, was speaking before the National Press Club Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Brookes, in his remarks, defended the company, saying the forums were not a
"gimmick"and were intended to address critics.
</P>
<P>
	   The first forum is scheduled for this spring and will deal with producing a
safer cigarette, he said. A second forum will target youth smoking and the third
will discuss the growing risk of black market cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are genuinely intended for us to have constructive engagement with our
critics," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brookes said the company has a policy not to advertise with a magazine with
more than 15 percent youth readership. All of the magazines have certified to
the company they fall within the guidelines, he said. He said ads were being
halted in Sport magazine, which recently notified the company that its youth
numbers had increased.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do treat this as a very serious policy," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks U.N. Censure of China  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration undertook a campaign Tuesday
to censure China in the U.N. Human Rights Commission for what officials
described as a steadily deteriorating Chinese human rights record.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in addition to intensifying a
crackdown on political dissent in China, Beijing is vigorously suppressing the
Buddhist Falun Gong meditation movement and tightening controls on the media and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, China strengthened controls on unregistered churches and on the
political and religious expression of ethnic minorities, especially Tibetans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These actions taken as a whole are contrary to the direction that China
has been urged to take by the world,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are specifically contrary to internationally recognized human rights
standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
which China has signed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Rubin's comments, Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning said his
government ``firmly opposes the U.S. practice of interfering in China's internal
affairs under the pretext of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin's announcement came a day after President Clinton urged Congress to
vote ``at the earliest possible time'' to approve a trade deal negotiated with
China in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Rubin's announcement appeared aimed at showing Congress the
administration is prepared to get tough on China's rights record even as it
pushes for closer trade ties. At issue before Congress this year is a trade
agreement that will allow China to join the World Trade Organization, which sets
rules for international commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign for congressional approval faces stiff resistance from
organized labor, environmental groups and their Democratic allies, who believe
low wages and lax pollution standards in China will undercut American workers.
Religious groups also are expected to raise objections about China's human
rights problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The advocacy group Human Rights Watch praised the U.S. initiative, urged the
president and vice president to involve themselves personally in it and asked
the European Union to join the Americans in sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``China must be held to the same basic human rights standards as any other
government,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights
Watch's Asia division. ``While China has been negotiating WTO agreements, it has
simultaneously cracked down on dissidents, unofficial religious groups, labor
organizers and others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said China was informed at a high level Tuesday of U.S. intentions in
the U.N. Human Rights Commission, which meets in March. He described the
Geneva-based group as the world's ``pre-eminent body'' on rights issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has instructed ambassadors around the
world to push for support for the prospective resolution denouncing China, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The goal here, through this international action, is to shine an
international spotlight directly on China's human rights practices,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu, the Chinese Embassy spokesman, predicted failure for the U.S. plan.
``They have already tried eight times before in Geneva, and they failed eight
times,'' Yu said. ``If they try this year, they will fail again.''
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. initiative in 1999 failed because American officials were unable to
muster majority support to include the question on the commission's agenda. Many
European allies opposed the initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration did not submit a China resolution 1998 because it
perceived that the rights situation had been improving.
</P>
<P>
	   Of particular concern to the administration in recent months has been the
crackdown on the Falun Gong. Since its founding in 1992, millions have joined
the spiritual movement. China has branded it as an ``evil cult'' and recently
sentenced four top leaders to prison terms of up to 18 years. The sentences
exceeded those given in recent years to political dissidents.

<HEADLINE> Society Jeweler Goes on Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A jeweler to Palm Beach's rich and famous went on trial
Tuesday on charges he defrauded customers of at least $80 million by passing off
stones that were fake, flawed, filled, painted or even irradiated to bring out
their color.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Jack Hasson, 47, sold, cleaned, cut, appraised and consigned
diamonds and other jewelry. All along, prosecutors said, he gave his customers
cheap imitations.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the customers who claim they were defrauded are golfers Jack Nicklaus
and Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Hasson could get up to 65 years in prison and $162 million in
fines. Longtime employee and co-defendant Clifford Sloan could face up to 30
years and $160 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasson's lawyer said in opening statements that the entire case was
essentially the result of one millionaire's ``buyer's remorse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Norman testified to start the trial that he paid Hasson $48,875 to make a
diamond pin shaped like his shark trademark. Norman said he gave the pin to his
wife, Laura, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he discovered that the blue, orange, green, black and pink diamonds
used in the pin had been treated with radiation to bring out their color.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a huge change in the emotional feeling of my wife,'' Norman
said. ``She didn't want to continue to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hasson is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, witness
tampering and fraud. Sloan is charged with money laundering and witness
tampering conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasson ``was as clever as any Hollywood producer who produces movies with
clever plots,'' federal prosecutor Steve Hopkins said in opening statements.
Prosecutors allege Hasson lied about doing business with Elizabeth Taylor, Bill
Gates, Steven Spielberg and the Sultan of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
	   To impress millionaire customer Aben Johnson with his supposed connections
to the sultan, one of the world's richest men, Hasson had his store manager's
brother pose as a sheik, hired women to pose as a harem and arranged for men to
play their bodyguards, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   When sued by fleeced customers, Hasson countersued for slander and often
settled for less than the customers' losses on condition of confidentiality,
which meant complaints about him never spread, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, the former owner of WXON-TV in Detroit, said he bought jewel after
jewel on Hasson's word that they were ``notable diamonds of the world'' --
including actress Loni Anderson's engagement ring, jewels from the Getty estate
and the collection of actress Carole Lombard.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said a 24-karat cubic zirconium that cost $141 was dubbed
Lombard's ``Howeson Blue'' and bought by Johnson for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson claims $60 million in losses on $82 million in purchases and is
suing Hasson.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Steve Tucker said in opening statements that the entire
criminal case grew out of Johnson's ``buyer's remorse.'' Johnson knew what he
was doing when he bought the gems as investments and intended to resell them for
billions of dollars, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
	   Norman, a two-time British Open champion, testified that he began doing
business with Hasson in 1989 after they met as sport fishermen and got into a
friendly competition on their daily catches. Norman said he bought about
$500,000 in jewelry and gifts from Hasson.
</P>
<P>
	   The golfer said he returned six pieces of jewelry to Hasson for what he paid
-- $385,375 -- after he had them appraised by Harry Winston's jewelers of New
York in 1997. Harry Winston's determined that the diamonds in Norman's pin had
been treated with radiation and that Hasson had inflated the weight and value of
other pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Norman said, he has bought $500,000 to $850,000 worth of jewelry
-- from Harry Winston's.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- David Ronald Musgrove on Tuesday became Mississippi's
62nd governor following last week's historic vote in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove, a 43-year-old Democrat, replaces controversial two-term Republican
Gov. Kirk Fordice.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove pledged to make education and economic development the cornerstones
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I challenge you to think bigger than ever before,'' Musgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,000 people packed the Capitol lawn in downtown Jackson as he was
sworn in.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove had 8,300 more votes than Republican Mike Parker in the Nov. 2
election, but didn't get the required majority. The House decided the contest
last week. Never before had a governor's election been so close it went to the
House.
</P>
<P>
	   Fordice, the only Republican governor to serve Mississippi in the last
century, could not have sought a third term. Fordice is getting a divorce after
44 years of marriage and has had a very public affair with his childhood
sweetheart.

<HEADLINE> U.S. approves dumping of more dredged material off Sandy Hook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A New York heating-oil company won permission Tuesday
to dump up to 105,000 cubic yards of muck - enough to fill 35 Olympic-size
swimming pools - six miles off New Jersey in a decision that may launch
litigation and legislation.
<P>
	   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit that will allow Castle
Astoria Terminals of Queens, N.Y., to dredge its channel and dump the material
at the so-called Mud Dump. Environmentalists and some lawmakers say the material
is contaminated and that its dumping will violate a 1996 agreement to close the
dump site on the ocean floor six miles off Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
	   The window for dumping ends Jan. 15 to make way for fishing season, so the
project is unlikely to begin before October. Opponents say that gives them nine
months in which to challenge the project in the courts and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   A host of state and federal agencies signed off on the project, among them
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the
U.S. Coast Guard and the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, after reviewing
EPA tests of the Castle Astoria material, agreed the dumping does not violate
the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army Corps and EPA say tests show the Castle Astoria material is not
harmful to fish or humans. The Army Corps attached 22 conditions to the Castle
Astoria permit, including one that requires inspectors to ride along to make
sure dumping does not interfere with sea turtles and whales.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers and an environmental group protested nonetheless. Rep.
Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, and Sandy Hook-based Clean Ocean Action said they
will file a federal lawsuit in hopes of blocking the permit.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly, said the Army Corps and the EPA "have
opened the door to dumping oil and chemical-contaminated dredge spoils from New
York into the ocean off the Jersey Shore."
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the anger was focused on New York, which has been less active than
New Jersey in developing alternative disposal methods for material dredged from
ports.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York has an ignominious past of dumping on New Jersey, but it won't be
tolerated anymore," said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. "They can do their
dredging, but they can't cross into Jersey waters to dump the waste."
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, Saxton and Rep. Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville, all said they would
try to enact legislation by October to block the Castle Astoria dumping.
</P>
<P>
	   Other lawmakers came down in favor of the project. Rep. Robert Menendez,
D-Union City, applauded the decision as a "necessary step to keep the Port of
New York and New Jersey open."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, New York Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer wrote
the Army Corps to urge approval of the Castle Astoria application after more
than two years of consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Port of New York and New Jersey is a vital economic engine for the two
states, the region, and, indeed, the entire nation," the New York Democrats
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, after years of squabbling over a planned dredging of the ports of
New York and New Jersey, the White House, environmentalists, lawmakers, labor
leaders and port officials reached an agreement on the future of what is known
informally as the Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration proposed closing the dump one year later, after
one final use of the site to dispose of silt from a dredging of the ports.
</P>
<P>
	   Officially, the dump is now closed. Only clean material, as defined by the
government, can be dumped at the site, as a means to bury the material already
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Castle Astoria dispute marks the second time in recent months in which
the government's definition of "clean" has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers sparred with the Army Corps last month over shipments
of muck dredged from the Brooklyn Marine Terminal. The EPA approved the project;
the lawmakers, along with Clean Ocean Action, objected.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, critics Pallone, Torricelli and Clean Ocean Action said the
material dredged from Castle Astoria's terminal is more contaminated than
material already at the Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision flies in the face of vast public opinion and against the
commitments made by Vice President Al Gore and the administration to clean up
the ocean off our shore," said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean
Action.
</P>
<P>
	   But Peter Shugert, spokesman for the Army Corps in New York, said mud from
Castle Astoria is "cleaner than the material that's out there."

<HEADLINE> Bush Camp Tunes Into Rival's Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Sen. John McCain gave his speech on taxes Tuesday,
the Bush campaign was tuned in.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't broadcast over TV, but aides in the Austin, Texas, office of
George W. Bush used a satellite dish to capture the feed being beamed from
Concord, N.H., where Bush's closest rival for the GOP presidential nomination
was laying out his plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's obviously an open public event,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for
Bush, the Texas governor. ``If reporters are there, we enjoy being there too.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign was thrilled to have them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's kind of flattering,'' said McCain spokesman Dan Schnur. ``I wonder
if they pull down Orrin Hatch's speeches.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show that Sen. Hatch, also seeking the nomination, is mired in single
digits.
</P>
<P>
	   Schnur went on to quote Satchel Paige, a star pitcher for the Negro League:
``Don't look over your shoulder -- something might be gaining on you.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador To Adopt Dollar As Currency  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's embattled president on Tuesday defended his
plan to replace the country's currency with the U.S. dollar, as large Indian and
labor groups renewed demands for Jamil Mahuad's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian organizations, which have protested frequently in the past, said
they planned demonstrations Saturday to force Mahuad's ouster and to shut down
Congress and the courts as part of their drive for a government that will work
on behalf of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A government of national salvation is necessary,'' said Antonio Vargas,
president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, the
nation's largest Indian federation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Popular Front, a grouping of leftist-led unions, student organizations
and grassroots neighborhood associations, said Tuesday it would resume street
protests.
</P>
<P>
	   The president defended his currency plan as the only solution to end
Ecuador's economic chaos and said all necessary force would be used to maintain
order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have the right to ask, to aspire and to put forth ideas,'' Mahuad
said during a public ceremony. ``But there is no right to break the rule of law
and the constitution, and much worse, to endanger the economic and social
stability of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some political analysts believe Mahuad's position remains tenuous and could
deteriorate rapidly if his plan runs into roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a desperate step,'' said political scientist Simon Pachano. ``It's
more a political measure than an economic measure. Last week Mahuad was at the
point of falling and made this decision as the only way to save his
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated political centrist who took office in August
1998, has faced growing calls to resign after failing to stop the rapid decline
of Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60 percent, the
highest in Latin America. Many economists predicted that speculation against the
sucre currency would quickly send Ecuador into hyperinflation this year if the
government did not act.
</P>
<P>
	   Scrapping the national currency means Ecuador can no longer print extra
money to meet its budget, thus eliminating a major cause of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Jose Gallardo, a retired army general, headed a delegation
of the military high command in a visit to the national palace to express
support for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The armed forces have come to reiterate their loyalty and collaboration so
that the year 2000 will be filled with accomplishments on behalf of the
Ecuadorean people,'' Gallardo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Past protests by Ecuador's 3.5 million Indians, including blocking the
country's major highways, have rarely led to changes in government policy.
</P>
<P>
	   And turnout for last week's protests in Ecuador's main cities by leftist-led
organizations amounted to only a few thousand demonstrators who were easily
dispersed by police. Soldiers empowered by a state of emergency to arrest and
contain protesters were largely uninvolved in controlling the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   The indigenous and labor groups say they will face further impoverishment
under Mahuad's plan to buy back the sucre over the next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad received good news Tuesday when his strongest opposition in Congress,
the pro-business Social Christian party, backed the plan. But party leaders
criticized the planned exchange rate of 25,000 sucres to the dollar, saying it
would impoverish thousands of people with savings in sucres.
</P>
<P>
	   The value of the sucre recently plunged 20 percent in less than a week to
29,000 to the dollar. A year ago, 7,000 sucres equaled $1.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Heed Tax Cut Call  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy booming and government surpluses
soaring, Republican voters are demanding that Washington loosen its grip on its
extra cash and slash taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP presidential candidates are scrambling to heed the call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You leave this money in Washington, I guarantee you those guys'll spend
it,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in Monday night's presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
	   An echo was heard Tuesday from front-runner George W. Bush, who told voters
in Florence, S.C: ``Instead of leaving the money in Washington, where I believe
it will be spent on bigger government, I intend to pass it to the taxpayers of
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican voters always hunger for tax cuts, but the strong economy may
have increased their appetites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a whole new world since 1996,'' said Republican pollster Whit Ayres,
who is not tied to any of the campaigns. ``What has changed is going from
deficit politics to surplus politics -- and that has increased the argument for
some sort of tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   While working for Lamar Alexander's failed 1996 campaign, Ayres asked likely
Iowa caucus-goers to identify the ``single most important problem'' facing the
country. The federal deficit ranked first, picked by 17 percent of the voters,
with morality and crime a close second.
</P>
<P>
	   All other issues, including taxes, were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, Ayres polled 300 likely Iowa caucus-goers and asked them to
identify the ``single most important political issues.'' Topping the list at 22
percent was tax cuts, followed closely by morality.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, 1996 exit polls showed that tax cuts were less important
to voters than the economy and jobs. This year, tax cuts easily top the economy
as a concern, campaign pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   National surveys of Republicans suggest that the nation's morals are a
greater concern than tax rates, though tax cuts are consistently ranked high.
</P>
<P>
	   All avowed tax-cutters, the presidential candidates are squabbling over how
to split up the spoils of a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The field's top three prospects -- Texas Gov. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain
and publisher Steve Forbes -- are battling over how much of the surplus should
be spent on tax reductions and who can be trusted to keep the tax-cutting
pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, five-year tax package that would spend a
large chunk of projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose package is half the size of Bush's, sets aside 23 percent of
future surpluses for tax cuts and dedicates the rest to paying down the national
debt and bolstering Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent GOP pollster recently gave voters in early primary states a
choice between a generic candidate who supports tax cuts and a candidate who
``supports protecting and preserving Social Security.'' Nearly half took the
Social Security candidiate, and less than 40 percent sided with the tax cutter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a recession, Republicans want a quick influx of cash. That's why
(Presidents) Reagan and Kennedy both correctly cut across-the-board rates during
economic downturns,'' said McCain adviser Dan Schnur. ``That's why John McCain
has devised a plan that includes a significant tax cut and saves Social
Security. It addresses both the short- and long-terms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Each campaign argue that it is driving the tax debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes pollster John McLaughlin said Bush proposed a large tax cut only
after he saw that Forbes was capable of ``getting traction in Iowa. All of a
sudden, he's a born-again tax cutter.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Texan introduced his plan, rival campaigns noticed that his poll
numbers climbed, particularly among economic conservatives who normally tilt to
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing his base would be seduced by Bush's plan, Forbes decided to air ads
accusing the governor of breaking a no-new-tax pledge in Texas. Bush is now
polling to see whether he needs to air a response ad.
</P>
<P>
	   To Republican voters, the issue is simple: Washington can't be trusted with
the economic windfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts are ``a very important issue to me,'' said Gerald Scott, a retiree
from St. Albans, Vt. ``I have children growing up and a lot of grandchildren;
I'd like to see them make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mildred Hendricks, 64, of Greensboro, N.C., said would like to cheaper
health care insurance and lower taxes -- two reasonable requests, she said, with
``as much extra money as they've got up there in Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Judge, Elian's Family Linked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A spokesman for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives earned
$10,000 as a political consultant for the judge who awarded temporary custody of
the boy to a great-uncle here in defiance of a federal order that he be returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said Tuesday she was not
required to remove herself from the case, a suggestion made a legal expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, who has spoken on behalf of the 6-year-old boy's
relatives, said he worked for Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled Monday that Elian's Miami relatives had shown that the boy
would face ``imminent and irreparable harm'' if he were returned to Cuba,
including the ``loss of due process rights and harm to his physical and mental
health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, who runs a public relations firm, said he hasn't spoken with the
judge in 18 months and that his work for her did not influence her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is absurd that anyone could influence anyone in this case,''
Gutierrez said. ``I'm not a part of this lawsuit. ... I'm not getting paid. I'm
a community activist trying to help out like millions of community activists in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Rodriguez said: ``According to the canons of judicial ethics
... a judge has no ethical obligation to disclose participation by attorneys or
participants in a past judicial election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A judge is not required to disqualify herself due to an attorney's
participation in a judicial campaign when the campaign takes place during the
previous year and is not ongoing,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the judge's campaign also paid his wife, Maritza, for
services provided by her advertising agency, though he did not know how much.
His wife's business has not participated in the effort to keep Elian in the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service has ruled that he should be returned to his father in Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge should have disclosed her relationship with Gutierrez
and recused herself from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was an appearance of impropriety and it should have been a basis for
her to recuse herself from the case,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, an attorney representing Elian's relatives, said Gutierrez
has stayed away from court to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have every confidence that she made this decision independently,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, attorneys for Elian's relatives refiled a petition seeking
political asylum for Elian, even as questions remained as to the whether the INS
would consider the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS was reviewing Rodriguez's ruling to see what effect it has on the
agency's decision last week to return Elian to his father, said Russ Bergeron,
an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March
6 so the court can hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle, who is
seeking to become Elian's guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, a member of the legal team, said the attorneys would wait for a
reaction from INS officials to the judge's ruling before taking further action.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Decatur Expulsions  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the Decatur school
board was within its rights to oust six black students from school for fighting
at a football game.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling was a blow to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his crusade against
``zero tolerance'' anti-violence policies in schools.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Michael McCuskey dismissed the students' claims that the
Decatur school board treated them unjustly because they are black and violated
their right to a fair hearing. McCuskey issued his ruling from Urbana, where he
heard three days of testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, whose Rainbow/PUSH Coalition filed the lawsuit on the students'
behalf, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court offered no relief for these youth and showed no mercy for
getting them back in school,'' Jackson said during a news conference with the
students and their parents at his group's Chicago headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also said he planned two rallies in Decatur -- one Saturday night,
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and another Jan. 24 in protest of the
decision. He also said he had scheduled a conference Jan. 25 in Springfield on
``zero tolerance'' policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the students were expelled following the Sept. 17 fist fight in the
stands at a football game, and one withdrew rather than face expulsion.
</P>
<P>
	   The teens initially were expelled for a maximum of two years. After
intervention by Jackson and Gov. George Ryan, the school board reduced the
expulsions to one year and agreed to allow all six teens to attend alternative
schools that are not a part of the district.
</P>
<P>
	   McCuskey struck down the students' case point by point, noting their actions
threatened the safety of the community. The fight cleared the visitors'
bleachers at the game but caused no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In short, this court is not impressed with the students' position that
because no knives or guns were used in the melee that it was not a significant
fight,'' McCuskey wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   School board officials said they were relieved at the decision and hoped it
could put to rest the racial tension that has built in the blue-collar central
Illinois town.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a tremendous amount of healing that has to take place in the
community. This has been very divisive,'' said Decatur Superintendent Kenneth
Arndt.
</P>
<P>
	   During protests in Decatur late last year, Jackson claimed the expulsions
were not a racial issue. But in the lawsuit, the students argued the school
district disproportionately expelled black students and disciplined them more
harshly than white students.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Kelty, an attorney for the school board, said the decision sends the
correct message about who determines school policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These rules are set at the local level, and it's not the job of the
federal court -- or any other court -- to interfere with these rules,'' Kelty
said.

<HEADLINE> Critics Fear Dilution of News  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The nation may get its news from more places than ever these
days. But the blockbuster merger of Time Warner and America Online, as well as
big media combinations expected in the future, are raising concerns about
homogenized and diluted news.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this merger invites is the possibility of a new era in American
communications that sees the end of an independent press," said Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is as alarmed. Richard Epstein, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, said the Internet still offers a worldwide venue for
dissenting voices. He added the industry is still diverse enough to keep itself
in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are just two newspapers in town, one will happily dump on the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $162 billion stock deal announced Monday allies AOL's 22 million online
subscribers with a news and entertainment conglomerate that includes CNN, Time
magazine, TBS, TNT, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   Media mergers are nothing new, beginning in earnest in the mid-1980s with
the takeovers of TV networks, including ABC and NBC, Dean Alger, author of the
1998 book "Megamedia," said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend accelerated in 1996 after Congress passed the Telecommunications
Act in an attempt to spur competition. Instead of making it easier for companies
to compete, the opposite has occurred, Alger said -- the big mergers that grew
out of the law means today's media are run increasingly by a dwindling number of
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   In his book -- subtitled "How Giant Corporations Dominate Mass Media,
Distort Competition, and Endanger Democracy -- Alger lists what he calls the
"dominant dozen" media conglomerates. Now updating the book for paperback
editions, Alger has just slashed the dozen to four: AOL/Time Warner; Disney/ABC;
Viacom/CBS and News Corp., the parent company of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concentration is getting more severe and the range of the diversity of
voices is clearly being constricted," Alger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect this trend to continue as other Internet companies look for
combinations with TV, film and news outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   With the AOL-Time Warner deal, the Internet, once considered the voice of
the little guy, has suddenly become a powerhouse player.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rise of the Internet was supposed to be the rise of the independent
voice," said Matthew Felling, media director of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs. "With the auditorium being filled with large bands, the guy playing his
clarinet is really going to get outshouted and is going to get completely
crowded out of the concert."
</P>
<P>
	   AOL might not write the news. But it channels news to its users. The
Internet portal may be more likely now to send the point-and-clickers toward CNN
and Time instead of MSBNC and Newsweek, media watchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts believe the quality of the news suffers when media worlds
collide.
</P>
<P>
	   "You need to have an independent voice that can keep an eye on powerful
interests," Rosentiel said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, ABC News killed a proposed "20/20" story about alleged security
problems at Disney World in Florida. Officials said the network's corporate
parent, Walt Disney Co., had no say in the decision, but others were critical.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Boost Fund Raising  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New campaign fund-raising figures added up to good news
for House Democrats but bad news for the party's presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reported Tuesday that it had
almost $20 million in the bank at the end of 1999 -- 10 times as much as two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Democratic National Committee reported having only $2.5 million on
hand -- well below the $4.5 million it had in the bank at the end of 1997. And
the Republican National Committee reported it had $10 million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures include both hard money -- funds raised under federal limits
that can be used to directly aid candidates -- and soft money -- unregulated
contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals that is spent on
issue advertisements designed to build support for the party or a particular
nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democrats need just five seats to regain control of the chamber they
lost in 1995. The DCCC raised $33.4 million in 1999 compared with $14.6 million
during 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The environment's just great for us,'' DCCC spokesman Erik Smith said.
``The House committee used to be the last stop on the fund-raising train. Now,
it's the first stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Republican Congressional Committee declined to release its
numbers Tuesday. The disclosure reports are due at the Federal Election
Commission Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The DNC's fund-raising troubles could hurt Vice President Al Gore and former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley. Both candidates are limited to spending around $40
million in their quest for the presidential nomination because they are
accepting federal funds for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus, in a drawn out contest for the nomination, Gore or Bradley could be
out of money months before the national convention while Republican front-runner
George W. Bush can continue spending money because he is not taking federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
	   In that case, the Democratic National Committee would be called upon to run
television commercials promoting the party and its candidates, the same way the
Republican National Committee helped back Dole when he reached the spending
limits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its flagging financial fortunes, the DNC has hired
three new finance chairs: Carol Pensky, former committee treasurer and founder
of its Women's Leadership Forum; Joel Hyatt, an unsuccessful Senate candidate
from Ohio and co-founder of Hyatt Legal Services who now teaches at Stanford
Business School; and Joe Cari Jr., former national finance chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The DNC reported it had raised more than $40 million in 1999, compared with
$58 million for the Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Group: Chavez Tainting Investigation  </HEADLINE>
   By FABIOLA SANCHEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Human rights groups said Tuesday that President
Hugo Chavez is trying to hinder their investigations into charges that soldiers
and police killed suspected looters after the devastating mudslides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will not be intimidated because they threaten us with the possibility
of investigating and punishing us,'' said Liliana Ortega, head of the Committee
of Victims of 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   A leading Venezuelan human rights group, Provea, last week said it has
received reports that security agents beat up and killed people during attempts
to curb looting after the Dec. 15 disaster, which left thousands of people dead
and turned many coastal neighborhoods into ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Cedeno, the government prosecutor in charge of monitoring human rights
in Vargas state, the area worst hit by the mudslides, told The Associated Press
on Tuesday that security agents killed at least 10 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former paratrooper who has given the military a prominent role in
his government, called Provea's report ``suspicious and superficial'' partly
because it offered no names of witnesses. Venezuela's new public defender, Dilia
Parra, said the groups could be investigated and charged if their accusations
turn out to be false.
</P>
<P>
	   But Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel has backed off from the comments,
and said a human rights investigation would proceed.

<HEADLINE> Putin To Raise Russian Pensions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's government will boost pensions by 20 percent as of
Feb. 1, acting President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday in an apparent appeal to
voters ahead of March presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's last pension hike, a 15 percent rise, came in October.
Officials at the time promised a 12 percent increase in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said the raise was a routine response to higher-than-expected tax
collection at the end of last year, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We make decisions about increasing pensions every year,'' Putin said. ``As
a result of the government's work in the fourth quarter, we managed not only to
fulfill, but also significantly exceed our promises.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement comes 10 weeks before the March 26 presidential election,
which Putin is heavily favored to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Boris Yeltsin, Putin's predecessor, cash-strapped federal and local
agencies often delayed pensions and salaries for several months. But revenues
from high world oil prices have helped the government pay out pensions in recent
months. Russia is a major oil exporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Pensions currently average the equivalent of $17.50 a month, below the
official poverty line, and are the only income for many elderly Russians.
Pensions also often lag behind inflation, which was 36.5 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Mixed reaction to State of State Address  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Reaction to Gov. Christie Whitman's State of the
State address, delivered Tuesday:
<P>
	   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, R-Union:
</P>
<P>
	   "It was perhaps as bold as a couple of them and not as bold as others. I
think everyone enjoyed the speech and the way it was presented. I thought it was
a good speech. I think the environmental issues are important. Drinking water,
the open space issue, and how we got about it, and how we spend that money. I
think those are important issues for the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem:
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was very aggressive. She's going into these two years with the
same enthusiasm she started her gubernatorial career with. There's going to be
school construction. Everyone knows that. There's going to be a Transportation
Trust Fund. There's going to be continuing efforts to do something about health
care. So all these things are understood. What I think she was trying to do
today was say, 'Hey, look at these other things in there."'
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph Doria, D-Hudson:
</P>
<P>
	   "It left out a lot of issues of importance to the people of the state. She
didn't discuss the transportation trust fund, (racial) profiling, auto emissions
and property taxes. She gave a bow to school construction but she didn't give
any details. We need leadership to bring the Senate and Assembly together. The
Republicans are squabbling among themselves and the governor needs to bring them
together. I think it was a good speech, but it didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey, D-Essex:
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing that's most on the minds of New Jerseyans, the governor didn't
mention, and that's state inspection lines. Most of her speech (was about)
things anybody would agree to, but it's the other things that weren't
mentioned."

<HEADLINE> Judge, Elian's Family Linked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A spokesman for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives earned
$10,000 as a political consultant for the judge who awarded temporary custody of
the boy to a great-uncle here in defiance of a federal order that he be returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said Tuesday she was not
required to remove herself from the case, a suggestion made by a legal expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, who has spoken on behalf of the 6-year-old boy's
relatives, said he worked for Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled Monday that Elian's Miami relatives had shown that the boy
would face ``imminent and irreparable harm'' if he were returned to Cuba,
including the ``loss of due process rights and harm to his physical and mental
health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, who runs a public relations firm, said he hasn't spoken with the
judge in 18 months and that his work for her did not influence her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is absurd that anyone could influence anyone in this case,''
Gutierrez said. ``I'm not a part of this lawsuit. ... I'm not getting paid. I'm
a community activist trying to help out like millions of community activists in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Rodriguez said: ``According to the canons of judicial ethics
... a judge has no ethical obligation to disclose participation by attorneys or
participants in a past judicial election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A judge is not required to disqualify herself due to an attorney's
participation in a judicial campaign when the campaign takes place during the
previous year and is not ongoing,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the judge's campaign also paid his wife, Maritza, for
services provided by her advertising agency, though he did not know how much.
His wife's business has not participated in the effort to keep Elian in the
United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service has ruled that he should be returned to his father in Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge should have disclosed her relationship with Gutierrez
and recused herself from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was an appearance of impropriety and it should have been a basis for
her to recuse herself from the case,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, an attorney representing Elian's relatives, said Gutierrez
has stayed away from court to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have every confidence that she made this decision independently,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, attorneys for Elian's relatives refiled a petition seeking
political asylum for Elian, even as questions remained as to the whether the INS
would consider the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS was reviewing Rodriguez's ruling to see what effect it has on the
agency's decision last week to return Elian to his father, said Russ Bergeron,
an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March
6 so the court can hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle, who is
seeking to become Elian's guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, a member of the legal team, said the attorneys would wait for a
reaction from INS officials to the judge's ruling before taking further action.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian returned to school Tuesday, saying he didn't have time to
do his homework because he had stayed up too late Monday.

<HEADLINE> McCain Plan Offers Savings Accounts  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain today outlined a five-year, $237 billion tax
relief plan that also would set aside more than $700 billion to protect Social
Security and create new all-purpose tax-free saving accounts for the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
	   In a lunchtime speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Concord, N.H., McCain
suggested it would be irresponsible to use most of projected budget surpluses to
cut taxes -- as Republican presidential rival George W. Bush would do -- without
planning for the retirement of the big baby boom generation, which will push
Social Security toward insolvency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Others suggest that we should use every penny for tax cuts, forgetting we
have promises to keep and a fleeting opportunity to keep our word without
imperiling the economic future of our children and generations to come,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator said his plan would provide a significant tax cut while
setting aside 62 percent of the budget surplus that is not already earmarked for
Social Security to help keep the retirement program afloat. The proposal would
also set aside 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus for Medicare and 5
percent to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   To help pay for the changes, McCain said he would raise some $150 billion by
closing a long list of corporate tax loopholes and shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every tax dollar now wasted on special breaks for oil companies, ethanol
giants, insurance companies and the multitude of other special interests with
their armies of lobbyists, is now at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential front-runner, Texas Gov. Bush, is pushing a
five-year, $483 billion tax relief plan that, among other things, would
gradually cut all income tax rates, abolish estate taxes and double the $500
per-child tax credit. Critics say it would leave precious little for Social
Security or Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement today, Bush said he and McCain ``have a fundamental
disagreement'' over taxes and how to use projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe surpluses should be passed back to hardworking Americans,'' Bush
said. ``Senator McCain's plan would leave more money in Washington to be spent
on more government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of McCain's plan has been made public before: Like Bush, the Arizona
senator would increase the $500-a-child tax credit to $1,000. But McCain also
wants to expand the bottom 15 percent tax bracket to couples with taxable income
of $70,000, up from $43,050 now, and to $35,000 for singles, up from $25,750.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would also create new ``family security accounts'' in which an
individual in the new 15 percent income tax bracket could save up to $3,000
tax-free per year, $6,000 for married couples, aides said Monday on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Like a traditional individual retirement account, the money would be taxed
as regular income when it is withdrawn. Unlike a traditional IRA, the money
could be withdrawn after only one year without penalty and could be used for any
purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to enhance family savings with as few restrictions as possible,
a McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, however, said the savings proposal is ``small
dollar'' compared to the amount middle-income people would save under Bush's
broader income tax cuts. McCain's expansion of the bottom tax bracket, Fleischer
said, would do nothing for the 71 percent of taxpayers who are already in it.
</P>
<P>
	   If elected, aides said, McCain would continue pushing up the income limits
on the 15 percent income tax bracket in an effort to one day achieve a single,
``flat'' tax advocated by many GOP fiscal conservatives and championed by
another GOP presidential challenger, publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is working at establishing a flat tax ``from the bottom up instead of
the top down,'' the McCain adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another major new item in McCain's proposal, which he will flesh out further
today, would raise $150 billion over five years by closing corporate tax
shelters and other breaks. In the Senate, McCain is a frequent critic of such
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to setting aside billions to keep Social Security solvent,
McCain wants to allow workers to save up to 20 percent of the payroll taxes they
and their employers pay into the system for private investment accounts. Details
of that plan would come later, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also proposes easing the ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of
two-income couples by raising the standard tax deduction from $7,200 to $8,600.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan includes an unspecified tax deduction for long-term care expenses,
expansion of tax-free accounts for medical costs and education and elimination
of income taxes for military personnel deployed or stationed overseas.

<HEADLINE> The Candidates on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights of tax proposals of the presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
	   Snapshot: Federal income tax rates range from 15 percent to 39.6 percent
depending on income, with most Americans taxed at 28 percent or under. The
per-person cost of all federal taxes combined is estimated at $7,026, up from
$4,646 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: Expand earned income tax credit. Families that don't make
enough to pay income tax -- and can't take the dependent care tax credit --
would get the equivalent in cash (average of $470 per family) for child-care
expenses. Close $25 billion in corporate tax breaks over 10 years and seek to
save $100 billion from tougher corporate audits and penalties. Among breaks to
end: tax benefit for companies that ``park profits in foreign subsidiaries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore: Targeted tax cuts for education and retirement, and
increased earning cap for receiving earned income tax credit, all costing $250
billion to $300 billion. Credit would be worth $500 more for married couples
making about $29,000. Would make research and development tax credit permanent.
Would raise the standard deduction for married couples filing joint returns to
twice that of a single taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: Proposed 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000 and deep
cuts in inheritance and small-business taxes -- to be paid for in part with
higher tariffs -- before leaving Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Trump: Billionaire proposed one-time tax of 14.25 percent on the net
worth of the wealthy in a plan he said would cost him $725 million personally.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: 16 percent flat tax on personal and business income and on
capital gains. Plan has $1,400 per-person tax credit, retains charitable and
mortgage-interest deductions and stops business from deducting the cost of new
equipment. Twenty percent cut in payroll taxes. Would eliminate the ``marriage
penalty'' and end inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush: A $483 billion, five-year package that would
gradually cut all tax rates, with poorest workers paying 10 percent and the
richest, 33 percent. The current child tax credit would be doubled to $1,000 and
the income ceiling for getting the credit would be doubled to $200,000. Also
proposes to eliminate inheritance taxes and offer tax breaks for education and
the elderly. To be paid for from projected non-Social Security budget surpluses
and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: 17 percent flat tax on earnings over $36,000 for a family of
four, eliminating charitable and mortgage-interest deductions as well as taxes
on capital gains, personal savings, inheritances, health care and college
education. Says people could choose between that plan and current system.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah: Tax break for parents who stay home with children.
Voted for $792 billion congressional tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: Replace income tax with national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona: Five-year, $237 billion plan that would expand
the bottom 15 percent tax bracket to couples with taxable income of $70,000, up
from $43,050, and to individuals with taxable income of $35,000, up from
$25,750. Plan would create all-purpose savings accounts for people in that
bracket, double child tax credit to $1,000 and aim to save $150 billion over
five years by closing corporate tax breaks, leaving $729 billion in projected
budget surpluses for Social Security as well as money for Medicare. Among tax
breaks to end: credits for ethanol fuel production, tax-exempt bonds for sports
stadiums.

<HEADLINE> Industry Turf War of Sorts  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM WHITMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A U.S. District Court lawsuit accuses the maker of
AstroTurf of infringing on a rival turf-maker's patent and engaging in
anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit, filed last Friday by Dalton, Ga.-based FieldTurf Inc., charges
that Southwest Recreational Industries Inc. has "maintained or attempted to
maintain monopoly power through predatory pricing, product disparagement, patent
infringement and interference with FieldTurf's actual or prospective contractual
relationships."
</P>
<P>
	   FieldTurf seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and asks that
those damages be trebled under federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Leander, Texas-based Southwest didn't immediately return phone
messages left Tuesday seeking reaction to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   FieldTurf owns a patent on a synthetic playing surface designed to be more
grass-like than AstroTurf, which has been described by some players as feeling
more like concrete than grass.
</P>
<P>
	   A FieldTurf surface features longer blades of synthetic grass than
traditional AstroTurf and a subsurface of sand and other resilient material
designed to be more forgiving on athletes' bodies than the hard rubber and
concrete underneath an AstroTurf surface.
</P>
<P>
	   FieldTurf's suit charges that, after it acquired its patent rights in 1994
and started competing in the artificial turf market, Southwest began selling a
nearly identical synthetic grass surface called AstroPlay.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit claims Southwest has sold AstroPlay surfaces in violation of
FieldTurf's patent to facilities in Montclair, N.Y., Watertown, N.Y., Wichita,
Kan. and Wilder, Ky., as well as in Spain and England.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lexington, the suit claims, Southwest unfairly interfered with
FieldTurf's ultimately successful effort to install a FieldTurf surface at
Lexington Catholic High School.
</P>
<P>
	   "After FieldTurf had won the bidding and received a verbal commitment,
Southwest attempted to tamper with the bidding process by disparaging
FieldTurf's ability to remain in business," the suit claims. "Southwest also
disparaged FieldTurf by (falsely) claiming that a deteriorating sports field in
Erie, Pa., was a FieldTurf installation. Finally, Southwest attempted to subvert
the bidding process by submitting additional bids for less than its actual cost
for the project and bypassing the high school administration with complaints to
the Lexington Archidiocese."
</P>
<P>
	   Lexington Catholic athletic director Danny Haney didn't immediately return a
message seeking comment on the lawsuit's allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit claims Southwest has violated the federal Sherman Antitrust Act, as
well as Kentucky state laws pertaining to unfair competition.

<HEADLINE> FAO Schwarz Exec To Lead Toys R Us  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Toys R Us Inc., a merchandiser to the masses, on Tuesday
picked the top executive from exclusive FAO Schwarz to try to lead it to a
recovery from sagging sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   John Eyler's appointment as president and chief executive of Toys R Us was
lauded by analysts because of his extensive background in the toy business. But
there was some concern on Wall Street whether he had the know-how to lead a
turnaround of a 1,500 store chain.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us shares fell as much as 9 percent in early trading Tuesday to
$11.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. By 5:15 p.m., shares fell $1.06 1/4,
or by 8.4 percent, to $11.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler comes on board after a tough year for Toys R Us, with its sales and
profits coming under pressure. Once the nation's No. 1 selling toy chain, Toys R
Us now trails giant discounter Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Paramus, N.J.-based company warned that it would miss 1999
earnings forecasts and reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell 2
percent during the holiday season, due in part to some shortages of popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its business, Toys R Us has been renovating its U.S.
stores, creating a brighter layout that is easier to navigate. It also has been
stepping up its efforts on the Internet to better compete with online rivals
Amazon.com and eToys.
</P>
<P>
	   But both areas still need tremendous work.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has about three-quarters of its 710 U.S. toy stores left to
redesign. It also must drastically improve the delivery and customer service
systems of its Web sites, Toysrus.com, after many complaints during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a lot ahead of this company to do," said Margaret Whitfield, a toy
analyst at the investment firm Tucker Anthony. "I am anxious to see what Eyler
will do to get this company back on track."
</P>
<P>
	   Some concern over his appointment stems from the fact that Eyler comes from
a toy chain far different than Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
	   While Toys R Us is best-known for its super-sized stores stacked high with
toys like Barbie dolls and board games, FAO Schwarz fills its stores with
expensive toys, such as the $8,500 Mercedes kids cars or limited edition Steiff
stuffed bears.
</P>
<P>
	   FAO Schwarz doesn't run sales or discount promotions, and many of its 42
stores are located in posh addresses, such as on Fifth Avenue in New York and at
the high-end Forum Shops mall in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   While the differences in the Toys R Us and FAO Schwarz businesses raised
eyebrows, analysts also were quick to point out the successes that Eyler has had
since he joined FAO as its chairman and CEO in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He is credited with updating the upscale toy chain's image, improving its
profitability and boosting its selection of exclusive toy lines. About 70
percent of the toys found in FAO Schwarz aren't sold elsewhere, up from 30
percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Going to an FAO is always a first-class shopping experience. Parents and
kids walk out of there loving the experience they had in the stores," said Jim
Silver, publisher of The Toy Book, a toy industry trade magazine. "It would be
great if he could do the same at Toys R Us."
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler said he hoped Toys R Us could expand its exclusive deals with
toymakers. In addition, he said that he'd like to follow a practice at FAO
Schwarz of stocking products of smaller toymakers, businesses that have had
problems making inroads at large toy chains.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he'd like
Toys R Us to develop its own products.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts pointed out that Elyer's experience extends beyond brick-and-mortar
stores. FAO Schwarz, a division of Vendex NV of Amsterdam, Netherlands, also
operates a catalog and a Web site, and Eyler's expertise in those areas should
be an asset as Toysrus.com looks to improve its online business.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us has been operating without a permanent CEO since August, when
Robert Nakasone resigned abruptly. Since then, chairman Michael Goldstein has
been acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old Eyler will take the helm of Toys R Us on Monday. John
Barbour will remain CEO of Toysrus.com, reporting to Eyler.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its U.S. toy stores, Toys R Us also operates 454 international toy
stores, 205 Kids R Us clothing stores, 130 Babies R Us stores and 45 Imaginarium
specialty toy stores.

<HEADLINE> Waco Photo Appears To Bolster FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An FBI photograph seems to discredit claims that flashes of
light filmed during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound were
gunfire from government agents, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Dispatch said the surveillance photo appears to have been snapped
within seconds of the time when a flash appears on a separate infrared tape at
11:24 a.m. on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians and their experts claim flashes on the infrared film
are muzzle flashes from FBI agents' guns. But the surveillance photo shows
nobody in the vicinity of the flashes.
</P>
<P>
	   It is part of a batch of photos the government recently turned over to John
C. Danforth and U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is presiding over a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Branch Davidian
survivors. Danforth was appointed last year to investigate whether the FBI tried
to cover up its actions at the group's compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has admitted it fired incendiary tear-gas canisters into the
compound the day a fire killed about 80 members of the group but contends that
people inside started the fire and that agents did not fire weapons at the
people inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, the infrared tape taken aboard one FBI plane flying about
9,000 feet over the compound and photographs taken aboard another plane at a
lower altitude had not been compared.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveillance photographs were timed by the damage depicted on the
infrared tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians, said he has not
yet seen the still photographs because the government has not handed them over
to the plaintiffs, but he was not impressed by the comparison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of times when that tank went in and out of the
building,'' he said. ``Being able to identify what time it is and whatever the
precise moment when someone was firing from the rear of the tank is very suspect
unless you've got a complete roll of film and you can see the entire sequence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians on Tuesday also asked Judge Smith to sanction the
government $50,000 for delaying the surrender of thousands of pages of documents
related to the siege. Caddell said the government has turned over fewer than 20
boxes of documents, most of which are already public record.
</P>
<P>
	   With a court-imposed deadline of Jan. 15, Caddell said he fears a ``last
minute document dump,'' of hundreds of thousands of pages of materials, as
plaintiffs prepare for a May 15 trial. The $50,000 would allow the plaintiffs to
hire additional staff to sort through the materials, Caddell said in the motion.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford on the matter were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Business Week Won't Pay Damages  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN NOLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Cincinnati
company's request for punitive damages from the publisher of Business Week
magazine, which conceded it improperly obtained consumer credit reports for a
news story.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned down WDIA Corp.'s request for
up to $45 million in punitive damages from McGraw-Hill Inc. and former Business
Week reporter Jeffrey Rothfeder.
</P>
<P>
	   McGraw-Hill had argued that WDIA, which provides consumer credit information
to customers, was not entitled to any punitive damages. McGraw-Hill and
Rothfeder said they had not acted with malice in publishing their 1989 cover
story because the article did not identify WDIA as the source of the consumer
credit information. They said the story was news-gathering that is protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Kearney, lawyer for WDIA, said the company will consider appealing
further, either to the full appeals court or to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   WDIA argued that it was entitled to punitive damages because Business Week
lied to obtain the consumer credit information and violated contract
restrictions on its use. WDIA said punitive damages should have been imposed to
prevent McGraw-Hill or others from misrepresenting themselves to obtain
information for publication.
</P>
<P>
	   McGraw-Hill conceded that it breached the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Floyd Abrams, McGraw-Hill's lawyer in New York, praised Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a true story. It was a useful story," Abrams said. "I'm pleased
the court has declined to give the plaintiff a windfall under circumstances in
which Business Week did do an important article for the public."
</P>
<P>
	   A lower court ruled in 1998 that Rothfeder and McGraw-Hill violated a
contract with WDIA to get the information for the story, by saying they intended
to use confidential credit information to screen prospective employees. But U.S.
District Judge Herman Weber decided then against awarding any punitive damages
because he said the story "served to inform Congress and the general public
about a matter of vital public interest."
</P>
<P>
	   Appeals judges David Nelson, Martha Craig Daughtrey and William Bertelsman
upheld that ruling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rothfeder used the information in a cover story titled "Is Nothing Private?"
that aimed to show how easy it is to obtain the credit reports of even
well-known Americans such as then-Vice President Dan Quayle. Rothfeder left the
magazine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In his December 1998 ruling, Weber refused to impose any of the $45 million
in punitive damages that WDIA wanted and awarded the company just $7,500 of the
$75,000 it requested in actual damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants did not appeal the $7,500 award and are prepared to pay it
when the appeals is over, Abrams said.

<HEADLINE> GM Stops Production of Electric Car  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has stopped production of its sleek EV1
electric car, citing waning interest from its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM vice chairman Harry J. Pearce said Tuesday that GM was shifting its
attention from all-electric cars to vehicles powered by hybrid fuel-electric
systems and fuel cells, which use hydrogen to create electricity. Pearce said
the company had a sufficient supply of EV1s on hand and said while GM could
build more, there was "no particular need."
</P>
<P>
	   GM will still lease EV1s in California and Arizona, but will "recycle" used
EV1s as their leases end, giving them new battery packs or other updates.
</P>
<P>
	   GM began building the EV1 in 1996, and hoped to eventually sell thousands of
battery-powered vehicles as pollution-free alternative transportation --
especially in warm-climate cities beset by smog.
</P>
<P>
	   It spent $350 million to develop the EV1, and promoted it heavily,
delivering some of the first vehicles to celebrities such as Sylvester Stallone.
It billed the EV1 as a household's second car for short trips, and set a goal of
leasing 100 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   But after an initial flurry of interest, few buyers came forward, and the
EV1s limitations became clear. EV1 leases cost between $400 and $600 a month,
and for their money, owners got a car with a range of 80 miles that needed
several hours to recharge.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 703 prospects who went through a special sales pitch for EV1s in the
first three months, nearly 80 percent decided against it. GM increased the EV1's
range, but sales didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
	   GM spokesman Jeff Kuhlman said the company builds EV1s in batches of 500,
and has made two batches since 1996. While no EV1s are being built right now, GM
could restart the assembly line if the market demanded it, Kuhlman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, GM leased 137 EV1s, and has leased about 600 since 1996. Pearce
said the EV1 appealed mostly to die-hard fans of electric cars, and not a mass
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "Range, two seats, recharging...those are very real concerns that consumers
have," Pearce said. "We have spoiled customers with respect to motor vehicles.
They want normal range, they want four or five seats, they don't want to spend
any time recharging."
</P>
<P>
	   Pearce also said GM was working with Toyota Motor Co. on new power
technologies, and said a hybrid vehicle that would be a joint effort was
possible. Hybrids use an internal combustion engine mated to an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
	   GM and Toyota share a factory in California; Toyota will put a hybrid
version of its Echo compact, called the Prius, on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   GM also showed off its fuel cell technology Tuesday, unveiling a fuel cell
version of its high-efficiency Precept concept vehicle. The five-passenger sedan
has a range of 500 miles, and an equivalent of 108 miles per gallon of gasoline
based on federal testing standards, Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel cells are attractive because the only byproduct is water. One of the
biggest hurdles to using fuel cells has been ways to store liquid hydrogen in
the car; it has to be chilled to 430 degrees below zero. Instead of liquid
hydrogen, the Precept's fuel cell uses a gel-like chemical hydride that fills
tanks below the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a no-excuses vehicle," Pearce said. "When this vehicle is up and
running -- as I predict it will be by the end of the year -- this vehicle will
have performance of 9 seconds, zero to 60 (mph). It will have a top speed well
in excess of 120 miles per hour."
</P>
<P>
	   Byron McCormick, co-executive director of GM's Global Alternative Propulsion
Center, said fuel cells will be ready for production by 2004, but more work
needs to be done to build fueling stations and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to set the stage to get millions of these out there. ... You
don't clean the air by putting just a few of these on the roads," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Declared Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand
trial, the government announced Tuesday, opening the possibility that the former
Chilean dictator could win his battle against extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said a medical team who examined Pinochet on Jan. 5
unanimously agreed that he was too ill to face trial for alleged human rights
abuses, ``and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt that he should not
allow Pinochet's extradition until hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement did not immediately make available details on why he was
considered unfit. But The Sunday Times reported in London last weekend that the
doctors had found Pinochet was suffering from a viral infection, diabetes, heart
disease and the effects of two mild strokes. His diabetes reportedly has caused
a loss of sensation in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could lead to Pinochet's release on humanitarian grounds,
halting efforts to try him in connection with the disappearances and killings of
thousands of Chileans during his 17-year rule there.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement read that Straw ``is minded ... to take the view that no
purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and
that he should therefore decide not to extradite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said Straw would hear arguments from Spain and other
parties to the case before making a final decision. Human rights groups
including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also have been invited to
submit comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The news was greeted with protest and support in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Organization of Relatives of Missing Detainees, a group
dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the Pinochet
dictatorship, said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous frustration and sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated,'' said Mireya Garcia, vice president of the organization. ``We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel, a close aide to Pinochet, said, ``this
is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process starts to
restore its sovereignty and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congressman Alberto Cardemil, also a close associate of Pinochet, called the
British decision ``a victory for a national cause, a cause of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from interested groups in Spain, where it
was near midnight when the announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention in Britain since his
arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was arrested on a Spanish
warrant for alleged human rights violations committed during his rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's medical exam was done at the Chilean government's request. The
general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric specialists during a
seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, mainly Chileans but also some Spaniards, were killed or
disappeared after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight against being
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited. A hearing is scheduled to begin March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw can consider Pinochet's health in making a final ruling. But even if
he were to agree to release the general due to health concerns, Spain could
appeal that ruling, further prolonging the general's stay in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet also faces more than 50 individual lawsuits in Chilean courts,
which the government has said he should face if he returns. The government has
never pressed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of Pinochet's most forthright
supporters, said Tuesday: ``I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a
very fair man.''

<HEADLINE> $1.6B Colombia Aid Package Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money alone will not fix the problems of drug violence
and corruption in Colombia, but $1.6 billion will go a long way toward
bolstering democracy there, the Clinton administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House proposed a package for the South American nation that
President Clinton said will stem the production and export of illegal narcotics,
while supporting economic development and improving human rights in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is flying to Colombia this weekend to
explain the package.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Albright also will
consult with Colombian authorities on implementing the package and how to obtain
additional international support for Colombia's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will make it better if the money's well spent, and it will dramatically
strengthen and solidify the Colombian government in its struggle to preserve
democracy, to preserve economic growth and preserve order in the country and be
a good neighbor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Will it solve all the problems? Of course not. Will it make a big
difference? It certainly will,'' the president said at a short
question-and-answer session with reporters in Arizona, where he traveled to
announce new national monuments designations.
</P>
<P>
	   	   The aid package is part of the budget plan the White House is drafting
for fiscal 2001. It dramatically increases America's involvement in Colombian
President Andres Pastrana's plan to wean Colombia from its drug-based economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional approval is far from assured, although there were some
encouraging words Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I have been critical in the past of the administration's efforts in
policies toward Colombia's growing problems, I believe the president is
beginning to respond in good faith to our concerns,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, also welcomed the plan but said he will pay
special attention to whether the Clinton plan will help Colombia's neighbors as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Hill Republicans generally favor spending on counternarcotics
activities, while the administration prefers spreading the money over a range of
programs including treatment of addiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed package includes money to help train special counternarcotics
battalions and buy 66 U.S. military helicopters for use in drug surveillance and
eradication.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This program is specifically directed against the narcotrafficking, and
trying to make sure that the eradication programs go forward,'' Albright said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana estimates his plan will cost $7.5 billion overall, of which more
than $4 billion would come from Colombia itself. He made an international appeal
for aid during a speech at the United Nations in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a news conference Tuesday in Bogota, Pastrana said his government
would wage a diplomatic offensive on Capitol Hill in coming weeks in hopes of
heading off partisan squabbling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll make a push before the electoral debate can contaminate whatever
assistance the United States might lend to Colombia,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana believes no counternarcotics program is viable unless Colombian
farmers are given the opportunity to produce alternatives to narcotics plants.
Clinton's proposal earmarks money for that purpose, which Pastrana said is
``recognition that the fight against drug trafficking cannot be limited only to
repressive actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Anti-narcotics aid has previously gone mostly to police interdiction
and forced eradication of coca and opium crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton phoned Pastrana on Monday night, while Clinton was en route to
Arizona. The two briefly discussed strategies for gaining quick congressional
approval, Pastrana said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Module Launch Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The long-delayed International Space Station has been
postponed once again due to flaws in a booster rocket, while Russia's Mir space
station may get a new lease on life, space officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The launch of the crucial crew compartment for the multibillion-dollar,
16-nation space station has been long behind schedule because of the Russian
government's failure to provide funds for its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, when the module was almost ready, two crashes of Proton booster
rockets pushed officials to postpone the launch date again Tuesday. The Zvezda
(Star) module is to be carried into space by a Proton.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Gromov, spokesman for the Energia company that built the module, said
the crashes were caused by a manufacturing flaw in the rockets' second-stage
engines. The Voronezh Mechanical Works, which built the engines, promised to
replace them by the end of June, he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once the booster is ready, it takes about 45 days to prepare the module
for launch, so the earliest launch time is the end of August,'' he said. He said
the actual launch date would be pushed back even further because space officials
first want to launch refurbished Protons with less-precious cargos.
</P>
<P>
	   Gromov's statement means that the entire project likely will be thrown more
than two years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   The station's first components were launched into space in November and
December 1998, but the first permanent crew may only begin its stint on the
station after the crew module is put into orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   NASA spokesman Duane Brown said that if there is a significant change, the
U.S. agency will look at having a Space Shuttle mission go up to the space
station to do some housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We, as an agency, certainly applaud the Russians and we are awaiting a
meeting, sometime in February, when they will give an official launch date for
the service module,'' he said. The Russians would brief NASA on Wednesday about
their investigation and the direction they will take, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Proton rockets crashed shortly after launch July 5 and Oct. 27. The
official investigation released by the Interfax news agency Tuesday said the
engines caught fire because they were contaminated by metal and mineral
particles.
</P>
<P>
	   While the new international station faced new delays, Russia's own Mir space
station may remain in orbit for longer than earlier planned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government decided last year to discard the aging station if private
investors fail to come up with funds to keep it aloft. The station has been
orbiting the Earth unmanned after its last crew left in August, and it was
expected that one final crew would go to the Mir to send it down around March.
</P>
<P>
	   No major funds have been found, but Gromov said Tuesday that a two-man crew
is now set to blast off for the station March 30. Their mission would last for
at least 45 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Gromov said the state-controlled Energia, which built the Mir and has been
running it since its launch in February 1986, is looking to a U.S. company named
Golden Apple to save Mir. He declined to provide more details.
</P>
<P>
	   If the U.S. firm backs off, Energia still hopes the government will change
its mind and pour more resources into Mir, the last remaining symbol of
once-glorious Soviet space program.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Covering Up Cosmo Cover  </HEADLINE>
    By TERRY KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kroger, the nation's largest grocery chain, will cover up
Cosmopolitan magazine at checkout stands because of complaints about headlines
like "Sex Tricks He's Never Seen Before" and "20 Earth-Quaking Moves That Will
Make Him Plead for Mercy -- and Beg for More."
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Gary Rhodes said Tuesday that all of the company's stores are
installing racks this month that will cover up everything but the magazine's
name.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger operates 2,268 grocery stores and about 800 convenience stores in 31
states under the names Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers,
Dillon, Fry's, Food 4 Less and Quality Food Centers.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was hailed by Morality in Media, a New York organization that
has been pressuring the nation's supermarket chains to remove or cover magazines
with "lurid sexual content" from checkout aisles.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger said customers complained more about the words on the cover than
about the picture, which is usually of a woman with deep cleavage.
</P>
<P>
	   King Soopers, Colorado's biggest supermarket chain, will install the
blinders at all 81 stores this week, said Dave Savage, King Soopers vice
president for retail sales in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have had to pull Cosmo many times because the cover was not fit for the
checkout area," where children would see it, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
	   Magazine spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said Cosmopolitan has the highest
newsstand sales of any monthly magazine. About half of its 2 million issues are
bought at checkout counters, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She conceded that "Cosmo's not for everyone," but added that to her
knowledge, no supermarket chain has ever put its cover under wraps.
</P>
<P>
	   She refused to speculate on how Kroger's move would affect sales, but said
supermarket sales account for 70 percent of Cosmo's 1.2 million circulation.

<HEADLINE> Judge, Elian's Miami Family Linked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A spokesman for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives earned
$10,000 as a political consultant for the judge who defied a federal order and
awarded temporary custody of the Cuban boy to a relative in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said Tuesday she was not
required to remove herself from the case because of the affiliation, a
suggestion made by a legal expert.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, who has spoken on behalf of the 6-year-old boy's
relatives, said he worked for Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled Monday that Elian's Miami relatives had shown that the boy
would face ``imminent and irreparable harm'' if he were returned to Cuba,
including the ``loss of due process rights and harm to his physical and mental
health and emotional well-being.'' She awarded his great-uncle temporary custody
until a March hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had earlier ruled that the young
shipwreck survivor should be returned to his father in Cuba by Friday because
they have a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, who runs a public relations firm, said he hasn't spoken with the
judge in 18 months and that his work for her did not influence her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is absurd that anyone could influence anyone in this case,''
Gutierrez said. ``I'm not a part of this lawsuit. ... I'm not getting paid. I'm
a community activist trying to help out like millions of community activists in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Rodriguez said: ``According to the canons of judicial ethics
... a judge has no ethical obligation to disclose participation by attorneys or
participants in a past judicial election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A judge is not required to disqualify herself due to an attorney's
participation in a judicial campaign when the campaign takes place during the
previous year and is not ongoing,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez said the judge's campaign also paid his wife, Maritza, for
services provided by her company, Creative Ideas Advertising. State records show
the company was paid $53,446.22. Her business has not participated in the effort
to keep Elian in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge should have disclosed her relationship with Gutierrez
and recused herself from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was an appearance of impropriety and it should have been a basis for
her to recuse herself from the case,'' Perlmutter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, an attorney representing Elian's relatives, said Gutierrez
has stayed away from court to avoid any appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have every confidence that she made this decision independently,''
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, attorneys for Elian's relatives refiled a petition seeking
political asylum for Elian, even as questions remained as to the whether the INS
would consider the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS was reviewing Rodriguez's ruling to see what effect it has on the
agency's decision last week to return Elian to his father, said Russ Bergeron,
an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez ruled that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March
6 so the court can hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle, who is
seeking to become Elian's guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, a member of the legal team, said the attorneys would wait for a
reaction from INS officials to the judge's ruling before taking further action.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Elian returned to school Tuesday, saying he didn't have time to
do his homework because he had stayed up too late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Is Off 127.04; Dow Off 71.12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks gave up an early advance and finished lower today as
rising bond yields drew investors' attention. Shares of Internet companies led
the Nasdaq composite index to a steep decline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 71.12 to close at 11,511.08, down from
the closing high set yesterday. Earlier in the session, the Dow had risen as
much as 90 points. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was off 127.04 at 3,922.63, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 19.01 to 1,438.59.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 2,091 down, 1,028 up and 436 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock
Market, five stocks fell for every three that rose.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.25 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.03 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.28 to 492.61.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks fell as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.67 percent
from 6.58 percent late Monday. The weakness in the bond market was spurred by
growing concerns that the robust growth of the U.S. economy will force the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times in 1999 in a bid to keep inflation from
escalating, and continued signs of economic growth have convinced many
economists that an increase in February is almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent sessions, the bond market has been much more sensitive than stocks
to the possibility of further rate hikes. Today, however, bond yields were
nearing the highest levels since Sept. 1997, drawing some investors away from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising bond yields can make it difficult for stocks to advance, in part
because they can present an appealing alternative to investors looking for
stable returns.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet companies, which buoyed the market Monday in response to America
Online's deal to buy Time Warner, were mostly lower today as investors sold some
shares to capture profits.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL fell. Analysts said investors were struggling with the notion that AOL,
a high-flying Internet leader that has commanded premium stock prices, will now
behave more like a traditional media company.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, scheduled to report earnings after the close of trading today, was
sharply lower. The Internet service provider was among the market's strongest
performers in 1999, and traders said the company would have to turn in an
especially strong profit report to spark further gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Nervousness about corporate earnings spread well beyond the technology
sector. Bank One Corp., citing continued weakness in its credit card business,
fell after saying it expects earnings for 2000 to fall significantly short of
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the broader market showed signs of strength. Intel rose, buoying the Dow
and the Nasdaq after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola rose, also benefiting from an upgrade from Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have been on the rise since last week, when investors sold
technology shares to collect profits from the sector's stellar performance in
1999, and gravitated toward neglected shares of blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
	   That trend continued today, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that last week's strength within several defensive
growth, consumer and deep cyclical areas is an early indication that the market
can and will look for alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume was fairly heavy on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq,
continuing a string of volatile sessions this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hold on and enjoy the ride," said Charles White, president and portfolio
manager at Avatar Associates in New York. "The market is looking for some
direction, but there's still a lot of money on the sidelines and a lot of
interest in the stock market."

<HEADLINE> Critics Fear Dilution of News  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The nation may get its news from more places than ever these
days. But the blockbuster merger of Time Warner and America Online, as well as
big media combinations expected in the future, are raising concerns about
homogenized and diluted news.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this merger invites is the possibility of a new era in American
communications that sees the end of an independent press," said Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is as alarmed. Richard Epstein, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, said the Internet still offers a worldwide venue for
dissenting voices. He added the industry is still diverse enough to keep itself
in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are just two newspapers in town, one will happily dump on the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $145 billion stock deal announced Monday allies AOL's 22 million online
subscribers with a news and entertainment conglomerate that includes CNN, Time
magazine, TBS, TNT, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   A call Tuesday evening to a Time Warner spokesperson to get comment about
the affect of the deal on news operations was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Media mergers are nothing new, beginning in earnest in the mid-1980s with
the takeovers of TV networks, including ABC and NBC, Dean Alger, author of the
1998 book "Megamedia," said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend accelerated in 1996 after Congress passed the Telecommunications
Act in an attempt to spur competition. Instead of making it easier for companies
to compete, the opposite has occurred, Alger said -- the big mergers that grew
out of the law means today's media are run increasingly by a dwindling number of
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   In his book -- subtitled "How Giant Corporations Dominate Mass Media,
Distort Competition, and Endanger Democracy -- Alger lists what he calls the
"dominant dozen" media conglomerates. Now updating the book for paperback
editions, Alger has just slashed the dozen to four: AOL/Time Warner; Disney/ABC;
Viacom/CBS and News Corp., the parent company of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concentration is getting more severe and the range of the diversity of
voices is clearly being constricted," Alger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect this trend to continue as other Internet companies look for
combinations with TV, film and news outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   With the AOL-Time Warner deal, the Internet, once considered the voice of
the little guy, has suddenly become a powerhouse player.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rise of the Internet was supposed to be the rise of the independent
voice," said Matthew Felling, media director of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs. "With the auditorium being filled with large bands, the guy playing his
clarinet is really going to get outshouted and is going to get completely
crowded out of the concert."
</P>
<P>
	   AOL might not write the news. But it channels news to its users. The
Internet portal may be more likely now to send the point-and-clickers toward CNN
and Time instead of MSBNC and Newsweek, media watchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts believe the quality of the news suffers when media worlds
collide.
</P>
<P>
	   "You need to have an independent voice that can keep an eye on powerful
interests," Rosentiel said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, ABC News killed a proposed "20/20" story about alleged security
problems at Disney World in Florida. Officials said the network's corporate
parent, Walt Disney Co., had no say in the decision, but others were critical.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Airs First Commercials  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking attention in his longshot bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. Orrin Hatch is airing a 28-minute commercial in
which he details a litany of Clinton administration missteps and controversies
and argues that it has been the ``most deceitful and corrupt in our nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first paid television time for Hatch, and his campaign is spending
$50,000 to air the ad twice each in Iowa and in New Hampshire. The Utah senator
has raised only about $2.3 million, a fraction of his competitors, and is mired
at the bottom of the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad features Hatch speaking directly to the camera, detailing one
controversy after another, beginning with Clinton's first year in office and
moving to the present. It adds up to 4,712 words.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, there's one issue he never mentions: Clinton's impeachment. In
fact, he makes no mention of sex whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
	   A cursory look at his ad might lead viewers to think Hatch was running
against Clinton, rather than Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and
other Republicans. But campaign aides said the Clinton years are important
because the fall race is likely to be against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president has certainly not repudiated the political approach and
tendencies of this administration,'' said Kevin McGuiness, Hatch's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ad, Hatch explains that he is forgoing the rising music and pretty
pictures of most advertisements in order to talk straight. And he says any real
discussion must start with what has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to get at what is bothering us, to find out why too many Americans
feel the country is on the wrong track and see what we can do to get our
national morale back to where it belongs,'' he says. It's impossible to move
ahead, he says, ``unless we air out what happened when the new (Clinton)
administration took office.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch makes just one reference to his GOP opponents, saying he is disturbed
that Bush and McCain are not discussing these issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of his time is spent detailing the Clinton years. First, he discusses
policy disagreements and says Clinton backed tax hikes rather than tax cuts,
offered a flawed crime bill, pushed a health care plan that put the government
in charge, vetoed welfare reform twice and delayed agreeing to a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch then goes into ethical issues: Misuse of federal agencies, illegal
campaign contributions, Chinese influence and missile technology transfers to
China.
</P>
<P>
	   He says the ``first step'' to moving ahead is ``telling the simple
unvarnished truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth I submit to you is this: that at the center of the crisis of
national morale and trust ... is probably the worst breach of faith with the
American people by a federal administration in our history, an administration
whose abuses of power have done grievous damage to the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch plans newspaper advertisements to publicize the upcoming broadcasts,
set for Wednesday and Thursday in New Hampshire and Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House had no comment. Gore's campaign said that despite Hatch's
complaints the American people are better off now than they were in 1992.
Spokeswoman Kathleen Begala said Gore is focused on issues that matter including
health care, education and keeping the economy strong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether he talks for two minutes or 28 minutes, he's not talking about the
issues people care about and Al Gore is,'' she said of Hatch.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Covering Up Cosmo Cover  </HEADLINE>
    By TERRY KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kroger, the nation's largest grocery chain, will cover up
Cosmopolitan magazine at checkout stands because of complaints about headlines
like "Sex Tricks He's Never Seen Before" and "20 Earth-Quaking Moves That Will
Make Him Plead for Mercy -- and Beg for More."
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Gary Rhodes said Tuesday that all of the company's stores are
installing racks this month that will cover up everything but the magazine's
name.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger operates 2,268 grocery stores and about 800 convenience stores in 31
states under the names Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers,
Dillon, Fry's, Food 4 Less and Quality Food Centers.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was hailed by Morality in Media, a New York organization that
has been pressuring the nation's supermarket chains to remove or cover magazines
with "lurid sexual content" from checkout aisles.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger said customers complained more about the words on the cover than
about the picture, which is usually of a woman with deep cleavage.
</P>
<P>
	   King Soopers, Colorado's biggest supermarket chain, will install the
blinders at all 81 stores this week, said Dave Savage, King Soopers vice
president for retail sales in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have had to pull Cosmo many times because the cover was not fit for the
checkout area," where children would see it, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
	   Magazine spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said Cosmopolitan has the highest
newsstand sales of any monthly magazine. About half of its 2 million issues are
bought at checkout counters, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She conceded that "Cosmo's not for everyone," but added that to her
knowledge, no supermarket chain has ever put its cover under wraps.
</P>
<P>
	   She refused to speculate on how Kroger's move would affect sales, but said
supermarket sales account for 70 percent of Cosmo's 1.2 million circulation.

<HEADLINE> Mom Who Killed Daughter Loses Son  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER ANDES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday awarded a white police officer
custody of a 3-year-old black boy whose mother admitted smothering her infant
daughter in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The case pitted supporters of Montgomery County Officer Laura Blankman, who
has cared for the toddler since he was 3 months old, against those who contended
a black child would fare better with a black biological parent who had turned
her life around.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County Circuit Judge Louise Scrivener also ruled that the boy,
Cornilous, must spend one night a week with his mother, LaTrena Pixley, 26. But
Pixley must continue with individual therapy and prove that she has food,
electricity, a working phone and $50 in cash before each visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The judge focused on the child's safety,'' said Blankman's attorney, Nancy
Poster.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling devastated Pixley, who is considering an appeal, said her
attorney, Ralph E. Hall Jr. ``She was so upset she had to leave work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's decision reversed an earlier ruling. In 1998, Circuit Court Judge
Michael D. Mason ruled the boy must be returned to his mother, focusing
attention on a Maryland law that protects the rights of biological parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland's Court of Special Appeals upheld Mason's ruling. But in February
1999, the state's highest court asked Mason to consider whether the boy was in
danger of abuse if returned to his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A parent, after all, has no right, fundamental or otherwise, to abuse or
neglect his or her children,'' Appeals Court Judge Alan Wilner wrote in the
15-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pixley pleaded guilty in March 1993 to second-degree murder after she
admitted smothering her daughter, Nakya Dannyell Scott, and dumping her body in
the trash.
</P>
<P>
	   Pixley was never sent to prison on that charge, however. A District of
Columbia Superior Court judge placed her on probation, saying she was suffering
from postpartum depression.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1996, shortly after Cornilous was born, Pixley was jailed for
violating her probation -- being charged with credit card fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   It was then that she asked Blankman, whom she had known from contacts with
the District of Columbia Public Defender's Office, to care for her son. A year
later Blankman filed for custody.
</P>
<P>
	   During custody proceedings, John B. Mealy, a court-ordered psychologist said
he believed there was a risk Pixley would neglect the child, but Joann Bragg,
Pixley's private therapist, testified Pixley is emotionally stable and ``ready
to resume parenting her son.''

<HEADLINE> Grants May Go To Firefighters' Kin  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The families of six Massachusetts firefighters who died
in a Dec. 3 warehouse blaze could each receive lump sum federal payments of
$146,000 by March, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The six Worcester Fire Department officers died trying to save homeless
people they believed were trapped inside the burning warehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   All six families applied last month for one-time financial awards provided
by the Justice Department's Public Safety Officers' Benefits program. The
program is designed to help survivors and families of federal, state and local
law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, ambulance
crew members and corrections officers who die or are permanently and totally
disabled in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureau of Justice Assistance spokeswoman Sheila Jerusalem said the families
applied Dec. 10, which began an information-gathering process that usually lasts
90 days. The department takes about two weeks to issue the checks after all
information is gathered, so ``they could get the money at the end of March,''
Ms. Jerusalem said. ``We'll be working on it as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fiscal 1999, which ended last Sept. 30, more than 200 families received
more than $29 million in death benefits under the program. The death benefit was
$143,000 last year. Another $800,000 in disability benefits was paid last year
to five public safety officers whose catastrophic personal injuries on duty left
them unable to work.
</P>
<P>
	   All benefits under the program are exempt from taxes and not subject to
attachment by creditors. Since the program began in 1977, more than 4,500
families have received death benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public safety officers face innumerable risks on a daily basis to ensure
the safety of our communities,'' said Nancy Gist, director of the Bureau of
Justice Assistance. ``As in the Worcester tragedy, when an officer or
firefighter loses his or her life or is permanently or totally disabled, the
family should not have its grief intensified with fears regarding how the family
will make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, the department amended the regulations governing another
benefit, the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents' Assistance program, to include
the families of state and local public safety officers. This program provides
money for the higher education of eligible survivors of officers killed or
permanently disabled in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
	   In fiscal 1999, this program paid more than $44,000 to eight families.
Full-time students are eligible to receive $404 a month, and part-time students
lesser amounts, to pay for tuition, room and board, books, supplies or fees.

<HEADLINE> Report: 10 Jury Verdicts At $9B  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Punitive damages made up nearly 90 percent of the Top 10
biggest jury verdicts awarded to individuals and families in 1999, reflecting
what legal experts said was an increasing comfort by jurors to use punitive
verdicts to punish negligence.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's Top 10 verdicts added to a stunning $8.86 billion -- three times
1998's total of $2.8 million -- and 12 times 1997's total of nearly $862
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that what jurors are doing that they didn't do before is they are
saying, `Let's regulate the industry. Let's send a message to the entire
industry that they're on notice,''' said Thomas Harrison, publisher of the
Boston-based Lawyers Weekly USA, which assembled the list.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual list of top jury awards included verdicts to individuals and
families and excluded class action lawsuits or litigation between corporations.
</P>
<P>
	   Punitive damages accounted for 88 percent of 1999's total, up significantly
from 1998 when they made up for 72 percent. In 1997, punitive damages were 68
percent of total verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards come as the controversy over whether punitive damages should be
capped continues. Following one of 1999's largest verdicts -- in which an
Alabama jury awarded $581 million to a rural family that claimed a bank and an
electronics company tried to gouge them out of $1,200 on the sale of two $1,100
satellite dishes in 1995 -- the Alabama Legislature passed a package of bills to
place limits on punitive damage verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996 Congress passed bills to limit punitive damages, saying the high
limits raised product prices and affected corporations' research and development
activities. President Clinton vetoed the bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest verdict on the 1999 list was awarded by a Los Angeles jury to a
group of six people severely burned when their 1979 Chevy Malibu was rear-ended
by a drunken driver and exploded into flames. General Motors Corporation was
ordered to pay $4.9 billion. Of that, $4.8 billion was punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. approves dumping of more dredged material off Sandy Hook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A New York heating-oil company won permission Tuesday
to dump up to 105,000 cubic yards of muck - enough to fill 35 Olympic-size
swimming pools - six miles off New Jersey in a decision that may launch
litigation and legislation.
<P>
	   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit that will allow Castle
Astoria Terminals of Queens, N.Y., to dredge its channel and dump the material
at the so-called Mud Dump. Environmentalists and some lawmakers say the material
is contaminated and that its dumping will violate a 1996 agreement to close the
dump site on the ocean floor six miles off Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
	   The window for dumping ends Jan. 15 to make way for fishing season, so the
project is unlikely to begin before October. Opponents say that gives them nine
months in which to challenge the project in the courts and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   A host of state and federal agencies signed off on the project, among them
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the
U.S. Coast Guard and the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, after reviewing
EPA tests of the Castle Astoria material, agreed the dumping does not violate
the 1996 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army Corps and EPA say tests show the Castle Astoria material is not
harmful to fish or humans. The Army Corps attached 22 conditions to the Castle
Astoria permit, including one that requires inspectors to ride along to make
sure dumping does not interfere with sea turtles and whales.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers and an environmental group protested nonetheless. Rep.
Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, and Sandy Hook-based Clean Ocean Action said they
will file a federal lawsuit in hopes of blocking the permit.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly, said the Army Corps and the EPA "have
opened the door to dumping oil and chemical-contaminated dredge spoils from New
York into the ocean off the Jersey Shore."
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the anger was focused on New York, which has been less active than
New Jersey in developing alternative disposal methods for material dredged from
ports.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York has an ignominious past of dumping on New Jersey, but it won't be
tolerated anymore," said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. "They can do their
dredging, but they can't cross into Jersey waters to dump the waste."
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, Saxton and Rep. Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville, all said they would
try to enact legislation by October to block the Castle Astoria dumping.
</P>
<P>
	   Other lawmakers came down in favor of the project. Rep. Robert Menendez,
D-Union City, applauded the decision as a "necessary step to keep the Port of
New York and New Jersey open."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, New York Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer wrote
the Army Corps to urge approval of the Castle Astoria application after more
than two years of consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Port of New York and New Jersey is a vital economic engine for the two
states, the region, and, indeed, the entire nation," the New York Democrats
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, after years of squabbling over a planned dredging of the ports of
New York and New Jersey, the White House, environmentalists, lawmakers, labor
leaders and port officials reached an agreement on the future of what is known
informally as the Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration proposed closing the dump one year later, after
one final use of the site to dispose of silt from a dredging of the ports.
</P>
<P>
	   Officially, the dump is now closed. Only clean material, as defined by the
government, can be dumped at the site, as a means to bury the material already
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Castle Astoria dispute marks the second time in recent months in which
the government's definition of "clean" has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey lawmakers sparred with the Army Corps last month over shipments
of muck dredged from the Brooklyn Marine Terminal. The EPA approved the project;
the lawmakers, along with Clean Ocean Action, objected.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, critics Pallone, Torricelli and Clean Ocean Action said the
material dredged from Castle Astoria's terminal is more contaminated than
material already at the Mud Dump.
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision flies in the face of vast public opinion and against the
commitments made by Vice President Al Gore and the administration to clean up
the ocean off our shore," said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean
Action.
</P>
<P>
	   But Peter Shugert, spokesman for the Army Corps in New York, said mud from
Castle Astoria is "cleaner than the material that's out there."

<HEADLINE> Allegations on Army Weapons Program  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials at the Army's chemical weapons incinerator in
Utah rigged tests and misled state regulators to conceal the plant's inability
to safely destroy nerve agents, the plant's former permit manager alleged
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Harris also said officials at Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility
knew residue from sarin -- a nerve agent also known as GB that kills by
constricting the lungs and halting breathing -- remained on weapons parts sent
to Du-Wald Steel Corp., a Denver scrap metal business, between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The incineration process itself should not be going on.'' Harris said.
``It is inherently dangerous. It does not destroy the (nerve) agent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harris said officials with the Army and the private contractor running the
incinerator threatened to fire him if he told state regulators or the public
about the safety problems, which he said could allow sarin to escape into the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Army and EG&AMP;G Defense Systems Inc., the contractor that
runs the plant, say the incinerator is safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army is investigating and ``is confident (Harris') allegations will be
proven untrue,'' said Greg Mahall, a spokesman for the Army's chemical weapons
destruction command in Aberdeen, Md.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We take the allegations seriously, of course,'' Mahall said. ``It doesn't
do us any good to let those go unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
	   EG&AMP;G declined to comment on the allegations. A manager at Du-Wald did not
return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris, who resigned from EG&AMP;G at the end of 1996, is the fifth former
official at the incinerator to allege environmental and safety problems. One of
them, Steve Jones, regained his post as the incinerator's chief safety officer
last year after federal courts ruled he had been illegally fired for criticizing
safety at the plant in 1994, when it still was under construction.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris first made his allegations in a sworn statement to the Chemical
Weapons Working Group, an organization asking Utah officials to overturn the
incinerator's state permit. The group also is suing in federal court to have the
incinerator shut down and opposes similar planned incinerators at military bases
in Alabama, Arkansas and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
	   The $600 million Tooele incinerator, about 50 miles west of Salt Lake City,
has been operating since 1996. It is the only chemical weapons incinerator in
the continental United States and was built to destroy nerve and blistering
agents stockpiled at the Army's Deseret Chemical Depot since World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   At the incinerator, bombs or containers filled with liquid sarin are
drained. The sarin is piped into a furnace and incinerated while the bombs and
containers are sent to another furnace to burn off any sarin residue.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris said incinerator officials, with the knowledge of Utah regulators,
rigged a test of the furnace designed to burn the residue. For the test,
officials cut in half a one-ton container and put a chemical stand-in for a
nerve agent on a platform to make sure it would burn, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not only was this a total sham, but the state regulators were well aware
of this and signed off as if everything was just perfect,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Downs, director of the Utah Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste,
denied his agency had any knowledge of a doctored test. Downs acknowledged some
munitions are burned before being completely drained of sarin, but denied that
creates a safety problem.

<HEADLINE> Whitman wants to grow high tech companies in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman wants to give Silicon Valley
a run for its money - with about $165 million worth of state, federal and
private dollars.
<P>
	   The governor, in the largest spending proposal of her sixth annual
State-of-the-State address, wants to pump $96 million in state funding into
efforts to lure and retain high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
	   She said those companies will provide good jobs, well into the new
millennium, for everyone from Ph.D.s to welfare moms.
</P>
<P>
	   "Promoting high technology is only a means to an end, and that end is jobs -
more jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs for all our families," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would be used for everything from making seed grants to startup
technology companies to updating the state's World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $96 million in state funds, Whitman plans to use $10
million in federal funds, recycle $3 million in welfare grants and draw $56
million from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan calls for $23 million to develop a "high-tech" workforce ready to
land these jobs, which typically pay more than those in many other sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   That includes $15 million for colleges and universities to prepare students
to work in the technology field. It also includes $3 million to train 1,000
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   Another $105 million would be used to help small and mid-sized high-tech
firms build their businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Of that, $40 million - $10 million in state money and $30 million in private
funding - would be offered as seed money to startup companies that have a hard
time raising venture capital. Startups could get anywhere from $200,000 to $2
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Another $5 million would double the number of "incubators" currently
available in New Jersey. These incubators provide startup firms with affordable
space and services to help them grow their business. There are currently seven
incubators in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Once those businesses grow, they will move into a $4 million
commercialization center planned for a new building at the North Brunswick
Technology Centre, which provides lab and office space for growing high-tech
firms. The proposal also calls for a $6 million technology center, a facility
where tech businesses can continue to expand. This would be built in South
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The third prong of the proposal calls for spending $37 million on updating
the state Web site and building systems that allow residents to do things like
register their cars and businesses online.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Uhlman, president of Lucent Technologies, said the proposal will help
New Jersey stay competitive in the lucrative and fast-paced technology field.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we stand still, we are going to fall behind," said Uhlman. "Other
states, in fact most states, have understood, as we have, the importance of
nurturing the high-technology economy, nurturing the businesses that are in the
state."
</P>
<P>
	   Others wonder whether the money is best spent on these programs, especially
since the state faces pressing funding problems, such as a multibillion-dollar
statewide school construction program and a transportation trust fund that will
run out of money this summer if new funding sources aren't identified.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to see that issue addressed as we go through the budget
process," said Sen. Richard Codey, D-Essex.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey currently competes pretty well in the high tech field, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is home to 25 of the fastest-growing high-tech firms in the nation and it
ranks third for average high-tech wages at $62,689.

<HEADLINE> GOP Accused of Closing Poll Booths  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK PRATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A state legislator says the Republican Party is
trying to hinder black voters' access to the polls by keeping some polling
places shut during its presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP, however, says the move only reflects the availability of poll
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans said last week they would use paper ballots and consolidate
some polling places for the party's Feb. 19 presidential primary because they
must rely on volunteers to run the election.
</P>
<P>
	   A complaint asking the Justice Department to investigate the GOP plan was
filed by state Rep. Todd Rutherford, a black Democrat. He said that in the 1996
primary, the Republicans did not operate ballot boxes in many predominantly
black precincts of downtown Columbia, while opening all polling places in
majority white precincts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cutting off access to the polls for people who live in my district is
disturbing,'' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican Chairman Henry McMaster called the complaint ``ridiculous''
and said the availability of volunteers and money is what determines which
polling places are opened.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP often gets little cooperation from Democrat-controlled county
election commissions in some areas, McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DeBartolo could not confirm whether
the complaint had been received but said officials were aware of the concerns
and would review them to ``determine what's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, political parties must pay for and run their own
primaries. Voters from all precincts can vote, but they must go to an open
polling site. And the primaries are open to all registered voters, not just
members of one party.
</P>
<P>
	   McMaster predicted that Democrats also won't be able to open all precincts
for their March 9 caucus and primary, which will select delegates to a
nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I presume Mr. Rutherford will file the same complaint against the
Democratic Party. No party has enough people to open all 1,800 precincts,''
McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutherford said he framed the complaint after talks with state Democratic
Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian and Gov. Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why don't they consolidate white suburban precincts?'' Harpootlian said.
``They don't do that because they know people go to vote at a certain place.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It demonstrates the Republican Party only wants white people to vote Feb.
19. This is politics of exclusion,'' Harpootlian said.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint was filed by lawyer A. Lee Parks Jr. of Atlanta, who said he
believed the GOP was making it more difficult for blacks to vote as Republicans,
including those who want to vote for black GOP presidential hopeful Alan Keyes.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Streisand Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Charges were dropped Tuesday against a tabloid
photographer who was arrested after Barbra Streisand and James Brolin complained
they were being stalked.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendal Wall, 28, who lives near the couple in Malibu, was arrested Saturday
and held on $1 million bail. He was freed after prosecutors found insufficient
evidence that Wall had stalked or threatened the couple.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Streisand and Brolin drove to a sheriff's station Saturday afternoon
and said Wall had been following them. Several hours later, the couple was
driving near their home when they spotted Wall again, allegedly following them,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   They flagged down a deputy and Wall was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   "They felt jeopardized. The police felt that sense of jeopardy was warranted
and they acted accordingly," said Dick Guttman, Miss Streisand's publicist.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the jail Tuesday, several people supporting Wall carried placards
and chanted "Free Wendal."
</P>
<P>
	   As Wall emerged, he clutched an evaluation from the district attorney's
office. "This says that I didn't break the law and she had me arrested for no
apparent reason," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants $850M for AmeriCorps  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration proposed Tuesday to spend more
money on promotion and recruitment for the AmeriCorps program and to support
other civic service.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1,
will include $850 million for national service efforts -- $120 million more than
the last budget, the White House announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the new money, $73 million would go to AmeriCorps to help recruit
members. AmeriCorps, which Clinton founded early in his administration, hopes to
reach 62,000 participants by next year. The president wants to see the program
grow to 100,000 participants by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone who serves is a catalyst for change,'' Clinton said in a
statement issued in Arizona, where Clinton announced new national monuments
designations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The initiatives I am announcing today will help more Americans share in
the power and promise of community service,'' Clinton added. ``I look forward to
working with Congress to ensure their enactment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress have tried repeatedly to kill AmeriCorps, despite
its popularity with governors and other officials in their party. Clinton
celebrated the organization's fifth birthday in October with a gala party at the
White House and declared that most of the partisan rancor had dissipated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After years of fights over funding and purpose in AmeriCorps, peace is
breaking out all over in Washington,'' Clinton said then.
</P>
<P>
	   After five years, 150,000 people have taken part in AmeriCorps, essentially
an at-home version of the Peace Corps. Participants spend a year doing things
such as building houses for the poor or teaching children to read in exchange
for a few thousand dollars to pay for college or student loans.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriCorps is among several initiatives that the White House considers part
of Clinton's presidential legacy. The current class has 40,000 participants, the
largest ever. Clinton asked for $546 million for AmeriCorps in fiscal 2000, but
the House voted to eliminate it. A compromise was reached with the Senate to
fund AmeriCorps at $439 million, a $3 million increase over fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris Wofford, head of the Corporation for National Service, which oversees
AmeriCorps, welcomed the Clinton budget package. ``A time of prosperity must
also be a time of patriotism and service,'' Wofford said.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration budget also proposes:
</P>
<P>
	   --Adding $9 million to the amount spent to encourage and support
volunteering by older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   --Spending $5 million to create an ``AmeriCorps reserve'' system of former
participants who can return to active duty when needed.
</P>
<P>
	   --Giving $7.5 million to America's Promise, the youth health, education and
mentoring program founded by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   --Spending $5 million on ``community coaches,'' a program that places
AmeriCorps members, teachers and counselors in schools to promote volunteering
and links to civic organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   --Spending $3 million for new ``youth empowerment grants,'' competitive
fellowships for young people with ideas to improve their communities including
anti-violence and mentoring programs.

<HEADLINE> Generic Version of Prozac Launched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A British drugmaker has launched a generic version of
Prozac, a move some analysts say could claim more than half of Eli Lilly and
Co.'s annual Prozac sales in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bioglan Pharma PLC launched sales Monday, the first business day after
Lilly's Prozac patent expired in Britain and a few other European countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Though 80 percent of Indianapolis-based Lilly's Prozac sales are in the
United States, the emergence of generic versions of the best-selling
antidepressant in Europe is a precursor to a bigger threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Lilly's two key U.S. patents for Prozac expire in 2001 and 2003. Lilly
depends heavily on Prozac, which made up 30 percent of the company's $9.24
billion in sales in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Bioglan, which specializes in skin-care products, said it is selling generic
Prozac in 20-milligram capsules, the same dosage as Lilly sells most of its
Prozac. Even more companies are expected to join in with their own generic
Prozac products.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'll see a fairly large piece of the Prozac franchise erode" in Europe,
said Jeffrey Chaffkin, a pharmaceutical analyst at PaineWebber in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaffkin said Monday that within a year, generics could claim more than half
of Lilly's annual Prozac sales in Britain of about $155 million.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Covering Up Cosmo Cover  </HEADLINE>
    By TERRY KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kroger, the nation's largest grocery chain, will cover up
Cosmopolitan magazine at checkout stands because of complaints about headlines
like "Sex Tricks He's Never Seen Before" and "20 Earth-Quaking Moves That Will
Make Him Plead for Mercy -- and Beg for More."
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Gary Rhodes said Tuesday that all of the company's stores are
installing racks this month that will cover up everything but the magazine's
name.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger operates 2,268 grocery stores and about 800 convenience stores in 31
states under the names Kroger, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers,
Dillon, Fry's, Food 4 Less and Quality Food Centers.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was hailed by Morality in Media, a New York organization that
has been pressuring the nation's supermarket chains to remove or cover magazines
with "lurid sexual content" from checkout aisles.
</P>
<P>
	   Kroger said customers complained more about the words on the cover than
about the picture, which is usually of a woman with deep cleavage.
</P>
<P>
	   King Soopers, Colorado's biggest supermarket chain, will install the
blinders at all 81 stores this week, said Dave Savage, King Soopers vice
president for retail sales in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have had to pull Cosmo many times because the cover was not fit for the
checkout area," where children would see it, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
	   Magazine spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said Cosmopolitan has the highest
newsstand sales of any monthly magazine. About half of its 2 million issues are
bought at checkout counters, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She conceded that "Cosmo's not for everyone," but added that to her
knowledge, no supermarket chain has ever put its cover under wraps.
</P>
<P>
	   She refused to speculate on how Kroger's move would affect sales, but said
supermarket sales account for 70 percent of Cosmo's 1.2 million circulation.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid To Delay Financial Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. said Tuesday it would delay release of
several scheduled financial reports until July, as the company seeks to regroup
from a year of accounting questions and a new management team.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's third largest pharmacy chain said it had reached agreement with
its lenders on the delay and planned to seek extensions on Securities and
Exchange Commission filings for the remaining quarterly and annual reports for
fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's third quarter report for the period ending Nov. 27 was due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe it's a responsible action to take," said vice president Karen
Rugen. "We've had a new management team for a month, we've had new auditors for
just a few weeks, and with all the delays with the reaudit of '97, '98 and '99,
we realized we didn't have enough time."
</P>
<P>
	   The company has been trying to recover after financial woes sent the
company's stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. Former top executive
Martin L. Grass was ousted in October, and a new team led by CEO Robert Miller
has pledged to improve profitability with stricter financial controls and
strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid also has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings
for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Rite Aid's move Tuesday was met with some skepticism by analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   "The move tells me that the problems run pretty deep and that there is no
easy solution to remedying the problems with Rite Aid's former internal
accounting methodologies," said Steven Valiquette of Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
	   "It takes the wind out of their sails in the short term, to the extent the
company had some momentum after announcement of its new management team," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Ransom of Raymond James &AMP; Associates agreed, citing figures on Rite
Aid's same-store sales released Tuesday showing a 5.9 percent increase, a poor
performance compared to the double-digit growth of Walgreen's and CVS, he said.
Same-store comparisons measure sales growth excluding the impact of newly opened
stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the double whammy of weak December sales and a likely black hole of
information doesn't help," he said. "I doubt any investors are betting on a
quick and easy turnaround."
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's announcement came late Tuesday, after the close of markets. Rite
Aid's shares were trading at $10.62 1/2, down 1 percent from Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Battle Via E-Mail  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential campaigns of Democrats Al Gore and Bill
Bradley gave new meaning Tuesday to the idea of a virtual stalemate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign designated it as ``Let Congress Know'' day and, via
e-mail, encouraged supporters to ``reach out to your member of Congress and ask
them to support Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``With hundreds of supporters calling on the same day, we will be making a
strong statement about the support for Bill Bradley at the grassroots level,''
read one e-mail distributed by Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign got a hold of Bradley's e-mail and responded in kind, asking
its supporters to place calls as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley has designated January 11, 2000 'Let Congress Know Day' -- so
that's exactly what we want you to do,'' wrote the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign reacted with a follow-up message: ``The Gore campaign got
wind of our program and in turn put together an e-mail to their supporters to
try and counter our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign forwarded that Bradley message to Gore supporters with a new
note of encouragement: ``The Bradley folks are nervous and are now re-energizing
their efforts as evidenced in their attached e-mail. So, keep up the good
work!''
</P>
<P>
	   Whether anybody won new support in Congress was hard to say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Peter DeFazio's district office in Eugene, Ore., reported receiving two
faxes, a phone call, an e-mail and a letter, all supporting Bradley. DeFazio has
not endorsed either Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Democratic House offices, randomly contacted, said they had noticed
little surge in calls, letters or faxes about the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic members of Congress are important not just for endorsements, but
because they are ``superdelegates'' to the party convention. Bradley has a big
game of catch-up ahead: Gore has been endorsed by 134 Democratic House members
and 27 senators; Bradley has the declared support of six House members and three
senators.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Airing Anti-Abortion Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appealing to Iowa conservatives, Steve Forbes is airing a
new ad on abortion one day after he criticized front-runner George W. Bush on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad, which was airing Tuesday in Iowa, features three women, one of whom
talks about what she felt when she saw her fetus on ultrasound. ``I mean, there
was my tiny child's heart beating, arms waving,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Another woman says: ``I mean, just because someone doesn't want them,
doesn't mean that these children aren't still alive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes ends the ad, his first on abortion, by saying: ``I want to protect
the rights of all Americans, including the unborn, but I need your support to
make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   When he ran in 1996, Forbes' campaign views on abortion were considerably
more moderate. This year, as he has sought votes from religious conservatives
and tried to broaden his message beyond the flat tax, he has adopted a hard-line
anti-abortion stand.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Republican debate Monday, Forbes challenged Bush to promise that if he
is the GOP nominee he will pick an anti-abortion running mate, appoint only
anti-abortion judges and preserve the anti-abortion plank in the Republican
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush declined all on three fronts.

<P>
	   ``I'm going to pick a vice president who can be the president. I'll pick
judges who strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench ... to
legislate. And I will ... work to keep the Republican Party pro-life,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes called that response ``a typical hedge'' and said, ``We need
something specific.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, looking ahead to the general election, doesn't want to alienate the
moderate voters he will need if he's the GOP nominee. Forbes, trying to break
through, is courting conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The new ad does not mention Bush, or any other candidate, by name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It demonstrates Forbes' commitment to the pro-life cause,'' said Keith
Appell, a Forbes spokesman. ``He will use the bully pulpit to advance this issue
forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes campaign officials said the ad would run across Iowa in a
``substantial buy.'' An official from a rival campaign said Forbes was spending
enough so that the typical viewer would see the abortion ad five times over the
next week. Forbes also is airing another ad, attacking Bush on taxes, which will
air about the same number of times.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, that would cost the Forbes campaign about $140,000.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Airs First TV Commercials  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking attention in his longshot bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. Orrin Hatch is airing a 28-minute commercial in
which he details a litany of Clinton administration missteps and controversies
and argues that it has been the ``most deceitful and corrupt in our nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first paid television time for Hatch, and his campaign is spending
$50,000 to air the ad twice each in Iowa and in New Hampshire. The Utah senator
has raised only about $2.3 million, a fraction of his competitors, and is mired
at the bottom of the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad features Hatch speaking directly to the camera, detailing one
controversy after another, beginning with Clinton's first year in office and
moving to the present. It adds up to more than 4,700 words.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, there's one issue he never mentions: Clinton's impeachment. In
fact, he makes no mention of sex whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
	   A cursory look at his ad might lead viewers to think Hatch was running
against Clinton, rather than Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and
other Republicans. But campaign aides said the Clinton years are important
because the fall race is likely to be against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president has certainly not repudiated the political approach and
tendencies of this administration,'' said Kevin McGuiness, Hatch's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ad, Hatch explains that he is forgoing the rising music and pretty
pictures of most advertisements in order to talk straight. And he says any real
discussion must start with what has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to get at what is bothering us, to find out why too many Americans
feel the country is on the wrong track and see what we can do to get our
national morale back to where it belongs,'' he says. It's impossible to move
ahead, he says, ``unless we air out what happened when the new (Clinton)
administration took office.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch makes just one reference to his GOP opponents, saying he is disturbed
that Bush and McCain are not discussing these issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of his time is spent detailing the Clinton years. First, he discusses
policy disagreements and says Clinton backed tax hikes rather than tax cuts,
offered a flawed crime bill, pushed a health care plan that put the government
in charge, vetoed welfare reform twice and delayed agreeing to a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch then goes into ethical issues: Misuse of federal agencies, illegal
campaign contributions, Chinese influence and missile technology transfers to
China.
</P>
<P>
	   He says the ``first step'' to moving ahead is ``telling the simple
unvarnished truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth I submit to you is this: that at the center of the crisis of
national morale and trust ... is probably the worst breach of faith with the
American people by a federal administration in our history, an administration
whose abuses of power have done grievous damage to the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch plans newspaper advertisements to publicize the upcoming broadcasts,
set for Wednesday and Thursday in New Hampshire and Saturday in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House had no comment. Gore's campaign said that despite Hatch's
complaints the American people are better off now than they were in 1992.
Spokeswoman Kathleen Begala said Gore is focused on issues that matter including
health care, education and keeping the economy strong.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether he talks for two minutes or 28 minutes, he's not talking about the
issues people care about and Al Gore is,'' she said of Hatch.

<HEADLINE> More Police Urged for Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEF FEDERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Although violence is declining in Kosovo, the Serb
province remains extremely dangerous for ethnic minorities and desperately needs
more international police, a senior United Nations official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, speaking at a press briefing on condition of anonymity, said
the level of violence has declined by ``orders of magnitude'' since a NATO-led
peacekeeping operation entered Kosovo in June.
</P>
<P>
	   The international troops, coupled with a U.N.-led civilian administration,
moved into Kosovo after a 78-day NATO air campaign ended an 18-month crackdown
on the province's ethnic Albanian majority and forced Yugoslav troops out of the
province.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Yugoslav forces left, many ethnic Albanians attacked Kosovo's
Serbs and other minorities in retaliation for the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
	   While there were 40 to 50 major ethnic crimes, many of them murders, each
week when the peacekeepers arrived, the number has gradually decreased to three
to five major crimes a week, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   And while tens of thousands of Serbs fled Kosovo to other parts of Serbia in
the first weeks of the peacekeeping operation, the exodus has stopped and small
numbers of Serbs have actually returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official attributed the decline in violence to the arrival of NATO
troops and United Nations police, the migration of small Serbian communities to
larger, more secure villages, as well as a cooling of tempers with the passage
of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is still very dangerous to be a minority,'' the official stressed.
``What crime there is focuses disproportionately on ethnic minorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and the republic of
Montenegro, disputed U.N. claims of improved security, saying the province's
Serb minority remains in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Belgrade's U.N. envoy Vladislav
Jovanovic criticized a report last month by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that ``good progress'' had been made by NATO and the U.N. Mission in Kosovo in
disarming ethnic Albanian fighters and establishing civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The report gives cause for one overarching concern: the apparent
contradiction between the claim that UNMIK has made progress and the facts
presented almost throughout the report testifying that the Serbs and other
non-Albanians are threatened and that their human rights are being violated,''
Jovanovic wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the move by many Serbs into secure enclaves amounted to ``an
obnoxious practice of ghettoization'' that was a ``disgrace to the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the delicate security situation, Annan has requested about 4,000
international police for Kosovo. Currently, less than half that number are
serving there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It simply is not enough to provide the necessary security coverage for all
of Kosovo in a period of such continuing tension,'' the U.N. official said. U.N.
officials made an urgent request to the Security Council on Tuesday for more
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has agreed to double its police contingent to more than 400, while
the United States had pledged to raise its contribution from 400 to 500, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman pitches high-tech advances, environmental improvements in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman took a look at New Jersey's
future through the eyes of a newborn on Tuesday, saying the state must do more
to encourage a high-tech economy, improve education and protect the environment
for its next generation of residents.
<P>
	   The governor, heading into her final two years in Trenton, used her sixth
State of the State address to pitch a high-technology initiative that would
commit $96 million in state funds to lure new companies, aid colleges and train
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   She also called for environmental initiatives to target development in
cities and for increases in aid to the elderly and early childhood education.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman showed photos of four infants who were born on Jan. 1 - just after
the Y2K computer glitch-free dawn of the millennium - and urged lawmakers to
plan for the babies' future. Throughout her speech, she referred to the kind of
life they will lead if today's leaders do their job.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I enter the second half of my second term as governor, I want to
continue strengthening New Jersey in four key areas: expanding the economy,
improving education, protecting the environment and serving the elderly,"
Whitman said in a 47-minute speech interrupted 39 times by applause. "Making
progress on these ... will make a better life for the four children you just met
and for all the New Jersey children who will call the 21st century their own."
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor, who last year abandoned a six-month U.S. Senate
effort that would have placed her on the campaign trail this year, told a joint
session of the state Legislature that she wants to "make sure prosperity
continues here in New Jersey long after this administration has completed its
work."
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come too far to see these accomplishments slip away because we rested
on our laurels," Whitman said. "The people of our state deserve a governor who
approaches the last two years of her tenure as if they were the first."
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said the speech touched on important problems for New Jersey,
but Democrats said the governor avoided discussing many of the past year's more
controversial issues, including allegations of State Police racial profiling and
the long lines at state auto inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's biggest proposal is a $165 million effort to encourage even more
high technology companies to settle in New Jersey. Her proposal would commit $96
million in state funds, recycle $3 million in welfare grants, use $10 million in
federal aid and draw $56 million from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
	   "Promoting high technology is only a means to an end, and that end is jobs -
more jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs for all our families," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan includes grants to boost worker training - including training for
those attempting to get off welfare. It aims to garner federal technology grants
for colleges and help small high-tech businesses get a start. Whitman also wants
to set up "cyberdistricts" in cities to target specific areas for high-tech
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Alluding to her plan to preserve what remains of New Jersey's open space,
the governor said she'd like to target more business and development in the
cities. She proposed another $15 million to encourage cities to clean up sites
that can be developed for industry, and $3 million to preserve water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Whitman ordered the Department of Environmental Protection to
use stricter standards in reviewing requests for new sewer plants to make sure
they don't harm an entire region's environment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Saving land will help," said Whitman. "But it's just as important to
recognize that where we put sewers, roads and new buildings can affect an entire
watershed. ... (New) rules will encourage development where sewers and roads
exist or can be built without harming the environment."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman wants to spend $69 million more on public preschool programs in poor
districts to eventually provide full-day, full-year preschool to about 33,000
young students. The state is under court order to provide dollars for the
preschools, and critics say it is not doing an adequate job. The state Supreme
Court is reviewing current efforts to decide if the state is meeting the court's
mandates.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said she wants to give new teachers additional mentoring from a
veteran educator during their first two years in the classroom. The state would
pay for the mentors' time, which would cost between $1,350 and $1,750 per
teacher. Currently, new teachers get a mentor for one year.
</P>
<P>
	   And she proposed more emphasis on character education for students.
</P>
<P>
	   "With so many horrible stories about youth violence in the news, we have to
renew our efforts to teach our kids values like respect and responsibility,
decency and civility," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also gave a bonus to state workers: two paid hours off per
month to volunteer at their children's school.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor used the speech to nudge Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and
Senate President Donald DiFrancesco to end their dispute over the
multibillion-dollar question of school construction and reach an agreement on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "The clock is ticking and too many schools are crumbling," Whitman said. "So
let's do it. Let's enact a funding plan that gives our children the safe and
sturdy schools they deserve."
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and DiFrancesco vowed that they will eventually get an accord on
school construction. DiFrancesco said he believed Whitman's environmental
initiatives are important.
</P>
<P>
	   "Drinking water, the open space issue ... I think those are important issues
for the future," DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats said they were intrigued by what Whitman left out of the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "She didn't discuss the transportation trust fund, (racial) profiling, auto
emissions and property taxes," said Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph Doria.
"She gave a bow to school construction but she didn't give any details. It was a
good speech, but it didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, however, said lawmakers all know about those other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I think she was trying to do today was say, 'Hey, look at these other
things in there,"' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Accused of Closing Poll Booths  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK PRATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A state legislator says the Republican Party is
trying to hinder black voters' access to the polls by keeping some polling
places shut during its presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP, however, says the move only reflects the availability of poll
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republicans said last week they would use paper ballots and consolidate
some polling places for the party's Feb. 19 presidential primary because they
must rely on volunteers to run the election.
</P>
<P>
	   A complaint asking the Justice Department to investigate the GOP plan was
filed by state Rep. Todd Rutherford, a black Democrat. He said that in the 1996
primary, the Republicans did not operate ballot boxes in many predominantly
black precincts of downtown Columbia, while opening all polling places in
majority white precincts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cutting off access to the polls for people who live in my district is
disturbing,'' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican Chairman Henry McMaster called the complaint ``ridiculous''
and said the availability of volunteers and money is what determines which
polling places are opened.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP often gets little cooperation from Democrat-controlled county
election commissions in some areas, McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine DeBartolo said the complaint had
been received and that officials would review it to ``determine what's
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, political parties must pay for and run their own
primaries. Voters from all precincts can vote, but they must go to an open
polling site. And the primaries are open to all registered voters, not just
members of one party.
</P>
<P>
	   McMaster predicted that Democrats also won't be able to open all precincts
for their March 9 caucus and primary, which will select delegates to a
nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I presume Mr. Rutherford will file the same complaint against the
Democratic Party. No party has enough people to open all 1,800 precincts,''
McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutherford said he framed the complaint after talks with state Democratic
Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian and Gov. Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why don't they consolidate white suburban precincts?'' Harpootlian said.
``They don't do that because they know people go to vote at a certain place.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It demonstrates the Republican Party only wants white people to vote Feb.
19. This is politics of exclusion,'' Harpootlian said.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint was filed by lawyer A. Lee Parks Jr. of Atlanta, who said he
believed the GOP was making it more difficult for blacks to vote as Republicans,
including those who want to vote for black GOP presidential hopeful Alan Keyes.

<HEADLINE> Were Bonfire Log Ropes Removed?  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS FLETCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Four stabilizing ropes were cut on the stack
of Texas A&AMP;M bonfire logs just hours before they collapsed and killed 12, a
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   But a senior who helped build the bonfire last year said Tuesday that the
cutting of the lines was a standard procedure and probably did not cause the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Keegan visited the site of the 7,000-log stack about an hour before
the disaster, which killed a dozen of his fellow Aggies and injured 27 on Nov.
18.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower four of eight guy lines stretching from perimeter poles to the
center pole -- the spine of the stack -- had been cut a few hours earlier,
according to an engineering firm's report released by the school Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Keegan said the lower lines, attached about 10 feet below the top of the
center pole, are cut each year as the bonfire nears completion. The upper lines
remain anchored at the top of the center pole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's a normal part of construction. It's done every year,'' said Keegan,
who has participated in the school tradition annually since he was a freshman.
``I don't think that was a contributing factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the four cut ropes probably could not have kept the structure
upright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once a million tons of logs starts to move some heavy duty ropes aren't
gonna stop that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keegan, an applied mathematics major, has previously studied the guy lines
and center pole. A computer analysis he performed of photos taken before the
collapse received widespread media attention last month. He determined then that
the stack was leaning, citing slack in the guy lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also indicates that the first log tier of the stack seemed to be
leaning. Engineers analyzed photographs taken by a witness daily between Nov. 6
and the day prior to the accident, along with scores of other photographs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The second, third and fourth stacks appear to be parallel to the center
pole. The lean in the first layer becomes more apparent as the bonfire stack
approached Nov. 17,'' according to the report by Rogers Engineering Services, a
College Station firm called by in by A&AMP;M officials immediately after the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of a five-member, independent commission appointed by the
university to investigate the accident, Leo Linbeck Jr., said the report will be
reviewed.

<HEADLINE> More Input Offered on Trade Issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, which watched as thousands
protested against U.S. trade policies in Seattle last month, pledged on Tuesday
to provide more opportunities for environmental, labor and consumer
organizations to offer advice on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary William
Daley said in a joint statement that their two agencies would solicit views from
interested parties on ways they can obtain a greater range of views in
formulating trade policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We welcome ideas from interested parties, including our existing advisory
committees, on how we might improve our procedures for securing advice,''
Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   An effort by 135 nations to launch a new round of global trade talks in
Seattle last month ended in failure as thousands of protesters argued that the
World Trade Organization was ignoring their pleas to take environmental and
labor concerns into account when negotiating new trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a federal district court in Seattle ordered the trade
representative and the Commerce Department to include qualified environmental
representatives on two existing industry advisory committees.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement Tuesday said the two agencies would comply with that ruling
while it is being appealed by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Daley said that the court's ruling, ``if allowed to stand, could undermine
the framework Congress has established'' for officials to receive trade
negotiating advice from U.S. industries.

   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- First, Wisconsin residents discarded their sales tax
rebate checks because the postcard covers looked like junk mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the postcards' claim that ``It's Your Money!'' may be a lie.
</P>
<P>
	   Norwest Bank, which mailed 2.5 million rebate checks starting last week,

was set up to handle calls from people who may have thrown away the checks
because of their deceptive postcard appearance, Zeuske said.

taxpayers who received the wrong checks and will send a letter containing an

<HEADLINE> Grants May Go To Firefighters' Kin  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The families of six Massachusetts firefighters who died
in a Dec. 3 warehouse blaze could each receive lump sum federal payments of
$146,000 by March, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Worcester Fire Department officers died after two went into the burning
warehouse to look for homeless people they believed may have been trapped
inside. The four others were members of a rescue party sent in to find their
comrades.
</P>
<P>
	   All six families applied last month for one-time financial awards provided
by the Justice Department's Public Safety Officers' Benefits program. The
program is designed to help survivors and families of federal, state and local
law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, ambulance
crew members and corrections officers who die or are permanently and totally
disabled in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureau of Justice Assistance spokeswoman Sheila Jerusalem said the families
applied Dec. 10, which began an information-gathering process that usually lasts
90 days. The department takes about two weeks to issue the checks after all
information is gathered, so ``they could get the money at the end of March,''
Ms. Jerusalem said. ``We'll be working on it as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fiscal 1999, which ended last Sept. 30, more than 200 families received
more than $29 million in death benefits under the program. The death benefit was
$143,000 last year. Another $800,000 in disability benefits was paid last year
to five public safety officers whose catastrophic personal injuries on duty left
them unable to work.
</P>
<P>
	   All benefits under the program are exempt from taxes and not subject to
attachment by creditors. Since the program began in 1977, more than 4,500
families have received death benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public safety officers face innumerable risks on a daily basis to ensure
the safety of our communities,'' said Nancy Gist, director of the Bureau of
Justice Assistance. ``As in the Worcester tragedy, when an officer or
firefighter loses his or her life or is permanently or totally disabled, the
family should not have its grief intensified with fears regarding how the family
will make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, the department amended the regulations governing another
benefit, the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents' Assistance program, to include
the families of state and local public safety officers. This program provides
money for the higher education of eligible survivors of officers killed or
permanently disabled in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
	   In fiscal 1999, this program paid more than $44,000 to eight families.
Full-time students are eligible to receive $404 a month, and part-time students
lesser amounts, to pay for tuition, room and board, books, supplies or fees.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Victims Exhumed from Graves  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LABUKOE, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. investigators exhumed two mass graves in
East Timor on Tuesday and found the bodies of eight people who were likely
killed months before the province voted to break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators had expected to find the remains of 18 East Timorese who
were executed by Indonesian-allied militiamen. But only eight bodies were
recovered before heavy rain suspended the work, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they saw at least another 10 bodies in the graves, located at
Lauboke village, 40 miles west of Dili. Locals said they buried the bodies after
they were dumped by militia in the village.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-independence militia violence both before and after the U.N.-sponsored
ballot in August left East Timor devastated. At least 200 bodies have been
recovered since international peacekeepers were deployed in September to restore
law and order.
</P>
<P>
	   One grave is said to contain the bodies of seven independence supporters who
were killed on April 5, when militiamen stormed a church in nearby Liquica. The
other grave is thought to hold 11 victims of an April 17 attack on the Dili home
of prominent independence campaigner Manuel Carrascalao.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping relatives of the dead were at the graves to witness the exhumations.
</P>
<P>
	   One man, Florindo de Jesus, identified one of the bodies as that of his
brother Alberto, who was killed by militia at the Carrascalao house. Florindo
said he was also at the house on the night of the massacre, but escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I jumped over the fence, but the militiamen were there. They cut me with
machetes,'' said de Jesus, who has deep scars on his arms, back and legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidney Jones, of the U.N. human rights team carrying out the exhumations,
said the bodies were badly mutilated and showed signs of torture and execution.
</P>
<P>
	   One male victim had his hands tied behind his back, a bullet wound in the
chest and multiple skull fractures, apparently from several heavy blows.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan began reviewing a human
rights report Tuesday on atrocities committed in East Timor and plans to make
recommendations for further action, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, three U.N. experts have recommended the Security Council establish
an international war crimes tribunal for East Timor unless Indonesia acts
quickly to investigate the involvement of its military in the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The separate human rights investigation was authorized in September by the
Geneva-based U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The organization called on Annan
to establish an international commission of inquiry to gather information on
possible human rights violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, gang warfare has broken out in East Timor's second-largest city,
posing a challenge to U.N. authority, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   For two weeks, gangs of youths have fought pitched battles for control of
the streets in Baucau, 70 miles west of the capital, Dili, said Sergey Lashin,
chief of the U.N. police force in East Timor. Several people have been injured,
Lashin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said one of the gangs had links to the pro-Indonesia movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor, which is
preparing the territory for eventual self-government, fear the clashes could
lead to widespread criminal violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergio Vieira de Mello, who heads the U.N. mission, said political
allegiances were not motivating the violence. Instead, he said, poverty and
unemployment were leading people toward crime.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Declared Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand
trial, the government announced Tuesday, opening the possibility that the former
Chilean dictator could win his battle against extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said a medical team who examined Pinochet on Jan. 5
unanimously agreed that he was too ill to face trial for alleged human rights
abuses, ``and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt he should not allow
Pinochet to be extradited. But it said he would not make a decision until
hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement did not go beyond declaring Pinochet unfit, saying that
details of his condition were disclosed to the former Chilean leader but kept
``confidential'' otherwise. However, The Sunday Times reported in London last
weekend that the doctors had found Pinochet was suffering from a viral
infection, diabetes, heart disease and the effects of two mild strokes. His
diabetes reportedly has caused a loss of sensation in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could lead to Pinochet's release on humanitarian grounds,
halting efforts to try him in connection with the disappearances and killings of
thousands of Chileans during his 17-year rule there.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement read that Straw ``is minded ... to take the view that no
purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and
that he should therefore decide not to extradite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said Straw would hear arguments from Spain and other
parties to the case before making a final decision. Human rights groups
including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also have been invited to
submit comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The news was greeted with protest and support in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Organization of Relatives of Missing Detainees, a group
dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the Pinochet
dictatorship, said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous frustration and sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated,'' said Mireya Garcia, vice president of the organization. ``We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel, a close aide to Pinochet, said, ``this
is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process starts to
restore its sovereignty and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congressman Alberto Cardemil, also a close associate of Pinochet, called the
British decision ``a victory for a national cause, a cause of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Spain, foreign ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez Villanueva said the
government did not plan to intervene in the judicial process and would continue
``to respect the decisions coming from the British government.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate word from Judge Baltazar Garzon, whose arrest order
resulted in Pinochet's detention nearly 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Enrique Santiago said he would request that the Spanish National
Court ask British prosecutors for a new medical examination if Britain releases
him on humanitarian grounds. Attorney Carlos Slepoy called the medical team's
report ``a big error which does a lot of harm to the human rights cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention in Britain since his
arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was arrested on a Spanish
warrant for alleged human rights violations committed during his rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's medical exam was done at the Chilean government's request. The
general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric specialists during a
seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, mainly Chileans but also some Spaniards, were killed or
disappeared after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight against being
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited. A hearing is scheduled to begin March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw can consider Pinochet's health in making a final ruling. But even if
he were to agree to release the general due to health concerns, Spain could
appeal that ruling, further prolonging the general's stay in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet also faces more than 50 individual lawsuits in Chilean courts,
which the government has said he should face if he returns. The government has
never pressed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of Pinochet's most forthright
supporters, said Tuesday: ``I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a
very fair man.''

McCain Plan Offers Savings Accounts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain today outlined a five-year, $237 billion tax
relief plan that also would set aside more than $700 billion to protect Social
Security and create new all-purpose tax-free saving accounts for the middle
class. In a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Concord, N.H., McCain suggested
it would be irresponsible to use most of projected budget surpluses to cut taxes
-- as Republican presidential rival George W. Bush would do -- without planning
for the retirement of the big baby boom generation, which will push Social
Security toward insolvency.

million more than the last budget, the White House announced. Of the new money,
$73 million would go to AmeriCorps to help recruit members. After five years,
150,000 people have taken part in AmeriCorps, essentially an at-home version of
the Peace Corps.

a hospital the day after Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of Columbine Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN ELLIOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A Florida teen pleaded innocent Tuesday to making an online
threat against Columbine High School, and his lawyer said the youth's judgment
was impaired by ``Internet intoxication.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Ian Campbell, 18, of Cape Coral, Fla., is accused of using America
Online's instant message system to tell a Columbine student that he would
``finish what begun'' at the school last April, when 12 students and a teacher
were shot to death by two teen-age gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer Ellis Rubin told reporters that Campbell was intoxicated by the
Internet to the point of being hypnotized when he made the threat against
Columbine last month. Rubin said Campbell meant no harm.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Denver set the trial for Feb. 28, but Rubin said he will
seek a change of venue because of the massacre's notoriety. Campbell remains
free on a $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Transmitting threatening communications is a felony. If convicted, Campbell
could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $250,000.
</P>
<P>
	   An FBI agent in Florida has said Campbell confessed to making the threat
when agents questioned him.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat led Columbine administrators to cancel two days of school. The
student who received the message also transferred to another school.

	   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco also
used their opening-day speeches to begin positioning themselves for a possible
gubernatorial campaign in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, R-Salem, showed no signs of reversing an independent streak that
saw him part ways last year with Gov. Christie Whitman and the state Supreme
Court over how much money should be spent on new schools in poor cities.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not be forgotten as a branch of government," he vowed. "I will not,
nor will my members allow me to, sit back and say, that's OK, we'll let
two-thirds of the constitutional power structure determine everything for the
state."
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said his legislative priorities include funding school construction,
helping the elderly and examining the property tax system.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers must also come up with a way to replenish the state Transportation
Trust Fund, the state program that pays for roadway and bridge improvements and
mass transit. The $900 million annual fund is due to run dry this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope we can do it without an increase in taxes. We surely don't want to
do that, but it will be discussed," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco, R-Union, agreed the transportation fund should be replenished
without new taxes. He highlighted his December proposal to spend $4 billion on
new road and rail projects over four years beginning next July. He wants to
divert the money from other automobile-related revenues, such as extra funds
from the gas tax and a gross receipts tax charged on oil products.
</P>
<P>
	   He also emphasized the need to curb sprawl by forcing new transportation
projects to comply with the state master plan in order receive state funding - a
theory that is rarely put into practice, even though the state plan is supposed
to guide development in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco targeted another issue - HMOs - that resonates with Garden State
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he will ask the Senate Health Committee to review the managed care
system to determine whether the state has adequate safeguards to prevent more
HMOs from going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, the state's largest HMO, failed,
leaving thousands without health insurance and millions of dollars owed to
doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent analysis found that most of New Jersey's health maintenance
organizations are losing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Managed care as a health care system is here to stay," DiFrancesco said.
"But we can't and won't allow patient care to be sacrificed in the name of
progress."

<HEADLINE> Top 10 Jury Verdicts Totaled $8.86B  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Punitive damages made up nearly 90 percent of the Top 10
biggest jury verdicts awarded to individuals and families in 1999, reflecting
what legal experts said was an increasing comfort by jurors to punish
defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's Top 10 verdicts added to a stunning $8.86 billion -- three times
1998's total of $2.8 billion -- and 12 times 1997's total of nearly $862
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that what jurors are doing that they didn't do before is they are
saying, `Let's regulate the industry. Let's send a message to the entire
industry that they're on notice,''' said Thomas Harrison, publisher of the
Boston-based Lawyers Weekly USA, which assembled the list.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual list of top jury awards included verdicts to individuals and
families and excluded class action lawsuits or litigation between corporations.
</P>
<P>
	   Punitive damages accounted for 88 percent of 1999's total, up significantly
from 1998 when they made up for 72 percent. In 1997, punitive damages were 68
percent of total verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards come as the controversy over whether punitive damages should be
capped continues. Following one of 1999's largest verdicts -- in which an
Alabama jury awarded $581 million to a rural family that claimed a bank and an
electronics company tried to gouge them out of $1,200 on the sale of two $1,100
satellite dishes in 1995 -- the Alabama Legislature passed a package of bills to
place limits on punitive damage verdicts.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996 Congress passed bills to limit punitive damages, saying the high
limits raised product prices and affected corporations' research and development
activities. President Clinton vetoed the bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest verdict on the 1999 list was awarded by a Los Angeles jury to a
group of six people severely burned when their 1979 Chevy Malibu was rear-ended
by a drunken driver and exploded into flames. General Motors Corporation was
ordered to pay $4.9 billion. Of that, $4.8 billion was punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> GOP Reaching Out to Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a major effort to reach out to Hispanics, the
Republican National Committee plans to unveil a multimillion-dollar TV ad
campaign to try to attract the votes of a group that largely sides with
Democrats in national elections.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders from around the country on Tuesday opened what they are calling
``The New Republican Century'' with a brainstorming session on Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
	   During the meeting, RNC leaders and experts in Hispanic politics will meet
to set strategy, both in public and behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics are the fastest-growing group in the population, and they have
gravitated in large numbers to Democrats in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last two presidential elections, Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for
President Clinton -- 72 percent to 21 percent in 1996, and 61 percent to 25
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid growth of the Hispanic population in the 1990s has drawn the
attention of both parties as they look for a winning coalition in the coming
years. Hispanics made up 9 percent of the population in 1990, and that grew by
1998 to just over 11 percent of the total, or 30.3 million, according to the
Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindful of those facts, the RNC is taking steps to reach out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hispanics, especially those born in the United States, who are now in the
middle class partially because of Republican policies -- those people are
persuadable,'' said RNC spokesman Mike Collins. He declined to reveal details of
the multistate TV and print ad campaign, pending a Thursday announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   But Collins did say the ads will attempt ``to reach into Hispanic households
and say 'We want to earn your trust and we want to earn your support.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, who is attending the meeting, says Hispanics
are more than the a key prize for Republicans this year as the party campaigns
to win back the White House after eight years of Democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are a permanent force in American politics who will determine who
occupies the White House and Congress in the years to come, and as a culture
that values hard work, the family and love of country, they are a natural fit
for the Republican Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Public school choice, which allows parents to choose their children's public
school, is an example of an issue that Hispanics and Republicans favor, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intentionally held the gathering in the heart of Silicon Valley
to emphasize their commitment to the computer industry, and planned to introduce
a new Web site that will serve as a master planner of GOP events.
</P>
<P>
	   The party also planned to consider proposals to avert the kind of
``front-loading'' of the presidential primary calendar that has occurred this
year. California and about a dozen other states have moved their primaries up to
March, accelerating the nominating process, which RNC Chairman Jim Nicholson
says is unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
	   An RNC task force is to lay out potential solutions for future elections,
Collins said.

<HEADLINE> $1.6B Colombia Aid Package Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money alone will not fix the problems of drug violence
and corruption in Colombia, but $1.6 billion will go a long way toward
bolstering democracy there, the Clinton administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House proposed a package for the South American nation that
President Clinton said will stem the production and export of illegal narcotics,
while supporting economic development and improving human rights in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is flying to Colombia this weekend to
explain the package.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Albright also will
consult with Colombian authorities on implementing the package and how to obtain
additional international support for Colombia's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will make it better if the money's well spent, and it will dramatically
strengthen and solidify the Colombian government in its struggle to preserve
democracy, to preserve economic growth and preserve order in the country and be
a good neighbor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Will it solve all the problems? Of course not. Will it make a big
difference? It certainly will,'' the president said at a short
question-and-answer session with reporters in Arizona, where he traveled to
announce new national monuments designations.
</P>
<P>
	   	   The aid package is part of the budget plan the White House is drafting
for fiscal 2001. It dramatically increases America's involvement in Colombian
President Andres Pastrana's plan to wean Colombia from its drug-based economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional approval is far from assured, although there were some
encouraging words Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I have been critical in the past of the administration's efforts in
policies toward Colombia's growing problems, I believe the president is
beginning to respond in good faith to our concerns,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, also welcomed the plan but said he will pay
special attention to whether the Clinton plan will help Colombia's neighbors as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Hill Republicans generally favor spending on counternarcotics
activities, while the administration prefers spreading the money over a range of
programs including treatment of addiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed package includes money to help train special counternarcotics
battalions and buy 66 U.S. military helicopters for use in drug surveillance and
eradication.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This program is specifically directed against the narcotrafficking, and
trying to make sure that the eradication programs go forward,'' Albright said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said
in a statement the U.S. package ``will worsen the grave crisis in Colombia, not
contribute to its solution.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``More weapons and more soldiers have not, and cannot, defeat the source of
illegal narcotics,'' the office's Winifred Tate said. ``Military assistance as
proposed by the Clinton administration ... threatens to directly implicate the
U.S. in brutal counterinsurgency campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana estimates his plan will cost $7.5 billion overall, of which more
than $4 billion would come from Colombia itself. He made an international appeal
for aid during a speech at the United Nations in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a news conference Tuesday in Bogota, Pastrana said his government
would wage a diplomatic offensive on Capitol Hill in coming weeks in hopes of
heading off partisan squabbling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll make a push before the electoral debate can contaminate whatever
assistance the United States might lend to Colombia,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana believes no counternarcotics program is viable unless Colombian
farmers are given the opportunity to produce alternatives to narcotics plants.
Clinton's proposal earmarks money for that purpose, which Pastrana said is
``recognition that the fight against drug trafficking cannot be limited only to
repressive actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Anti-narcotics aid has previously gone mostly to police interdiction
and forced eradication of coca and opium crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton phoned Pastrana on Monday night, while Clinton was en route to
Arizona. The two briefly discussed strategies for gaining quick congressional
approval, Pastrana said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Dictator To Take Guatemala Post  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA WIDES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A former dictator who has been blamed for some of the
worst human rights abuses of Guatemala's decades-long civil war is set to be
sworn in Sunday as the next leader of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Once he takes the oath of office, retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt will head
Guatemala's highest legislative body -- despite accusations of genocide from a
human rights group and a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios Montt was a general who seized power in a March 1982 coup and governed
until he was overthrown in August 1983. During his rule, the army burned Indian
villages and killed thousands of suspected leftists.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, voters in November elected him to a seat in Congress, where, as
head of the majority party, he will become the body's president.
</P>
<P>
	   The independent Center for Human Rights Legal Action, which says it plans to
file a legal complaint in Guatemala accusing Rios Montt of genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When genocide occurs to a people it becomes the most important part of
their history and should never be forgotten,'' said Frank Larue, the center's
director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Armenians it happened at the turn of the century, for the Jews, it
was the Holocaust,'' he said. ``For Guatemalans, it was the early 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu has already taken action against
Rios Montt, last month filing a complaint in a Spanish court blaming his
policies for the deaths of her relatives during the war.
</P>
<P>
	   The retired general's reputation for iron leadership has made him popular
among crime-weary Guatemalans. As president, Rios Montt clamped down on urban
crime -- even as state-supported massacres were happening in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   When courts ruled that former coup leaders were barred the presidency, Rios
Montt backed populist lawyer Alfonso Portillo, who won the December election and
will also be sworn in on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rios Montt has said lower level officers may have carried out excesses, but
that he never authorized or knew about any massacres.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never fired a single rifle,'' he told a local newspaper during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   He also has been restrained in response to Menchu's petition, saying, ``This
woman is entitled to sue anybody who she thinks harmed her family.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a congressman, Rios Montt will receive immunity in Guatemala that can be
revoked only by Congress, which will be dominated by his own party, the
Guatemalan Republican Front. Few think it likely that Rios Montt would be
extradited to Spain to face the allegations in Menchu's petition.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo has promised the general will not be above the law, but he also has
said he does not believe evidence links Rios Montt to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during the war, mostly
Mayan Indians. In a report published last year, the Commission for Historical
Clarity attributed 623 massacres to state forces and said the majority of
government-sponsored human rights violations occurred between 1981 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Guatemala's 36-year civil war ended in 1996, with the signing of a peace
treaty between leftist rebels and the government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Expand Tax Break Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, expanding his election-year package of
tax initiatives, will offer a plan Wednesday to expand tax breaks for low-income
working Americans, an administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council, will announce
that he will ask Congress to enlarge the earned income tax credit, which now is
claimed by nearly 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The credit already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign,
with Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley urging that more low-income working parents
be eligible for the credits and that the amount of help be increased.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's initiative was billed as a central ingredient of a program
that he will describe as his ``opportunity agenda'' to broaden the avenues for
advancement for all Americans in the strong U.S. economy. It will be a major
element of Clinton's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, said the
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The earned income tax credit became a political football last year when
House Republicans, in a drive to save money, urged converting payments of the
tax credit from a lump sum to monthly installments, arguing they could save $8.7
billion in fiscal 2000. The idea collapsed under a veto pledge from Clinton and
criticism from Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who said
that such a change might hurt the working poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Created in 1975, the credit is intended to keep people working and to offset
the payroll taxes they contribute for Social Security and Medicare. In 1998,
taxpayers earning between $10,000 and $31,000 were eligible, depending on number
of children. The average 1998 claim was $1,459 for 19.4 million taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials have said that Clinton, in his Jan. 27 speech, will
offer a package of tax breaks roughly the same size as the $322 billion of
initiatives over 10 years that he recommended to Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Republicans are preparing their own tax proposals, far more
modest than the massive $792 billion tax-cutting package that Clinton vetoed
last year. This year's scaled-down GOP plan will include educational tax breaks
and marriage penalty relief.

<HEADLINE> The Walls Have Ears at Mass. Arena  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Privacy advocates are disturbed by a new device that can tell
owners of concert halls, car dealerships and shopping centers what people are
listening to on their radios as they drive up.
</P>
<P>
	   The device tracks what FM station is tuned in; it is not designed to track
license plates or record conversations.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say the technology is disturbing and invasive, particularly
because few motorists know about the legal eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know this is just the tip of the iceberg," said John Roberts, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. "The technology
is incredible and people really aren't aware of it ... Americans are terribly
naive about privacy."
</P>
<P>
	   Tweeter Center, a concert venue in southeastern Massachusetts, installed the
device -- called MOBILTRAK -- last year. The venue's owner, SFX Entertainment
Inc., finds the information useful in planning promotions and marketing
campaigns, spokeswoman Susan Elmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The machines are also in use in several other cities, including Los Angeles,
Phoenix, Atlanta and Toronto. Birmingham, Ala.-based MOBILTRAK did not return
calls seeking comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Rodrigues, editor-in-chief of the Los Angeles-based trade newspaper
Radio &AMP; Records, said the technology has been getting a lot of attention from
radio stations since its debut two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great tool for the concert promoter because he can see who people
come in listening to and direct his advertising to that station," he said.
"Finding out what people are listening to on FM is important and that's what
this does."
</P>
<P>
	   MOBILTRAK's method is also attracting merchants, who can learn where to
advertise if they know which station shoppers are tuned into when they pull into
a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Spahn, marketing director of the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Ala.,
has a MOBILTRAK device at each of his mall's five entrances.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the information has allowed him to target ads for the 200-store
shopping mall on local radio, and track the results.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he's had no complaints from customers, even after use of the
machines was reported in the local media.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no different than counting cars," Spahn said. "I don't consider this
an issue considering what else is going on. There's satellites in the sky
reading everything, and taking pictures of neighborhoods."
</P>
<P>
	   But even though the device is "blind" -- unable to correlate listening
information with individuals -- there are still privacy concerns. Roberts said
MOBILTRAK users should post signs or otherwise notify patrons that they are
being monitored.
</P>
<P>
	   "My concern is that the next step will be someone in a van (with a similar
device) going down a street and seeing what people are watching or listening to
in their own homes," he said. "Technology is so far ahead of the law."

<HEADLINE> Surplus Use Sets Apart Bush, McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major difference between the tax relief plans offered
by George W. Bush and John McCain is the way they treat projected budget
surpluses: Bush would send as much as possible back to taxpayers, while McCain
wants to reserve billions of dollars for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also differs from Bush by targeting more than four dozen corporate
tax breaks for elimination to help pay for his plan. They range from credits for
ethanol fuel production to tax-exempt bonds for sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
	   The split between the two leading Republican presidential candidates follows
the debate last year between GOP congressional leaders who sought huge tax cuts
and Democrats, led by President Clinton, who argued that solvency for the two
big retirement programs was more important.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Tuesday in Concord, N.H., McCain contended that his proposal to
cut taxes by $237 billion over five years while setting aside $729 billion in
surplus dollars for Social Security -- as well as money for Medicare -- was the
right way to prepare for the aging baby boom retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Others suggest that we should use every penny for tax cuts, forgetting we
have promises to keep and a fleeting opportunity to keep our word without
imperiling the economic future of our children and generations to come,'' the
Arizona senator said.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. Bush and his campaign aides insisted anew Tuesday that the
surplus would be more than large enough to accommodate his larger tax cut of
$483 billion over five years and provide unspecified help to Social Security and
Medicare. Indeed, some congressional analysts now say the combined budget
surplus may be $800 billion higher than the $3 trillion over 10 years previously
estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, noting that McCain's plan would not lower the lowest rate as his own
would, said: ``I think it's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's important to cut all rates to give everybody a tax break,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's also was criticized by Republican presidential rival Steve Forbes,
who said the Arizona senator's plan was similar to Bush's and that both men were
``missing the point.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They both offer a mere modicum of tax relief while cluttering up an
already incomprehensible tax code,'' Forbes said in a statement. ``No amount of
tinkering will substitute for bold, innovative and total tax reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   A top Bush economic adviser, former Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey, said Bush wants to be as flexible as possible in fixing those mammoth
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you start to rule certain things out, the chance at being really
successful at solving the Social Security problem goes down,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iris Lav, deputy director of the liberal Center on Budget Policy and
Priorities, said both plans envision more in tax cuts than is wise unless a firm
guarantee is in place for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is some specific agreement, you can't start spending the
money either on new programs or tax cuts,'' Lav said.
</P>
<P>
	   For some Republican activists, McCain's stance on the surplus is too close
to Clinton's and too far from their goal of limiting government growth by
cutting taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain aides, however, say that $729 billion would be ``locked away'' where
Congress could not get at it -- an idea similar to a measure passed last year by
the GOP-led House but never enacted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   To pay for a large chunk of his tax package, McCain proposes eliminating
more than 50 breaks in the tax code -- raising what the campaign estimates as
$150 billion. Democrat Bill Bradley has also targeted tax breaks, but to a much
lesser extent.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's hit list includes credits for ethanol, tax-exempt bonds for
shopping centers and sports stadiums, exemptions for investment income of trade
associations, a deduction for business entertainment costs, even a tax credit
for electricity produced from poultry waste that was recently passed by Congress
with McCain's grudging support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every tax dollar now wasted on special breaks for oil companies, ethanol
giants, insurance companies and the multitude of other special interests with
their armies of lobbyists, is now at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsey said that ``there may be some merit'' in some of McCain's proposals,
but added that Bush is concerned that elimination of some loopholes would ``have
unanticipated consequences. It's important to see the specifics, to see the
dollar amounts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another major difference between Bush and McCain is in income taxes,
although both agree on doubling the current $500-a-child tax credit that
benefits millions of families.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush wants to gradually reduce all income tax rates and simplify from five
brackets to four, with the top rate cut from 39.6 percent to 33 percent by 2006.
McCain, on the other hand, would make more people eligible for the 15 percent
bottom bracket by raising the top eligible income from $43,050 to $70,000 in
taxable income.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsey, however, said that 71 percent of taxpayers are already in the 15
percent bracket, and Lav of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agreed it
would most benefit the quarter of Americans with the highest incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It only helps people who have a portion of their incomes above 15
percent,'' Lav said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early Wednesday amid
speculation the Group of Seven industrialized nations will take steps to weaken
the Japanese currency. Japanese stocks fell moderately.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 106.00 yen, up 0.42 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also higher than its late New York level of 105.99 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 149.58 points, or 0.79
percent, to 18,701.34 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 657.51 points, or 3.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar carried over its overnight strength against
the yen in overseas foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors bought the dollar partly on the view that the G-7 may issue a
joint statement in support of yen-weakening measures at a meeting between the
group's finance ministers and central bankers in Tokyo next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The G-7 consists of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany,
Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has worried that recent rises by the yen against the dollar would hurt
the country's fledgling economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and thus less
competitive, while reducing the value of overseas profits when converted to yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower Wednesday as information and high
technology issues came under selling pressure following a decline on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 21.77 points, or 1.30 percent, to 1,657.05. The TOPIX closed up
79.81 points, or 4.99 percent, the day before.

<HEADLINE> Pataki calls for a $76.8 billion state budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Quoting Ronald Reagan and boasting of his own record
as a fiscal conservative, Gov. George Pataki proposed Tuesday that New York
spend nearly $77 billion in its next fiscal year.
<P>
	   Pataki told state legislators that New York stands at a fiscal crossroads as
they consider his budget for the 2000-01 fiscal year beginning April 1. They can
either consolidate and further the gains the state has made in his five years as
governor or backslide into overspending and overtaxing, Pataki warned.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are the showcase of the future," Pataki said, quoting Reagan. "And it is
within our power to mold that future, this year and for decades to come. It can
be as grand and as great as we make it."
</P>
<P>
	   The aim, Pataki said in his own words, is to create the "kind of New York we
want our children to inherit."
</P>
<P>
	   A $77 billion budget would be 5.5 percent larger than the current
fiscal-year spending plan. Pataki conceded that would be more than the projected
inflation rate for the next year, but he said the numbers are skewed by the
inclusion of $2 billion in rebates due property taxpayers in fiscal 2000-01
under the "STAR" program.
</P>
<P>
	   Those rebates are classified as state spending when they really are not,
Pataki argued.
</P>
<P>
	   A better gauge, the governor said, is the proposed size of the state's
general fund - $37.9 billion. That fund is comprised of money generated through
state taxes and fees. Pataki said it would grow by only 2.3 percent in fiscal
2000-01, or by less than the expected inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a budget this year which I think is just a great budget," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were few surprises in Pataki's new spending plan: his office had
dribbled out the chief initiatives over the past several days or high points had
been outlined in his State of the State address to legislators last week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki, for the first time, did say the state would end the current
fiscal year with a budget surplus of $625 million. He urged the Legislature to
use any surpluses to reduce the state's debt.
</P>
<P>
	   "If recent history teaches us anything, it's that government has the
capacity to gobble up $625 million in the blink of an eye," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor urged the Legislature to pass the centerpiece item in his $700
million tax-cut plan, a phase-out of the state's gross receipts tax on utility
bills. Pataki said lawmakers should eliminate the tax first for manufacturers,
retroactive to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Other new elements in Pataki's proposal called for the state to spend $12.9
billion on public schools - up $355 million or about 3 percent over the
current-year aid levels; tripling to $750 million the amount of money in reserve
for debt reduction; and instituting a debt reform package including the
elimination of taking on new debt without prior voter approval.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Pataki urged the creation of a new Department of Justice by merging the
Division of State Police, the Department of Correctional Services and other
agencies concerned with crime and corrections; the building of a new
maximum-security state prison at an undetermined site; the renewal of driver's
licenses once every eight years instead of five years and the entry of New York
into the multi-state lottery game known as Powerball.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next several weeks, legislators and their analysts will pore over
Pataki's proposal and hold budget hearings before each chamber will formulate
changes. It has been 16 years since lawmakers and the governor completed passage
on a new state budget prior to the April 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   It was quickly evident Tuesday that Pataki's education spending plan would
be the most controversial of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said that far from
providing for a $335 million school aid increase, the Republican governor's
budget would actually provide nearly $900 million less for schools by not
carrying over appropriated, but unspent, money from the current fiscal year to
the next one.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has given us nice rhetoric on education but he hasn't put the
dollars behind it," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver also was cool to Pataki's proposals to create a new state Department
of Justice, saying he was worried parole services would lose out under such an
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Democrat, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, questioned whether
Pataki was actually keeping general fund under the rate of inflation. McCall
said the governor was shifting some money "off-budget" so it wouldn't be
recorded as spending, even though the money will most likely be expended.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno,
said "by and large, we think the governor submitted a great budget." But Bruno
also said Senate Republicans think there should be more money for education and
more tax cuts than Pataki proposed.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Alleged kingpin boasted about getting Milton Milan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A prosecution witness in a drug trial testified
Tuesday that an accused kingpin boasted that he helped get Milton Milan elected
mayor of Camden.
<P>
	   The latest potentially damaging testimony against Milan came in the drug
conspiracy trial of Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun" Figueroa. The pair are the
alleged leaders of what prosecutors said was the largest cocaine cartel in
Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Convicted drug dealer-turned prosecution witness Lucas Torres testified that
Rivera once bragged about his relationship with Milan. Torres said Rivera made
the comments when Torres was in jail on drug charges in 1996 or 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "What did he say about Milton?" asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Sally Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   "That he's the one that got Milton Milan to be the mayor," Torres testified.
"He's the one that put up the money for it."
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Martir, Milan's attorney, declined comment on the court testimony.
Martir also represents Figueroa, the accused enforcer for the drug ring.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm too busy worried about my client here right now," Martir said.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, 36, a Democrat, took office in July 1997, the first Latino to head
the impoverished city of 87,000. Before becoming mayor, Milan was City Council
President.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres, who spent about 4 1/2 hours on the witness stand Tuesday, said that
when he asked Rivera for bail money back then, Rivera advised against touching
any of the drug profits Rivera had stashed for Torres.
</P>
<P>
	   "Milton's the mayor and by the time you get out I'll be the president and
you'll be a millionaire," Torres recalled Rivera saying during the jailhouse
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said that before his arrest Rivera arranged for him to open a
car-detailing business - using $175,000 in Torres' drug money. Milan's company,
Atlas Contracting, constructed the building, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Him (Rivera) and Milton got involved with it. They built the place," Torres
said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Milan has acknowledged Rivera as a boyhood friend, he has denied any
close relationship with the accused drug lord. Milan has also said he was
unaware of the drug allegations involving Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said the drug ring thrived in Camden, in part, because of
close ties to several city police officers. Several witnesses have alleged that
the ring had dealings with Milan before he became mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan is not charged in the drug case. However, last summer federal
authorities raided his home and City Hall as part of a federal investigation
into alleged corruption in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, another convicted drug dealer alleged that Milan bought cocaine
from the organization in 1993 - before he became mayor - allegations Milan has
denied. An FBI agent has also testified that authorities found an IOU signed by
Milan promising to repay $2,500 to Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   In other testimony Tuesday, Torres said at least a half-dozen police
officers frequented Rivera's gym and auto parts business in Camden. A former
police detective assigned to Milan admitted supplying the drug ring with an
illegal weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was like a friendship relationship," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said he eventually began making payments to Tom McDonnell, an
investigator in the Camden County Prosecutor's Office, to protect his thriving
drug business.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said you either pay or you go to jail," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said he made six or seven weekly payments of $5,000 and the amount
later increased to $11,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonnell, whose brother, Ed, is a county freeholder, died of cancer several
years ago. A spokesman for county Prosecutor Lee Solomon declined comment
Tuesday on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the drug ring was so entrenched that it took years for
investigators to break up the organization. The ring allegedly used violence and
even murder to protect the lucrative cocaine market in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Rivera, 40, was the major drug procurer and financier for
the cartel and Figueroa, 34, was an enforcer who used violence to protect the
ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa are the only two people to stand trial of the 14 who
were charged in the case when authorities broke up the ring in 1998. If
convicted, both face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres, 31, and another dealer, Camildo Cruz, set up the "33rd Street Set"
in the early 1990s. In just a month's time, Torres said the set was generating
$10,000 a week in cocaine profits and $1,600 a day in a marijuana profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Each week, Torres said, $10,000 bundled in small bills was delivered to
Rivera for safekeeping. Rivera would purchase flashy cars and houses in his name
for Torres, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said he agreed to testify against Rivera after Rivera "started
playing games with me." He said Rivera refused to accept his collect telephone
calls from jail and reneged on a promise to hire him a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   "He started breaking all the rules. He was supposed to take care of me,"
Torres said.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres returns to the witness stand Wednesday when testimony resumes.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Edwards Falls Ill at Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Ill with the flu, former Gov. Edwin Edwards left his
federal corruption trial Tuesday and was hospitalized for dehydration and
shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, was leaning on his wife, Candy, and co-defendant Andrew Martin
as he left the courthouse. He said he felt nauseous.
</P>
<P>
	   Court was adjourned at about 5:30 p.m., about a half hour early, when
defense attorney Dan Small told the judge Edwards was not feeling well.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, Stephen Edwards, also a co-defendant, said they would ask the judge
to recess the trial, but it was unclear if that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to,'' he said. ``It would be disrespectful to the jurors for him
not to be there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards was taken to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, where his doctor said he
would be kept overnight. Edwards was given fluids intravenously and oxygen, and
an EKG showed no heart trouble, said Dr. Tom John.
</P>
<P>
	   As the trial opened Monday, Edwards said he had been battling the flu but
felt better. Looking pale and weak in court, he sat through much of the first
two days of jury selection with his head in his hands and his eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve jurors and four alternates ultimately will be selected in the case
accusing Edwards and six others of various roles in a scheme allegedly headed by
Edwards to profit from the process by which riverboat casino licenses were
issued in Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Waco Photo Appears To Bolster FBI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An FBI photograph seems to discredit claims that flashes of
light filmed during the 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian compound were
gunfire from government agents, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post-Dispatch said the surveillance photo appears to have been snapped
within seconds of the time when a flash appears on a separate infrared tape at
11:24 a.m. on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians and their experts claim flashes on the infrared film
are muzzle flashes from FBI agents' guns. But the surveillance photo shows
nobody in the vicinity of the flashes.
</P>
<P>
	   It is part of a batch of photos the government recently turned over to John
C. Danforth and U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is presiding over a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Branch Davidian
survivors. Danforth was appointed last year to investigate whether the FBI tried
to cover up its actions at the group's compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has admitted it fired incendiary tear-gas canisters into the
compound the day a fire killed about 80 members of the group but contends that
people inside started the fire and that agents did not fire weapons at the
people inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Until recently, the infrared tape taken aboard an FBI plane flying about
9,000 feet over the compound and photographs taken aboard another plane at a
lower altitude had not been compared.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveillance photographs were timed by the damage depicted on the
infrared tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians, said he has not
yet seen the still photographs because the government has not handed them over
to the plaintiffs, but he was not impressed by the comparison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were a lot of times when that tank went in and out of the
building,'' he said. ``Being able to identify what time it is and whatever the
precise moment when someone was firing from the rear of the tank is very suspect
unless you've got a complete roll of film and you can see the entire sequence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Branch Davidians on Tuesday also asked the judge to sanction the
government $50,000 for delaying the surrender of thousands of pages of documents
related to the siege. Caddell said the government has turned over fewer than 20
boxes of documents, most of which are already public record.
</P>
<P>
	   With a court-imposed deadline of Jan. 15, Caddell said he fears a ``last
minute document dump,'' of hundreds of thousands of pages of materials, as
plaintiffs prepare for a May 15 trial. The $50,000 would allow the plaintiffs to
hire additional staff to sort through the materials, Caddell said in the motion.
</P>
<P>
	   In Texas, U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford said the government may request a
delay but is making a ``good faith effort'' to produce the documents as they
become available.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mr. Blackwell's annual list of fashion frumps includes
Cher, Celine Dion, Queen Elizabeth and Martha Stewart, who he dressed down as
"dull, dowdy and devastatingly dreary."
</P>
<P>
	   Blackwell, a former fashion designer who writes a column for a supermarket
tabloid and entertains on ocean cruises, did have something nice to say. He
declared that Gwyneth Paltrow, Sophia Loren, Oprah Winfrey, Camryn Manhein,
Barbra Streisand, Halle Berry, Helen Mirren, Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone and
Princess Caroline of Monaco were "fabulous fashion independents."
</P>
<P>
	   Mr. Blackwell's 40th annual worst-dressed women list and his comments:
</P>
<P>
	   1. Cher: "A million beads and one overexposed derriere."
</P>
<P>
	   2. Celine Dion: "In her backward tuxedo there's no way of knowing whether
Diva Dion is coming or going -- a profusion of confusion."
</P>
<P>
	   3. Queen Elizabeth: "Was she the palace Christmas tree or just a royal
clown?"
</P>
<P>
	   4. Martha Stewart: "Dresses like the centerfold for the Farmer's Almanac."
</P>
<P>
	   5. Fiona Apple: "A kinked and curled Kewpie Doll wrapped in a collection of
yesterday's fatal fashion frights."
</P>
<P>
	   6. Britney Spears: "This belly-baring songbird is better heard than seen."
</P>

	   7. Sarah Jessica Parker: "From 'Sex and the City' Sarah's fashions are a
mix-and-match pity."
</P>
<P>
	   8. Jennifer Aniston: "She's a fashion bore and a snore."
</P>
<P>
	   9. Cameron Diaz: "On 'Any Given Sunday' Cameron falls prey to a freaky
fashion curse -- and as the week continues, she just slips from bad to worse."

<HEADLINE> More Police Urged for Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEF FEDERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Although violence is declining in Kosovo, the Serb
province remains extremely dangerous for ethnic minorities and desperately needs
more international police, a senior United Nations official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The level of violence has declined by ``orders of magnitude'' since a
NATO-led peacekeeping operation entered Kosovo in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The international troops, coupled with a U.N.-led civilian administration,
moved into Kosovo after a 78-day NATO air campaign ended an 18-month crackdown
on the province's ethnic Albanian majority and forced Yugoslav troops out of the
province.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Yugoslav forces left, many ethnic Albanians attacked Kosovo's
Serbs and other minorities in retaliation for the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
	   While there were 40 to 50 major ethnic crimes, many of them murders, each
week when the peacekeepers arrived, the number has gradually decreased to three
to five major crimes a week, the official said, speaking on condition of
anoymity in accord with U.N. rules regarding some background briefings.
</P>
<P>
	   And while tens of thousands of Serbs fled Kosovo to other parts of Serbia in
the first weeks of the peacekeeping operation, the exodus has stopped and small
numbers of Serbs have actually returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official attributed the decline in violence to the arrival of NATO
troops and United Nations police, the migration of small Serbian communities to
larger, more secure villages, as well as a cooling of tempers with the passage
of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is still very dangerous to be a minority,'' the official stressed.
``What crime there is focuses disproportionately on ethnic minorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and the republic of
Montenegro, disputed U.N. claims of improved security, saying the province's
Serb minority remains in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Belgrade's U.N. envoy Vladislav
Jovanovic criticized a report last month by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that ``good progress'' had been made by NATO and the U.N. Mission in Kosovo in
disarming ethnic Albanian fighters and establishing civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The report gives cause for one overarching concern: the apparent
contradiction between the claim that UNMIK has made progress and the facts
presented almost throughout the report testifying that the Serbs and other
non-Albanians are threatened and that their human rights are being violated,''
Jovanovic wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the move by many Serbs into secure enclaves amounted to ``an
obnoxious practice of ghettoization'' that was a ``disgrace to the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the delicate security situation, Annan has requested about 4,000
international police for Kosovo. Currently, less than half that number are
serving there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It simply is not enough to provide the necessary security coverage for all
of Kosovo in a period of such continuing tension,'' the U.N. official said. U.N.
officials made an urgent request to the Security Council on Tuesday for more
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has agreed to double its police contingent to more than 400, while
the United States had pledged to raise its contribution from 400 to 500, he
said.

By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy booming and government surpluses
soaring, Republican voters are demanding that Washington loosen its grip on its
extra cash and slash taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP presidential candidates are scrambling to heed the call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You leave this money in Washington, I guarantee you those guys'll spend
it,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in Monday night's presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
	   An echo was heard Tuesday from front-runner George W. Bush, who told voters
in Florence, S.C: ``Instead of leaving the money in Washington, where I believe
it will be spent on bigger government, I intend to pass it to the taxpayers of
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican voters always hunger for tax cuts, but the strong economy may
have increased their appetites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a whole new world since 1996,'' said Republican pollster Whit Ayres,
who is not tied to any of the campaigns. ``What has changed is going from
deficit politics to surplus politics -- and that has increased the argument for
some sort of tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   While working for Lamar Alexander's failed 1996 campaign, Ayres asked likely
Iowa caucus-goers to identify the ``single most important problem'' facing the
country. The federal deficit ranked first, picked by 17 percent of the voters,
with morality and crime a close second.
</P>
<P>
	   All other issues, including taxes, were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, Ayres polled 300 likely Iowa caucus-goers and asked them to
identify the ``single most important political issues.'' Topping the list at 22
percent was tax cuts, followed closely by morality.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, 1996 exit polls showed that tax cuts were less important
to voters than the economy and jobs. This year, tax cuts easily top the economy
as a concern, campaign pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   National surveys of Republicans suggest that the nation's morals are a
greater concern than tax rates, though tax cuts are consistently ranked high.
</P>
<P>
	   All avowed tax-cutters, the presidential candidates are squabbling over how
to split up the spoils of a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The field's top three prospects -- Texas Gov. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain
and publisher Steve Forbes -- are battling over how much of the surplus should
be spent on tax reductions and who can be trusted to keep the tax-cutting
pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, five-year tax package that would spend a
large chunk of projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose package is half the size of Bush's, sets aside 23 percent of
future surpluses for tax cuts and dedicates the rest to paying down the national
debt and bolstering Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent GOP pollster recently gave voters in early primary states a
choice between a generic candidate who supports tax cuts and a candidate who
``supports protecting and preserving Social Security.'' Nearly half took the
Social Security candidiate, and less than 40 percent sided with the tax cutter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a recession, Republicans want a quick influx of cash. That's why
(Presidents) Reagan and Kennedy both correctly cut across-the-board rates during
economic downturns,'' said McCain adviser Dan Schnur. ``That's why John McCain
has devised a plan that includes a significant tax cut and saves Social
Security. It addresses both the short- and long-terms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Each campaign argue that it is driving the tax debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes pollster John McLaughlin said Bush proposed a large tax cut only
after he saw that Forbes was capable of ``getting traction in Iowa. All of a
sudden, he's a born-again tax cutter.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Texan introduced his plan, rival campaigns noticed that his poll
numbers climbed, particularly among economic conservatives who normally tilt to
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing his base would be seduced by Bush's plan, Forbes decided to air ads
accusing the governor of breaking a no-new-tax pledge in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Bush plans to broadcast an ad in Iowa later this week in which
he promises to run a campaign free of ``cynical and negative politics.'' Bush
also criticizes Forbes, saying, ``My opponent has chosen to run a negative
campaign,'' according to an adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   To Republican voters, the issue is simple: Washington can't be trusted with
the economic windfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts are ``a very important issue to me,'' said Gerald Scott, a retiree
from St. Albans, Vt. ``I have children growing up and a lot of grandchildren;
I'd like to see them make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mildred Hendricks, 64, of Greensboro, N.C., said would like to cheaper
health care insurance and lower taxes -- two reasonable requests, she said, with
``as much extra money as they've got up there in Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman promises broader approach to environmental protection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman offered a "big picture"
approach on Tuesday to protecting New Jersey's environment in the new century.
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, as New Jersey has poured more concrete, cut down more
woodlands and built more buildings, we have put watersheds at risk," the
governor said in her State of the State message.
</P>
<P>
	   A watershed is a geographical area that drains into a single river or water
body. Watershed management assesses problems according to their impact on water
quality in that particular river or bay.
</P>
<P>
	   "Saving land will help," the governor said. "But it's just as important to
recognize that where we put sewers, roads and new buildings can affect an entire
watershed."
</P>
<P>
	   However, environmental lobbyists critical of Whitman's commitment said her
speech was further evidence of how badly she is missing the big picture.
</P>
<P>
	   And Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said he was leery of excessive state
control over private property owners.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor promised a new approach, for instance, in approving sewer plant
expansions, saying the state would require not only the standard research on
water pollution and treatment but a wider look at the quantity and type of
development such expansions could trigger.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, new sewer capacity could clear the way for housing projects or
shopping malls that could do more damage to a waterway than the sewage itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerri Ratcliffe, deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental
Protection, said the agency has the ability to examine a "broader spectrum" of
issues with every sewer plant application.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now are going to apply this broader spectrum to every application," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toward that end, Whitman promised $6 million more over the next two years to
help local groups plan how to protect watersheds.
</P>
<P>
	   George Hawkins, head of a Trenton-area watershed group, said, "It is
extremely tough and important work."
</P>
<P>
	   "Are we going to limit development 100 miles away at the headwaters of the
Bound Brook because it will increase flooding at the base because of stormwater
issues?" Hawkins said. "That is a question that has to be done on a watershed
basis."
</P>
<P>
	   Before her speech Tuesday, Whitman signed an executive order mandating
tougher requirements for sewer permits.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, and
other lobbyists for environmental groups said sewer expansion already has been
approved that would allow development of some 300,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   DEP Commissioner Bob Shinn did not dispute that, but noted sewer planning is
done over decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Shinn said that after decades of regional planning through three
administrations, Tuesday marks the start of an effort to tie it all together, to
ensure that a sewer plant or factory in one town does not endanger a community
miles away or threaten the water of the next generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Tittel said, "It really come does to whether there will be standards and
implementation versus just more words and planning that goes nowhere."
</P>
<P>
	   "We want this to happen," Tittel said. "The DEP (hasn't) had the ability to
stop anything, and this will help."
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Flanagan of New Jersey Public Interest Research Group said, "The
announcement that the governor has put out there is not backed up with the tools
in the department."
</P>
<P>
	   DEP spokesman Peter Page said new applications for sewer expansion come in
at the rate of about two a week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Collins said tighter state control over sewer approvals "is a little
scary, but there's no particulars here. But I'm willing to look at the issue in
the context of property rights."
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said he would not accept strict land control based in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the most forgotten rights of Anglo-American society is property
rights. That's what our society was based upon when we started this country," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Minority Leaders Unite in TV Talks  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM HARRIGAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A coalition of minority leaders reported progress
Tuesday in talks aimed at increasing diversity in network TV programming and
behind the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "Colored people come in all colors," declared NAACP President Kweise Mfume,
who came under criticism last week for leaving Hispanic representatives out of
negotiations that led to an agreement with NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   Esteban Torres, the former congressman who is chairman of the National
Latino Media Council, said it was agreed during a meeting Tuesday that Mfume,
who also reached agreement with ABC, will continue to lead current talks with
the networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume, who was also joined by Asian-Pacific American and Native American
leaders, said that in future negotiations he will share the job with "equal,
rotating co-chairmen."
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
said some talks were going better than others.
</P>
<P>
	   "Negotiations with Fox look promising, much more so than CBS looks now,"
Mfume said. "We think Fox has heard us loud and clear and has come forward with
something better." He did not give specifics of how Fox planned to increase
minority involvement in creative development and include more minorities in
leading roles.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume and other coalition members had meetings with NBC and CBS West Coast
executives later Tuesday -- plus a Wednesday morning session with Fox
executives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Have we made progress? Yes. Do we expect more, absolutely," Mfume said. "We
have planted a seed in fertile soil."
</P>
<P>
	   The issue came to a boil in July when the NAACP and a coalition of Hispanic
groups threatened to call a network boycott over the lack of minority
representation on TV.

$1.6B Colombia Aid Package Proposed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money alone will not fix the problems of drug violence
and corruption in Colombia, but $1.6 billion will go a long way toward
bolstering democracy there, the Clinton administration said today. The White
House proposed a package for the South American nation that President Clinton
said will stem the production and export of illegal narcotics, while supporting
economic development and improving human rights in Colombia. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is flying to Colombia this weekend to explain the package.

	   LABUKOE, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. investigators exhumed two mass graves in
East Timor Tuesday and found the bodies of eight people who were likely killed
months before the province voted to break away from Indonesia. The investigators
had expected to find the remains of 18 East Timorese who were executed by
Indonesian-allied militiamen. But only eight bodies were recovered before heavy
rain suspended the work, officials said. Anti-independence militia violence both
before and after the U.N.-sponsored ballot in August left East Timor devastated.
At least 200 bodies have been recovered since international peacekeepers were
deployed in September to restore law and order.

McCain Plan Offers Savings Accounts

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain today outlined a five-year, $237 billion tax
relief plan that also would set aside more than $700 billion to protect Social
Security and create new all-purpose tax-free saving accounts for the middle
class. In a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Concord, N.H., McCain suggested
it would be irresponsible to use most of projected budget surpluses to cut taxes
-- as Republican presidential rival George W. Bush would do -- without planning
for the retirement of the big baby boom generation, which will push Social
Security toward insolvency.

begins Oct. 1, will include $850 million for national service efforts -- $120
million more than the last budget, the White House announced. Of the new money,
$73 million would go to AmeriCorps to help recruit members. AmeriCorps is
essentially an at-home version of the Peace Corps.

<HEADLINE> Whitman announces $15 million to clean up urban lots for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday promised to
provide $15 million in cash grants to help cities and crowded suburbs prepare
vacant lots for commercial use or housing.
<P>
	   Jane Kenny, Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, said the
increased spending would serve the dual purpose of boosting urban economies and
steering development away from open "green fields" and toward "brown fields."
</P>
<P>
	   The state in 1998 eased regulations on cleaning up vacant properties, from
abandoned homes and lots piled with trash to old factory sites with pollution
problems. Often city governments have taken control of such properties - and
their problems - through tax defaults.
</P>
<P>
	   DCA provided loans to help cities and towns clean them up, but for many
larger cities it was simply too expensive to undertake.
</P>
<P>
	   "For financially struggling cities, this is a crucial deficiency," Kenny
said. "This initiative fills a gap in New Jersey's brownfields program."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman in her State of the State address said, "We have seen New Jersey
turn some of these so-called brownfields into veritable gold mines. They've
helped city residents gain jobs and enjoy a higher quality of life."
</P>
<P>
	   "But some brownfields are still untouched. They haven't been able to attract
private developers, and a big reason is the expense of cleanup," the governor
said. "As we save farms, let's also salvage the urban acres that could be
fertile ground for new homes or businesses."
</P>
<P>
	   DCA will pay out the grants to clean up sites where cities or large towns
have completed development plans and where interested businesses want to move.
</P>
<P>
	   The loan program has doled out $15 million to date to fund the cleanup of 14
urban sites, which in turn has brought in $178 million in private investment,
the DCA said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Tries To Lure Teachers  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG WILLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday he hopes to persuade
young people to become teachers for a few years before going on to other
careers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Sacramento Press Club, Davis said ``it is unrealistic of
us to expect that people will enter the teaching profession and stay there 40
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can get someone to devote four years of their life because they
realize this is the best way to give back to their community, we will have
accomplished something very significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was criticized by Bob Wells, executive director of the
Association of California School Administrators, who said it's hard enough to
persuade people to choose teaching as their life's work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Teaching ought to be a profession. We would really limit ourselves if we
only have a chance to go after that portion of the population that treats it as
a volunteerism,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said even with all the incentives he is proposing in his new state
budget to attract new teachers, public schools still can't compete with private
industry salaries and that there is no chance that taxpayers would be willing to
pay teachers competitive salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, the Democratic governor said, he is urging students to consider
teaching as a public service commitment in the spirit of volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the incentives Davis is proposing to attract new teachers is a
forgivable college loan of up to $11,000 for people who teach for at least four
years in a low-performing school.
</P>
<P>
	   California will need to add at least 26,000 new teachers a year for the next
decade as public school enrollment grows.

<HEADLINE> Fisk, Perez in Baseball Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty-five years after clearing The Wall, Carlton Fisk and
Tony Perez made the Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair, linked by home runs in perhaps the greatest World Series ever,
were elected to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday, wiping away the times they fell
just short.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll be happy and proud to be standing up there in July at the same podium
as he is," Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk is best remembered for waving his 12th-inning homer fair in Game 6 of
the 1975 World Series. Perez's two-run shot off Bill Lee the following night,
which helped rally Cincinnati from a three-run deficit to the title, is largely
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sweet now, when I'm in. It doesn't matter how long I had to wait,"
said Perez, who made it on his ninth try. "The first thing I thought of was
calling my mother in Cuba. The family was there, too. They started jumping
around. My mother was crying."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk, who caught the most games in major league history (2,226) and hit a
record 351 of 376 career home runs while playing the position, received 397
votes among the record 499 ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball
Writers' Association of America. Perez received 385 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   To be elected, a player had to be listed on 375 ballots (75 percent). Fisk,
who fell 43 votes short last year in his first time on the ballot, received 79.6
percent and made it with 22 votes to spare.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, 71 votes shy last year when Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount
were chosen, got 77.2 percent and was elected with 10 votes to spare, becoming
the first Cuban chosen by the BBWAA.
</P>
<P>
	   And it could be an even bigger '75 reunion when induction ceremonies are
held.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk, who played from 1969-93, and Perez, active from 1964-86, will be
inducted into the Hall at Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 23. Sparky Anderson, who
managed the Reds to Series titles in 1975 and '76, is a leading contender for
election by the veterans' committee, which meets Feb. 29 at Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would be something special, if I went in with Sparky at the same
time," Perez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk, who spent 11 seasons with the Boston Red Sox and 13 with the Chicago
White Sox, acknowledged his Game 6 homer off Pat Darcy was his defining moment,
especially for director Harry Coyle's reaction shot of his using every bit of
body English to wave the ball fair as it traveled down the left-field line. When
it finally hit the foul pole for a home run, he jumped with his arms thrust in
the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people who viewed that game realized we're all people and we run
the full gamut of emotions, maybe even more intensely than the fans," Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati trailed 3-0 in the sixth inning the following night when Perez
hit a two-run homer on Lee's blooper pitch.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's something you never forget," Perez said. "I still feel it. I can close
my eyes and I still see it."
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, now a special assistant to Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski,
hit 379 homers and finished with 1,652 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   He joins Big Red Machine teammates Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan in the Hall.
Missing is career hits leader Pete Rose, ineligible because of the lifetime ban
from baseball he agreed to following an investigation of his gambling. Rose
received 17 write-in votes -- which don't count.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a great player and should be in it," Perez said, "but right now I
don't want to get into it."
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, a teammate of Fisk's on the 1980 Red Sox, will be just the 18th first
baseman in the Hall and Fisk only the 13th catcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisk, a New Englander from New Hampshire, left both the Red Sox and White
Sox on bad terms, but Boston has reached out in recent years, making him a
special assistant to GM Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
	   "My relationship with the Red Sox has improved," Fisk said. "They've made
concerted efforts to open the door of communication."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, he still hasn't decided if he wants a Red Sox or White Sox hat on his
Hall plaque.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to think about it a little more," he said. "I'm going to reserve
judgment on that for a little while."
</P>
<P>
	   He still sounds angry at the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of that is water under the bridge, but some of the issues still
haven't been addressed," he said. "There are some very definite scars from our
relationship."
</P>
<P>
	   Both players were emotional when they received the news.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Notre Dame 80, Seton Hall 52  </HEADLINE>
    By JR ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Ruth Riley had 17 points and 13 rebounds and Niele
Ivey added 14 points and 10 assists as No. 6 Notre Dame beat Seton Hall 80-52 on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley added seven blocks, one short of the school record, for the Irish
(12-2, 3-0 Big East).
</P>
<P>
	   Though Notre Dame led by as many as 30 points, the Irish were sluggish at
times thanks in part to the Seton Hall (6-7, 0-3) press.
</P>
<P>
	   Up 48-28 early in the second half, Notre Dame committed three straight
turnovers as Seton Hall pulled within 49-37 with 13:15 left, its smallest
deficit since midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Irish responded with an 11-0 run that began and ended with
3-pointers by Alicia Ratay. Seton Hall didn't seriously challenge the Irish
again.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratay finished with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing without 6-foot-2 forward Leslie Ardon, out with a broken hand, the
Pirates couldn't match the 6-foot-5 Riley inside. But the Irish also had
problems getting Riley the ball, often forcing lob passes inside. Combined with
their problems with the press, the Irish committed 25 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Seton Hall's 52 points matched the lowest offensive output of any
Notre Dame opponent this season. The Pirates shot 21-of-70 from the field --
just 1-of-11 from 3-point range -- and had 23 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr Fuller scored 13 points to lead the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irish led 24-16 with 7:55 left in the first half when they blew the game
open with a 13-0 run over the next three minutes. Notre Dame led 37-22 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Notre Dame's 15th straight home win, tying a school record.

<HEADLINE> Sanders' Arbitration Hearing Opens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A hearing on the Detroit Lions' demand that retired
running back Barry Sanders repay $5.5 million of an $11 million signing bonus
opened with six hours of testimony before an arbitrator Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders attended the hearing before arbitrator Sam Kagel. Chief operating
officer Chuck Schmidt and vice president Tom Lewand represented the Lions.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear when a ruling by Kagel will be made.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders walked away from the Lions on July 28, two days before the start of
training camp, saying he was tired of playing football. He had played two years
of a six-year, $36 million contract signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders forfeited $3.1 million in base salary and a $250,000 reporting bonus
for the 1999 season by retiring.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders retired after 10 seasons with the Lions with 15,269 yards rushing,
trailing only Walter Payton's 16,726 yards on the NFL career list.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the Lions insisted all season they would not trade Sanders, coach
Bobby Ross hinted Monday he might be willing to consider a deal. The Miami
Dolphins reportedly are among the teams interested in Sanders if he decided to
return to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lions hope to have the arbitration ruling before the start of the
free-agent signing period in March, so they have a clear picture of their salary
cap status heading into the 2000 season.

<HEADLINE> Critics Fear Dilution of News  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The nation may get its news from more places than ever these
days. But the blockbuster merger of Time Warner and America Online, as well as
big media combinations expected in the future, are raising concerns about
homogenized and diluted news.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this merger invites is the possibility of a new era in American
communications that sees the end of an independent press," said Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is as alarmed. Richard Epstein, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, said the Internet still offers a worldwide venue for
dissenting voices. He added the industry is still diverse enough to keep itself
in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are just two newspapers in town, one will happily dump on the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $145 billion stock deal announced Monday allies AOL's 22 million online
subscribers with a news and entertainment conglomerate that includes CNN, Time
magazine, TBS, TNT, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Miller, communications director at Time Warner Inc., said the merger
will enhance, not limit, the flow of information by creating new ways to
communicate. He added the Internet makes it impossible for one group to stifle
the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the first limitless medium, and by its very nature, no
single company or group can hope to control it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Media mergers are nothing new, beginning in earnest in the mid-1980s with
the takeovers of TV networks, including ABC and NBC, Dean Alger, author of the
1998 book "Megamedia," said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend accelerated in 1996 after Congress passed the Telecommunications
Act in an attempt to spur competition. Instead of making it easier for companies
to compete, the opposite has occurred, Alger said -- the big mergers that grew
out of the law means today's media are run increasingly by a dwindling number of
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   In his book -- subtitled "How Giant Corporations Dominate Mass Media,
Distort Competition, and Endanger Democracy -- Alger lists what he calls the
"dominant dozen" media conglomerates. Now updating the book for paperback
editions, Alger has just slashed the dozen to four: AOL/Time Warner; Disney/ABC;
Viacom/CBS and News Corp., the parent company of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concentration is getting more severe and the range of the diversity of
voices is clearly being constricted," Alger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect this trend to continue as other Internet companies look for
combinations with TV, film and news outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   With the AOL-Time Warner deal, the Internet, once considered the voice of
the little guy, has suddenly become a powerhouse player.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rise of the Internet was supposed to be the rise of the independent
voice," said Matthew Felling, media director of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs. "With the auditorium being filled with large bands, the guy playing his
clarinet is really going to get outshouted and is going to get completely
crowded out of the concert."
</P>
<P>
	   AOL might not write the news. But it channels news to its users. The
Internet portal may be more likely now to send the point-and-clickers toward CNN
and Time instead of MSBNC and Newsweek, media watchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts believe the quality of the news suffers when media worlds
collide.
</P>
<P>
	   "You need to have an independent voice that can keep an eye on powerful
interests," Rosentiel said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, ABC News killed a proposed "20/20" story about alleged security
problems at Disney World in Florida. Officials said the network's corporate
parent, Walt Disney Co., had no say in the decision, but others were critical.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Newspaper Sale Challenged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A former mayoral candidate filed a federal antitrust
suit Tuesday to try to stop the sale of the San Francisco Chronicle to the
publisher of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   Clint Reilly, suing as a subscriber and "potential advertiser" in both
newspapers, accused the Hearst Corp. of trying to monopolize the daily newspaper
market in San Francisco by acquiring its competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale would deprive readers of "free and open competition in the sale of
daily newspapers and their differing editorial and reportorial voices," and
would lead to increases in newspaper prices and advertising rates, the suit
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hearst Corp., publisher of the afternoon Examiner, announced last August
that it would buy the morning Chronicle and seek a buyer for the Examiner. The
price would be $660 million, according to published reports. The two papers will
be merged if no buyer can be found, the company said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not the first legal tussle involving Reilly and the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, he filed a personal injury lawsuit after his ankle was broken
during a confrontation with Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein. The
injury, which occurred during a meeting on the paper's coverage of Reilly,
required surgery. Reilly accused Bronstein of pushing him and later won an
out-of-court legal settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Reilly said that Hearst "knows and intends
that the sale of the Examiner will be impossible" because the Chronicle
dominates the market, and the Examiner is being offered for sale without its
business functions, such as printing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   Chronicle Publishing Co. spokeswoman Dawn Jackson said the newspaper would
have no comment until its lawyer reviewed the suit. Hearst Corp. spokesman Paul
Luthringer said he would have no comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly, a former political consultant, ran unsuccessfully for mayor in
November's election.
</P>
<P>
	   The city is studying a possible antitrust suit to stop the sale. Supervisors
voted Monday to urge City Attorney Louise Renne to consider a suit and report
back in two weeks on the costs of legal action and the prospects of success.

   KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- Anthrax scares shut down a middle school and a social

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gov. Edwards Falls Ill at Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Ill with the flu, former Gov. Edwin Edwards left his
federal corruption trial Tuesday and was hospitalized with dehydration, fever
and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, was leaning on his wife, Candy, and co-defendant Andrew Martin
as he left the courthouse. He said he felt nauseous.
</P>
<P>
	   Court was adjourned at about 5:30 p.m., about a half hour early, when
defense attorney Dan Small told the judge Edwards was not feeling well.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, Stephen Edwards, also a co-defendant, said they would ask the judge
to recess the trial, but it was unclear if that would happen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to,'' he said. ``It would be disrespectful to the jurors for him
not to be there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards was taken to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, where his doctor said he
would be kept overnight. Edwards was given fluids intravenously and oxygen, and
an EKG showed no heart trouble, said Dr. Tom John.
</P>
<P>
	   As the trial opened Monday, Edwards said he had been battling the flu but
felt better. Looking pale and weak in court, he sat through much of the first
two days of jury selection with his head in his hands and his eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve jurors and four alternates ultimately will be selected in the case
accusing Edwards and six others of various roles in a scheme allegedly headed by
Edwards to profit from the process by which riverboat casino licenses were
issued in Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> Reaction To Pinochet Decision Mixed  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A British medical decision Tuesday declaring Gen.
Augusto Pinochet too sick to stand trial drew praise from his supporters and
criticism from opponents, who promised to continue efforts to try him for
alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old former Chilean dictator has been in Britain since he was
arrested on a Spanish warrant for alleged human rights violations committed
during his 17-year rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The governments of Chile and Spain both appeared unlikely to get involved in
ruling, which could bring an end to the former Chilean dictator's 15-month
battle to keep from being extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   But human rights lawyers said they will continue efforts to try Pinochet.
Attorney Enrique Santiago said he will request that the Spanish National Court
ask British prosecutors for a new medical examination if Pinochet is released on
health grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's younger daughter, Jacqueline, said the family was ``extremely
happy.'' She said her father has been in bed in recent days, and upon returning
to Chile ``he will go straight to the Military Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mireya Garcia, vice president of the Organization of Relatives of
Missing Detainees, a group dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being
arrested under the Pinochet dictatorship, called the ruling ``a terrible blow.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he
was in shape to stand trial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government said a medical team who examined Pinochet unanimously
agreed that he was too ill to face trial, and that Home Secretary Jack Straw
felt he should not allow Pinochet to be extradited. But it said he would not
make a decision until hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters at the private Pinochet Foundation were joyful -- but cautious.
Director Hernan Guiloff warned: ``There is nothing to celebrate yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel, a former close aide to Pinochet, said:
``This is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process
starts to restore its sovereignty and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Socialist Sen. Ricardo Nunez said that once here, Pinochet should resign the
post of senator-for-life granted to him under the constitution written by his
regime and withdraw from politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he doesn't, he would make Chile the laughingstock of the world,'' Nunez
said.

<HEADLINE> Bruins' Allison Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins forward Jason Allison will miss the rest of the
season after deciding Tuesday to have surgery -- first on his left thumb and
then on his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole year has been a disappointment," he said Tuesday night between
periods of the Bruins' game against Toronto. "The first game I hurt my arm. I
haven't been able to do things I know I can do."
</P>
<P>
	   Allison, whose been troubled by the wrist since last season, hoped to make
it through this campaign without surgery that would keep him out three to four
months.
</P>
<P>
	   After injuring thumb ligaments Saturday, he was told surgery could wait, the
Bruins said. But Dr. James Herndon said Tuesday the injury was more serious than
first thought and he will operate on Allison's thumb on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dr. Herndon looked at the MRI and determined that the left hand injury is
more serious that the wrist and should be repaired first," general manager Harry
Sinden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrist surgery will be pushed back four to five weeks so that Allison,
whose wife is expecting their first baby this month, won't have both hands in
casts at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to be able to brush my teeth, drive my car," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison has led the Bruins in scoring in each of his two full seasons with
the team. The 24-year-old center is the team's No. 3 scorer this season with 10
goals and 18 assists in 37 games, missing five because of the wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a way, it could be a blessing in disguise," said Allison, whose left
hand was in a cast. "Instead of playing not even close to 100 percent and not
playing very well, at least this way I know it will be 100 percent when I come
back."

Flu and Respiratory Infections Hit Canadians

<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The bugs that tail the flu bug may be responsible for the
heavy toll this season on companies and the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
	   Influenza has invaded workplaces and put pressure on clinics and hospitals.
But secondary upper-respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia,
have had more time to spread their misery because the flu season was ahead of
schedule, say some occupational health workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who didn't have a fall flu shot or who rolled up their sleeves late
were caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of the people at the clinics we're seeing have had flu shots,'' said
Dr. Marion Dyke of MCI Medical Clinics Inc., which oversees 26 walk-in clinics
in Ontario.
</P>

chest very easily. We're seeing more adults with sinus and ear infections, and

Agriculture Minister Seeks More Money for Farmers
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief will be pressing cabinet
colleagues today to sow some seeds of goodwill in Western Canada by boosting
federal aid for farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanclief wants to offer more cash and a longer-term aid plan when he meets
his provincial counterparts here Friday, particularly for those from the
Prairies hit hard by a farm income crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   But he'll first need his cabinet colleagues onside.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're crossing our fingers that this will be on their agenda,'' Sylvie
Millette-Leduc, spokeswoman for Vanclief, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Published reports suggest Ottawa is considering spending an extra $500
million a year for the next five years on a disaster aid package as it overhauls
the country's farm safety net programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Including insurance programs, those are now worth about $1 billion annually,
with the provinces kicking in an additional $400 million.

	   A statement from Inco said it failed to reach a development deal with
Newfoundland's government because the company couldn't meet the province's

pressure on Premier Brian Tobin to prove his demands can eventually fit with

	   MONTREAL (AP) -- A mother of nine who spent two weeks in jail because of
more than $3,500 in unpaid parking tickets enjoyed her freedom Tuesday after a
Good Samaritan paid her fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandra Savard was released from prison after a 72-year-old woman who wanted
to remain anonymous paid $2,800 -- the total of the fines after her time served
was deducted from the original total.

release Monday.
</P>

	   Another Montrealer is poised to launch a constitutional fight of his three
jail terms for unpaid parking tickets -- which totalled almost $20,000 with

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Tries To Lure Teachers  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG WILLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday he hopes to persuade
young people to become teachers for a few years before going on to other
careers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Sacramento Press Club, Davis said ``it is unrealistic of
us to expect that people will enter the teaching profession and stay there 40
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can get someone to devote four years of their life because they
realize this is the best way to give back to their community, we will have
accomplished something very significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was criticized by Bob Wells, executive director of the
Association of California School Administrators, who said it's hard enough to
persuade people to choose teaching as their life's work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Teaching ought to be a profession. We would really limit ourselves if we
only have a chance to go after that portion of the population that treats it as
a volunteerism,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Herold, a teacher since 1965 and one of California's 1999 teachers
of the year, said: ``It just seems like I have the best job I can imagine. It
does take a long time to be a good teacher sometimes. I would hate to see that
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said even with all the incentives he is proposing in his new state
budget to attract new teachers, public schools still can't compete with private
industry salaries and that there is no chance that taxpayers would be willing to
pay teachers competitive salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, the Democratic governor said, he is urging students to consider
teaching as a public service commitment in the spirit of volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the incentives Davis is proposing to attract new teachers is a
forgivable college loan of up to $11,000 for people who teach for at least four
years in a low-performing school.
</P>
<P>
	   California will need to add at least 26,000 new teachers a year for the next
decade as public school enrollment grows.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Land Gets Protection  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK (AP) -- Amid criticisms that he was just
polishing his legacy, President Clinton extended national monument status
Tuesday to colorful, pristine lands around the Grand Canyon and three other
areas. ``This is an act of humility for all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like every president since 1906 except three, Clinton used the Antiquities
Act to protect the federally owned scenic areas from harm from activities such
as mining or development. The largest area, the Grand Canyon-Parashant National
Monument, covers a million acres filled with vegetation, minerals, and Paleozoic
rock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, 10,000 or 20,000 years from now, if the good Lord lets us all
survive as a human race, no one will remember who set aside this land on this
day,'' Clinton said. ``But the children will still enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Antiquities Act, passed by Congress in 1906, has been used by presidents
to safeguard federal lands as, in the words of the act, ``objects of historic
and scientific interest.'' Only Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush declined to
use it; President Carter used the law to preserve large sections of Alaskan
wilderness in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's action does not affect existing water and grazing rights and
mining claims, but does bar new ones on the designated lands. Hunting is
prohibited on the expanded section of the Pinnacles site and a ban on off-road
vehicles at Grand Canyon-Parashant becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's order came exactly 92 years after Theodore Roosevelt made
the Grand Canyon a national monument on Jan. 11, 1908. The canyon became a
national park in 1919. Another area Clinton expanded Tuesday, the Pinnacles
south of San Jose, Calif., also received its monument designation from Roosevelt
in 1908.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton arose early and watched the sun rise over the Grand Canyon's
multicolored ridges and plateaus. Then, under a blue sky streaked with wispy
white clouds, he took a helicopter tour and hiked along Tuweep Valley. He made
his announcement at Hopi Point on the canyon's South Rim, where the cliffs were
awash in crisp, chilly sunlight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we're doing the right thing, because look at the day we've got,''
Clinton said. ``We've got the good Lord's stamp of approval on this great day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton signed the declarations at a wooden desk in a dusty valley dotted
with sagebrush, with the Shivwitz Plateau rising behind him. Speaking to
reporters, he rebuffed critics who said he was taking action in order to build
his record on the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you come to the end of an eight-year term, and you have one year
left, everything you do obviously can be characterized in that way,'' Clinton
said. ``But if it's a legacy for the children of America, for hundreds of years
into the future, then it's not a bad gift to give.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president's action was praised by environmentalists, some
Arizona state and local officials accused him of ignoring local interests. ``We
think it is totally disrespectful of the local community,'' said Mohave County
Supervisor Carol Anderson, whose district covers the monument area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'll declare this monument. They'll go home, and we'll be left to take
care of it,'' said Joy Jordan, mayor of Fredonia, Ariz., a tiny community about
50 miles from the monument boundary. She said local residents worry that the
monument designation could hurt ranching and timber.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said he would hold hearings on the issue next
month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president proposes today ... is another executive order devoid of
public participation, partnership or broad local support,'' said Thomas,
chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's panel on parks.
``Unfortunately, attempting to build a record during the final year of his
presidency will mean more executive orders and federal regulations to limit
access for hunting and multiple use of public resources in the West.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he regrets that some people oppose his action, but feels most
Americans support his decision. ``We've tried to be -- and we will always be --
sensitive to the concerns and legitimate interests of local people, but I think
we've done a good job here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recommended last year that Clinton extend
protections at the Grand Canyon-Parashant, a jagged 1,500-square-mile desert
area dotted with junipers; Agua Fria, 71,000 acres encompassing two mesas filled
with Indian ruins, petroglyphs and other prehistoric treasures north of Phoenix;
Pinnacles; and hundreds of rocks and small islands that make up the California
Coastal National Monument.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there is one thing that unites our fractious, argumentative country
across generations and parties and across time, it is the love we have for our
land,'' Clinton said. ``We cannot improve upon this landscape. The only thing we
can add to it is our protection.''

<HEADLINE> After Whitman veto, lawmakers again push tax break for veterans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Just days after Gov. Christie Whitman vetoed a
similar bill, lawmakers on Tuesday took another stab at granting veterans'
groups and their auxiliaries a sales tax break in line with other charities.
<P>
	   Whitman last week vetoed such a bill, saying she wanted to wait until a
special committee assigned to study the effect of piecemeal sales tax exemptions
finishes its work before granting any more cuts. Lawmakers in the legislative
session that just ended had introduced more than 100 bills to carve out such tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate on Tuesday, however, used the final minutes of the 208th
Legislature to pass another bill on the issue. The Assembly had passed an
identical bill Monday. Aides to the state Senate said the latest version would
grant tax breaks to the veterans groups, but would also set up a legislative
study commission on the issue of tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a meaningful, tangible gesture of support for our veterans and the
organizations which serve them," said Sen. Diane Allen, R-Burlington, sponsor of
the upper house version.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman now has one week to sign the bill, or it will die. The legislation
is S-2301 and A-6.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Sniper Gets 20-Year Sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A former high school honor student was sentenced Tuesday
to at least 20 years in prison for a sniper attack on Interstate 80.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was hit in the chest and hospitalized but no one was killed in
the shooting rampage last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank God you're a bad shot,'' Washoe District Judge Steven Kosach told
Christopher Merritt, 21, of Mankato, Minn., who earlier pleaded guilty to six
counts of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You committed a cowardly act and pulled the trigger at least 12 times,''
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Merritt appeared somber and declined a chance to address the judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosach sentenced him to a range of 20 to 55 years. Merritt won't be eligible
for parole until serving the minimum.
</P>
<P>
	   Six vehicles were hit by gunfire that shut down a 10-mile stretch of I-80
west of here for four hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Merritt said in a series of jailhouse interviews with reporters that the
rampage was intended to be the start of a cross-country killing spree partly to
mock violence in the media.

<HEADLINE> Bruins' Allison Out for Season  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins forward Jason Allison will miss the rest of the
season after deciding Tuesday to have surgery -- first on his left thumb and
then on his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole year has been a disappointment," he said Tuesday night between
periods of the Bruins' game against Toronto. "The first game I hurt my arm. I
haven't been able to do things I know I can do."
</P>
<P>
	   Allison, who's been troubled by the wrist since last season, hoped to make
it through this campaign without surgery that would keep him out three to four
months.
</P>
<P>
	   After injuring thumb ligaments Saturday, he was told surgery could wait, the
Bruins said. But Dr. James Herndon said Tuesday the injury was more serious than
first thought and he will operate on Allison's thumb on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dr. Herndon looked at the MRI and determined that the left hand injury is
more serious that the wrist and should be repaired first," general manager Harry
Sinden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The wrist surgery will be pushed back four to five weeks so that Allison,
whose wife is expecting their first baby this month, won't have both hands in
casts at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to be able to brush my teeth, drive my car," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison has led the Bruins in scoring in each of his two full seasons with
the team. The 24-year-old center is the team's No. 3 scorer this season with 10
goals and 18 assists in 37 games, missing five because of the wrist.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a way, it could be a blessing in disguise," said Allison, whose left
hand was in a cast. "Instead of playing not even close to 100 percent and not
playing very well, at least this way I know it will be 100 percent when I come
back."

	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's presidential bid was endorsed
Tuesday by the Portsmouth Herald, which said the entire American electorate
would be ``well-served'' to have the Arizona senator as the Republican party's
nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is understandable that McCain's candidacy is scary to the establishment
at large, and it is the reason why the majority of Republican U.S. senators have
opted to support Texas Gov. George W. Bush,'' the newspaper said in its
announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper also said McCain's push to overhaul federal campaign finance laws
``is an attractive and powerful reason'' for supporting his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Union Leader of Manchester endorsed rival Steve Forbes.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Challenges have been filed to petitions in Sen. John
McCain's presidential campaign in New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, his campaign chairman in New York accused state Republican
leaders Tuesday of violating a pledge not to challenge the Arizona senator's
nominating petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The petitions are essential for McCain to get on as many ballots as possible
in the state's Republican primary March 7. Only the valid signatures of
registered Republicans count.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign Chairman Guy Molinari blamed GOP Gov. George
Pataki and state Republican Chairman Bill Powers for the challenges. McCain said
the challenges come days after GOP rival George W. Bush, who is backed by
Pataki, said he wouldn't challenge the New York nominating petitions of McCain,
his top challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   The general challenges were filed by various Republicans in different
election districts primarily upstate, said a spokesman for the state Board of
Elections.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters had qualified GOP primary delegate slates in 25 of the
state's 31 congressional districts through the state's cumbersome petition
process. That could be enough to give Bush an important and costly battle in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have his delegate slates on
the ballots statewide.

	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The securities and investment industry is giving
heavily to presidential candidates in hopes of influencing the debate over
privatizing Social Security, according to a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report says that during the first nine months of 1999, companies like
Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch gave $5.6 million to candidates through
individual and political action committee donations, and another $5 million in
unregulated soft money to political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonprofit New Hampshire Citizens Alliance and the ICAN Education
Foundation in Iowa, which are pushing for campaign finance reform, sponsored the
report. It is the fourth in a series looking at special interest money in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Of all candidates, the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
received the most from the companies and their employees -- $2,625,960, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrat Bill Bradley got $1,559,699; Vice President Al Gore, $952,131;
Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, $357,109; Steve Forbes, $116,750; and Gary
Bauer $41,075.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch each received $4,250.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups say the investment industry is giving most heavily to Bush
because he favors some privatization of Social Security.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. J.C. Watts on Tuesday urged Vice President Al Gore
to endorse pending legislation that offers an array of tax incentives to help
uplift poor communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the
legislation shows that Republicans have an agenda for improving the lives of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore last week sided with his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, who told an
interviewer that Republicans have no real program to help black people.
</P>
<P>

said Watts, who urged Gore to join Republicans in making a difference by
endorsing the legislation.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Heed Tax Cut Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy booming and government surpluses
soaring, Republican voters are demanding that Washington loosen its grip on its
extra cash and slash taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP presidential candidates are scrambling to heed the call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You leave this money in Washington, I guarantee you those guys'll spend
it,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in Monday night's presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
	   An echo was heard Tuesday from front-runner George W. Bush, who told voters
in Florence, S.C: ``Instead of leaving the money in Washington, where I believe
it will be spent on bigger government, I intend to pass it to the taxpayers of
South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican voters always hunger for tax cuts, but the strong economy may
have increased their appetites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a whole new world since 1996,'' said Republican pollster Whit Ayres,
who is not tied to any of the campaigns. ``What has changed is going from
deficit politics to surplus politics -- and that has increased the argument for
some sort of tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
	   While working for Lamar Alexander's failed 1996 campaign, Ayres asked likely
Iowa caucus-goers to identify the ``single most important problem'' facing the
country. The federal deficit ranked first, picked by 17 percent of the voters,
with morality and crime a close second.
</P>
<P>
	   All other issues, including taxes, were in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, Ayres polled 300 likely Iowa caucus-goers and asked them to
identify the ``single most important political issues.'' Topping the list at 22
percent was tax cuts, followed closely by morality.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, 1996 exit polls showed that tax cuts were less important
to voters than the economy and jobs. This year, tax cuts easily top the economy
as a concern, campaign pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   National surveys of Republicans suggest that the nation's morals are a
greater concern than tax rates, though tax cuts are consistently ranked high.
</P>
<P>
	   All avowed tax-cutters, the presidential candidates are squabbling over how
to split up the spoils of a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The field's top three prospects -- Texas Gov. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain
and publisher Steve Forbes -- are battling over how much of the surplus should
be spent on tax reductions and who can be trusted to keep the tax-cutting
pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, five-year tax package that would spend a
large chunk of projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose package is half the size of Bush's, sets aside 23 percent of
future surpluses for tax cuts and dedicates the rest to paying down the national
debt and bolstering Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent GOP pollster recently gave voters in early primary states a
choice between a generic candidate who supports tax cuts and a candidate who
``supports protecting and preserving Social Security.'' Nearly half took the
Social Security candidate, and less than 40 percent sided with the tax cutter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a recession, Republicans want a quick influx of cash. That's why
(Presidents) Reagan and Kennedy both correctly cut across-the-board rates during
economic downturns,'' said McCain adviser Dan Schnur. ``That's why John McCain
has devised a plan that includes a significant tax cut and saves Social
Security. It addresses both the short- and long-terms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Each campaign argues that it is driving the tax debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes pollster John McLaughlin said Bush proposed a large tax cut only
after he saw that Forbes was capable of ``getting traction in Iowa. All of a
sudden, he's a born-again tax cutter.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Texan introduced his plan, rival campaigns noticed that his poll
numbers climbed, particularly among economic conservatives who normally tilt to
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing his base would be seduced by Bush's plan, Forbes decided to air ads
accusing the governor of breaking a no-new-tax pledge in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Bush intends to broadcast an ad in Iowa later this week in
which he would promise to run a campaign free of cynical and negative politics.
An early draft of the spot has Bush complaining that, ``My opponent has chosen
to run a negative campaign,'' according to an adviser who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   To Republican voters, the issue is simple: Washington can't be trusted with
the economic windfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts are ``a very important issue to me,'' said Gerald Scott, a retiree
from St. Albans, Vt. ``I have children growing up and a lot of grandchildren;
I'd like to see them make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mildred Hendricks, 64, of Greensboro, N.C., said she would like to see
cheaper health care insurance and lower taxes -- two reasonable requests, she
said, with ``as much extra money as they've got up there in Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 3, Bruins 2  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Igor Korolev scored twice Tuesday night and Dmitri Khristich
had two assists against the team that walked away from him as the Toronto Maple
Leafs beat the Boston Bruins 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Korolev scored the tie-breaker 8:31 into the third period, and Toronto
improved to 8-0 in games when Korolev has scored this season. Curtis Joseph
stopped 33 shots for the Maple Leafs, who won for just the second time in six
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Rob Tallas made 23 saves for the Bruins, who are winless (0-4-2) in six
games and have won just once in 11 games. Anson Carter scored to tie it 2-2 but
missed twice in the final minute after Tallas had been pulled for an extra
skater.
</P>
<P>
	   Khristich won a $2.8 million arbitration award from the Bruins this fall but
the team "walked away" from the decision -- the first time an NHL team had taken
advantage of the right negotiated as part of the collective bargaining agreement
that ended the 1994-95 lockout.
</P>
<P>
	   He signed a four-year, $10 million deal with the Maple Leafs and scored a
goal in his first game against his former team on Nov. 11. But Toronto lost that
one, 4-3 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maple Leafs were able to win this time, stopping their slide with two
quick goals early and Korolev's tie-breaker late.
</P>
<P>
	   Korolev took a pass from Khristich, just as a Bruins penalty was expiring,
and flipped the puck over Tallas to make it 1-0 at 11:17 of the first. Just 101
seconds later, Khristich found Mats Sundin, who put it through Tallas' legs to
make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Heinze chipped the rebound of a Marquis Mathieu shot over Joseph to
make it 2-1 early in the second. Boston tied it just 23 seconds into the third
when Carter tipped P.J. Axelsson's cross into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruins forward Jason Allison will miss the rest of the season after deciding
Tuesday to have surgery -- first on his left thumb and then on his right wrist.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 117, Raptors 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reserve Aaron Williams scored a season-high 17 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds as the Washington Wizards snapped a three-game losing streak
with a 117-89 victory over the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Strickland scored 15 points and Jahidi White added 13 as Washington
posted its most lopsided triumph this season, eclipsing a 14-point victory over
New Jersey on Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven Wizards reached double figures as Washington improved to 4-8 against
Central Division opponents. Half of those victories have come against Toronto,
which missed a chance to take over third place in the Central.
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter scored 19 points and Antonio Davis had 14 points and 15
rebounds for the Raptors, who have dropped three straight. Tracy McGrady added
16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Toronto, which had been the only Central Division team with a winning road
record, fell to 8-8 away from home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards averted their first four-game skid of the season thanks to
Toronto's abysmal first-period shooting. The Raptors started out 5-for-23 from
the field and scored only 10 points in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   While Toronto struggled, the Wizards went on a 12-2 run midway through the
period, taking a 16-6 lead on Williams' bank shot with 3:03 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Juwan Howard scored the first four points of a 10-2 burst to open the second
quarter and Toronto made only one field goal over the period's first 6:26.
Washington led by as many as 25 on White's layin with 23.9 seconds remaining in
the half.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Returning from a tour of the Grand Canyon, President Clinton
visited Houston to help raise money for a key House supporter and to bolster
state Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was the keynote speaker at a $100,000 fund-raiser for Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who was a vocal defender of Clinton's on the
Judiciary Committee when the House impeached him in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The best thing about her is she fights,'' Clinton said, ``and she doesn't
give up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton walked a block through an opulent Houston neighborhood to the second
fund-raiser of the evening, which was held at the home of John Eddie Williams,
one of the plaintiff attorneys involved in the 1998 tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The event at Williams' house raised $125,000 for the Texas Legislative
Victory Fund, a committee established to boost Democrats in elections across the
state in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats control the state House, while Republicans control the Senate and
the governor's chair is occupied by Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that good economic times have given the nation an opportunity
to shore up its future, and he suggested that more Democrats were needed in
Congress to make key decisions. ``I don't want to see us squander this
opportunity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> No.11 Mich. St. 77, No.9 Ind. 71, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Morris Peterson forced overtime with a 3-pointer
and scored four more points in the extra session as No. 11 Michigan State
defeated No. 9 Indiana 77-71 to take over first place in the Big Ten on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The win left the Spartans (12-4, 3-0 Big Ten) the lone unbeaten team in
conference play. Indiana (12-2, 2-1), which never led in the five-minute
overtime, was held to just one basket in the extra period, a 3-pointer by
Michael Lewis with 4.0 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie Bell led the Spartans with 22 points and Peterson finished with 17.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Guyton scored 28 points for the Hoosiers, who were outrebounded 46-37.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson's 3-pointer with 11.3 seconds left in regulation was only the
Spartans' fifth basket over the final 10:44 and tied it at 62. Mateen Cleaves
heaved up a long shot from just inside midcourt at the buzzer for Michigan
State, but the ball spun out of the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Granger's layup 47 seconds into the overtime gave the Spartans a lead
they never lost. Two free throws by David Thomas gave Michigan State a 75-68
lead with 8.9 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis' 3-pointer cut it four points, then Granger sealed it with two free
throws with 2.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   With so much on the line, both teams looked a little nervous at the start.
In the first eight minutes, Indiana -- leading 11-9 -- had hit just 4 of 13
shots while the Spartans were shooting 3 of 14, and each team had turned the
ball over four times.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the first half settled into a game of runs. Guyton scored nine
points in a 9-0 burst that put Indiana ahead 25-20. But Bell scored six as the
Spartans answered with an 8-0 run for a 28-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-point play by Guyton tied it at 28, but Bell's 3-pointer from the
right corner just before the buzzer send Michigan State off with a 31-28
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleaves, making his first start since returning last week from a foot injury
that kept him sidelined for 10 weeks, had eight assists to claim the Michigan
State record with 653, eclipsing the old mark of 645 by Scott Skiles.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Wants Education Dept. Gone  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN BIEMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWALK, Iowa (AP) -- The Department of Education is part of a trend toward
``bureaucratic imperialism'' and should be abolished, Republican presidential
hopeful Alan Keyes told a group of Iowa educators Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative radio commentator said more decisions and financing should
be placed in the hands of parents and grassroots communities and not the federal
or state governments. He said he would filter a few of the departments functions
into other agencies as part of a massive downsizing of the federal government,
if elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A little less than half of the government survives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was appearing before about 70 teachers and school administrators with
the Professional Educators of Iowa, a nonpartisan association that opposes
mandatory teacher enrollment in unions. It was part of an education-oriented
day, in which he also spoke to a high school in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he supports school vouchers and home schooling, which he says
``helps recrystallize the role of parents in the education process.'' His
support of ``Right to Work'' laws, which give employees the choice of whether to
belong to a union, was popular with PEI.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Hawkins, the group's director and a school teacher for 30 years, said he
liked a lot of what he heard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is unwavering in his ethical stance, his eloquence is very
impressive,'' Hawkins said. ``Even if he does not win, he's valuable because
he's like a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Keyes focused on agriculture in an appearance before
about 350 people -- mostly students -- at Monroe PCM High School.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there should be an alternative to the Federal Reserve Bank, tailored
for farmers and based on the Biblical principal of ``seven fat years followed by
seven lean years.'' Keyes said his proposed bank would have to save surplus in
times when demands are met and build credit for when times are bad.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Syracuse 76, West Va. 63  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN RABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Tony Bland scored nine of his 22 points in the
final five minutes as No. 7 Syracuse beat West Virginia 76-63 Tuesday night to
remain the only unbeaten team in Division I.
</P>
<P>
	   Etan Thomas added 14 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks as the Orangemen
(12-0, 3-0 Big East) won for the second straight time on the road following a
10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
	   This one wasn't a cinch.
</P>
<P>
	   After Thomas went to the bench with his fourth foul midway through the
second half, Syracuse went scoreless over a five-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   West Virginia (7-6, 0-3) then went inside to pick away at a 10-point
deficit. Freshman Calvin Bowman's dunk started an 8-0 run that brought the
Mountaineers within 54-52 with 7:14 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas returned and his alley-oop dunk from Jason Hart with 5:48 left
started a decisive 14-2 run and the Mountaineers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
	   Bland hit a 3-pointer with five minutes left that put the Orangemen ahead
59-52.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse hit 17 of 21 free throws and the Big East's top defense limited
West Virginia to 41 percent shooting in the second half and 44 percent for the
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Junior Calvin Bowman scored a career-high 21 points on 10-of-16 shooting,
most of them inside shots. Marcus Goree added 17 and Lionel Armstead 12.
</P>
<P>
	   West Virginia's outside game was its sore spot. The Mountaineers made just
3-of-18 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the loss, West Virginia played the Orangemen tough for the fourth
straight time at home. The Mountaineers won two of their previous home meetings
and took Syracuse to overtime the other time.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, West Virginia is playing all 16 home games at arenas around the
state because of asbestos removal at its 14,000-seat venue.

Clinton To Expand Tax Break Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, expanding his election-year package of
tax initiatives, will offer a plan tomorrow to expand tax breaks for low-income
working Americans, an administration official said today. Clinton, in a speech
to the Democratic Leadership Council, will announce that he will ask Congress to
enlarge the earned income tax credit, which now is claimed by nearly 20 million
people. The credit already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign,
with Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley urging that more low-income working parents
be eligible for the credits and that the amount of help be increased.

	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a major effort to reach out to Hispanics, the
Republican National Committee plans to unveil a multimillion-dollar TV ad
campaign to try to attract the votes of a group that largely sides with
Democrats in national elections. GOP leaders from around the country today
opened what they are calling "The New Republican Century" with a brainstorming
session on Hispanic voters. During the meeting, RNC leaders and experts in
Hispanic politics will meet to set strategy, both in public and behind closed
doors.

$1.6B Colombia Aid Package Proposed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money alone will not fix the problems of drug violence
and corruption in Colombia, but $1.6 billion will go a long way toward
bolstering democracy there, the Clinton administration said today. The White
House proposed a package for the South American nation that President Clinton
said will stem the production and export of illegal narcotics, while supporting
economic development and improving human rights in Colombia. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is flying to Colombia this weekend to explain the package.

E. Timor Victims Exhumed from Graves
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LABUKOE, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. investigators exhumed two mass graves in
East Timor Tuesday and found the bodies of eight people who were likely killed
months before the province voted to break away from Indonesia. The investigators
had expected to find the remains of 18 East Timorese who were executed by
Indonesian-allied militiamen. But only eight bodies were recovered before heavy
rain suspended the work, officials said. Anti-independence militia violence both
before and after the U.N.-sponsored ballot in August left East Timor devastated.
At least 200 bodies have been recovered since international peacekeepers were
deployed in September to restore law and order.

Pinochet Deemed Unfit for Trial

	   LONDON (AP) -- Doctors ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand
trial on human rights abuse charges, the British government announced Tuesday,
opening the possibility that the former Chilean dictator could win his battle
against extradition to Spain. The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention
in Britain since his arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was
arrested on a Spanish warrant for alleged human rights violations committed
during his rule in Chile.

GM Stops Production of Electric Car
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has stopped production of its sleek EV1
electric car, citing waning interest from its customers. GM vice chairman Harry
J. Pearce said today that GM was shifting its attention from all-electric cars
to vehicles powered by hybrid fuel-electric systems and fuel cells, which use
hydrogen to create electricity. Pearce said the company had a sufficient supply
of EV1s on hand and said while GM could build more, there was "no particular

defeated No. 9 Indiana 77-71 to take over first place in the Big Ten tonight.
The win left the Spartans (12-4, 3-0 Big Ten) the lone unbeaten team in
conference play. Indiana (12-2, 2-1), which never led in the five-minute
overtime, was held to just one basket in the extra period, a 3-pointer by
Michael Lewis with 4.0 seconds remaining. Charlie Bell led the Spartans with 22
points and Peterson finished with 17.

<HEADLINE> UCLA's Rush Contrite Over Misstep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA forward JaRon Rush said Tuesday that greed prompted
him to accept money from an agent in violation of NCAA rules, which he admitted
was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just a stupid kid just doing stupid things," the 20-year-old Rush said
in his first public comments since being suspended Dec. 10. "I made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Rush declined to say how much money he received from agent Jerome Stanley of
Los Angeles, who has denied having anything more than a friendship with the
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not from a real rich family, so when times get hard, I try to take
advantage of it," Rush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush's grandmother, Jeanette Jacobs of Kansas City, has confirmed to the Los
Angeles Times that Rush admitted to her that he took four payments of $50 each
from Stanley.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA officials also are looking into Rush's relationship with his former AAU
coach Myron Piggie. Rush returned in November to Kansas City to testify in a
trial Piggie is involved in.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush practiced Tuesday with the Bruins for the second time since classes
resumed Monday. He has been allowed to rejoin the team while UCLA officials
continue investigating his case. However, he hasn't been cleared to play in
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush said he believes his chances of playing again are good, even if it
doesn't happen this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just hoping to get back," he said. "I'm not looking at a specific game
or a specific number of games, just as long as I'm back by this year's end.
Hopefully, that will happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Steve Lavin said he is glad to have Rush in practice to challenge
UCLA's starters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, we can't control the outcome right now of when it will be
determined that he can play again, so what we have to do is just work with him
in practice and hope he's ready when the opportunity presents itself," Lavin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush said UCLA athletic director Pete Dalis told him his scholarship would
still be honored if the NCAA ruled him ineligible for any further collegiate
competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Rush also said he would return to UCLA next season if he was suspended for
the rest of this season, because he isn't ready to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just a kid going just through harsh times right now," he said. "It's
just how you come over that and how you grow from it. That's what I'm trying to
go through right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Rush's younger brother, Kareem, will be eligible to return to playing for
Missouri on Jan. 29. He was suspended for receiving money from an AAU coach in
Kansas City prior to enrolling at Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have the agent deal in there, so it may be a little harsher penalty,"
Rush said. "He's dealing with it all right. He's coming back January 29, and
hopefully I'll be back a little bit after that."

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall Moderately  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell moderately Wednesday on profit-taking
following a decline on Wall Street. The dollar edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 128.82 points, or 0.68
percent, to 18,722.10 points at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the
average closed up 657.51 points, or 3.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.95 yen in late morning, up 0.37 yen from late Tuesday
in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 105.99 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices remained lower as Japanese information and high
technology issues came under selling pressure after U.S. counterparts moved
lower in New York trading on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 16.43 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,662.38. The TOPIX closed up
79.81 points, or 4.99 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar carried over its overnight strength against
the yen in overseas foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors bid up the greenback partly on the view that the G-7 may issue a
joint statement in support of yen-weakening measures at a meeting between the
group's finance ministers and central bankers in Tokyo next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The G-7 consists of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany,
Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has worried that recent rises by the yen against the dollar would hurt
the country's fledgling economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and thus less
competitive, while reducing the value of overseas profits when converted to yen.

<HEADLINE> Woman killed by Amtrak train in Elizabeth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - An Amtrak train bound for New York struck and
killed a woman Tuesday afternoon, delaying rail service on the Northeast
Corridor line.
<P>
	   The victim was not identified. Amtrak spokesman Russ Hall said she
apparently jumped off a platform at the Broad Street Elizabeth station into the
path of Train 110, a northbound Metroliner that had left Washington, D.C. at 11
a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   It was due to arrive in New York at 1:59 p.m., but struck the woman at 1:42
p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident caused delays of 15 minutes to 30 minutes on Amtrak and NJ
Transit until the accident was cleared at 3:46 p.m., Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 107 passengers on board were put aboard another Amtrak train that had
been following the Metroliner.
</P>
<P>
	   Trains used a second northbound track to bypass the accident until normal
service was restored.

<HEADLINE> 7-Year-Old Mackie Sold for $5M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Mackie, a 7-year-old mare in foal to the late Mr.
Prospector, sold Tuesday for $5 million, a record for Keeneland's January Horses
of All Ages Sale.
</P>
<P>
	Mackie was purchased early in the day by Britton House Stud of England. The
sales price broke the previous January record of $3.25 million, set last year
for Breeder's Cup Distaff winner Escena.
</P>
<P>
	The $5 million price tag makes Mackie the fifth-highest broodmare ever sold at
Keeneland. The top price paid was $7 million for Korveya in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Solar Slew, the 18-year-old dam of career money winner Cigar
and in foal to Deputy Minister, sold for $2.8 million to Lakland Farm.
</P>
<P>
	Then Tacha, a Mr. Prospector mare in foal to Seattle Slew, sold for $2.2
million to Kenny Troutt and Bill Casner.
</P>
<P>
	At night, Claxton's Slew -- the dam of Escena in foal to Storm Cat -- sold for
$3.3 million and champion mare Countess Diana sold for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	The top yearling to sell on Tuesday was hip number 599, a dark bay or brown
colt by Deputy Minister out of the Seattle Slew mare Slew Boyera.
</P>
<P>
	The colt, consigned by Taylor Made Farm as agent, was purchased for $500,000,
the third-highest price paid for a yearling colt in the January sale. The colt
was purchased by J.B.K. Inventure.
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Keeneland sold six horses for over $1 million and 245 horses
overall for a record $37,017,200.
</P>
<P>
	Through two days, Keeneland has sold 486 horses for $47,912,800, an average of
$98,586 per transaction.

<HEADLINE> Bush Responds to Rivals With New Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to his rivals on two campaign fronts, George
W. Bush is preparing to air new ads defending his commitment to Social Security
and accusing Steve Forbes of running a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad involving Forbes is in response to a spot the conservative publisher
is airing in Iowa and New Hampshire that accuses Bush of breaking a no-tax
pledge during his term as Texas' governor. It is tentatively scheduled to air in
Iowa this week, with the Bush campaign waiting to make sure Forbes' spot airs as
widely as promised.
</P>
<P>
	   In a draft of Bush's ad, he promises to run a campaign free of ``cynical and
negative politics'' and suggests, without mentioning his name, that Forbes has
not done so. ``My opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign,'' Bush says,
according to an adviser who read from the draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush hopes to capitalize on lingering resentment some Iowa voters feel
toward Forbes' 1996 critical ad campaign that hindered Bob Dole, the eventual
GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's internal polls have indicated that Forbes would be vulnerable to
accusations that he is going negative. The Bush campaign has been prepared since
the beginning to level the negative charge against Forbes as soon as he turned
critical of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' ad began running last week, and has not been on the air long enough
to determine its effect on Bush, the adviser said. But the governor's team did
not want to wait until damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had already received priceless attention by raising the accusation
during a GOP presidential debate Monday night in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   In focus groups last year, the Bush team tested the impact of ads it
produced to look like Forbes attacking the governor. At least one of those mock
ads involved Bush's tax record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate ad will soon run in New Hampshire to promote Bush's $483 billion,
five-year, tax-cut plan, with Bush assuring voters he could cut taxes and
protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is in a dead heat with Bush in New Hampshire,
has accused Bush of proposing to spend too much on tax cuts and nothing to shore
up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Also running in New Hampshire is a so-called ``real time'' ad that takes a
veiled slap at McCain. The real-time ads consist of footage of Bush campaign
events that are rushed into production and onto the air by Bush's media team. In
the latest spot airing Tuesday in New Hampshire, Bush tells viewers the surplus
could grow by $800 billion -- more than expected. ``That makes the idea of
having a paltry tax cut even more risky,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
	   While the ads display Bush's ability to fund an aggressive ad campaign, the
separate responses to McCain and Forbes also underscore a disadvantage: Only the
front-runner must deal with multiple criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how much Bush was spending on the first two ads, but the
adviser said they would be rolled into his heavy advertising schedule.

<HEADLINE> No. 16 Oklahoma 76, Baylor 43  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- No. 16 Oklahoma held Baylor to 13 first-half points
while bombarding the Bears from long range and coasted to a 76-43 victory
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   J.R. Raymond scored 20 and Eduardo Najera had 18 for the Sooners (14-1, 2-0
Big 12), who held Baylor to four field goals in the first half and 32 percent
shooting for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bears (9-4, 0-2), who scored only 17 in the first half of their
conference opener against Texas last week, were held to the second-fewest points
in a half in school history. The school record is seven points, against Illinois
State in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   It made for a miserable return for Baylor coach Dave Bliss, who coached
Oklahoma from 1975-80 and had not been back in Norman since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Baylor turned the ball over on four of its first five trips and didn't make
a field goal until Steve Othoro's follow dunk at the 13:38 mark. Terry Black,
Baylor's best player and one of the top scorers in the conference, added a steal
and dunk 20 seconds later to make it 13-8.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma made sure Baylor got no closer. While the Bears turned the ball
over on five of six possessions, the Sooners got two 3-pointers from Raymond and
another from Tim Heskett to push the lead to 22-5.
</P>
<P>
	   A 13-1 run a few minutes later gave Oklahoma a 35-9 lead. The Bears didn't
crack double figures until Jamie Kendrick's two free throws made the score 35-11
with 1:32 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma had eight 3-pointers in the first half and finished with 11. Baylor
was 2-of-15 from behind the arc and committed 22 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendrick scored 15, the only Baylor player in double figures. Black scored
just six, 10 below his average.

<HEADLINE> Company Recalls Oven Cleaner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The manufacturer of Easy-Off oven cleaner voluntarily
recalled 50,000 cans of the product Tuesday after receiving reports that a
faulty spray valve has caused skin and eye burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the oven cleaner's contents can
spew out because an improperly attached valve assembly can separate from the
can.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said the manufacturer, Reckitt &AMP; Colman Inc. of Wayne, N.J., had
received 18 reports of cans spewing oven cleaner and 12 reports of chemical
burns to consumers' skin and eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can identify the yellow 16-ounce aerosol can by the lettering
``Heavy Duty'' printed in white letters beneath the ``Easy Off'' product title;
and by the lot number, B9305-NJ2, printed at the can's bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   Supermarkets, hardware stores, mass merchandisers, and drug stores sold the
product nationwide between November 1999 and January 2000 for about $3 to $4.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission advised consumers who bought the recalled product to
wrap the can in several layers of newspaper and throw it away.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will send a replacement oven cleaner coupon to all affected by
the recall.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call Reckitt &AMP; Coleman at 1-888-993-3389
between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST Monday through Friday and between 9 a.m. and 10
p.m. EST Saturday and Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Declared Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A medical team found that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was too ill
to stand trial on charges of human rights abuses, the government announced
Tuesday, in a decision that may clear the way for the former dictator to return
home to Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling drew quick reaction in Chile where a group representing relatives
of alleged victims expressed its disappointment, while supporters declared it
was good for both Pinochet and for Chile. The Spanish government said it had no
plans to contest the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said a medical team who examined Pinochet on Jan. 5
unanimously agreed that he was too ill to face trial for alleged human rights
abuses, ``and that no change to that position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt he should not allow
Pinochet to be extradited. But it said he would not make a decision until
hearing arguments from parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old Pinochet has been under detention in Britain since his
arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago. He was arrested on a Spanish
warrant for alleged human rights violations committed during his rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement did not go beyond declaring Pinochet unfit, saying that
details of his condition were disclosed to the former Chilean leader but kept
``confidential'' otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the general has diabetes, suffers from arthritis and recently had
two mild strokes. In addition, the Sunday Times reported last weekend that the
official doctors found that -- in addition to his known health woes -- he also
has heart disease, a viral infection and that his diabetes has caused a loss of
sensation in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could lead to Pinochet's release on humanitarian grounds,
halting efforts to try him in connection with the disappearances and killings of
thousands of Chileans during his 17-year rule there.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement read that Straw ``is minded ... to take the view that no
purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and
that he should therefore decide not to extradite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said Straw would hear arguments from Chile and Spain as
well as three other countries who claim and other parties to the case before
making a final decision. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch also have been invited to submit comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chile, officials with the Organization of Relatives of Missing Detainees,
a group dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the
Pinochet dictatorship, said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous frustration and sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated,'' said Mireya Garcia, vice president of the organization. ``We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel, a close aide to Pinochet, said, ``this
is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process starts to
restore its sovereignty and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congressman Alberto Cardemil, also a close associate of Pinochet, called the
British decision ``a victory for a national cause, a cause of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Spain, foreign ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez Villanueva said the
government did not plan to intervene in the judicial process and would continue
``to respect the decisions coming from the British government.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate word from Judge Baltazar Garzon, whose arrest order
resulted in Pinochet's detention nearly 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Enrique Santiago said he would request that the Spanish National
Court ask British prosecutors for a new medical examination if Britain releases
him on humanitarian grounds. Attorney Carlos Slepoy called the medical team's
report ``a big error which does a lot of harm to the human rights cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's medical exam was done at the Chilean government's request. The
general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric specialists during a
seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, mainly Chileans but also some Spaniards, were killed or
disappeared after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight against being
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited. A hearing is scheduled to begin March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw can consider Pinochet's health in making a final ruling. But even if
he were to agree to release the general due to health concerns, Spain could
appeal that ruling, further prolonging the general's stay in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet also faces more than 50 individual lawsuits in Chilean courts,
which the government has said he should face if he returns. The government has
never pressed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of Pinochet's most forthright
supporters, said Tuesday: ``I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a
very fair man.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Calls Radio Show  </HEADLINE>
   By J.M. HIRSCH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- An on-air interview with Education Secretary Richard
Riley turned into a roundup of the Democratic presidential hopefuls' education
proposals when Bill Bradley placed a surprise call to a radio station Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Woodland, host of WSMN-AM's ``Between the Lines,'' was talking with
Riley about the federal government's role in schools when he got an unexpected
call.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Secretary, we have an unusual call here,'' Woodland told Riley, who
supports Vice President Al Gore. ``It says on my screen here that this is Bill
Bradley. I'm not going to guarantee that this is Bill Bradley. Caller?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hey Woody, how are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good. How are you? This doesn't sound like Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is Bill Bradley?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely,'' Bradley said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, now it does sound like Bill Bradley,'' Woodland conceded.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign officials said Bradley decided to call several New Hampshire radio
stations Tuesday night while campaigning in Iowa. They said he did not know
Woodland was speaking with Riley at the time he called the station in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodland asked Bradley to explain his education proposals and differentiate
them from Gore's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The difference is we both believe there should be a strong federal role in
education. I think I conceive of education though not only from K through 12,
but beginning at birth and extending through every life stage,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley then outlined some of his proposals, including attracting new
teachers to urban and rural areas, extend after-school and preschool programs,
and investing more money in community colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley said Gore would agree with most of Bradley's ideas, but said there is
an important difference between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that (Gore) has a much more activist view. His plans that he has
set out are much more specific and deal with specific areas of education instead
of just broad approaches to it,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary said he didn't think ``there is a whole lot of difference''
between Bradley and Gore in terms of their belief in the importance of
education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I do think in this campaign it has been clear that the vice president
has put education as a top priority, and I think Bill has put it as a priority
primarily for the state,'' Riley added.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Ind. Mail Bombing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A man confessed Tuesday to manufacturing and mailing
a bomb to another man who was having an affair with his wife, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Detective Gary Gulledge said 35-year-old Richard Rogier confessed to
using black powder and a camping flashlight to make a bomb, which he mailed to
Frank Valderas.
</P>
<P>
	   Gulledge said Valderas, 42, had been dating Rogier's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He stated that he wanted this guy to leave his wife alone, and he did it
just to scare him,'' Gulledge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Valderas opened the package Friday night and triggered the bomb. The
explosion left Valderas with first- and second-degree burns from his elbows to
his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogier faces state charges of bomb hurling, a Class B felony. Gulledge said
federal charges are forthcoming.

<HEADLINE> French Road Freight at Standstill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Thousands of foreign truck drivers were stranded at borders and
ports Tuesday for the second day as French truck company owners brought road
freight to a standstill to protest a law shortening the workweek.
</P>
<P>
	   Roadblocks were set up at 70 spots around the country, news reports said.
Foreign truckers bore the brunt of the disruption, but private cars were being
allowed through -- albeit with inevitable delays.
</P>
<P>
	   And there was little sign of immediate relief for the fuming foreign drivers
despite late-night talks in Paris Tuesday between Transport Ministry officials
and the truck owners' unions.
</P>
<P>
	   France Info radio said the barricades would remain in place Tuesday night
and into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The truck owners are protesting the French government's program to reduce
the working week from 39 hours to 35. They are also angry about a 30 percent
rise in diesel prices over the last year.
</P>
<P>
	   They say the law, aimed at reducing double-digit unemployment, will make
truckers far less competitive compared to their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   French truckers are among Europe's most militant. In November 1998, a strike
disrupted France and snarled traffic with neighboring nations for five days. In
October, truckers blocked roads and highways as part of Europe-wide protests
against plans to limit weekend driving in European Union countries.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 4, Hurricanes 3  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Simon Gagne scored a power-play goal with 1:19 left as
the Philadelphia Flyers extended their winning streak to six straight Tuesday
night with a 4-3 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Gagne's eighth of the season came on a rebound and with Carolina's Tommy
Westlund in the penalty box for charging.
</P>
<P>
	   An apparent game-winning goal by Westlund with 2:50 remaining was waved off
by referee Richard Trottier. He said Westlund interfered with Flyers goalie John
Vanbiesbrouck as he was poking at the puck in the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Roberts scored his 300th career goal with 12:43 left as Carolina took a
3-2 lead. Roberts scored on a back-hander in the slot off a pass from Jeff
O'Neill to become just the sixth NHL player to score 300 goals and log 2,000
penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Carolina's first lead of the night didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia, with the top power-play unit in the NHL, got only two chances
with the man-advantage, but made both count.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Brind'Amour picked a rebound out of the air to tie it 3-3 three minutes
after the Roberts' go-ahead goal, then Gagne scored the game-winner as the
Flyers improved to 6-0-1 in their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams exchanged three goals in a three-minute span early in the second
period after the Flyers had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Gelinas tied it when his wrist shot beat Vanbiesbrouck high on the
stick side.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-six seconds later, Philadelphia regained the lead when Eric Lindros
lost Ron Francis behind the net and fed John LeClair in the slot. It was
LeClair's 24th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, with Lindros off for elbowing, Andrei Kovalenko threaded a shot
between Vanbiesbrouck's pads and the post for his ninth of the season and third
in three games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers wasted little time getting on the board, scoring on their first
flurry in front of Arturs Irbe. Valeri Zelepukin put in a rebound just 1:09 in.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes managed just two shots on Vanbiesbrouck in the opening 20
minutes. That came on the heels of a two-shot third period against the Flyers in
a 4-1 loss on Nov. 11 -- the last meeting between the clubs.

<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Sergei Zholtok and Benoit Brunet scored in the second
period as the Montreal Canadiens ended a seven-game winless streak Tuesday night
with a 3-0 victory over the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Theodore, starting in place of flu-ridden Jeff Hackett, made 28 saves
for his second shutout of the season -- third career -- for Montreal, which last
won Dec. 20 against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Dainius Zubrus scored in the third period for the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Wings, who own the NHL's best record (27-12-4-1), ended a two-game
winning streak and were shut out for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the Red Wings' most dangerous chances came during a pair of
four-minute power plays -- one early in the second and the other in the third,
which included two minutes with a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   The announced crowd of 20,296 saw Theodore rob Larry Murphy with a glove
save during the first power play and watched Steve Yzerman shoot wide of an open
net during the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal took 26 shots at Chris Osgood.
</P>
<P>
	   Zholtok banged in the rebound of Eric Weinrich's shot on a rush 8:01 into
the second for his career-high 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet deflected in Patrice Brisebois' low point shot during a power play
with seven seconds left in the period to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Zubrus was given credit for his ninth goal at 12:33 of the third after his
shot fell into the crease and Arron Asham banged Murphy's stick, causing the
puck to slide into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadiens lost their previous four meetings with Detroit, with their
last victory over the Red Wings on Jan. 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal went into the game on a 0-4-3 run, with three straight losses.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 95, Bulls 88  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing would have sat out another fourth quarter and
no one would have cared, except the Knicks found another way to blow a big lead
before their center returned and New York hung on to beat the Chicago Bulls
95-88 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knicks led by 25 points entering the final quarter but let the lead slip
to just two with 1:06 left as Chicago went on a 33-10 run.
</P>
<P>
	   With the fans at Madison Square Garden on the edge of their seats and the
arena as loud as it was during Bulls-Knicks games of old, Larry Johnson hit a
3-pointer with 47 seconds left to put the Knicks back up by five.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand was called for traveling on Chicago's next possession, and Allan
Houston hit a pair of foul shots with 35 seconds left to send any thought
Chicago had of extending its winning streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson led the Knicks with 19 points, Houston had 15, Ewing had 14 points
and 14 rebounds and Latrell Sprewell also scored 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing, who was benched by coach Jeff Van Gundy for the final 16 minutes of
the Knicks' previous game -- a loss to Cleveland -- looked like he was going to
have the luxury of kicking back in his chair to enjoy a rare blowout. But the
Knicks, who have made a habit of blowing big leads in the fourth quarter, let it
happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-point play by Ron Artest cut the lead to 12 with 5:31 left, forcing
Van Gundy to re-insert Ewing and Larry Johnson. Artest followed with a
3-pointer, Will Perdue dunked and Artest drove around Ewing for a layup that
made it 86-81.
</P>
<P>
	   Artest hit one of two free throws with 1:08 left to cut the deficit to four,
and Brand grabbed the offensive rebound off Artest's miss and converted it to
pull Chicago within two, 90-88, before the Knicks held on.
</P>
<P>
	   New York improved to 10-4 since Ewing rejoined the team last month following
his recovery from a partially torn Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
	   Artest scored 24 and Toni Kukoc had 22 to lead the Bulls, who were coming
off back-to-back-to-back victories over the Wizards (twice) and Celtics -- a
trio of wins that were mockingly called the Bulls' first three-peat since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing, who shot 2-for-8 from the field and 10-for-10 from the line, left the
game with 3:47 remaining in the third quarter and New York ahead by 21. The
Knicks eventually went ahead by 27 in the third quarter before Chicago mounted
its comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Ewing gave the Knicks the lead for good on a seven-foot jumper with 2:13
left in the first quarter that made it 16-15. New York was ahead by seven by the
end of the quarter and by 14 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson had a pair of 3-pointers in the first 6 1/2 minutes of the third
quarter, the second of which put New York ahead 71-47. A tip-in by Houston made
it 80-53 with 24 seconds left in the third.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Sergei Brylin scored the go-ahead goal with just under
eight minutes left and the New Jersey Devils extended their unbeaten streak to
nine games Tuesday night in a 6-5 victory over the struggling Tampa Bay
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devils' unbeaten streak (7-0-2), the NHL's longest this season, is the
team's best since a franchise record-tying 13-game run two years ago. The
Lightning are in the midst of a 12-game winless drought (0-10-2), their fourth
winless streak of 10 or more games in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Brylin scored a rebound goal at 12:13, just 39 seconds after Tampa Bay's
Paul Mara tied it 5-5.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrik Elias, who has eight goals and 11 points during an eight-game
point-streak, and Brad Bombardir scored 25 seconds apart late in the second
period as New Jersey improved to 11-1-1 in its past 13 games against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the Devils' season-high fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay took out years of frustration against Devils goalie Martin
Brodeur, scoring three times -- including twice in 21 seconds by Robert
Petrovicky and Bruce Gardiner -- to take a 3-2 first-period lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Brodeur entered the game 16-3-2 with a 1.64 goals-against-average against
the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Sillinger had Tampa Bay's other first-period goal. Scott Gomez, the
only rookie to lead his team in scoring, and Claude Lemieux scored in the
opening period for the Devils.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Tests Slow Burn Paper  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette company,
plans consumer tests of a slower-burning paper that may reduce the risk that a
dropped or discarded cigarette will start a fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand announced Tuesday that it
expects to start the tests of the paper with its Merit cigarettes within six
months. It has yet to select the test markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our goal is to manufacture and market cigarettes that are less likely to
cause fires when carelessly handled and that are acceptable to consumers," John
Nelson, senior vice president of operations for Philip Morris USA, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials say cigarettes account for more fatal home fires than any
other single consumer product.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement was welcomed as long-overdue by safety groups. Critics said
experts concluded years ago that it was technically feasible to make such
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is tragic that it has taken so long," said Andrew McGuire, executive
director of the Trauma Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that has pushed
for development of cigarettes less likely to start fires.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philip Morris officials said it has been hard to find a solution that
can work on the fast-moving machinery used in making billions of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   About 900 people, including 140 children, were killed in home fires caused
by cigarette fires in 1997, the most recent year for which the Consumer Product
Safety Commission had figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris has come up with a system in which two slim bands of paper are
attached to the inner surface of the regular paper that wraps a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Carnovale, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, said the bands slow the
rate at which the cigarette burns when the lit portion passes over the bands.
Under test conditions, she said that has made it less likely that the cigarette
would ignite certain types fabrics, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said smokers usually can't see the bands and find no difference in the
taste or effort required to inhale. She said the bands and slower burn rate
don't add to the health risks of smoking for smokers or those near them.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the bands may cause cigarettes to go out if left unattended in
an ashtray, and the consumer tests are needed to determine whether smokers
object to that.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, she said Philip Morris wants to know whether making a cigarette
that is less likely to set the couch on fire makes smokers more careless about
they handle their cigarettes. "It can't change behavior. It is still a lit
cigarette and people should not smoke in bed," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said consumer tests typically take six months to a year, and said the
test will not likely be expanded to the company's other brands before then.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann Brown, chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said Philip
Morris briefed her staff about the new technology last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "They spoke to us generally about it, but they didn't share technical date
and we don't know if the cigarette will really work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency cooperated with a study that concluded in 1984 that it was
technically feasible and commercially viable to make cigarettes that were less
likely to start fires, said agency spokesman Russ Rader.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris' two main rivals will be watching the test closely.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nations' second-biggest, has been unable to
come up with a cigarette that is both less likely to start a fire and is
acceptable to consumers, spokesman Seth Moskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which ranks third, is working on it as
well, said spokesman Steve Kottak. "It is very difficult to make a smokable
fire-safe cigarette," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco critic Kathryn Kahler Vose, a spokeswomen for the Campaign for
Tobacco Free Kids, questioned the timing of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome a cigarette that will reduce deaths from cigarettes, but the
timing is curious," she said, noting that Philip Morris's parent is in the midst
of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign to improve its image.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us appoints top executive from upscale FAO Schwarz as its  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Toys R Us Inc., a merchandiser to the masses, on Tuesday
picked the top executive from exclusive FAO Schwarz to try to lead it to a
recovery from sagging sales and profits.
<P>
	   John Eyler's appointment as president and chief executive of Toys R Us was
lauded by analysts because of his extensive background in the toy business. But
there was some concern on Wall Street whether he had the know-how to lead a
turnaround of a 1,500 store chain.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us shares fell as much as 9 percent in early trading Tuesday to
$11.43 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. By 5:15 p.m., shares fell $1.06 1/4,
or by 8.4 percent, to $11.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler comes on board after a tough year for Toys R Us, with its sales and
profits coming under pressure. Once the nation's No. 1 selling toy chain, Toys R
Us now trails giant discounter Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Paramus, N.J.-based company warned that it would miss 1999
earnings forecasts and reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell 2
percent during the holiday season, due in part to some shortages of popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to boost its business, Toys R Us has been renovating its U.S.
stores, creating a brighter layout that is easier to navigate. It also has been
stepping up its efforts on the Internet to better compete with online rivals
Amazon.com and eToys.
</P>
<P>
	   But both areas still need tremendous work.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has about three-quarters of its 710 U.S. toy stores left to
redesign. It also must drastically improve the delivery and customer service
systems of its Web sites, Toysrus.com, after many complaints during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a lot ahead of this company to do," said Margaret Whitfield, a toy
analyst at the investment firm Tucker Anthony. "I am anxious to see what Eyler
will do to get this company back on track."
</P>
<P>
	   Some concern over his appointment stems from the fact that Eyler comes from
a toy chain far different than Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
	   While Toys R Us is best-known for its super-sized stores stacked high with
toys like Barbie dolls and board games, FAO Schwarz fills its stores with
expensive toys, such as the $8,500 Mercedes kids cars or limited edition Steiff
stuffed bears.
</P>
<P>
	   FAO Schwarz doesn't run sales or discount promotions, and many of its 42
stores are located in posh addresses, such as on Fifth Avenue in New York and at
the high-end Forum Shops mall in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   While the differences in the Toys R Us and FAO Schwarz businesses raised
eyebrows, analysts also were quick to point out the successes that Eyler has had
since he joined FAO as its chairman and CEO in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He is credited with updating the upscale toy chain's image, improving its
profitability and boosting its selection of exclusive toy lines. About 70
percent of the toys found in FAO Schwarz aren't sold elsewhere, up from 30
percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Going to an FAO is always a first-class shopping experience. Parents and
kids walk out of there loving the experience they had in the stores," said Jim
Silver, publisher of The Toy Book, a toy industry trade magazine. "It would be
great if he could do the same at Toys R Us."
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler said he hoped Toys R Us could expand its exclusive deals with
toymakers. In addition, he said that he'd like to follow a practice at FAO
Schwarz of stocking products of smaller toymakers, businesses that have had
problems making inroads at large toy chains.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyler also said in an interview with The Associated Press that he'd like
Toys R Us to develop its own products.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts pointed out that Elyer's experience extends beyond brick-and-mortar
stores. FAO Schwarz, a division of Vendex NV of Amsterdam, Netherlands, also
operates a catalog and a Web site, and Eyler's expertise in those areas should
be an asset as Toysrus.com looks to improve its online business.
</P>
<P>
	   Toys R Us has been operating without a permanent CEO since August, when
Robert Nakasone resigned abruptly. Since then, chairman Michael Goldstein has
been acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old Eyler will take the helm of Toys R Us on Monday. John
Barbour will remain CEO of Toysrus.com, reporting to Eyler.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its U.S. toy stores, Toys R Us also operates 454 international toy
stores, 205 Kids R Us clothing stores, 130 Babies R Us stores and 45 Imaginarium
specialty toy stores.

<HEADLINE> Labor Dept. Backpeddles Again  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department, which caused a storm a week ago
over a ruling on safety for at-home workers, came under fire again Tuesday for
telling a company it must figure stock options into worker's overtime pay rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Department officials rushed to provide a same-day response to complaints
Tuesday by Washington-based LPA Inc., an association of corporate human
resources executives, which said the guidance could discourage companies from
offering stock options lower-level employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said the guidance letter, written in February 1999, had been
tailored to a specific circumstances presented by one company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are (other) circumstances under which stock option programs would
not need to be included when calculating overtime,'' said a letter to LPA from
Employment Standards Administration Wage and Hour Division Administrator T.
Michael Kerr.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerr's letter did not elaborate, but invited LPA officials to meet with him
to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time in two weeks that the Labor Department has faced
criticism for advice given to one company in guidance letters that are routinely
publicly released and consulted by others.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, in a controversy that lawmakers have promised to follow up with
an investigation, the department withdrew a letter that told a Texas credit
services firm that companies have the same safety responsibilities for employees
working at home as in the office.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock option guidance letter responded to an unidentified corporate
attorney's questions about a hypothetical stock option plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers included in the hypothetical plan would be able to choose to buy 100
shares of their company's stock at a preset price any time during a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Department officials said that under such a scenario, the company
should treat the stock options as part of the worker's normal compensation --
not a special bonus or profit-sharing plan. That would mean a higher base pay
for the worker and therefore a higher overtime rate.
</P>
<P>
	   LPA, in a written complaint sent to Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, noted
that a growing number of companies offering similar stock option plans to hourly
wage workers don't currently count them as normal compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We recently circulated the letter among our members and those who provide
such options to nonexempt (from overtime) employees are very upset with the
opinion,'' said president Jeffrey McGuiness in LPA's complaint.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders More Northwest Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Northwest Airlines
and the union representing its flight attendants to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Donovan Frank, who last week ordered the union to take steps to stop
its members from staging a "sickout" over stalled contract negotiations, gave
both sides until Friday to choose a private mediator or give him a list of
mutually acceptable mediators.
</P>
<P>
	   In his order, Frank wrote, "The time has long since passed for the parties
to reach a fair and appropriate contract." He indicated a settlement would be in
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with Northwest and the Teamsters Local 2000 did not return phone
calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The union of 11,000 Northwest flight attendants has been seeking a new
contract since September 1996. In late August, Local 2000 members overwhelmingly
rejected a tentative agreement that had been endorsed by union negotiators.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Special-Teams Coach Ousted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Bruce DeHaven was fired Tuesday as Buffalo's
special-teams coach, three days after his unit allowed the game-winning
touchdown in the Bills' playoff loss to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   The game-winning 75-yard touchdown return -- which will go down as one of
the most remarkable plays in NFL playoff history -- came when the Bills'
coverage unit overpursued the ball, leaving the entire left sideline open for
the Titans' Kevin Dyson, who caught a lateral from Frank Wycheck.
</P>
<P>
	   "You would hope the work you've done during the season or during your whole
career would mean more than one play," DeHaven told the Buffalo News. "But I
also know that these things happen in the National Football League."
</P>
<P>
	   Following Saturday's game, Bills coach Wade Phillips made it clear he wasn't
happy with special-teams overall performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans' first touchdown came when the Bills gave up a 42-yard return off
a free kick. A penalty gave Al Del Greco a second chance to kick a field goal at
the end of the half, and the Bills also gave up a 30-yard kickoff return and a
16-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
	   DeHaven, who hopes to be hired by another NFL team, was hired by Marv Levy
in 1987. Under him, the Bills' kickoff coverage team ranked No. 1 in the NFL
four years in a row (1987-1990), and in 1991, the Bills set a punt coverage
record -- yielding only 53 yards in 16 games -- that still stands.

	   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame's offense is no secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Pound the ball inside to 6-foot-5 center Ruth Riley and then pop it outside
to whichever guard is hot.
</P>
<P>
	   Stopping it is another matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley had 17 points and 13 rebounds and Niele Ivey added 14 points and 10
assists as the No. 6 Irish beat Seton Hall 80-52 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley added seven blocks, one short of a school record, as Notre Dame (12-2,
3-0 Big East) won its 15th straight at home, tying a school record.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ruth and Niele are both playing like All-Americans right now," coach Muffet
McGraw said. "Niele is the best point guard in the league if not in the
country."
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, the Irish were sluggish at times and had problems with the press
Seton Hall (6-7, 0-3) went to after realizing it was being hurt by letting Riley
set up in the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 48-28 early in the second half, Seton Hall was able to utilize the
press to force Notre Dame into three straight turnovers. That allowed the
Pirates within 49-37 with 13:15 left, their smallest deficit since midway
through the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irish responded with an 11-0 run that began and ended with 3-pointers by
Alicia Ratay. Seton Hall didn't seriously challenge again.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratay finished with 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "We decided we couldn't guard Ruth, so we might as well go small and try to
make it more of an open court," Seton Hall coach Phyllis Mangina said. "We got
some turnovers. We just didn't capitalize. Then they came right back and killed
us."
</P>
<P>
	   Playing without 6-foot-2 forward Leslie Ardon, out with a broken hand, the
Pirates couldn't match Riley inside. But the Irish also had problems getting
Riley the ball, forcing lob passes into the paint. Combined with their problems
with the press, the Irish committed 25 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It concerns me a great deal. We gave them too many easy opportunities,"
McGraw said. "A lot of the turnovers weren't forced. We were trying to make an
extra pass. We didn't put any zip on it and just left it out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Seton Hall's 52 points matched the lowest offensive output of any
Notre Dame opponent this season. The Pirates shot 21-of-70 from the field --
just 1-of-11 from 3-point range -- and had 23 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr Fuller scored 13 points to lead the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Playing against teams at that next level, the top 10, they capitalize on
those things," said Mangina, whose three Big East losses this season are to No.
1 Connecticut, No. 9 Rutgers and the Irish. "I don't know anyone else in the
country that's just played No. 1, No. 6 and No. 9. That's a tough way to start
the league."

Pinochet Found Unfit for Trial
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A medical team found that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was too ill
to stand trial on charges of human rights abuses, the government announced
Tuesday, in a decision that may clear the way for the former dictator to return
home to Chile. The ruling drew quick reaction in Chile where a group
representing relatives of alleged victims expressed its disappointment, while
supporters declared it was good for both Pinochet and for Chile. The Spanish
government said it had no plans to contest the announcement.

New Hampshire that accuses Bush of breaking a no-tax pledge during his term as
Texas' governor. It is tentatively scheduled to air in Iowa this week, with the
Bush campaign waiting to make sure Forbes' spot airs as widely as promised.

to the Democratic Leadership Council, will announce that he will ask Congress to
enlarge the earned income tax credit, which now is claimed by nearly 20 million
people. The credit already has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign,
with Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley urging that more low-income working parents
be eligible for the credits and that the amount of help be increased.

E. Timor Victims Exhumed from Graves

<P>
	   LABUKOE, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. investigators exhumed two mass graves in
East Timor Tuesday and found the bodies of eight people who were likely killed
months before the province voted to break away from Indonesia. The investigators
had expected to find the remains of 18 East Timorese who were executed by
Indonesian-allied militiamen. But only eight bodies were recovered before heavy
rain suspended the work, officials said. Anti-independence militia violence both
before and after the U.N.-sponsored ballot in August left East Timor devastated.
At least 200 bodies have been recovered since international peacekeepers were
deployed in September to restore law and order.

<HEADLINE> Report: Deutsche Telecom Deal Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By ANNA SATHIAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- A proposed deal between Singapore Telecom and Germany's
Deutsche Telekom to pool their resources in Southeast Asia has fallen through, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore's Business Times reported that a proposed "billion-dollar deal" is
"as good as dead" because Deutsche Telekom's Malaysian partner, Technology
Resources Industries, was reluctant to have Singapore Telecom as a partner.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore Telecom refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsche Telekom Asia spokeswoman Ann Tan said she could not comment on the
report. Technology Resources Industries' managing director Tajuddin Ramli was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, Deutsche Telekom owns 21 percent of Technology
Resources Industries, whose cellular phone subsidiary, Celcom, was one of the
key attractions for Singapore Telecom in the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were other attractions for the two sides, said Michael Millar, a
telecoms analyst at investment bank SG Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutsche Telekom has equity stakes not only in Technology Resources
Industries, but also in PT Satelindo in Indonesia, and Islacom in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore Telecom has a stake in two telecommunications companies, Globe in
the Philippines and Thailand's Advanced Info.
</P>
<P>
	   "The plan was to pool all those assets under one holding," Millar said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Technology Resources Industries' reluctance to enter into a deal
with Singapore Telecom means the latter is unlikely to gain a foothold in
Malaysia's mobile phone market as all the Malaysian players already have
partners.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Wants Education Dept. Gone  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN BIEMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWALK, Iowa (AP) -- The Department of Education is part of a trend toward
``bureaucratic imperialism'' and should be abolished, Republican presidential
hopeful Alan Keyes told a group of Iowa educator Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative radio commentator said more decisions and financing should
be placed in the hands of parents and grassroots communities and not the federal
or state governments. He said he would filter a few of the departments functions
into other agencies as part of a massive downsizing of the federal government,
if elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A little less than half of the government survives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was appearing before about 70 teachers and school administrators with
the Professional Educators of Iowa, a nonpartisan association that opposes
mandatory teacher enrollment in unions. It was part of an education-oriented
day, in which he also spoke to a high school in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he supports school vouchers and home schooling, which he says
``helps recrystallize the role of parents in the education process.'' His
support of ``Right to Work'' laws, which give employees the choice of whether to
belong to a union, was popular with PEI.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Hawkins, the group's director and a school teacher for 30 years, said he
liked a lot of what he heard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is unwavering in his ethical stance, his eloquence is very
impressive,'' Hawkins said. ``Even if he does not win, he's valuable because
he's like a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Keyes focused on agriculture in an appearance before
about 350 people -- mostly students -- at Monroe PCM High School.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there should be an alternative to the Federal Reserve Bank, tailored
for farmers and based on the Biblical principal of ``seven fat years followed by
seven lean years.'' Keyes said his proposed bank would have to save surplus in
times when demands are met and build credit for when times are bad.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes ended the day with a rally of about 400 people at a motel in Des
Moines, where he delivered one of his trademark orations, invoking the Bible and
the Founding Fathers as he touched on abortion, welfare, national security, and
the income tax -- which he called ``one of the most ingenious schemes of
subjugation in history.''

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Found on Ship  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Three Chinese stowaways were found dead this week in a cargo
container that arrived aboard a ship from Hong Kong -- the first known deaths in
what has suddenly become one of the busiest methods of smuggling immigrants into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Crammed into 40-foot, canvas-topped corrugated-metal boxes, the stowaways
try to survive on bottled water and little food for the two-week voyage across
the Pacific from China.
</P>
<P>
	   Immigration officers have stepped up efforts to catch the immigrants and the
smugglers they pay up to $50,000 to make the trip, but the boxes keep coming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until now, the prices migrants have paid for illegal passage to the United
States have been high in terms of dollars,'' said Bob Coleman, acting director
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Seattle, ``but in a situation
like this, where lives are lost, the cost is unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, federal officials boarded the Cape May, a Japanese-owned
freighter that left Hong Kong for Seattle on Dec. 27, and found three dead
Chinese and 15 others in threadbare clothes and bare feet. All of them required
medical care, and seven remained hospitalized Tuesday in satisfactory condition.
The cause of the deaths was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday morning, 19 more immigrants, all in relatively good health, were
found in a container from a ship that likewise docked in Hong Kong before
arriving here.
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Irene Mortensen said conditions inside the container from
the Cape May were deplorable. People barely had enough room to lie down, and had
only the bedding and survival gear they brought with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Food consisted of slowly rotting vegetables and crackers. The only toilet
was a bucket; the only ventilation came from holes cut in the canvas roof.
</P>
<P>
	   For anywhere from three to seven days, the 15 survivors, many of them
seasick, lay next to the bodies of the dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, authorities in Long Beach, Calif., arrested 30 illegal
immigrants from China after they crossed the Pacific in cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
	   Their travel conditions were better than those of the group caught in
Seattle. The containers had food, water, battery-powered lights, portable
potties, cell phones and ladders for climbing out.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Chinese smugglers called ``snakeheads'' have been bringing
illegal immigrants to this country aboard ships to both coasts and through
Canada. But the use of the sealed containers is a relatively new twist, and
Monday's deaths were the first known to have occurred through that method.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, authorities caught 203 people smuggled via container to
West Coast ports in the United States and Canada. How many more make it through
isn't known.
</P>
<P>
	   Most West Coast ports handle freight almost exclusively in containers. The
ports move tens of thousands of containers each year -- the largest ships carry
5,000 or more -- and there is no telling from the outside which of the boxes
might hold people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's certainly a growing sophistication on the part of smugglers,''
said David Bachman, chairman of the University of Washington's China studies
program. ``I would expect that for each container caught, there must be some
multiple that are getting through.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong officials have vowed to crack down on human smuggling. Some
speculate that rival smuggling gangs have been anonymously tipping off
authorities, trying to drive each other out of business.
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting late Tuesday, Hong Kong customs officials pledged to step up
inspection of ships leaving Hong Kong, including the use of modern technology
such as heat detection, to prevent illegal migrants from boarding the ships or
hiding in containers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipping companies pledged to immediately report any suspicious looking
cargo on their ships, and to scrutinize business registration and documentation
of new clients before accepting shipments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apart from these measures, the Hong Kong customs will reinforce the
terminal patrol inside the container storage yard,'' Hong Kong customs senior
superintendent Ronald Aau Yee-Leung said in a statement released after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the arrests and recent deaths, human smuggling is expected to
continue as Chinese lured by dreams of financial or political freedom try to get
to the United States. The INS estimates as many as 27,000 illegal Chinese were
in the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are people who are glad and happy to go through something like this
in order to reach America,'' said Dan Danilov, an immigration attorney
representing three of the latest illegal immigrants to arrive in Seattle. ``This
means a new life for them.''

<HEADLINE> Kaiser, Steelworkers Negotiate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Kaiser Aluminum Corp. and its locked-out Steelworkers
began yet another round of talks Tuesday to try and end a 16-month labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, in Washington, D.C., include incoming Kaiser chief executive
officer Ray Milchovich, along with top officials of the United Steelworkers
union.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the length and the slow pace of progress in the negotiations, Kaiser
welcomes the opportunity to bring together these top officials in an effort to
find a mutually acceptable path toward settlement," Kaiser spokeswoman Susan
Ashe said in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
	   But she cautioned that the gap between the two sides remains wide.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Russell, president of Steelworkers Local 329 in Spokane, was pessimistic
after a long day of talks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not going to resolve this thing in four days," Russell said in a
telephone interview from Washington, D.C. "The gap's just too wide."
</P>
<P>
	   But both sides hope to find some common group that will allow them to
eventually resolve their differences, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute began as a strike in September 1998 by 2,900 Steelworkers at
five Kaiser plants. Last January, the workers offered to return while
negotiations continued, but Kaiser locked them out.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the two plants in the Spokane area, and others in Tacoma,
Gramercy, La., and Newark, Ohio, have operated with replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute centers on pay, benefits and job security. A major stumbling
block has been Kaiser's plan to cut about 700 union jobs, replacing some 240 of
the jobs by contracting with lower-paid, non-union workers.

<HEADLINE> Critics Fear Dilution of News  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The nation may get its news from more places than ever these
days. But the blockbuster merger of Time Warner and America Online, as well as
big media combinations expected in the future, are raising concerns about
homogenized and diluted news.
</P>
<P>
	   "What this merger invites is the possibility of a new era in American
communications that sees the end of an independent press," said Tom Rosenstiel,
director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is as alarmed. Richard Epstein, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, said the Internet still offers a worldwide venue for
dissenting voices. He added the industry is still diverse enough to keep itself
in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there are just two newspapers in town, one will happily dump on the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $145 billion stock deal announced Monday allies AOL's 22 million online
subscribers with a news and entertainment conglomerate that includes CNN, Time
magazine, TBS, TNT, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Miller, communications director at Time Warner Inc., said the merger
will enhance, not limit, the flow of information by creating new ways to
communicate. He added the Internet makes it impossible for one group to stifle
the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet is the first limitless medium, and by its very nature, no
single company or group can hope to control it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Media mergers are nothing new, beginning in earnest in the mid-1980s with
the takeovers of TV networks, including ABC and NBC, Dean Alger, author of the
1998 book "Megamedia," said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The trend accelerated in 1996 after Congress passed the Telecommunications
Act in an attempt to spur competition. Instead of making it easier for companies
to compete, the opposite has occurred, Alger said -- the big mergers that grew
out of the law means today's media are run increasingly by a dwindling number of
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   In his book -- subtitled "How Giant Corporations Dominate Mass Media,
Distort Competition, and Endanger Democracy -- Alger lists what he calls the
"dominant dozen" media conglomerates. Now updating the book for paperback
editions, Alger has just slashed the dozen to four: AOL/Time Warner; Disney/ABC;
Viacom/CBS and News Corp., the parent company of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concentration is getting more severe and the range of the diversity of
voices is clearly being constricted," Alger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect this trend to continue as other Internet companies look for
combinations with TV, film and news outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   With the AOL-Time Warner deal, the Internet, once considered the voice of
the little guy, has suddenly become a powerhouse player.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rise of the Internet was supposed to be the rise of the independent
voice," said Matthew Felling, media director of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs. "With the auditorium being filled with large bands, the guy playing his
clarinet is really going to get outshouted and is going to get completely
crowded out of the concert."
</P>
<P>
	   AOL might not write the news. But it channels news to its users. The
Internet portal may be more likely now to send the point-and-clickers toward CNN
and Time instead of MSBNC and Newsweek, media watchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts believe the quality of the news suffers when media worlds
collide.
</P>
<P>
	   "You need to have an independent voice that can keep an eye on powerful
interests," Rosenstiel said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, ABC News killed a proposed "20/20" story about alleged security
problems at Disney World in Florida. Officials said the network's corporate
parent, Walt Disney Co., had no say in the decision, but others were critical.

<HEADLINE> Musgrove Becomes Miss. Governor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- David Ronald Musgrove on Tuesday became Mississippi's
62nd governor following last week's historic vote in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove, a 43-year-old Democrat, replaces controversial two-term Republican
Gov. Kirk Fordice.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove pledged to make education and economic development the cornerstones
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I challenge you to think bigger than ever before,'' Musgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Musgrove had 8,300 more votes than Republican Mike Parker in the Nov. 2
election, but didn't get the required majority. The House decided the contest
last week. Never before had a governor's election been so close it went to the
House.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,000 people packed the Capitol lawn in downtown Jackson as he was
sworn in. Among those who attended was a surprise participant: the outgoing
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before leaving office, Fordice said his accomplishments in eight
years as governor are going unrecognized. ``You'll never say what this
administration did for this state,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Fordice is getting a divorce after 44 years of marriage and has had a very
public affair with his childhood sweetheart. He confirmed what had been
expected, that he and Ann G. Creson will be wed on Feb. 26, shortly after his
marriage is dissolved.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor, elected on a family values platform, said he is tired of
speculation about when he will marry for the second time.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Streisand Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Charges were dropped Tuesday against a tabloid
photographer who was arrested after Barbra Streisand and James Brolin complained
they were being stalked.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendal Wall, 28, who lives near the couple in Malibu, was arrested Saturday
and held on $1 million bail. He was freed after prosecutors found insufficient
evidence that Wall had stalked or threatened the couple.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Streisand and Brolin drove to a sheriff's station Saturday afternoon
and said Wall had been following them. Several hours later, the couple was
driving near their home when they spotted Wall again, allegedly following them,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   They flagged down a deputy and Wall was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   "They felt jeopardized. The police felt that sense of jeopardy was warranted
and they acted accordingly," said Dick Guttman, Miss Streisand's publicist.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the jail Tuesday, several people supporting Wall carried placards
and chanted "Free Wendal."
</P>
<P>
	   As Wall emerged, he clutched an evaluation from the district attorney's
office. "This says that I didn't break the law and she had me arrested for no
apparent reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm still going to take her picture," Wall said of Miss Streisand. "This is
not going to stop me. It's my job."

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Auburn 66, No. 20 Kentucky 63  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNA FRYER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Doc Robinson hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 24.4
seconds to play and Scott Pohlman added two free throws as No. 4 Auburn snapped
a 14-game losing streak against Kentucky with a 66-63 win over the 20th-ranked
Wildcats on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Auburn's (14-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) first victory over
Kentucky (10-5, 1-1) since 1990 and snapped the Wildcats' six-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Auburn fans then stormed the court in celebration, making it impossible
for the players to leave the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   With the score tied at 59 with 2:36 to play, Chris Porter gave the Tigers
their first lead since the 11:09 mark on a tip-in. Two free throws by Jamaal
Magliore tied it at 61 with 1:12 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers had a chance to take the lead, but David Hamilton missed two free
throws. Daymeon Fishback got the rebound, which was knocked out of bounds by
Keith Bogans, giving the Tigers the ball with 42.9 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, who was called an "adequate" guard last week by Georgia coach Jim
Harrick, then hit an off-balance 3-pointer to give Auburn a 64-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Tayshaun Prince missed a 3 at the other end, but Keith Bogans got the
rebound, drew a foul and made two free throws to make it 64-63 with 13.3 to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn came out of a timeout and gave Pohlman, a 77 percent free throw
shooter, the ball. He was quickly fouled by J.P. Blevins, and calmly sank both
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky then missed two shots at the other end as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter, who scored just 12 and 16 points in Auburn's two losses to Kentucky
last year, finished with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Robinson finished with 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Prince led Kentucky with 15 points,
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky, which trailed by as many as 14 in the first half and 36-28 at the
break, quickly closed the gap in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Prince led a 21-11 run with seven quick points, and the Wildcats made it
48-47 with 12:35 to play on Desmond Allison's tip-in.
</P>
<P>
	   After an Auburn miss, Kentucky took its first lead since 5-4 in the first
half on Bogans' jumper. That made it 49-48 with 12:07 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats stretched their lead to 55-50 with 8:21 to play as Auburn
missed five straight shots. Jules Camara got the rebound on his own miss and
connected on a 12-foot jumper, Prince hit a layup and Camara made another
jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn then cut the score to 55-54 on two tip-ins by Porter, but Porter
landed hard on his shoulder after the second one and left the game with 6:27 to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   He returned at the 5:15 mark to a deafening chant of "Porter! Porter!" and
sparked the Tigers with two huge defensive rebounds, setting the stage for
Auburn's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, who opened the game out to prove Harrick wrong, equaled his
scoring average in the first half with 10 points and made all five of his shots.
He finished 8-of-11 and had nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishback finished with 17 points, including three first-half 3-pointers.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Victims Exhumed from Graves  </HEADLINE>
   By HEATHER PATERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LABUKOE, East Timor (AP) -- U.N. investigators exhumed two mass graves in
East Timor on Tuesday and found the bodies of eight people who were likely
killed months before the province voted to break away from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators had expected to find the remains of 18 East Timorese who
were executed by Indonesian-allied militiamen. But only eight bodies were
recovered before heavy rain suspended the work, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said they saw at least another 10 bodies in the graves, located at
Labukoe village, 40 miles west of Dili. Locals said they buried the bodies after
they were dumped by militia in the village.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-independence militia violence both before and after the U.N.-sponsored
ballot in August left East Timor devastated. At least 200 bodies have been
recovered since international peacekeepers were deployed in September to restore
law and order.
</P>
<P>
	   One grave is said to contain the bodies of seven independence supporters who
were killed on April 5, when militiamen stormed a church in nearby Liquica. The
other grave is thought to hold 11 victims of an April 17 attack on the Dili home
of prominent independence campaigner Manuel Carrascalao.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping relatives of the dead were at the graves to witness the exhumations.
</P>
<P>
	   One man, Florindo de Jesus, identified one of the bodies as that of his
brother Alberto, who was killed by militia at the Carrascalao house. Florindo
said he was also at the house on the night of the massacre, but escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I jumped over the fence, but the militiamen were there. They cut me with
machetes,'' said de Jesus, who has deep scars on his arms, back and legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidney Jones, of the U.N. human rights team carrying out the exhumations,
said the bodies were badly mutilated and showed signs of torture and execution.
</P>
<P>
	   One male victim had his hands tied behind his back, a bullet wound in the
chest and multiple skull fractures, apparently from several heavy blows.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan began reviewing a human
rights report Tuesday on atrocities committed in East Timor and plans to make
recommendations for further action, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, three U.N. experts have recommended the Security Council establish
an international war crimes tribunal for East Timor unless Indonesia acts
quickly to investigate the involvement of its military in the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   The separate human rights investigation was authorized in September by the
Geneva-based U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The organization called on Annan
to establish an international commission of inquiry to gather information on
possible human rights violations in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, gang warfare has broken out in East Timor's second-largest city,
posing a challenge to U.N. authority, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   For two weeks, gangs of youths have fought pitched battles for control of
the streets in Baucau, 70 miles west of the capital, Dili, said Sergey Lashin,
chief of the U.N. police force in East Timor. Several people have been injured,
Lashin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said one of the gangs had links to the pro-Indonesia movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor, which is
preparing the territory for eventual self-government, fear the clashes could
lead to widespread criminal violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergio Vieira de Mello, who heads the U.N. mission, said political
allegiances were not motivating the violence. Instead, he said, poverty and
unemployment were leading people toward crime.

<HEADLINE> $1.6B Colombia Aid Package Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money alone will not fix the problems of drug violence
and corruption in Colombia, but $1.6 billion will go a long way toward
bolstering democracy there, the Clinton administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House proposed a package for the South American nation that
President Clinton said will stem the production and export of illegal narcotics,
while supporting economic development and improving human rights in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is flying to Colombia this weekend to
explain the package.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Albright also will
consult with Colombian authorities on implementing the package and how to obtain
additional international support for Colombia's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will make it better if the money's well spent, and it will dramatically
strengthen and solidify the Colombian government in its struggle to preserve
democracy, to preserve economic growth and preserve order in the country and be
a good neighbor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Will it solve all the problems? Of course not. Will it make a big
difference? It certainly will,'' the president said at a short
question-and-answer session with reporters in Arizona, where he traveled to
announce new national monuments designations.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid package is part of the budget plan the White House is drafting for
fiscal 2001. It dramatically increases America's involvement in Colombian
President Andres Pastrana's plan to wean Colombia from its drug-based economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional approval is far from assured, although there were some
encouraging words Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While I have been critical in the past of the administration's efforts in
policies toward Colombia's growing problems, I believe the president is
beginning to respond in good faith to our concerns,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, also welcomed the plan but said he was ``concerned that aid alreadly
in the pipeline has not been delivered effectively, including Black Hawk
helicopters for the Colombian National Police that have languished on the runway
for more than two months.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until the administration shows a willingness to deliver aid effectively to
the Colombian police, their credibility on fighting drugs at the source remains
in doubt,'' Gilman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Hill Republicans generally favor spending on counternarcotics
activities, while the administration prefers spreading the money over a range of
programs including treatment of addiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed package includes money to help train special counternarcotics
battalions and buy 66 U.S. military helicopters for use in drug surveillance and
eradication.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This program is specifically directed against the narcotrafficking, and
trying to make sure that the eradication programs go forward,'' Albright said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said
in a statement the U.S. package ``will worsen the grave crisis in Colombia, not
contribute to its solution.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``More weapons and more soldiers have not, and cannot, defeat the source of
illegal narcotics,'' the office's Winifred Tate said. ``Military assistance as
proposed by the Clinton administration ... threatens to directly implicate the
U.S. in brutal counterinsurgency campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana estimates his plan will cost $7.5 billion overall, of which more
than $4 billion would come from Colombia itself. He made an international appeal
for aid during a speech at the United Nations in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a news conference Tuesday in Bogota, Pastrana said his government
would wage a diplomatic offensive on Capitol Hill in coming weeks in hopes of
heading off partisan squabbling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll make a push before the electoral debate can contaminate whatever
assistance the United States might lend to Colombia,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana believes no counternarcotics program is viable unless Colombian
farmers are given the opportunity to produce alternatives to narcotics plants.
Clinton's proposal earmarks money for that purpose, which Pastrana said is
``recognition that the fight against drug trafficking cannot be limited only to
repressive actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Anti-narcotics aid has previously gone mostly to police interdiction
and forced eradication of coca and opium crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton phoned Pastrana on Monday night, while Clinton was en route to
Arizona. The two briefly discussed strategies for gaining quick congressional
approval, Pastrana said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley says Gore flip-flops on tobacco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley accused Al Gore on Tuesday of
flip-flopping in Senate votes on smoking and tobacco, opening a new health care
front in their fight for the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore said it
sounded like Bradley was getting desperate.
<P>
	   Appearing at an elementary school, Bradley pointed in particular to a 1985
vote in which Gore opposed efforts to block a cigarette tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was an appropriate thing to raise at this time," said Bradley.
"It lays out a very clear point in time when there was a disagreement over who
supported big tobacco."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley defended selecting a 15-year-old vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cited a vote that meant a lot to me," said Bradley. "I'm hitting tobacco
because tobacco happens to be something I've hit for 18 years. As for the past,
the past leads to the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign also said, "Despite the fact that much of tobacco
advertising targets children, in 1988 Gore opposed tobacco advertising
restrictions."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his health care proposal would earmark $1 billion for
anti-smoking efforts and would support research into why children start smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp quickly responded by handing out summaries of three Senate
votes that it said Bradley had cast in 1982 opposing higher cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore, who was boosting his own health plan in eastern Iowa, rejected
Bradley's charge in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just kind of think that sort of smacks of sort of desperate negative
campaigning," said Gore. "It sounds like he's gone back 15 years to pick out
some amendment that had other things connected to it."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also said the tactic violated a Bradley campaign pledge not to engage
in attack politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said he wouldn't do that but I guess he's changed his mind," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has been harshly critical of Bradley's Senate record on farm issues,
and he was asked if that criticism amounted to the same "negative campaigning."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said the difference was in timing because the Bradley
farm record he criticizes is more recent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that commitment to farm policy is very much a live and current
issue," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley himself has reacted strongly when Gore has criticized some of the
votes he made as a New Jersey senator, and he has accused the vice president of
dwelling in the past instead of looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "At some point this was going to become comparative," Bradley said Tuesday.
"When somebody does make a change, they ought to explain it."
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been consistent over time with regard to tobacco and he hasn't,"
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had other harsh words for Bradley as he stood in front of the
electronic bingo board at Davenport's Center for Active Seniors. He contended
his rival's health plan would gamble with Medicare's future by declining to put
aside extra funds now for when baby boomers flood the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won belly laughs from his audience when he likened Bradley's approach
to a man who fell out a tenth floor window, only to report as he passed the
fifth floor, "So far, so good."
</P>
<P>
	   As for Gore's record, Bradley argued that there are obvious flip-flops. For
example, he said Gore was telling Iowa voters in 1988 he opposed the tobacco
subsidy program "and telling North Carolina voters the exact opposite later that
week."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore insisted he has along record of opposition to tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've led the fight against smoking and against the efforts by the companies
to lure children into smoking," said Gore. "I don't know of anybody in the
anti-smoking groups or community who would back him up in questioning my
commitment to leading the fight."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued that his own anti-smoking effort is tougher - and evidence
that his health proposals are more sweeping than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
	   Health care has emerged as an important theme in the fight for the
Democratic nomination. Most polls have shown Gore with a substantial lead
heading into Iowa's Jan. 24 precinct caucuses that open the nominating season.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Killed in Indonesian Clashes  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Religious clashes in eastern Indonesia and
separatist fighting in the west have left dozens of people dead in the sprawling
Southeast Asian nation, witnesses and the military said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Battles between Christians and Muslims erupted Saturday on Seram island,
some 1,600 miles east of Jakarta, the capital, and continued through the weekend
and into this week.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two dozen people were killed, scores were injured, and hundreds of
houses were burned down last week, said Sgt. Andi Ismail, in Seram's main town,
Masohi.
</P>
<P>
	   While he said the violence appeared to have subsided, new witness and media
reports Wednesday said fighting continued this week and left at least another 21
people dead on Seram island and Halmahera island, in North Maluku. The military
managed to separate the two sides after the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Iwa Budiman said the warring factions clashed
throughout the day Tuesday, burning buildings and forcing thousands of people to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Vice Gov. Paula Renyaan of Maluku
province as saying more than 1,000 people were missing after fleeing their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   One Muslim fighter told The Associated Press that the bloodshed continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We attacked the Christians on Monday after they attacked us the day
before,'' Luki Uyara said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2,000 people have died in a year of sectarian violence in the Maluku
islands, which were known as the Moluccas or Spice Islands during Dutch colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting has sharply escalated since Christmas Day. Some in Indonesia's
Muslim community, which makes up 90 percent of its 210 million people, have
demanded the government take firm action to stop the killings.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, about 300 Muslim students rallied in the capital saying they
would declare a ``jihad'' or holy war unless the government acted. Last week
more than 80,000 Muslim protesters in Jakarta made the same demand.
</P>
<P>
	   However, President Abdurrahman Wahid, himself a prominent Muslim leader and
advocate for religious tolerance, condemned the calls for a holy war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't care whether they want to have a jihad or anything else ... One
thing is for sure, if they're threatening the safety of the state, we will take
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Indonesia's westernmost Aceh province, at least 23 people, including
three soldiers and three policemen, have been killed in the past 10 days, a
police spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Sayed Husaini said most of the deaths were from clashes between
security forces and rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Aceh, an oil-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra, is one of several
Indonesian regions where separatists are fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Achenese guerrillas have been waging a struggle against Indonesian rule
since the mid-1970s. At least 5,000 people have died in the violence during the
past decade.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Declared Unfit for Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A medical team found that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was too ill
to stand trial on charges of human rights abuses, the government announced
Tuesday, in a decision that may clear the way for the former dictator to return
home to Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling drew quick reaction in Chile where a group representing relatives
of alleged victims expressed its disappointment, while supporters declared it
was good for both Pinochet and Chile. In Spain, which is seeking Pinochet's
extradition, the government said it had no plans to contest the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said a medical team who examined Pinochet on Jan. 5
unanimously agreed that he was unfit to face trial, ``and that no change to that
position can be expected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Home Secretary Jack Straw felt he should not allow
Pinochet to be extradited to Spain. But it said he would give parties to the
case seven days to present arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means that the 84-year-old Pinochet, who has been under
detention in Britain since his arrest in a London hospital nearly 15 months ago,
could be freed within weeks. He was arrested on a Spanish warrant for alleged
human rights violations committed during his rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement did not go beyond declaring Pinochet unfit, saying that
details of his condition were disclosed to the former Chilean leader but kept
``confidential'' otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the general has diabetes, suffers from arthritis and recently had
two mild strokes. In addition, the Sunday Times reported last weekend that the
official doctors found that -- in addition to his known health woes -- he also
has heart disease, a viral infection and that his diabetes has caused a loss of
sensation in his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet is sought in Spain in connection with the disappearances and
killings of thousands of Chileans during his 17-year rule there.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement read that Straw ``is minded ... to take the view that no
purpose would be served by continuing the present extradition proceedings and
that he should therefore decide not to extradite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government also said Straw would hear arguments from Chile and Spain as
well as France, Belgium and Switzerland. Those three countries have also made
extradition requests, claiming that their citizens also suffered rights abuses
in Chile during Pinochet's dictatorship. Human rights groups including Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch also have been invited to submit comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chile, officials with the Organization of Relatives of Missing Detainees,
a group dedicated to dissidents who disappeared after being arrested under the
Pinochet dictatorship, said they were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tremendous frustration and sorrow. A wonderful legal process has
been frustrated,'' said Mireya Garcia, vice president of the organization. ``We
believe that although Pinochet is indeed very old and has problems, he was in
shape to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Retired army Gen. Rafael Villarroel, a close aide to Pinochet, said, ``this
is going to be good for Chile, for our fatherland, because a process starts to
restore its sovereignty and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congressman Alberto Cardemil, also a close associate of Pinochet, called the
British decision ``a victory for a national cause, a cause of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Spain, foreign ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez Villanueva said the
government did not plan to intervene in the judicial process and would continue
``to respect the decisions coming from the British government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish Judge Garzon, whose arrest order resulted in Pinochet's detention,
did not immediately comment. But lawyers working with him said the legal fight
would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Enrique Santiago said he would request that the Spanish National
Court ask British prosecutors for a new medical examination if Britain releases
him on humanitarian grounds. Attorney Carlos Slepoy called the medical team's
report ``a big error which does a lot of harm to the human rights cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's medical exam was done at the Chilean government's request. The
general was seen by a neurologist and two geriatric specialists during a
seven-hour consultation at Northwick Park Hospital in north London.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the Home Office said the Chilean Embassy advised the
government on Oct. 14 that Pinochet's health had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet, 3,197 people, mainly Chileans but also some Spaniards, were killed or
disappeared after he seized power in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Pinochet has waged an aggressive fight against being
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers have already appealed an Oct. 8 ruling by a London magistrate
that he can be extradited. A hearing is scheduled to begin March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw can consider Pinochet's health in making a final ruling. But even if
he were to agree to release the general due to health concerns, Spain could
appeal that ruling, further prolonging the general's stay in England.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet also faces more than 50 individual lawsuits in Chilean courts,
which the government has said he should face if he returns. The government has
never pressed charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, one of Pinochet's most forthright
supporters, said Tuesday: ``I would trust the home secretary's judgment. He is a
very fair man.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Decatur Expulsions  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the Decatur school
board was within its rights to oust six black students from school for fighting
at a football game.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling was a blow to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his crusade against
``zero tolerance'' anti-violence policies in schools.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Michael McCuskey dismissed the students' claims that the
Decatur school board treated them unjustly because they are black and violated
their right to a fair hearing. McCuskey issued his ruling from Urbana, where he
heard three days of testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, whose Rainbow/PUSH Coalition filed the lawsuit on the students'
behalf, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court offered no relief for these youth and showed no mercy for
getting them back in school,'' Jackson said during a news conference with the
students and their parents at his group's Chicago headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also said he planned two rallies in Decatur -- one Saturday night,
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and another Jan. 24 in protest of the
decision. He also said he had scheduled a conference Jan. 25 in Springfield on
``zero tolerance'' policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed by five of the students who were expelled following
the Sept. 17 fist fight in the stands at a football game, and one who withdrew
rather than face expulsion. A sixth expelled student was not involved in the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The teens initially were expelled for a maximum of two years. After
intervention by Jackson and Gov. George Ryan, the school board reduced the
expulsions to one year and agreed to allow all six teens to attend alternative
schools that are not a part of the district.
</P>
<P>
	   McCuskey struck down the students' case point by point, noting their actions
threatened the safety of the community. The fight cleared the visitors'
bleachers at the game but caused no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In short, this court is not impressed with the students' position that
because no knives or guns were used in the melee that it was not a significant
fight,'' McCuskey wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   School board officials said they were relieved at the decision and hoped it
could put to rest the racial tension that has built in the blue-collar central
Illinois town.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a tremendous amount of healing that has to take place in the
community. This has been very divisive,'' said Decatur Superintendent Kenneth
Arndt.
</P>
<P>
	   During protests in Decatur late last year, Jackson claimed the expulsions
were not a racial issue. But in the lawsuit, the students argued the school
district disproportionately expelled black students and disciplined them more
harshly than white students.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Kelty, an attorney for the school board, said the decision sends the
correct message about who determines school policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These rules are set at the local level, and it's not the job of the
federal court -- or any other court -- to interfere with these rules,'' Kelty
said.

<HEADLINE> Search for Suspect Focuses on Fla.  </HEADLINE>
   By TERRY SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Police were searching South Florida on Tuesday for a man
believed to have fatally shot his boss and co-worker after being fired.
</P>
<P>
	   The family of Mario Betancourt issued a statement asking him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your family loves you very much and we don't want anything bad to happen
to you,'' said the statement, read by Hialeah Capt. Jerry Freeman.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said that Betancourt went to The Padding Store in Port St. Lucie
Monday afternoon. After owner Richard Mashler fired him -- Mashler's wife said
Betancourt was suspected of stealing -- Betancourt went to his van.
</P>
<P>
	   He retrieved a 9 mm automatic handgun, went back inside and shot Mashler,
49, three times in the chest, police said. Co-worker Kenneth Conklin, 39, tried
to run out the back door but was shot three times in the back. Both died at the
scene and the gunman fled.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, police found Betancourt's 10-year-old daughter at her paternal
grandmother's home Hialeah, near Miami. Police initially believed she was in her
father's van outside the store in Port St. Lucie, about 110 miles north of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   But after speaking to the girl, police said her father picked her up at
school in Port St. Lucie about two hours before the shooting and that she was
not at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Port St. Lucie Detective John Holman would not say how or when she arrived
in Hialeah.
</P>
<P>
	   Poliec said they were focusing their search in South Florida because
Betancourt, 43, lived for years in the Miami area and has friends there who
might hide him.
</P>
<P>
	   But law enforcement agencies throughout the state and country have been
asked to look for Betancourt and his beige Chevrolet van.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Coming to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he plans
to lay out his grievances about a weapons-related clash between Protestants and
Catholics in a meeting Wednesday with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams, whose IRA-linked party took its place last month in a new four-party
coalition government for Northern Ireland, said before leaving for the United
States Tuesday that Protestant politicians need to drop their threat to bring
down the fledgling administration if the Irish Republican Army doesn't begin
disarming within weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Protestant-Catholic government and gradual IRA disarmament were
important goals of the 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA opened negotiations last month with a disarmament commission, but
the outlawed group hasn't yet indicated whether it will agree to identify or
destroy any of its hidden weapons dumps. The accord anticipated the IRA's total
disarmament by May. Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, the Protestant
who leads the government, has promised his supporters he will withdraw from
office if the IRA doesn't begin the process by February.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite this, Adams said he didn't expect to receive any pressure on the
arms issue Wednesday from Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole issue of decommissioning (weapons) is now exactly where it
belongs: in the hands of an independent commission,'' Adams said. ``That was
always the course favored by the president, who has played an admirably
evenhanded role in Ireland.''

<HEADLINE> Heat 116, Timberwolves 106  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dan Majerle hit 9-of-10 3-pointers and scored a
season-high 33 points to lead the Miami Heat over the Minnesota Timberwolves
116-106 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Majerle's 3-pointers were a career high. He made six in a row in the second
half, highlighted by a 29-footer with 9:38 left in the game to give the Heat a
93-78 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami led by as many as 21 points in the fourth quarter before the Wolves
rallied. They closed to 109-104, but Voshon Lenard hit Miami's season-high 11th
3-pointer of the game to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett tied his career-high with 35 points for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat has handed the Wolves their only two losses in Minnesota's last 12
games. Unlike their Dec. 28 meeting, a come-from-behind 89-78 Heat victory,
Miami took the lead early, and Majerle's 3-point shooting ensured the Heat kept
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Majerle hit all four of 3-point attempts in the third quarter, and each came
at a time when Minnesota was in the process of making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wolves got as close as 10 points in the fourth quarter before Majerle
struck for two more 3-pointers. His nine 3-pointers in the game tied for
third-best in NBA history but were one short of the Heat's franchise record of
10, held by Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami never trailed after taking an 11-10 lead on Alonzo Mourning's dunk
midway through the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Otis Thorpe hit his first six shots from the field and scored 13 points in
the first half, which atoned for Mourning's foul trouble. The Heat center picked
up three early fouls and scored just 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota's first quarter was the opposite of its performance Sunday at
Philadelphia. The Wolves made only five of their first 17 shots and 10-of-23 in
the period, after hitting 18-of-22 in the first period on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Minnesota recovered to shoot 53 percent for the game, while Miami shot
56 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sick Fla. Boy Can Keep Treehouse  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVE BRYAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A neighborhood association has backed down from its
demands that the family of a 6-year-old boy suffering from leukemia tear down
his treehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Liz DeAmbrose, a real estate agent who is president of Palm Owners
Association, said a letter from Brage Sassin's oncologist allows the association
to grant the family an exception to its rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He feels that it's in the best interest of the child to leave the
playhouse exactly the way that it is for his emotional well being,'' Ms.
DeAmbrose said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of residents had phoned and sent faxes and e-mails of support for
Brage's family after the association told the family that the treehouse was in
violation of community regulations because it's too tall.
</P>
<P>
	   Brage helped his father build the treehouse last spring when he briefly was
in remission from the cancer that struck when he was 2. In August, he suffered a
relapse.
</P>
<P>
	   His parents said the treehouse is the one place where Brage seems to forget
he is sick and undergoing painful chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
	   The association had threatened to fine Omar and Tammy Sassin, who vowed not
to touch the treehouse. The association had said that at 14 feet above the
ground, the treehouse was 6 feet too tall and had to be destroyed.
