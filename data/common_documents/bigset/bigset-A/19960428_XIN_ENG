<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The former Afghan Premier
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is likely to rejoin the Kabul regime, a senior
official said in Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul quoted Abdul Aziz Murad, the spokesman of
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, as saying that the Kabul
regime and Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami had signed a political
agreement in this regard.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Newspaper Criticizes Japan-U.S. Joint Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The "Japan-U.S. Joint
Declaration on Security" issued earlier this month was to revive
Cold War confrontation in the Asia-Pacific, Rodong Sinmun,
mouthpiece of the Workers' Party of Korea, said in a signed
article today.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, which was directed against the
former Soviet Union, has no reason to exist following the end of
the Cold War, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is now being used by Washington and Tokyo as a tool
against the DPRK and certain other Asian countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan said in the Joint Declaration that
cooperation between them would be strengthened and that
U.S. forces would continue to be stationed in the region due to
the "instability and danger" that still exists in the Korean
peninsula as well as in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
This is an excuse created by the U.S. and Japan to seek
domination in the region by using the security treaty, said the
article.
</P>
<P>
It said that the DPRK and other Asian countries should
increase their vigilance over this trend because the issuance of
the Declaration will sharpen confrontation and destroy peace and
stability in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government is too
optimistic about the quick return of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Afghan
former Premier and leader of Hezb-i-Islami, to the Kabul regime, a
reliable source told Xinhua by telephone today.
</P>
<P>
The source quoted Gulzei Muhammad, the Deputy Chairman of
Hezb-i-Islami's political department in Peshawar, as saying that
his party was talking with Kabul regime on Afghan peace process,
but no complete result has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Aziz Murad, the spokesman of Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, said in Kabul today that Hekmatyar would soon rejoin the
Kabul regime and take up top positions.
</P>
<P>
Some other sources in Kabul said that Hezb-i-Islami had signed
agreement with the Kabul regime in this regard and Hekmatyar might
be given the positions of Prime Minister, Defense Minister or
Financial Minister.
</P>
<P>
Terming Murad's saying as too optimistic, Gulzei Muhammad said
that the Afghan problem must be resolved through the efforts made
by all the parties instead of two.
</P>
<P>
Hezb-i-Islami had to consult with the other three parties in
the four-party opposition alliance about the reconciliation with
Kabul regime, he added.
</P>
<P>
And the final idea should be made by the alliance instead of
Hezb-i-Islami only, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hezb-i-Islami has been holding talks with the Kabul regime in
recent months on how to end the Afghan crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Gulzei Muhammad said that the Taliban factor should also be
considered before signing any final agreements.

hall in Midrand, a town 20 km north of Johannesburg.

United Nations defined in 1995 as the least developed countries
(LDCs).

Mandela urged UNCTAD not to leave the poor "to the vagaries of
the world economy."

<HEADLINE> Athens Metro to Get More Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment Bank (EIB)
will offer an additional one billion U.S. dollars for Athens' new
underground railway network which has been under construction
since 1992, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Metro, described as "the largest and most complex
transportation project in Greece and one of the largest in
Europe", already has 90 percent funding in grants and loans from
the EU and EIB. the remaining 10 percent is provided by the Greek
state.
</P>
<P>
The additional one billion dollar loan is not being requested
because the project is running into difficulties but because it is
needed to construct an additional junction between Athens' two
heavily populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The funds will therefore be used to extend the 18.5 kilometer
network and 21 subway stations already approved by the EU.
</P>
<P>
When completed in 1998, the Athens Metro is scheduled to serve
780,000 passengers daily which is equivalent to one-third of the
commuting public.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Blamed for New York Male's Life Span Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy of
males born in New York City has begun to decline, which
researchers attribute largely to the city's AIDS epidemic, the New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Health has been keeping records on
length of life in New York City since 1901, when the average life
span was only 40.6 years. That figure, keeping on rising steadily,
peaked at 68.5 years for men in 1980, it said.
</P>
<P>
But according to a report to be issued by the health department
soon, the high incidence of AIDS in New York City and the many
young deaths it brought lowered that figure in the 10 years that
followed, cutting the average male life expectancy to 68 years by
1990.
</P>
<P>
On contract, the average life expectancy of women, longer than
that of men on the average, continues to rise, according to the
report. It reached a high in 1990 of 77.2 years. Women account for
only 20 percent of the city's 81,500 AIDS cases, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS deaths each year had continued to rise since
1990, according to the health department researchers. As a result,
they said, there is no reason to believe that life expectancy has
improved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the paper said, due to the higher poverty and
disease rates in the nation's largest city, the average American
lived a year or two longer than the average New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in this century has affected the life expectancy of
New Yorkers as greatly as AIDS," said the paper, adding that rates
of heart disease and cancer, the two leading killers of men in New
York, declined between 1980 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
The paper also explained that the dip in life span does not
mean that New York men are beginning to die at an earlier age. But
it does mean that AIDS -- now the third largest killer of male New
Yorkers -- has threatening the life of babies and men under 40,
because AIDS mostly killed men in their 30's.

Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah left here this afternoon,
winding up a three-day official visit to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before his leaving, the Kuwaiti crown
prince said his visit to Tunisia was an incarnation of the sincere

meeting on condition that such a summit is going to have a clear
and specific agenda approved by the Arab League.

comply fully with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, chiefly

MOSCOW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin came
back to Moscow tonight after a three-day official visit to China
starting on Wednesday and a short working visit to Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Yeltsin held his third summit meeting with Chinese

including a joint declaration and agreements on cooperation
mainly in the economic fields and on setting up "a hot line"
between Moscow and Beijing.
</P>

Both sides believe the accords signed and Yeltsin's Beijing
trip itself would promote the development of bilateral good
neighborliness, friendship and cooperation in various spheres.
</P>

In Shanghai, the largest city in China, Yeltsin, together with
leaders of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, signed an

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has rejected U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1054 calling for diplomatic sanctions against
it for not handing over the three suspects involved in the
assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said
that Sudan felt shocked and embittered about the issuing of
U.N. Security Council resolution 1054.
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced Sudan's regret at the issuing of the
resolution which came at a time when the facts, which confirmed
that those who are accused of having attempted to assassinate
Egyptian President Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in June
last year were not in Sudan, were revealed.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council is intended
to isolate Sudan internationally, constitutes a precedence of the
council's work, creates a serious problem in connection with
adopting coercive and selective practices and is contrary to the
principles on which the world organization is based," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan believed that this resolution would have serious effects
on the stability and territorial integrity of Sudan and the
stability of the entire region, and it was passed under the
instigation of some member states of the U.N. Security Council,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated Sudan's condemnation of terrorism
with all its forms, as well as Sudan's adherence to the
U.N. principles and conventions.

<HEADLINE> IFOR, Bosnian Sides Ready to Respect Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An IFOR commander said today the
demonstrated readiness of the three sides in Bosnia to withdraw
their heavy weapons by the agreed deadline was a sign of the
stabilization of the military situation.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the French troops Gen. Robert Rideau said that
IFOR troops, who are present everywhere in Bosnia, "have not
noticed any sign of aggression in the until-recently warring
sides."
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement calls for the withdrawal of all heavy
weapons, the return of troops to barracks and demobilization which
would reduce armies to their peacetime size before April 18, or
the 120th day of the start of the implementation of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
IFOR said the postponement of the agreed deadline for several
weeks was due to bad organization of the formerly opposed armies,
rather than their unwillingness to respect what had been agreed.
</P>
<P>
Rideau said the arms and size of the three armies had
drastically been reduced, although they were firmly opposed to
this only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The French commander said that in the region controlled by the
French IFOR troops, the Serb side have reported about 800 pieces
of heavy weapons, the Muslims 600 and the Croats about 300.
</P>
<P>
"These weapons will be stored in 61 storehouses controlled by
IFOR," Rideau said.
</P>
<P>
According to data supplied to IFOR by the three sides, the
Muslims have so far demobilized 75 percent of their 72,000 troops,
the Serbs 65 percent of 40,000 troops, and the Croats 75 percent
of 17,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Rideau also said he was "a cautious optimist" and announced that
in two weeks IFOR would start seriously implementing the terms of
the Dayton agreement referring to demobilization and the storing
of heavy weapons.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Rejects Swazi Land Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today rejected a long-standing claim by Swaziland for a
corridor of land in four towns of Mpumalanga Province.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was quoted by the South African
Press Association as saying at Swaziland's Matspha Airport that
the areas include Nelspriut, Barberton, Malelane and Lydenburg.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had told the King Mswati III that the South
African government had discussed and dismissed the claim of
Swaziland, a tiny land-locked country surrounded by South Africa
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The second man in South Africa, Mbeki has today finished his
two-day Swaziland tour, accompanied by Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo and other top government officials.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the claim to reincorporate the area known as
Kangwane into Swaziland arose in the early 1980s and had never
left the royal agenda since then.
</P>
<P>
"King Mswati pressed the issue during his recent visit to
South Africa and after discussions it was agreed that it is not
an issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if Swaziland succeeded in getting a border
readjustment, it would set a precedent and lead to continent-wide
strife and instability.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's land claim was contrary to the Organisation of
African Unity's ruling that colonial boundaries should be
honored, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also stressed that the land dispute could interfere with
a multi-billion-Rand Maputo Corridor Initiative to upgrade
transport links between South Africa's Gauteng Province and
Maputo Harbor in another southern African state of Mozambique.

Participants at both meetings agreed that the Black Sea Trade
and Development Bank should be operational by the end of the year
to ensure funding for various cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC, set up in Turkey's Istanbul on June 25, 1992, is
aimed at promoting economic ties among its 11 member nations. The

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Madagascar National Assembly President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
said here today that China respects the universal principles of
human rights, while the realization of these principles should be
in line with the conditions of each country.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the remark in his meeting here this evening with
Richard Andriamanjato, president of the National Assembly of
Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will not allow Western countries such
as the US to interfere in its internal affairs in the name of
human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with support from a vast number of developing
countries and other friendly nations, draft resolutions against
China on human rights submitted by the US and other Western
countries to the UN Commission on Human Rights all ended in
failure.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Madagascar, both facing the tasks of
safeguarding sovereignty and national esteem and developing their
economies, share the same or similar views on human rights, and
firmly oppose the attempts of the Western countries to interfere in
the internal affairs of developing nations by using the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also expressed his appreciation for Madagascar's support
for China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan question, Qiao made clear China's principled
stand on it, saying that the government of the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole
of China, and Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory,
which is a fact recognized by the UN and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening-up
drive, as well as its independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
Andriamanjato said that Madagascar, which attaches great
importance to its relations with China, hopes for a better
knowledge about China's reform and development, as well as China's
successful transition to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Madagascar admires China's great changes,
especially its experience in managing rural enterprises, which is
good for developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is great potential for bilateral
co-operation, and the two sides should seek various channels for
further co-operation in various forms.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope for further exchanges and
co-operation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Qiao hosted a banquet for Andriamanjato and
his party, who arrived here Saturday as guests of the NPC Standing
Committee after a visit to Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The delegation first arrived in Shanghai on April 22 for an
official goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee Ni Zhifu met with the delegation.

<HEADLINE> Massacre Sparks Gun Law Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The worst shooting massacre in
the world that occurred in Tasmania today reignited contentious
debate on whether Australia's gun law should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Federal Attorney-General and Justice Minister Daryl Williams
said that it was an "appalling tragedy" that scores of tourists
were killed by a gunman at Port Arthur in Tasmania early this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Gun controls are a state and territory responsibility and some
states have been reluctant to impose restrictions that the
commonwealth regards as appropriate," a spokeswoman of Williams
quoted him as saying tonight.
</P>
<P>
He supported the adoption of uniform gun laws among the states
and greater restriction on possession of weapons, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
Williams indicated that he would put gun laws on the agenda at
the state police ministers council meeting in July.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania, along with Queensland, are among the states that have
the most liberal firearms laws in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Tasmania permits ownership of fully automatic firearms with
police permit. There is no registration system for individual guns
in the state. A shooter's license is valid for life.
</P>
<P>
Gun Control Australia president John Crook said that automatic
guns had been freely available in Tasmania until the state
introduced two gun acts in 1991 and 1992 after shooting massacres
in Melbourn in Victoria state. But semi-automatic guns were still
relatively easy to obtain in Tasmania, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that today's massacre had pushed the number of deaths
from shooting massacre in the country since 1987 to about 125. It
could also be the worst gun massacre in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that previous worst record were in the United States,
where 22 people were shot dead in Killeen, Texas, in 1991 and 21
killed at the McDonald's restaurant massacre in San Isidoro,
California, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
He wrote to Prime Minister John Howard calling on him to
pressure state Liberal premiers into tightening gun laws.
</P>
<P>
However, Ted Drane, president of Sporting Shooters Association
of Australia (SSAA), said that his group would "fight like hell"
against any attempt to impose restrictive firearms laws which did
not involve consultation with shooters.
</P>
<P>
He would send a fax to Howard and Williams offering a
consultative approach to any discussions on changing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that prohibition of ownership of firearms "won't work."
</P>
<P>
"People will try to make us wear the guilt for what happened in
Tasmania today and we are not guilty. We are not guilty and we
refuse to be made to feel responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
All Australian states and territories except Tasmania and
Queensland ban high-powered semi-automatic weapons or impose
strict conditions on their distribution and use, including the
number of bullets in magazines.
</P>
<P>
Increasing shooting incidents have already prompted the New
South Wales state government to tighten gun laws.

<HEADLINE> "Philosophy, Social Sciences Must Flourish": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party official has
called for greater efforts to make China's philosophy and social
sciences flourish and prosper.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a four-day national conference that concluded here
today, Ding Guangen, a Politburo member of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, said it is an important task for
philosophical researchers and social scientists to provide a
spiritual locomotive, theoretical support and ideological
guarantee for the realization of China's trans-century goals.
</P>
<P>
Masterpieces of philosophy and social sciences are the
yardsticks of a nation's research in this field, said Ding, urging
that philosophers and social scientists concentrate on achieving
outstanding results and creating excellent works that cater to the
needs of society.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong
Thought, and in particular Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics in bringing about a
prosperous philosophy and social sciences, Ding said China will
further promote academic progress, guarantee academic freedom, and
actively implement the policy of ''letting one hundred flowers
blossom, and one hundred school of thought contend."
</P>
<P>
Ding, also head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central
Committee, said that China will encourage and help promote healthy
academic criticism and strive to create a harmonious atmosphere
for academic activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry will go on hiatus this week at a Maryland retreat,
according to news reports published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barry, 60, will temporarily leave his post because of
"tell-tale signs of spiritual relapse and physical exhaustion," a
statement released by the mayor Saturday and published by the
Washington Post Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
The statement bore the heading: "Rejuvenation!"
</P>
<P>
Barry's wife, Cora Masters Barry, stressed that the leave did
not mean her husband had relapsed into the drug and alcohol
addiction.
</P>
<P>
"He is not ill, period," she told the Post. "But he needs to
rest, step back and get some things out of his system."
</P>
<P>
The mayor's press secretary Raymone Bain said that Barry "has
seen signs to stop and take a break."
</P>
<P>
Since his prostate surgery in early December, Barry has
maintained a hectic work schedule that was interfering with full
recuperation.
</P>
<P>
Besides personal health problems, the mayor has been fighting a
budget battle within the Washington city government, a
congressionally appointed financial control board and Congress
itself.

FUZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Economic and technological
development zones in east China's Fujian Province are developing
healthily and helping to enliven the local economy.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the province has three state-level economic

zones for Taiwan investors, two state tourism and holiday zones,
two high-tech industrial parks and 101 economic and technology
development zones.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 these zones had spent a total of 10 billion
yuan on building infrastructure facilities, and imported more
than 2,000 foreign-funded projects involving foreign investment
totalling 9.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 foreign-funded companies which have already
gone into production, have turned out an industrial output value
amounting to 30.9 billion yuan annually, and exported 2.2 billion
US dollars-worth of goods a year.
</P>
<P>
Fujian took the lead in the country in building economic and
technological development zones.
</P>
<P>
To make the zones more attractive, the province is to reform
its investment policies and improve services in this regard.

<HEADLINE> China Market for Mobile Telecom Products Is Vigorous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's market demand for mobile
telecommunications products will keep a robust surge over the next five
years, fixing the annual sales volume at around 20 billion yuan
(2.41 billion US dollars)-worth.
</P>
<P>
The "People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily" said that the
number of China's cellular phone users will climb to 10 million in
the year 2000 from 1.5 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years of this century the country will have a
demand for 1.8 million to 2.6 million mobile phones, 70,000 to
100,000 basic stations, and 1.7 million to 2.1 million lines of
mobile switching systems every year.
</P>
<P>
The radio paging service, another pillar money maker for
China's mobile telecom business, will maintain an increase of 1.5
million to two million in the number of subscribers during the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the growth of satellite mobile telecommunications
is expected to gain momentum, as with the Asia and Pacific Mobile
Telecom (APMT) system has started operation in China.
</P>
<P>
Allured by the huge market potential, a score of foreign
telecom companies have entered China over the past few years.These
big names, such as Motorola, Siemens, NEC, Ericsson, MTC and
Nokia, have established joint ventures to manufacture mobile
telephones and basic stations in coastal cities, including
Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Tianjin.

terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a bus bomb blast killing some 70

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Urged to Return to One China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- promoting the growth of
cross-straits relations on the basis of one China principle
tallies with the common interests of people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
This orientation has long been adhered to by the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), an ARATS official
said today on the third anniversary of the first non-governmental
meeting between ARATS president Wang Daohan and Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The historic meeting was considered as the first contact
between high-ranking personnel of authorized non-governmental
organizations from the mainland and Taiwan in more than four
decades.
</P>
<P>
It indicated the cross-straits relations had made important
headway and exerted a positive influence on the smooth development
of relations between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, he stated.
</P>
<P>
However, the acts of the Taiwan authorities run counter to its
promise of "adhering to the one China principle", hampered the
normal growth of cross-straits relations and sabotaged the basis
for negotiations between ARATS and SEF, thus compelling the second
Wang-Koo meeting and all negotiations between ARATS and SEF at all
levels to break off, the official said, adding that the Taiwan
authorities should bear full responsibility for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities really want to resume the second
Wang-Koo meeting, it must stop its activities of creating "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", the official said.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing for the Taiwan authorities to do now
is to return to the one China principle, he added.

<HEADLINE> Development Zone Helps Farmers Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A development zone using 27.5
million US dollars of World Bank loans to help farmers overcome
poverty has been set up in this port city of south China's Guangxi
zhuang autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The development zone, consisting of an aid-the-poor industrial
park, an aquatic breeding farm and a vegetable growing base, will
provide jobs for poorer farmers in Guangxi, and Guizhou and Yunnan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The development zone was jointly established by Beihai and east
China's Suzhou City.
</P>
<P>
Six enterprises from Suzhou have set up labor-intensive firms
in Beihai, manufacturing garments, toys and handicrafts. The firms
will start to recruit workers from among farmers this year.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank official cited the development zone as an
"ambitious and challenging" project.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also pays great attention to this
project, and State Councillor Chen Junsheng once led a special
team to inspect its progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Police said that they had
discovered another body of the victims in the worst massacre in
Australia's modern history, bringing the death toll to 33.
</P>
<P>
This could be the world's worst shooting massacre. The previous
most tragic shooting was the so-called McDonald's massacre in
California of the United States, where a gunman walked into a
local McDonald's fast food shop and shot 21 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The number of injured remained at 18, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the gunman responsible for the
massacre might have driven hostages into a car and set the car on
fire.
</P>
<P>
But the car is so near to the house where the gunman holds
three hostages that the police could not investigate whether he
has burnt victims to death.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims have been confirmed to be from Canada.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that there are children and at least one baby
among the dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) donated here today 250,000 US dollars-worth of goods
for sanitation, education and water supply in the earthquake-hit
Lijiang area in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's Deputy Governor Zhao Shumin expressed her appreciation
to UNICEF for the donation here this afternoon when meeting
with UNICEF's representative to China Keshab Mathema and UNICEF's
Hong Kong Branch Chief Matthew Mo.
</P>
<P>
When Lijiang was hit by a severe earthquake in early February
this year UNICEF's Hong Kong branch collected 250,000 US dollars
in a short period of time for the purchase of relief goods.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF had donated 50,000 US dollars-worth of goods for the
relief work in Lijiang previously.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting this afternoon Zhao said that the co-operation
between Yunnan and UNICEF started 13 years ago and has scored
marked results.
</P>
<P>
Mathema said that UNICEF is to expand its co-operation with
Yunnan, hoping to make more contributions to the local children's
health and development.
</P>
<P>
Mathema and his party are also scheduled to visit some schools,
hospitals and villages in Lijiang.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that UNICEF has provided nearly nine million US
dollars for co-operative projects in Yunnan altogether, covering
sanitation, education, civil affairs and water conservancy.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Assistance Reforms Reciprocal: Envoys (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic envoys from five
African nations voiced their shared view here recently that
China's reform of its policy of providing assistance abroad are
beneficial to both China and African countries.
</P>
<P>
In interviews with Xinhua, Charge d'Affaires of the
Ethiopian Embassy to China Lissane Yohannes said that Ethiopia is
following with keen interest such reform, focusing on
"making available government-subsidized soft loans for priority
projects in key areas of socio-economic development beneficial to
both parties".
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia's current economic policy gives wide
opportunities for China to reform its policy of providing
assistance abroad.
</P>
<P>
China's experiences in developing agriculture, a key to its
economic development, are worth learning by the Ethiopian side
despite different situations in each country, added Yohannes.
</P>
<P>
So, he noted, the reforms are welcomed by Ethiopia which "hopes
and desires to be one of the beneficiaries of this policy", and
the two sides have worked out priorities for exploration.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Samir Borhan said that the reforms will
"help increase the bilateral trade between China and African
countries", for China can help Africa by "giving credits and
loans at low interest rates and technical assistance, training
their nationals and opening Chinese universities wider to African
students".
</P>
<P>
He added that African countries, although rich in natural
resources, lack the technical expertise and investment to tap
these resources.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Assistance Reforms Reciprocal: Envoys (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malian Ambassador Kafougouna Kone said that China is respected
by African nations, which have received a great deal of financial
assistance and interest-free credits from China in the past years.
</P>
<P>
China's reform of its foreign economic assistance, which take
into consideration the conditions of the recipients, will not
hinder the improvement of its economic and trade relations with
the recipients, but rather promote investment in larger projects.
</P>
<P>
These projects will contribute to the strengthening of
relations between China and the recipients, added Kone.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Ambassador Peter Mweshihange held that the reform is
aimed at rectifying difficulties in some areas and promoting
shared responsibility, but "it is not seen as a decline in either
technical and economic assistance to Africa".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "joint-venture partnership, as proposed by
China, will create an atmosphere of "no-winners and no-losers" in
a given project in any country", and it will "promote
opportunities for employment and exchange of expertise and
experience".
</P>
<P>
Noting that this is a welcome development, Zimbabwean
Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said that this new approach
ensures that the much-needed raw materials are not wasted but put
to good use by creating production capacity and the transfer of
technology.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that African countries, which have all along
been exporting raw materials without being able to process them,
have lost the added-value and employment-creation benefits.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the new nature of China's reforms defines a
new relationship between China and African countries that can
stimulate mutually beneficial economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Disaster-Ridden Tibetans Enjoy Better Lives than the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- "A snowfall in 1956 was up to a
man's neck, but our feudal lord insisted on forcing my wife to
graze cattle, and she never returned." recalled Nyixia, an old
Tibetan in Nagqu County, in the northern part of the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"But that was not unusual when Tibet was under the rule of the
Dalai Lama," the old man said. "Hundreds of thousands of herdsmen
died as a result of snow disasters which struck here once every three
or five years.
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised and overjoyed at first when the central
government provided disaster relief for us each time we were
stricken by the 'white disaster'," Nyixia said. "It was simply
because we were taken as no better than cattle or sheep when the
Dalai Lama ruled Tibet."
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that since the 18th century Nagqu
Prefecture in north Tibet has experienced some 100 snow disasters,
most of which resulted in the death of large numbers of livestock
and made the herdsmen's lives harder.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Nagqu Prefecture once again fell into the grip of a
snow disaster, which isolated its 12 counties, endangering both
herdsmen and their livestock.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from the food grain department of the
autonomous region show that three to four million kg of grain was
airlifted to the disaster areas at that time by the air force of
the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Besides, large quantities of daily-use articles and specially
allocated relief funds from the central government were sent to
the prefecture through a variety of channels.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of snow disasters any more," Purpu Toinzhub,
a local Tibetan, said, "as we are absolutely sure that the central
government will come to our aid whenever we are in difficulty."
</P>
<P>
According to Duerjie, a leading official of the prefecture,
Nagqu Prefecture had a population of no more than 100,000 before
1959, but this has risen to 300,000. And the number of livestock
has grown to seven million, up from two million in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Most households in Ngaqu Prefecture huddled in tents before
1959. However, such a scene can hardly being found in today's
Ngaqu, because local residents there have long bidden farewell to
tents and moved into new houses, in front of which there are
usually small wind-powered generators.
</P>
<P>
With 17 households, De'gyi Village in the county boasts 27
wind-powered generators, which supply residents with enough
electricity for light, heat and TV.
</P>
<P>
With a smile on her face, Tsedron said, "It never occurred to
me that wind could generate electricity."

</P>
<P>
The project is a nationwide education program to help children

dropouts return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
In his letter Hu said the project has become a driving force
for the development of education in the less-developed areas,
through raising funds for the poor pupils.
</P>
<P>
Hu also asked the whole of society to show sympathy and render
support for the project.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised should be used exclusively in the
poverty-stricken areas, where they are needed most, he added.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started six years ago, has so far helped
more than one million children.

<HEADLINE> Woman Among Gunman Hostages in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A woman is believed to be among
the three hostages held by the gunman who killed at least 32
people in the worst massacre in Australia's modern history this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Police told local ABC television that a man and a woman were
believed to be the owner of the Seacape bed and breakfast cottage
at Port Arthur in Tasmania where they were kept hostage by the
gunman. The third man is believed to be an interstate tourist from
other part of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the gunman had stopped shooting at police
since 7:30 pm local time. Police are still negotiating with him.
</P>
<P>
Barry Bennet, police officer in charge of the investigation,
said that the gunman "appears to be very calm." He said that
police had been unable to speak to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tasmanian police was trying to negotiate a solution
with the gunman.
</P>
<P>
"If that takes us a day, two days, that's our policy. What
we'll be trying to do (is) to end this without any more
bloodshed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman shot dead at least 32 people and injured 18 or more
early this afternoon. He killed adults and children
indiscriminately in a packed cafe. Then he walked outside and
drove away in his car, shooting his victims one by one as they
screamed and ran away from him along a five-kilometer trail.
</P>
<P>
"It was a gun that meant to kill people," a witness said.

<HEADLINE> Manila's Domestic Liquidity Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' domestic
liquidity or M3 has reached 761.3 billion pesos (30.45 billion US
dollars) as of end-January 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank, the figure was 25.8 percent
higher than the 605.2 billion peso (24.21 billion US dollars)
level posted for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in domestic liquidity was due to the expansion in
credits to the private sector in the past few months, the Central
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Central Bank assures it continue to adopt a
cautious policy stance in the management of monetary aggregates to
be able to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
In its first quarter report to President Fidel Ramos, the
Central Bank admitted that in order to bring down inflation to
single-digit levels, it has to adjust interest rates to keep
liquidity in the financial system at manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's management of monetary aggregates was
reflected in the movements of both base money and reserve money,
which ran below program ceilings agreed with the International
Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> CDC Profits Up In 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The British-based Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) has made a pre-tax surplus of 110
million Pounds Sterling last year, an increase of 26 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
CDC regional manager David Johns said in a statement released
today that total investments at the end of 1995 were 1,487
million Pounds in 369 enterprises of 50 countries where the
corporation operated.
</P>
<P>
During the year under review, new investments were up by 15
percent to 276 million Pounds, with 90 percent of new approvals
in poorer countries, 47 percent in Sub-Sahara Africa and a first
investment in South Africa, Johns revealed.
</P>
<P>
He announced that CDC had opened new offices in Mozambique,
Uganda and Bangladesh and a second office in India while it had
received permission to operate in Laos and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, he quoted CDC chairman Lord Cairns as saying that
financial constraints were greeting a growing challenge for the
corporation to maintain its momentum.
</P>
<P>
CDC is an British overseas development finance institution
whose operations concentrate on poor commonwealth countries.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 32 in Port Arthur Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Death toll rose to 32 in the
worst massacre in Australia's modern history.
</P>
<P>
Barry Bennet, police officer in charge of the investigation,
said that so far 32 people had been confirmed dead in the massacre
by a gunman at Port Arthur in Tasmania early this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At least 18 people were injured. Overseas tourists are believed
to be among the victims, including children and at least one baby.
</P>
<P>
A team of crime scene experts and ballistic police have been
flown to Tasmania from New South Wales to help investigate the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Police said that death toll was likely to continue to rise as
searching for bodies is still going on.
</P>
<P>
The lone gunman is still holding three hostages in a bed and
breakfast cottage at Port Arthur and firing at police in random
shots.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the gunman has put forward some conditions for
his surrender but refused to deliberate. The hostages are believed
to be alive, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Geoff Easton said that the identity of the
gunman and the three hostages could not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the gunman was in his late teenage or early
20s. He was a blond "surfie-looking fellow."
</P>
<P>
The man drove a Volkswagen car with a surfboard on the roof,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
He had been chatting with tourists "quite lucidly" when he
walked into the packed cafe at the Port Arthur Historic Site early
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"He said 'there are a lot of wasps around today, there aren't
many Japs, are there?' and then began muttering to himself," a
witness said.
</P>
<P>
Wasp is an acronym that refers to "white anglo saxon
protestants." The meaning of the word has been broadened to cover
all white people.
</P>
<P>
He carried a tennis bag. At about 2:30 pm local time, he
suddenly pulled out an automatic rifle out of the bag and began to
shoot at people indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
"He left the site shooting as he went, shooting everybody he
could see," said Wendy Scurr, who was working at the front desk of
the historic site.
</P>
<P>
She said that the gunman continued to shoot at people after he
went outside the cafe. He picked up his victims one by one as
people screamed and ran from him.
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going bang bang bang--it was bang and then he'd pick
someone else out and line them up and shoot them," witness Phillip
Milburn told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
The gunman also shot at a number of cars and shot more people
dead at the nearby Fox and Hounds Hotel when he drove away from
the site of the first shooting.
</P>
<P>
He drove five km and took hostages before he was rounded up in
the cottage. Then he continued to shoot at helicopters that took
his victims to hospital, witnesses said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Nationwide Crackdown on Major Crimes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China launched a nationwide
crackdown on major crimes today in an effort to ferret out a batch
of major cases, pursue and capture a large number of escaped
prisoners, and give relentless blows to criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Public Security, the crackdown
will focus on robbery and theft that target financial institutions
and urban residential areas, improve the social order of chaotic
regions, smash drug-trafficking and prostitution, and confiscate
unlawful firearms and ammunitions, so as to help ensure a better
social order.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Chinese central government has recently
given a series of major important instructions, calling for a
nationwide crackdown on major crimes, in a bid to improve the
sense of security among the general public.
</P>
<P>
As Ren Jianxin, secretary of the Political Science and Law
Committee under the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, noted in a recent speech: "The national campaign is not
only an important decision made by the CPC Central Committee, but
an urgent necessity for maintaining social stability."
</P>
<P>
Tao Siju, minister of public security, made detailed
arrangements at a recent national conference on the campaign,
saying that "as a major action responding to the calls of the
people, the crackdown will have a great impact on the prestige and
images of the Party, the government and the ministry in the hearts
of the general public."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that, "the successful carrying out of the
campaign is of crucial importance for economic growth and
political stability, as well as for the further implementation of
the country's reform and opening-up drive in the coming years."

<P>
However, the minister warned that the national police force
should fully acknowledge the seriousness of the present social
situation across the country, adding that they should carry out
the campaign in accordance with orders from all senior governments
and public security departments.
</P>
<P>
Tao said he hopes the police ranks can display their
confidence, commitment, courage and capability during the
implementation of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, generally speaking, the social order
in China has been stable this year, with the exception that major
criminal cases have witnessed a marked increase.
</P>
<P>
During the January-February period the number of major criminal
cases which had been put on file jumped by 12.6 percent compared
with same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that the most eye-catching problems
are the number of major robberies which mainly target financial
institutions, cash-carrying vehicles, and jewelry shops, robberies
of vehicles on highways, and murder.
</P>
<P>
Criminal gangs which engage in drug-trafficking, prostitution,
and the abducting and selling of children and women are rampant in
some regions, the ministry said, adding that a considerable amount
of firearms and ammunition which are unlawfully available in
society pose a grave threat to law and order.

<HEADLINE> Group Of 77 Backs China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The group of 77 issued a
ministerial declaration here today, voicing support for the entry
of developing countries including China into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"The universality of the WTO, which is of great importance to
strengthening and improving the multilateral trading system, must
also be realized as soon as possible," the Group of 77, which has
at present 128 members, said in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that developing countries seeking accession to
the WTO "should be given the opportunity to achieve accession on
balanced terms consistent with WTO rules, as well as the level of
their economic development, trade, and financial and
developmental needs."
</P>
<P>
China has been negotiating on its terms of entering the WTO
but her effort is blocked by some western powers which claim
china should enter as a developed, not developing country.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by the Group of 77 and China together
although China does not belong to the group. So that means the
Group of 77 backs China's entry into the WTO and shows its
displeasure at those who oppose China's being admitted into the
world trade body.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said, "we express our deep concern at the
continuing use of coercive economic measures against developing
countries, through inter alia, unilateral economic and trade
sanctions which are in clear contradiction with international
law.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, we object to the new attempts aimed at
extra-territorial application of domestic law, which constitute a
flagrant violation of the UN Charter and of WTO rules."
</P>
<P>
It also urged UNCTAD to seek solutions to the problems of
poverty and find durable solutions to debt and debt service
problems of the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Demand German Support to Solve Beef Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain is likely to demand German
support to lift the European Union's worldwide ban on British beef
exports as the two heads of British and German governments meet in
London Monday, senior British officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks to be held in No 10 Downing Street, British
Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will
discuss the beef issue and European integration.
</P>
<P>
However, being unsatisfied with what Britain is doing against
the mad cow disease, Kohl is likely to make it clear that a
settlement of the beef issue depends completely on efforts from
the British side.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed on March 27 to restore consumer confidence
after the British government announced a week earlier that the mad
cow disease could spread to humans.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders would also discuss the issue of European
integration. But as the two countries are widely divided on the
future blueprint of Europe, the summit is unlikely to yield any
positive results on that subject.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
will look for alternative funding for the last part of a rural
electrification project following withdrawal of Norwegian aid.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press today, this was disclosed at the
State House in the town of Zanzibar on Friday by the chief
government spokesman, Ali Tahir, when reacting to reports that
Norway had frozen 4.5 million US Dollars earmarked for the
project.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Norway was unhappy with the political
situation in Zanzibar and accused Salmin Amour's government of
human rights violations, so it decided to stop supporting the
project.
</P>
<P>
The government chief spokesman told reporters that the
government would identify new sources of funds for the project
and that the people should not be worried by the donor country's
decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Tahir pointed out that it was unethical for foreign
missions in Tanzania to interfere with internal affairs of the
country such as elections.

recent important decision by the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee on safeguarding social order across the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is hailed by an editorial in tomorrow's "People's
Daily", which says, "It is a major action responding to calls
from the general public, and will create a better environment for
the smooth implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and
long-term objectives for the Year 2010."
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, China has enjoyed stable social order this
year thanks to the painstaking efforts of the national police
force, the editorial says. However, rampant crimes in some
regions, especially a series of major criminal cases, have caused
alarm.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the central authorities have decided to focus on
cracking down on such major criminal activities as murder,
robbery, prostitution, and drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for Party committees and governments at all
levels to deal with the relations between reform, development and
stability properly, and not to focus their attention only on
developing the economy, while neglecting social stability.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of regions that are in a chaotic state will be held
responsible for this, the editorial says, if they can not
achieve obvious improvements after a set period of time.
</P>
<P>
The police ranks across the country should fully acknowledge
the necessity and importance of the movement, as well as the great
responsibility they have to shoulder, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In carring out the campaign, they should adhere to the
principle of severely cracking down on major crimes in accordance
with the law, in a bid to fully safeguard the rights and interests
of all law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also adds that Party committees and governments
at all levels should enlist the general public in the campaign,
adding that full mobilization of the masses will leave criminals
no room to hide.

</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Samir Borhan said that the upcoming visit
to Egypt is another reflection of the good relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>

developing future-oriented bilateral ties and issues of common
concern, including the situations in the Middle East and Southeast
Asia, and many other international issues.
</P>
<P>
Malian Ambassador to China Kafougouna Kone noted that Jiang
will be the first Chinese president ever to visit Mali, which is a
great event in Mali-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Kone noted that Mali-China relations have been built on the
basis of equality, reciprocity and mutual respect, which are firm
and full of vitality, and can be viewed as an example for
south-south co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Ambassador Peter Mweshihange said that, on the basis
of the already existing bilateral political and economic ties,
this visit "will further enhance and strengthen these ties and
enable both countries to expand these fields to other feasible
spheres of co-operation."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said that his
country, which attaches great importance to this visit, holds that
it is necessary for Zimbabwe and China to further strengthen
bilateral relations in the current situation.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-African ties, Simani said that China and African
countries enjoy traditional friendship which can stand any test.
</P>
<P>
Simani noted that China, which has experienced various problems
as a developing country, has set itself up as an example for all
developing countries, and can help other developing countries
solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Jiang's visit will push Sino-African relations to a
new high, Yohannes said that "China, not in words alone but also
in deeds, has proved to a trustworthy friend of Africa".
</P>
<P>
He added, "China's policy toward Africa has been consistent,
and it has unreservedly and with no strings attached rendered
valuable economic and technical assistance, and has established
cultural ties with numerous African countries."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "all these endeavors have helped China to win
the admiration and respect that is duly deserved".
</P>
<P>
Samir noted that Jiang's visit will "pave the way for China to
intensify its relationship with African countries to the benefit
of both".
</P>
<P>
There is "an excellent opportunity" for the development of
economic and trade relations, and China is "in the first place in
this respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kone held this visit is a very important one in the history of
Africa-China relations, saying that in the past few years
relations with developing countries, especially with African
countries, have constituted an important part of China's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
This visit will enable Jiang to witness Africa's new
achievements and discuss Africa's priorities for consideration

undoubtedly contribute to strengthening the traditional friendship
between China and African nations.
</P>
<P>
Chidyausiku said that the planned visit shows that China
attaches importance to its ties with African nations and it will
further enhance Africa-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Samir said that China and African countries "need each other in
the international fora, as they are confronted by certain powers
which want to reshape the whole international community according
to their own norms" which are "against the African and Chinese
norms and traditions".
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China and African countries enhance their
co-operation by "better understanding each other's points of view
on international issues, exchange support and have consultations
on a regular basis for the common field of interests."
</P>
<P>
Kone emphasized that Africa and China pay great attention to
each other's concerns, and the mutual support in international
arenas between China and Africa is the best reflection of the many
common views shared by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that this visit will provide an opportunity for the two
sides to discuss international issues.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the human rights issue, the Kenyan and Zimbabwean
ambassadors held that people's basic rights such as food, shelter
and clothing are the primary human rights, and China and African
countries share the same or similar views on this point.
</P>
<P>
They said that for developing countries human rights protection
should be in line with their development stages, and it is a
mistake to simply copy the mode of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Different cultural backgrounds, histories and traditions should
all be taken into account in this regard, they said, noting that
human rights should not be imposed on people with different
traditions and outlooks of life.
</P>
<P>
This opinion of developing sovereign states should get respect
from others, held the two ambassadors.

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Benefit From New Debt Relief Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is one of the seven
African countries expected to benefit from a new debt relief
proposal by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) next five years, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement released in Washington as saying
that the World Bank has ratified a proposal with amendments by
IMF to lobby the Paris Club of creditor governments to provide as
much as 90 percent debt reduction for the seven countries.
</P>
<P>
The seven countries are Burundi, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Sao
Tome and Principe, the Sudan, Zaire and Zambia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the provision of the debt relief for the eligible
countries would depend on performance of the structural
adjustment program in these countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it added that the World Bank and IMF have frozen
debt relief to African countries next five years except the
seven.
</P>
<P>
At present, the stock of Zambia's external debt stands at 6.2
billion US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bloodshed At Islamic Gathering In South Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and three others wounded after Somali gunmen loyal to General
Mohamed Aideed opened fire upon a religious gathering at the
biggest Islamic mosque in South Mogadishu this morning.
</P>
<P>
This happened when the religious men were planning to perform
a huge prayer marking the biggest Islamic festival of Eid-l-ad-ha
which all the Islamic world have been celebrating today wherever
they are.
</P>
<P>
The gathering which was scheduled to end with a worshiping of
Allah to contain the hostility between the Somalis. The religious
scholars who were also planning to hold a long march through the
main streets of Mogadishu were seen as a political threat by
General Aideed who sent three of his painted armed wagons to
disperse the gathering and ban the use of the biggest mosque
known as the Islamic alliance.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of General Aideed have surrounded the mosque
and are preventing the people from going to the mosque to perform
their prayers.
</P>
<P>
According to religious affairs analysts, the incident was
backed by a religious Sufism group fully supported by General
Aideed. The Sufism group stands firm against any religious public
gathering beyond their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of scholars have took to the streets of South
Mogadishu after the news of the incident was heard throughout the
city. The scholars wearing white Islamic gowns and waving white
scarves protested against the incident.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Omar Faruq, a well known preacher, was expected to
address to the religious gathering which was announced four days
ago by moderate Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He recently came from Europe to stress the role of Islamic
scholars in the on-going armed conflict between the opposing
factions in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time General Aideed has fired upon such a
religious gathering. More than seven people were killed when the
supporters of General Aideed shelled upon a religious gathering at
Darawishta Park in June 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The outskirts of the China's
largest Shanghai city has become one of the country's most
affluent rural areas - with a good sprinkling of
millionaire-villages.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 3,000 villages in outskirtan Shanghai each
earn one million yuan-worth in profits every year - bringing
prosperity to local people.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 600 rural families shows that per capita annual
income in the municipality's outlying areas was 4,200 yuan last
year, more than 46 percent of it coming from township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Of the total rural living expenditure, spending on food
witnessed a slight drop to 30 percent or so in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year there was an average 74 black-and-white TV sets, 49
color TV sets, 63 washing machines, 56 refrigerators, and 22
motorcycles for every 100 peasants, well up on previous lists of
modern conveniences - mod cons, as they are known in the Western
world.
</P>
<P>
Most peasants get old-age pensions, and individuals in the
outlying areas now share medical expenses with the villages.
</P>
<P>
Qizhong Village in Maqiao township, 25 km away from downtown
Shanghai, generated 1.1 billion yuan in industrial output value
last year, with per-capita share reaching 800,000 yuan - reaching
the standard of advanced countries. It made it one of the richest
townships in China.
</P>
<P>
This was due to the village's co-operation with large
state-owned enterprises and overseas businesses in urban areas to
develop industrial enterprises and service trades.
</P>
<P>
Five enterprises in Qizhong Village earned nearly 100 million
yuan in profits last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The re-opening of the Nigeria-
Benin border last week has led to the depreciation of the
Nigerian currency Naira against CFA in circulation in Benin even
as more than 300 soldiers remain at the border posts.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of Naira against CFA, according to the
''Sunday punch'' newspaper today, stood at 200 Naira for 125 CFA
before the closure of the border seven weeks ago. It fell to 200
for 122 CFA immediately after the announcement of the re-opening.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the decline, the newspaper said, may not be
unconnected with the unprecedented influx of Nigerians,
especially petty traders, to Benin as a result of the re-opening
of the border.
</P>
<P>
The traders who buy various items including second hand
clothes, shoes, bags, turkey meat and rice, for sale in Nigeria
carry large sums of money which is normally ''crossed'' for them
by uniformed men at the border posts.
</P>
<P>
The cross border trade between Nigeria and Benin was severely
affected during the closure while smuggling through illegal
routes assumed an alarming rate, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the border had then reportedly affected the
prices of many imported goods such as rice, second hand clothes,
tyres, textile materials and turkey meat.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper said, business activities across the
border is reported gradually picking up as prices of goods are
said to be falling.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Continues to Shoot at Police in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The gunman who killed 25 people
at Port Arthur in Tasmania, Australia was still shooting at police
as he was held up with a hostage in a cottage in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local ABC television reported that the gunman shot at police
from the cottage where he holds hostages.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that the police were attempting to
negotiate with the man. More than 200 police have sealed off the
area around the house.
</P>
<P>
The man is still unidentified. Witnesses said that he was in
his late teenage or early 20s. The man was a blond
"surfie-looking fellow." He had been chatting with tourists
"quite lucidly" when he walked into the packed cafe at the Port
Arthur Historic Site early this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"He said 'there are a lot of wasps around today, there aren't
many Japs, are there?' and then began muttering to himself," a
witness said.
</P>
<P>
Wasps is an acronym that refers to "white Anglo Saxon
Protestants." The meaning of the word has been broadened to cover
all white people.
</P>
<P>
The man drove a Volkswagen car with a surfboard on the roof,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The man began to shoot at people indiscriminately in the cafe
with an automatic rifle at 1:30 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
"He left the site shooting as he went, shooting everybody he
could see," said Wendy Scurr, who was working at the front desk of
the historic site.
</P>
<P>
She said that the gunman continued to shoot at people after he
went outside the cafe. He picked up his victims one by one as
people screamed and ran from him.
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going bang bang bang -- it was bang and then he'd
pick someone else out and line them up and shoot them," witness
Phillip Milburn told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
The gunman also shot at a number of cars and shot more people
dead at the nearby Fox and Hounds Hotel when he drove away from
the site of the first shootings.
</P>
<P>
He drove five km and took hostages before he was rounded up in
a cottage. Then he continued to shoot at helicopters that took
his victims to hospitals, witnesses said.

HONG KONG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police are
investigating suspected links between a car bomb outside Stanley
Prison and two other attacks on prison property.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded outside Hong Kong's Stanley Prison Saturday
night, damaging a car used by a prison officer.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, a tin can believed to contain paint thinner, was lit
and placed beneath the car outside the prison superintendent's
staff quarters while the officer was watching TV.
</P>
<P>
The incident follows attack on two prison facilities in Stanley
Prison and Siu Lam Psychiatric Center in the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday masked men threatened to kill a guard before
driving a 24-ton truck into a Siu Lam gatehouse.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, a crane was driven into a sentry booth at Stanley
Prison.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hong Kong Correctional Services Department

more guards outside all correctional facilities at night.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous two attacks could well be related to last

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The suburban areas of this,
China's largest city is becoming more attractive to overseas
businessmen nowadays, owing to the rapidly improving
infrastructure and cheap land and labor.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the city set up more than 1,200 foreign-funded
enterprises on its outskirts, with contractual overseas investment
reaching more than 3.8 billion US dollars. The total investment of
large projects with more than 10 million US dollars each accounted
for half of the total amount imported by the area.
</P>
<P>
The city now has a total of more than 6,000 foreign-funded
enterprises in the suburbs, involving nearly 10 billion US dollars
in contractual overseas investment, with the number of
overseas-funded projects accounting for half of the total in
the city.
</P>
<P>
The focus of overseas investment in the local rural areas is
shifting from the former labor-intensive industries, such as
textiles, to capital-intensive hi-tech items, with the number of
machinery and electronics projects accounting for 34 percent of
the total overseas-funded ones.
</P>
<P>
Rural agriculture, tourism and the service trades are also
attracting increasing overseas investment. The city now has
nearly 300 overseas-funded agricultural projects in the suburbs,
with total investment reaching 600 million US dollars, covering
the production of vegetables, flowers and non-staple foodstuffs as
well as animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Maqiao Town, 25 km from the downtown area, is an epitome of the
burgeoning Sino-overseas co-operation in the local rural areas. It

CANBERRA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A gunman who shot dead 25 people
is now being held up in a cottage with a hostage at Port Arthur in

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Draft Budget Envisages Deficit of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti government's
draft budget for the next fiscal year sets the deficit at 1.102
billion dinars, or 3.674 billion U.S. dollars, some 326 million
dollars lower than the budgeted deficit for the current fiscal
year, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The country's revenues for the next fiscal year, mostly from
oil, were forecast at 2.975 billion dinars (9.916 billion
dollars), up 65 million dinars (216.66 million dollars ) from the
current 1995-1996 fiscal year which ends on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures were estimated at 4.077 billion dinars (13.59
billion dollars) for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Figures for next year's revenues are calculated at an oil
production rate of 2 million barrels a day, at the price of 13
dollars a barrel, according to the country's Finance Minister
Nasser al-Rowdhan. The current oil price is about 15 to 16 dollars
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget will be submitted to the National Assembly for
deliberation and approval.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Kuwaiti Economic Consultancy, an
official body giving analysis of economic situations in the world
as well as Kuwait, the draft envisaging an annual deficit
reduction of 170 million Kuwait dinars (561 million dollars)
"falls short of the average annual reduction actually required to
eliminate the deficit by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
The report said an average deficit reduction of 250 million
dinars (825 million dollars) per annum would be needed to
eradicate the deficit by the end of the century. the Kuwaiti
fiscal year runs from july 1 to june 30.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is running a fiscal deficit of about 4 billion dollars
for the current fiscal year, compared with 4.36 billion
U.S. dollars the previous year,
</P>
<P>
The budgetary funds of this small oil-rich emirate mainly rely
on oil exports. The budget situation is seriously affected by
fluctuations of the oil prices in the world market. Many other
factors including wage increases and additional employment also
have impact on the government efforts to eradicate the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Although rich in oil, Kuwait's economy has been burdened by
low oil prices and the high costs of the 1991 Gulf war which
liberated the emirate from Iraq's seven-month occupation.
</P>
<P>
The plan to eliminate budget deficits by the year 2000
envisages the introduction of new taxes, increase of custom
tariffs and a possible rise in the prices of gasoline, water and
electricity.

<HEADLINE> Top U.S. Economists Call for Extension of MFN to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two top U.S. economists called
for an extension of the most-favoured-nation status (MFN) to
China, saying that it will be a big mistake for the U.S. to deny
MFN treatment to China.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a mistake, of the first order, for the U.S. to deny
the most-favoured-nation treatment to China," said Richard Cooper,
chairman of U.S. National Intelligence Council and economic
advisor to President Clinton, in an interview with Xinhua here
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about China's joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of Yale School of
Management, said that it is absolutely crucial that China be in
the WTO, and its crucial to both the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
"If China is outside of the system, it will cause tremendous
problems for the smooth growth of trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of intellectual property rights, he said, "We
agree the Chinese government has tried very hard, and a lot of
progress has been made. There is no question, but we understand
the enforcement will be tough because it's a new system for China,
and it will take a long time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believes that granting China the most-favored-nation-status
will be beneficial to the U.S. "U.S. has a strong interest in
normal trade with China for two reasons," he explained, adding
that "the products we buy are very good for the U.S economy, the
imports are very healthy because it give us more choice and helps
competition and keeps the prices down. And the quality of Chinese
products is getting better and better."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't give China normal trade status, China will not
give us normal trade status, and we need the Chinese market for
our exports. So for both countries, the extension of the MFN is
very important," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. economists yesterday attended an international
workshop on China's economic reform and development which was
sponsored by Qinghua University.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Unearth 5,600-Year-Old Pottery Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
unearthed a 5,600-year-old colorful pottery pot which features a
painting of two men lifting a heavy object.
</P>
<P>
The 11.3-centimeter high pottery pot was dug out from an
ancient tomb at the Zongri site in Tongde County, Hainan Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, the Beijing-based
Guangming Daily reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The painting which used round dots to indicate the men's head,
thick lines as their torsos and thin lines as their arms and legs,
depicts two men standing with two legs apart, backs humping
slightly and their hands lifting a huge round object, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
"The design on the pottery painting is surprisingly similar to
those rock paintings found in Altai Mountains along the boders
between China and Mongolia," a researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The pot's mouth is 24.2 centimeters in diameter and bottom 9.7
centimeters in diameter, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire to Bring Quiet to Northern Israel: Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli army officer
has said that the cease-fire arrangement with pro-Iranian
Hezbollah in Lebanon would bring peace and quiet to northern
Israel "for a long time."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Tel Aviv late Saturday night,
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of staff of the Israeli Armed Forces,
expressed his belief that life in the northern part of Israel
would quickly return to normal.
</P>
<P>
An understanding announced Friday by U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres ended
the 17-day Israeli "Operation Grapes of Wrath" against Hezbollah,
or Party of God, in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahak noted that the understanding was not a total
cease-fire or a peace agreement, as Hezbollah can still attack
Israeli forces, while the Israeli army will be able to hit back at
Hezbollah in southern Lebanon even if guerrillas take shelter in
villages there.
</P>
<P>
He added that the understanding could only be judged over
time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli military intelligence chief Moshe Ya'alon
said Hezbollah survived the military operation with its weapons
intact. He added that it had never been the Israeli army's
intention to disarm it.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon told reporters that Hezbollah can continue to carry
out attacks in the "security zone" after the operation, which
started on April 11, and after the cease-fire arrangement.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Hezbollah "has to think very hard before it
violates the cease-fire arrangement when it comes to shooting
Katyusha rockets and firing on civilians."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that Hezbollah would try to violate the
arrangement, but the Syrian and Lebanese governments, as well
as the Israeli army's deterrence would prevent this.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, tens of thousands of residents began returning to
their homes in southern Lebanon, shortly after the U.S.-brokered
cease-fire arrangement took into effect at 4:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of buildings in southern Lebanon were destroyed or
damaged during the 17-day military operation, mainly as a result
of Israeli shelling and air raids against the Hezbollah targets in
the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesman Timur Goksel
said Saturday that there was a total of 600 air attacks in the
areas under the U.N. supervision during the operation, which did
not include regions to the north and east, such as Beirut and the
western Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Goksel said, Israeli army gunners fired
around 25,000 artillery shells at targets north of the "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL also recorded a total of 1,200 Katyusha rocket
launchings from Lebanon, although not all of those fired fell
into Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Lebanon, at least 160 Lebanese
civilians were killed and over 300 wounded during the 17-day
operation.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, 127 people had been treated for mainly
light injures or shock caused by Katyusha attacks in the days
leading up to and during the operation, while at least 1,400
buildings in northern towns and villages were damaged.
</P>
<P>
However, by far the worst damage was in southern Lebanon,
where roads, water and electricity supplies were also seriously
damaged or completely destroyed during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross and relief agencies, especially those affiliated
directly with the U.N., are expected to be at the forefront of
attempts to rebuild the south after the cease-fire
arrangement.

<HEADLINE> IMF Provides 216 Million US Dollars To Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has provided a loan worth 216 million US Dollars to Kenya,
Kenya's local paper "Sunday Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board met in Washington on Friday approved Kenya's
request for a three-year arrangement to draw the money from the
Fund under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The loan was approved ahead of a visit to the country today by
IMF's Managing Director Michael Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has applauded the granting of the IMF loan and
reiterated its commitment to further economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Consultative Group for Kenya meeting in Paris
recommended a quick disbursement of 730 million US Dollars. The
money was pledged in 1994, and it was delayed to release because
the donors were not satisfied with Kenya's political and economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last month's decision by donors "is seen as the final proof
of renewed donor confidence in the Kenyan government."

<HEADLINE> No Kaunda, No Polls, Says Zambia's Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United National Independence
Party (UNIP), the largest opposition in Zambia, has declared that
this year's general elections will not take place if UNIP
president Kenneth Kaunda is barred from contesting the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Times of Zambia" today quoted special assistant for
press to Kaunda, Muhabi Lungu as saying that the government was
free to go to court or do anying they wanted, but Kaunda would
still contest the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Lungu was reacting to an announcement by the ruling party's
national chairman Sikota Wina that there was sufficient evidence
that former President Kaunda was a foreigner and that he would
not be allowed to rule Zambia again.
</P>
<P>
If Kaunda was barred from standing for presidential candidate,
the elections would not be held, Lungu said, declining to
elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced beyond the shadow of doubt that Dr Kaunda
has the right to stand because he is a Zambian," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kaunda will not qualify for presidential
candidate in the coming elections if the draft constitution is
adopted by Parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
One clause in the draft constitution stipulates that only
second generation Zambians are qualified to stand for
presidential candidates. But Kaunda is not a second generation
Zambian because his parents are Malawians.

Hamas prisoners to go on trial after the four suicide bombings in
late February and early March will be completed "within three
weeks."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders freed are Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar,
released six days ago, Ahmed Bahar, an imam, and former negotiator
and newspaper editor Sayed Abu Musameh, released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qidrah said Palestinian police have discovered coordination
between Islamic Jihad and Hamas and also "Israeli radicals,"
which he said had been shown by statements made by Israeli
radicals and by Hamas activists. He said he could not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Adnan-Ghoul, No. 2 figure of the Hamas armed
wing, would shed light on these connections as well as help in
locating its No. 1 head Mohammed Deif, he said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qidrah said the release had nothing to do with Eid al-Adha
(Moslems' Feast of the Sacrifice) which began today, or a feeling
of relaxation after the passage of an amendment to the
Palestinian national charter, but only with the progress of legal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
At its session held in Gaza, the Palestine National Council
Wednesday adopted the decision to scrap clauses in the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) charter calling for destruction of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 of the 900 arrested by Palestinian police following the
wave of bombing attacks reportedly remain in jail.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Manuscript Collection to be Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A collection of Dunhuang
Manuscripts, containing more than 30 million characters, is to be
published by the Hangzhou University Publishing House in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of manuscripts in the Dunhuang Caves, Gansu
Province, was one of most important events in China's modern
cultural history as their contents cover politics, economy,
literature and art, as well as Buddhism in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers found it hard to read these manuscripts
as they were all written by hand and inevitably contain
many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a group of experts in the field, Hangzhou University
started the work of editing the manuscripts several years ago, and
now they are ready for publication.
</P>
<P>
The first volume of the collection is expected to be published
next year. The whole work will take five to eight years.

XINING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
has plans for a five-year afforestation drive that involves 27
cities and counties and covers 363,000 sq km of the province, more
than half of its total area.
</P>
<P>
The drive will use 228 million yuan in funding, and is intended
to provide a better environment in barren and mountainous parts of
the province, such as the Hehuang Valley, around Qinghai Lake, and
in the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the problem of having only 2.6 percent forest
coverage, as well as the larger problem of desertification and
soil erosion, local people have managed to complete work on
390,000 ha in a large forest shelter project, and have planted 130
million trees in barren areas, after several years of work.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Women in Nepal Launch Anti-Alcohol Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 28 (Xinhua) -- As the habit of heavy alcohol
drinking among many Nepalese males has created increasing social
and household problems, women in some parts of the country began
to take action to protect themselves from this traditional social
ill.
</P>
<P>
Reports of anti-alcohol activities by local women of various
urban and rural areas are not rare these days, indicating that
Nepalese women, known for their hard working and obedience, have
raised awareness of self-protection and organized together to
fight their husbands who usually waste their money and time making
themselves drunken.
</P>
<P>
A women rights group in the western industrial city of Pokhara
recently organized a procession against alcohol selling and
consumption. Women activists collected alcoholic drinks from local
shops and pubs and destroyed them to demonstrate their hatred for
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
Women were often found the biggest victims of their husbands'
love for heavy drinking especially in some rural areas where men
spent their whole days in chatting, cards playing and drinking
with the hard-earned money from their wives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, women in several northern districts in the country's
Himalayan region had initiated similar movement, demanding local
authorities to ban alcohol manufacture, distribution and
consumption in their villages.
</P>
<P>
Members of local anti-alcohol groups said that they were
regularly physically abused by their drunken husbands and they
would try their best efforts to clear away alcoholic drinks from
their communities.
</P>
<P>
Men spent money in drinking and returned home with empty hands,
they quarreled with family members and misbehaved when they could
not get money for drinking from their wives, said one woman of a
local anti-alcohol group in Dolakha district, about 60 kilometers
northeast of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Anti-alcohol groups in Dolakha and neighboring districts held
mass rallies to call for supports from local authorities and
people for their alcohol control activities.
</P>
<P>
With the support of local authorities, they set some rules for
punishing those drinking alcohol. For example, one being proved
of drinking for the first and second time would be fined 200 and
500 rupees (4 and 10 US dollars) respectively, and those who are
found drinking alcohol for the third time would be handed over to
police.
</P>
<P>
They also set a provision of punishment for those who distill
alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
However, the alcohol control activities have affected another
group of women in these villages who used to earn their living by
selling alcohol drinks to drunkards.
</P>
<P>
Local administrations have directed these anti-alcohol groups
to find alternative employment opportunities for the women in
alcohol-selling business whose liveliness was facing risk as a
result of their campaign.

<HEADLINE> Jail Riot in Canada Injures 42 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 34 inmates and 8 prison
guards were hospitalized as a result of a 24-hour riot in a
Manitoba jail, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The riot began as prisoners attacked one another and assailed
the jail guards in the Headingley Correctional Institution outside
the Manitoba capital of Winnipeg, southern Canada, on Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were 321 prisoners in the jail when the riot started,
most of whom are convicts serving sentences of less than two years
for theft and assault.
</P>
<P>
The riot has also caused extensive damage to the jail buildings
as inmates set several fires and rampaged through the places.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has launched a massive
investigation into the riot, the largest one in the province of
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
Manitoba Justice Minister Rosemary Vodrey, who visited the
scene today, was quoted as saying that she was "sickened by what a
rioting group of criminal inmates did."
</P>
<P>
"The inmates will never walk away from this," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that there are rival gangs in the prison, but the
rioting appeared to have targeted prisoners who had been convicted
of sex crimes or prisoners who had become informants.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Bangladesh
have expressed their support for the timetable for fresh elections
announced by the Election Commission (EC) last night.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation over television and radio, Chief
Election Commissioner (CEC) Abu Hena announced that the
parliamentary elections will be held on June 12 and the last date
for filing nomination papers is May 12.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) welcomed
the announcement, although it said it would be more convenient for
all if the election date were set for sometime in May, as the
month of June in the country is characterized by rains, cyclones
and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
The BNP had stuck to its demand for holding the polls no later
than May.
</P>
<P>
In a swift response to the announcement of the poll schedule,
the Awami (People's) League (AL), the former largest opposition
party, said the party was fully prepared to take part in the June
12 polls. The AL would extend all-out cooperation to the EC in
implementing its plan for conducting a "free and fair poll," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Another major party, the Jatiya (National) Party (JP), also
expressed its satisfaction with the poll schedule, saying it was
in keeping with the 90-day timeframe for holding the polls.
</P>
<P>
All the major parties said they will distribute nomination
forms on May 1 or May 2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP and the AL have decided on their separate
programs for public meetings, to be held at the same avenue on the
same day of June 10.
</P>
<P>
In his speech last night, Hena asked all political parties to
strictly follow the code of conduct.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Demands New Order in World Banana Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and the European Union (EU)
are still as poles apart in opinions concerning the world banana
market as their geographic separation.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, however, has thrown down the gauntlet by demanding
more than just an arbitration from the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
The central American country, world's largest banana producer,
has demanded a mandatory import of 2.75 million tons of banana a
year by the 15-nation EU, the elimination of import license on the
part of the EU and a revision of EU commercialization framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The WTO Executive Council studied Wednesday the Ecuadorian
case, but the Ecuadorians may have to wait 180 days before they
can hear the final say as regards the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Simon Canarte, director of the Banana Producers Association of
Ecuador, said that an ideal situation would be created if the
licenses would be made less weighty or even be replaced by a
tariff system.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by the Ecuadorian Agriculture and Livestock
Ministry shows that Ecuador has lost 71.754 million dollars in its
banana sales to EU as a result of the license system.
</P>
<P>
The study predicts that the loss will reach 1.312 billion
dollars in the year 2002 if the license system persists.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the Netherlands are importing bananas from Latin
America with a 20-percent tariff whereas Spain, Britain, Greece
and Portugal are forbidden to buy the fruit there.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the only European country that imports banana from
Latin America without applying tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Of late, the EU has expressed its willingness to solve the

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo
Frei's current visit to Argentina will consolidate Chile's
relations with Argentina and speed up its entry into the Southern
Cone Common Market (Mercosur), local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The visit came when economic links between Chile and Argentina
are progressing with rapid growth of trade and investments. Sixty
percent of Chilean direct investments abroad, up to 5.5 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of 1995, are in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, a series of cooperation agreements,
especially on the common border and culture, have been signed,
opening a wide area to future integration.
</P>
<P>
Chile's commerce and economy are the most dynamic in the region
and the neighboring countries believe that its participation in
Mercosur will generate multilateral benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur countries, consisting of Argentina, Brazil,
Uruguay and Paraguay, consider that Chile's economic dimension and
commercial expansion will also inject vitality into regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
Founded in March 1991, the Mercosur is aimed at promoting the
economic integration of the Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Protect More Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China's capital, rich in cultural
relics, plans to renovate a group of historic sites and open some
new museums to the public over the next five years, according to a
local report.
</P>
<P>
The projects will include reconstructing a 4,000-m-long section
of the Great Wall, cleaning the moat around the Forbidden City and
building a park to enclose the ruins of Yuanmingyuan (Old Summer
Palace), the "Beijing Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
At least 40 million yuan will be spent on these projects each
year, the paper quoted sources from the Beijing Municipal Cultural
Relics Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 new museums will be established before the year
2000, increasing the number of museums in this city of 12 million
people to some 140.
</P>
<P>
The new museums will both hold relics and display folk customs,
Buddhist culture and traditional local opera culture as well as
ancient architecture.
</P>
<P>
The 3,040-year-old city has 2.26 million cultural relics, with
15,000 under top state protection. But some of them, mostly
located in old and poorly-preserved residential areas, have been
endangered by the city's large-scale infrastructural construction
in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
"As a famous ancient capital, Beijing has to improve its
relics-protection work and preservation of historical sites," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The city is planning to set up a park to accommodate a group of
historical buildings which will have to be moved because of
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Private collection, auctioning and overseas purchases of
cultural relics will also be encouraged by the government as part
of its protection measures, the paper said.

SHIJIAZHUANG, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Zhuozhou City in north
China's Hebei Province has become a major aviation training center.
</P>
<P>
Located 60 km south of Beijing, the training center trains

The process of recruiting students is very strict, said a

prospective students must go through a series of psychological
tests, as well as pass the national college entrance examination,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The schooling period is four years, and graduates emerge with
bachelor's degrees in military science.

The courses provided in the school have a high degree of
specialization. Each of them is closely related to piloting skills
and success in their future careers.
</P>
<P>
For example, the students are required to be familiar with
everything in a plane even in total darkness in order to deal with
any emergency.

<HEADLINE> Paolo Berlusconi to Serve Jail Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of
the former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, was sentenced
to two and a half years in jail on Friday in addition a fine of
748 million lire (480,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Milan court convicted Paolo of bribing Milan tax police and
political party leaders between 1982 and 1985, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Milan prosecution had charged Paolo with bribes of as much
as 1.277 billion lire (810,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local press deemed that the sentencing sounded a warning to the
former prime minister who is scheduled to appear in court to stand
a corruption trial soon.
</P>
<P>
Silvio Berlusconi is the media magnate of the Fininvest
empire. But his center-right coalition has just failed to win the
April 21 general election.
</P>
<P>
Documents provided by Francesco Nanocchio, a former Milan tax
policeman, showed that between 1989 and 1992, three Fininvest
companies -- insurer Mediolanum Vita, television producer
Videotime and publisher Mondadori -- had paid a total of 330
million lire (206,000 dollars) to Milan tax police in three bribes.
</P>
<P>
But Berlusconi said that he was just an outsider during a
January hearing of his case.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Tourism Revenue to Reduce in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Tourism income in Portugal will
drop by 5 percent in 1996, according to a study by the Portuguese
Travel and Tourism Agencies Association.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that tourism revenue in Portugal in 1996 will
be one billion escudos (approximately 6.2 million U.S. dollars) less
than that in 1995, because 700,000 foreign visitors will not come.
</P>
<P>
According to the study based on hotel reservations until March
31, travellers from the main source countries, except Spain, have
decreased.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from Britain, the second source of tourism revenue
after Spain, was 25 percent less at the end of March than that in
the same period of 1995. Revenue from Germany dived by 17 percent
and the Netherlands, 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The association's President Atilio Forte said the drop has been
caused by the suspension of tourism promotion by the tourism
authorities since the presidential electoral campaign started in
the summer of 1995 which have spent 8 million dollars less in the
promotion this year than in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Border Cities Benefit From Greater Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen border cities in China
have seen rapid economic growth and improvement of people's living
standards since they began to open to the outside world in 1992,
with the approval of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
That policy help change poor, backward, and closed Chinese
border cities forever, into vigorous economies.
</P>
<P>
Located along the border with Vietnam and Myanmar, or in the
north with Russia, Mongolia or the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, or with some of the countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the small cities, with a total population of
less than one million, have become important land links with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on open border cities held in Dongxing, Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, officials said that border trade and
tourism have mushroomed since the cities were opened, and they
have improved development of local service industries and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Pingxiang, a small Chinese city near Vietnam, increased its
annual foreign trade volume to 2.23 billion yuan (268 million US
dollars) last year, from 639 million yuan (77 million US dollars)
in 1992, a 2.5-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, on the Russian
border, Suifenhe Port handled 12.6 million tons of goods last
year, accounting for 70 percent of the province's total and one
quarter of the country's total of overland trade.
</P>
<P>
The two cities are just two of the examples of the fast
development of border trade and transportation in the 13 cities,
which are inhabited mainly by people of many ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The border cities have also become attractive tourist
destinations for people from neighboring countries, and ideal
places for Chinese people to arrange tours outside their country
in growing numbers, to visit Vietnam and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe had 120,000 domestic and overseas tourists last year
with the foreign exchange earnings from tourism worth 8.2 million
US dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Torch Relay Starts in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An across the United States
Olympic torch relay started from Los Angeles Saturday after the
flame arrived from Greece, where the Olympics was rooted more than
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It's a beacon that summons up the best in all of us,"
President Bill Clinton said in a message read to the 1,500 crowd
at a ceremony at the Los Angeles Coliseum by Vice President Al
Gore's wife Tipper.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Olympics Organizing Committee President William Payne
also said that "it can be the dawn even of a new world."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the short celebration, 1960 Decathlon
gold-medalist Rafer Johnson lit a torch from the flame in a bowl
brought to the Coliseum by a helicopter from the Los Angeles
International Airport, where the flame arrived from Greece by a
special chartered flight this morning.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the last runner in the torch relay across the country
for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, held the torch aloft and
then set off on the first leg of the 25,000-kilometer, 84-day
relay to Atlanta, where the 17-day Games will begin on July 19.
</P>
<P>
He ran into the street from the stadium and handed the torch to
Gina Tillman, granddaughter of Jesse Owens, 4-gold medalist at the
1936 Berlin Games.
</P>
<P>
The flame will be carried by 10,000 runners representing more
than 100 countries to cover a land of 42 states and the District
of Columbia of the host nation to Atlanta in time for the Games,
which will be participated by over 10,000 athletes from some 197
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The torch relay will also include bicycle, horseback, boat,
plane and car travels, according to the Atlanta Committee for
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame was handed over by Greece on Friday in a
ceremony at the marble Panathenean Stadium in Athens where the
Olympics were revived in 1896.
</P>
<P>
The flame was handed to William Payne after a month's relay
throughout Greece.
</P>
<P>
The flame was lit from the sun's rays on March 30 in the
western pagan sanctuary of ancient Olympic where the Olympics was
Born in 776 BC.
</P>
<P>
Since 1936 Berlin Games, a flame lit in Olympia has opened the
games to underscore the continuation of the ideals of the ancient
Greeks in the modern Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Warn Muslims not to Enter Serb Land Illegally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Interior
Ministry said today Muslims from the territory of the Muslim-Croat
federation again plan to enter illegally the Serb territory on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Muslims plan to send several groups into Prijedor, Doboj,
Brcko, Bijeljina, Zvornik and other towns in the north and east of
the Serb entity Republika Srpska in an attempt to cause incidents,
the interior ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Muslims attempted to enter the Serb territory
without agreement of Serb authorities or UNHCR authorization,
causing a clash with local Serb population.
</P>
<P>
IFOR intervened, wounding 12 Serb civilians, and Serb army
commander Ratko Mladic strongly protested to the U.N. and IFOR.
</P>
<P>
"Such infiltrations are aimed at causing conflicts and
disturbing public order," the statement said, adding that all Serb
police units had been ordered to prevent the infiltrations and
protect the legal system and territorial integrity of the
Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Serb officials have warned the representatives of the
International Police Force and IFOR about the planned Muslim
infiltrations and asked them to prevent Muslims from massively
entering the Serb territory so as to avoid grave consequences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IFOR command in Bosnia today urged Muslim, Croat and
Serb leaders to cancel all marches, visits and convoys planned for
Sunday without the approval of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
An IFOR spokesman in Sarajevo said that at least seven
unauthorized crossings between territories were expected Sunday,
when Muslims celebrate the Bayram.
</P>
<P>
IFOR representatives urged Muslims not to do anything not
envisaged by the UNHCR repatriation plan, Tanjug news agency
reported.
