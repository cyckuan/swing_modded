SINGAPORE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong announced Sunday two initiatives worth 260 million
Singapore dollars (about 152 million U.S. dollars ) a year to
encourage Singaporeans to have more children.
</P>
<P>
In his National Day Rally speech, Goh said that at the current
total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.48, without immigration, in 50
years Singapore's population will fall from 3.2 million to 2.7
million.
</P>
<P>
The low TFR is due to two social trends--- more men and women
are remaining single and those married are having fewer children,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To help Singaporeans to address both financial and childcare
concerns involved in the issue of having more children, the
government has decided to undertake two initiatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, the government will introduce a Child Development Co-
Savings Scheme, or Baby Bonus.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the government will open a special account
for a couple having a second or third child and put a certain sum
of money into the account each year until the child is six.
</P>
<P>
For the second initiative, Goh said, the government will
provide eight weeks paid maternity leave not only for the first
two children under the current Employment Act but also for the
third child.
</P>
<P>
And instead of having the employers bear the expense, the
government will pay the wage cost of the maternity leave for the
third child, subject to a cap of 20,000 Singapore dollars (about
11,700 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cost to the government will be 260 million Singapore
dollars a year, or more if more babies are born, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
He added that other measures will also announced later,
including implementing more family-friendly work arrangements in
the civil service and making children centers more available and
affordable.

<HEADLINE> Barak Warns Shas, UTJ Not to Topple Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak warned Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) on Monday that if
they join the efforts to topple the government during the summer
recess of the Knesset (parliament), their interests would be
greatly harmed.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not reveal what measures he will take to punish those
two parties, but said he would find ways of "being less
considerate" to their interests, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Prime Minister's Office told the Radio that
measures Barak would take against the two parties include providing
less funds to the Shas educational system and considering passing
legislation on conscripting religious students to the army.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which has 17 Knesset members, left Barak's coalition in
July just before Barak decided to go the Camp David summit in the
United States to work out a peace agreement with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The UTJ, an ultra-Orthodox party, agreed to be Barak's coalition
partner but not take any cabinet posts when Barak formed his
coalition in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two parties, together with the opposition Likud and another
ultra-Orthodox party, the National Religious party, strongly
opposed Barak's plan to formulate a new national constitution.
</P>
<P>
Barak announced Saturday night that he plans to finish
formulating the new constitution within one year, which will
include the abolition of the Religious Affairs Ministry, the
introduction of civil marriage and letting all the state-funded
schools study three core subjects of English, mathematics and
civics.
</P>
<P>
Shas leader Eli Yishai said on Sunday that Barak's plan is a bad
plan which could cause a rift in the country.
</P>
<P>
UTJ on Monday totally rejected Barak's warning, saying that
Barak's move was "childish."

<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has discovered an estimated of 1.07 billion
barrels of oil and 800 billion cubic feet (22.4 billion cubic
meters) of gas, the second significant oil and gas discoveries in
one week in Iran. The discoveries of oil and gas in Iran grew by
28 percent this year as compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials estimated the overall oil reserves in the
country at 520 billion barrels and the extractable quantities at 25
percent of the total. The percentage can rise to 35 percent due to
the increasing investments and modern technologies.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia has set a minimum for foreign capital
investment in the country according to a special specification for
each economic activity. The specification applies to all projects
wholly-owned by foreigners or the projects of which the foreigners
own over 51 percent share.
</P>
<P>
The executive statutes of foreign investment system set 6.6
million U.S. dollars as a minimum capital for an agricultural
project, 1.3 million dollar for industrial firms, and 500,000
dollars for other projects.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Ministry of Trade renewed commitment to the 18-
month United Nations-imposed embargo on Sierra Leone's illegal
diamond exports, which started on August 15.
</P>
<P>
The embargo bans all exports of crude diamond from Sierra Leone
until the government of the country adopts an appropriate system
for issuing certificates of origin for the diamonds and restores
its control over the diamond producing sites, currently under rebel
control.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- British Airways will open direct flights to Egypt's
Luxor, a tourist resort over 500 kilometers south of Cairo, as of
October 29.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus 320 will fly from London to Luxor on Sunday and return
to London via Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on
Monday, British Airways manager in Egypt Enal Sabry said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the airlines' flights to Alexandria prompted the

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Sovereignty Over Jerusalem: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will continue to promote the
Middle East peace process but firmly rejects Israeli sovereignty
over the holy city of Jerusalem, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah Khatib said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Answering an inquiry from members of the Palestinian Affairs
Committee of the House of Representatives (lower house), Khatib
stressed that Jerusalem is part of the Arab lands captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, and its future should be
decided in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan will not compromise on its position that
Jerusalem belongs to the Arab and Muslim world and the holy city
should be handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, the
governing body of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks on the eve of Tuesday's
visit to Israel and Palestinian territories by Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein to promote the peace process on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
After the 1967 war, during which Israel seized the Arab East
Jerusalem, Israel has claimed Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible
capital, which was not recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors after it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Regrets Israeli Attempts to Annex Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday voiced
regrets at Israel's attempts to "hinder the Middle East peace
process," especially the attempt to annex Jerusalem and giving some
Palestinians Israeli nationality.
</P>
<P>
This position was expressed at a weekly session of the Saudi
cabinet held in the western Saudi city of Jeddah chaired by King
Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, which discussed the latest developments in the Arab
and international arenas, stressed that Riyadh supports the
Palestinian people's rights to establishing their own state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
As the September 13 deadline for a final Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement is approaching, Israeli and the Palestinians are
still in conflict over the fate of Jerusalem, which proved to be
the biggest obstacle to a deal at last month's Camp David summit in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Parties involved in the peace talks on the Israeli-Palestinian
track are trying to narrow the gaps over the solution of the most
sensitive issues in their conflict, including the future of
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Formulates Home-Based HIV/AIDS Care Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
formulated a community home-based care policy for HIV/AIDS
patients that will result in more resources being channeled to the
field, said Zimbabwean National AIDS Coordination Program
Coordinator Andrew Timbe here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The policy would ensure that there is continuity from health
institutions to communities when patients are transferred, he said
when addressing a workshop organized by the Farm Community Trust
of Zimbabwe and attended by more than 20 commercial farm-based
trainers in community home-based care.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the policy, which is to be made
available to AIDS organizations soon, will incorporate the
community home-based care program into the existing health care
delivery system.
</P>
<P>
"The policy document gives direction in relationship to
community home-based care," he said, noting that it will encourage
offering of support system to enable AIDS suffers to approach life
positively until death.
</P>
<P>
The policy would advocate for the coordination of resources
from non-governmental organizations, churches and other donors
through community health nurses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS pandemic is claiming at least 2,000 lives per week in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Encourages AIDS Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The practice of counseling in
cases of AIDS should help the public to accept infected people
without stigmatizing them, said Chairman of the National AIDS
Council of Zimbabwe Gordon Chavhunduka here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to create counseling services in the
country, Chavhunduka said at the official opening of a workshop on
the prevention of parent-to-child HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
He told experts and directors of AIDS service organizations
that "HIV-infected people suffer from psychological distress and
social stigmatization resulting from lack of knowledge,
misunderstanding and the negative attitudes towards them."
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, every year about 55,000 babies are being infected
with HIV, the virus which causes the incurable AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
Chavhunduka urged counselors to continue bringing into focus
the critical role of fathers in the efforts to prevent HIV
infection of their children.
</P>
<P>
The four-day workshop is aimed at providing counselors with
skills to prevent parent-to-child transmission of HIV.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Tries to Secure Release of Four Journalists in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Monday joined international efforts to
secure the release of four journalists, including two of South
African nationality, accused of spying in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Gugu Radebe, a freelance Johannesburg cameraman, and Timothy
Lambon, who holds dual British and South African citizenship, were
arrested along with Sierra Leonean producer Samura Sorious and
Briton David Barrie in Monrovia Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Zelda la Grange confirmed here on Monday
that Mandela has attempted throughout Monday to contact Liberian
President Charles Taylor by telephone.
</P>
<P>
However, he was unable to reach Taylor because the Liberian
leader was meeting Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Mali
President Omar Konare about the peace process in Sierra Leone, la
Grange said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Mandela sent a letter requesting a
briefing from Taylor Monday afternoon, trying to obtain first-hand
information before deciding on what intervention will be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African government said Deputy Home
Affairs Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and a delegation of foreign
affairs officials will meet Liberia's ambassador to South Africa
to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The four people were arrested on suspicion of espionage while
filming a three-part documentary for the British television
station Channel 4. They have been accused by Liberia's Justice
Department of "clandestine activity to injure the image and
character of the president of Liberia".
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs Department spokesman Ronnie
Mamoepa said South African diplomats have established that the
four did not appear in court on Monday as originally expected.

<HEADLINE> Ammunition Explodes in S. Africa, One Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- One person was missing and
several injured when a grass fire caused detonation of highly
explosive ammunition at a South African National Defense Force (
SANDF) base in Potchefstroom, North West province Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
SANDF spokesman Major General Bafana Nxumalo said the grass
fire spread to a stockpile of ammunition at General Support Base
when some SANDF soldiers were trying to send the ammunition to
depots.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 people present on the spot, 29 were brought to safety
without serious injuries except that one was missing, Nxumalo said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the heat of the fire and the continuous detonation of
ammunition, members can not get close enough to the scene to
determine whether the individual is trapped in the fire and what
the state of his possible injuries could be," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the general, single detonations of heavy caliber
ammunition and sporadic shots from small ammunition are still
continuing and SANDF ammunition experts are already at the scene
closely monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
A special team has been established to investigate the incident
and a damage assessment will be conducted two hours after all
detonations have ceased, he said.

<HEADLINE> Treasure Hunters Plunder Ancient Dacian Sites in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian archaeologists
continue to investigate the historical remains of the ancient
Dacian culture on an area of 200 sq. kilometers in Hunedoara
County of central Romania, but their efforts are disturbed by
illegal seekers of the Dacian gold, who have invaded the region
over the past five years due to very lenient legislation.
</P>
<P>
Systematic archaeological excavations in the area began as
early as the inter-war years. At present, the work is being
conducted by a team of experts headed by Professor Ioan Glodariu,
aiming to uncover as much information as possible about the
Dacians who mingled with the Romans and were the ancestors of the
Romanian people.
</P>
<P>
The experts' efforts, however, are hindered by illegal treasure
hunters who, using high-technology metal detectors, have unearthed
objects in significant quantities. This year alone, they have
uncovered nearly 350 kilograms of weaponry and various household
objects, which they usually abandon near the site of the
excavation.
</P>
<P>
"Since they started to look for treasure troves, they have
unearthed around 2,000 kosons, which are Dacian gold coins dating
from around the first half of the 1st century BC. According to
numismatists, at present we witness a real inflation of Dacian
coins, with their price constantly declining," Glodariu said.
</P>
<P>
Such coins are now being sold in various numismatic shops
across Europe,from Budapest to Paris, he added.
</P>
<P>
Though underground wealth belongs to the Romanian State under
the constitution, the large area coupled with weak legislation
allow treasure hunters to continue their activities untroubled.
</P>
<P>
If caught, offenders are fined the equivalent of 100 U.S.
dollars, a ridiculous amount compared to the possible gains. In
order to stop such practice, Prof. Glodariu suggests that
helicopters scatter buckshot or other metal that will utterly
disturb the metal detectors - a method successfully used in other
countries.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Considers Sinking of Kursk Accident of Maneuver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Monday that the sinking of the Russian nuclear-
powered submarine Kursk was "an accident of exercise and maneuver"
rather than the result of a collision with another submarine.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio Europe 1, Richard said that at the
time of the exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet in the Barents
Sea, there were only Russian warships present.
</P>
<P>
"My conviction is that this is very probably an accident of
exercise, of maneuver, in a surrounding where there were only
Russian military ships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard also pointed out that there were conventional real
shootings during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have repeatedly suggested that "Kursk" could
have collided with a British submarine before it sank.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev announced Monday evening that all compartments of the
nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea during a
military exercise on August 12, are full of water and "obviously,
no one onboard survived."
</P>
<P>
"The most likely cause of sub accident is its collision with a
large and commensurable object, possibly an underwater object," he
told an interview with the Russian ORT television station.
</P>
<P>
The use of all Kursk-type submarines will be suspended until
the causes of the accident are established, he said.
</P>
<P>
A third explosion was registered in the Barents Sea on the day
of the accident, August 12, at 11:44 a.m. Moscow time (0744 GMT),
but "further analysis is needed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to initially investigation, two objects were
discovered on the bed of the Barents Sea following the tragedy.
One of them was the Kursk sub and the second has never been seen
again, said Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Russian duty crews of the vessels participating in
the maneuver saw unidentified buoys in the area of the distress
waters following the accident, but they have floated away with the
sea current, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Begins Efforts to Save U.N. Mission in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the former Nigerian president appointed to save the U.N.
Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from collapse,
has arrived in the region, a U.N. spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference here
that the former Nigerian head of state, appointed Friday by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan as his special envoy for DRC, was
scheduled to hold talks in Lusaka later Monday with Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba, the chief mediator in DRC's many-
sided conflict.
</P>
<P>
"General Abubakar will fly to Kinshasa tomorrow to meet with
President of DRC, Laurent Kabila, as well as with other senior
officials," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Later in the week he is to travel to Addis Ababa to hold
consultations with Salim Salim, the Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appointment two days after inconclusive peace
talks between Kabila and leaders of the five African countries
which have sent troops into the central African country either to
support or oppose him.
</P>
<P>
"Among the issues he will discuss are the need for a cessation
of hostilities, the granting of full freedom of movement to the U.
N. mission, and concerns about propaganda attacks against the
mission and its personnel," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed a letter sent by Annan last week to the U.N.
Security Council, in which the U.N. chief asked the 15-nation body
to allow him more time to assess the situation in DRC and rethink
the future of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed in February to send 500 cease-fire
observers and 5,500 troops to protect them but has put on hold
because Kinshasa has refused to let them to area under the
government control. The U.N. peacekeepers were sent into the war-
torn country to monitor a cease-fire agreement, signed in Lusaka
in July last year.

<HEADLINE> Most Venezuelan Congressmen Reject U.S. Flights Over </HEADLINE>

<P>
CARACAS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of Venezuela's recently
elected congressmen are against allowing U.S. airplanes flying
over the Venezuelan territory to carry out anti-drugs tasks, said
the press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the newspaper "El Universal",
57.7 percent of the 156 consulted law-makers reject flying over by
U.S. planes, while 35.9 percent would approve them and 6.4 percent
refrained from answering.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed the congressmen of the ruling party, the
Fifth Republic Movement, decisively support the government's
position to forbid flying-over: 57 legislators are against, 8 in
favor and 3 unclear.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried to convince Venezuela to authorize
U.S. anti-drug airplanes to fly over the South American country's
territory, saying Venezuela is not able to totally control drug
dealers activities in its air space.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Chief of Staff Visits Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JEURSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief of General Staff
Shaul Mofaz met with his Jordanian counterpart Mohammed Malkawi on
Monday in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz briefed the visiting Jordanian top military advisor on
military intelligence and the structure of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF), Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two generals then flew to Jerusalem, where they met Israeli
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Malkawi's one-day visit is reciprocal to Mofaz's trip to Jordan
last month.
</P>
<P>
However, reports here said the Jordanians are still hesitant to
lift the veil of secrecy from the enhancing relations between the
defense establishments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, a leading Israeli daily, on Monday quoted
military sources as saying that Israel and Jordan are planning to
conduct a joint naval search and rescue exercise in the Gulf of
Aqaba next January.
</P>
<P>
The drills, the third in two years, will be another sign of the
steady and strengthening military ties between the two countries,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's King Abdullah II is scheduled to arrive in
Israel on Tuesday for talks with Barak and other senior Israeli
officials.
</P>
<P>
This will be his second visit to the Jewish state since he came
to power 18 months ago. He visited Israel's southern port city of
Eilat in late April.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is the
second Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with the Jewish
state, after Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Israel, Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
is expected to visit the Palestinian territories and Israel on
Tuesday in a bid to promote the Middle East peace process,
particularly on the Israeli-Palestinian track, Jordanian officials
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will pay a working visit to the West Bank town of
Ramallah for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Abdullah on his recent tour of
dozens of countries to drum up support for a future Palestinian
state after the United States-hosted Camp David summit last month
failed to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty in 1994 with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Later on Tuesday, Abdullah will visit Israel for a meeting with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to follow up their talks in Amman last
week.
</P>
<P>
During Barak's visit to Amman last Wednesday, Abdullah stressed
that Jordan's interests must be protected in the peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians, particularly on the refugee
issue.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan is hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian
refugees registered with the United Nations. Amman insists that
they should have the rights to choose between returning to their
homeland or staying in the kingdom while asking for compensations
from parties concerned.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Britain
will resume their joint naval anti-submarine and surface exercises
in the near future, the South African navy said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A British Royal Navy Duke-class missile-carrying frigate will
arrive in Cape Town in the first week of October and will spend
more than a week there and probably conduct anti-submarine
exercises with the South African navy's Daphne-class submarines,
the South African navy said.
</P>
<P>
It said that South Africa's Warrior-class missile-carrying
strike craft will also join the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of South Africa's democratic elections
about eight years ago, several British Royal Navy ships have
visited South African ports.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's naval and maritime enthusiasts in Cape Town are
pleased about the proposed visit of the British warship, but they
are still disappointed at the cancellation of the visit of the
giant American aircraft carrier USS George Washington.
</P>
<P>
The carrier, which operates about 100 combat aircraft, was due
to visit Cape Town next month but now has other commitments.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has
urged women in the country not to marry foreigners because they
will introduce "reactionary elements into the country", South
African Press Association quoted the Namibian state-run New Era
newspaper as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Namibian Home Affairs Minister Jerry
Ekandjo, while speaking at a community meeting in Katutura,
Windhoek's former black township, said foreigners who marry
Namibian women "work day and night to destabilize peace and
stability in the country".
</P>
<P>
"We are only 1.6 million people but after 20 years we will find
Namibia with 6 million and out of that 4 million will be
foreigners who acquired their nationality through marriage unless
Namibian women change their behavior," he said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's constitution allows foreigners who have married
Namibians to apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Ekandjo also lambasted Namibia's white population of about 180,
000, accusing them of never attending events marking Namibia's
national day because they were too busy "in the farms making
barbecues and sausages".
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Preserve Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Acting Environment and
Natural Resources Minister Samuel Miyanda has called on members of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to join hands in
trying to preserve the ecosystem in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a five-day biodiversity workshop in
Lusaka on Monday, Miyanda said all SADC countries are highly
dependent on the ecosystem hence the need for regional cooperation
to effectively address the root causes of threats to biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Ecosystem plays an important role in improving the living
standards of the people, and the free movement of wildlife in
ecosystem across the borders makes it important for countries to
develop cross management policies for the purpose of protection,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if policies are one-sided, no meaningful
achievement would be made.
</P>
<P>
The minister commended the United Nations for organizing the
workshop and called on the participants to come up with meaningful
ideas that would reduce the pressure being put on the ecosystem in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, the United Nations Development
Program country representative Olubanke King-Akerele said the
issues of biodiversity are very important to sustainable human
development.
</P>
<P>
She cited areas like the lower Zambezi and Luangwa in Zambia as
being some of the areas that need protection because they
contribute so much to biodiversity and habitat preservation.
</P>
<P>
There is need for governments in the region to come up with a
strategy on conservation of the areas for the benefit of the
people, she said, adding that the strategy should also aim at
opening up opportunities on policy dialog and review as well as
investment ventures that would contribute to poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Warns Against New Land Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
started to crack down on lawlessness by mainly war veterans who
have threatened to occupy more farms, factories and commercial
establishments, a cabinet minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that any lawlessness would not be tolerated by the police and
those who broke the law would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered the police, through Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri, to deal firmly with anyone, including war
veterans, who start new invasions of farms or factories.
</P>
<P>
There would not be any doubts that the police would deal
effectively and firmly with people, including war veterans, who
broke the laws of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given that the land redistribution is now under implementation
by the relevant national committee on land reform, no new
demonstrations on the farms are going to be tolerated," he said,
stressing that "no unauthorized land allocations will be tolerated.
"
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, "there should be no interference
with normal farming activities. Any incitement to violence or
confrontation will not be tolerated. Lawlessness on the farms
indeed or anywhere else will not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"Generally, I expect all concerned to please take note that
anarchy and all other similar negative attitudes shall be dealt
with swiftly and thoroughly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo was angered by war veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi, who
reportedly challenged the former freedom fighters to invade farms
near Harare city and subdivide them into residential stands.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi, whose organization had been behind the farm invasions
of white-owned commercial farms countrywide, threatened to occupy
more factories and commercial establishments.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi's statement is inciting, Nkomo said, stressing that it
is the responsibility of the government and the local authorities
to allocate and redistribute land.
</P>
<P>
"Acquired farms will be resettled in terms of the policy and
procedures set out by the central government," he said. "In the
case of designated or acquired farms, only authorized institutions
have the authority to give notices of vacation to those who own
the land."
</P>
<P>
Following a directive from Nkomo, the Zimbabwean police
arrested 13 war veterans on Monday for mounting two illegal
roadblocks in Goromonzi district, Mashonaland East province.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans were demonstrating against the government's
slow pace in the land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
To date 2,000 families have been resettled since the government
launched its fast-track resettlement program in August this year.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bankers Association Defends Secrecy Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Bankers Association (
SBA) defended the country's banking system, reaffirming that the
secrecy laws are not up for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Monday in the Swiss capital of
Berne, SBA President Georg Krayer said that the Swiss banking
system had an "exemplary regulatory regime, equal to any in the
world". He rejected what he described as "the rebuke" meted out by
the group of seven industrialized nations, which has categorized
Switzerland as an "offshore financial center".
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland is neither a tax haven nor is it unwilling to co-
operate in the fight against money laundering," he said.
</P>
<P>
Krayer denied that Switzerland was trying to torpedo European
Union plans to tighten up its tax system. But he reiterated that
Swiss banking secrecy was non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
He added that measures to penalize the country for non-
compliance with EU tax rules would be unacceptable until banking
centers such as Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong were made to comply
as well.
</P>
<P>
The European Union wants so-called "tax havens" to disclose the
identity and assets of EU citizens, who hold accounts in those
countries.

<HEADLINE> Health Experts Warn of "Airport Malaria" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Health authorities in many
countries are becoming increasingly concerned about the
potentially deadly risks of malaria carried into their territory
by "jet-setting" mosquitoes that travel on international flights
and spread the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
in a press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"A serious consequence of the transport of infected mosquitoes
aboard aircraft has been the numerous cases of 'airport malaria'
reported in Europe, North America and elsewhere," said experts of
a report published in the August issue of the WHO Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Airport malaria is particularly dangerous in that physicians
generally have little reason to suspect it, according to the
experts. This is especially true if there has been no recent
travel to areas where malaria is endemic. Diagnosis may, therefore,
be protracted and death may occur before a correct diagnosis is
made and adequate treatment provided.
</P>
<P>
Between 1969 ad 1999, 12 countries reported a total of 87 cases
of malaria in people living near an airport, resulting in at lease
five deaths. All cases occurred among people with no immunity to
the disease. Long delays in making correct diagnosis frequently
resulted in patients developing severe or complicated malaria.
</P>
<P>
There is an important on-going need for disinfecting aircraft
that come from the airports in the areas where the tropical
disease is endemic, the experts pointed out. "Malaria-carrying
mosquitoes may enter the passenger cabin before take-off or during
stopovers or may survive the trip in the luggage hold.
</P>
<P>
Many countries already insist that arriving aircraft be
disinfected, especially if they have come from areas where vector-
borne disease are endemic, WHO said. It is common for an arriving
aircraft to be sprayed by the health services of the country of
destination if there is any doubt as to whether treatment has been
applied earlier in the flight.

All the compartments of the submarine were filled with water

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Expects Survivors in Kursk's Other Compartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- There is still "some chance" to
find survivors in compartments seven and eight of the sunken
nuclear submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea, Russian Northern Fleet
chief spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky said late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"These compartments will be checked with the help of a special
apparatus," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying at a
press conference in Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian divers are continuing their efforts at the Kursk
nuclear submarine. "None of the divers have left the accident area
and we are not considering curtailing any of the work yet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Navrotsky said he does not rule out that the sixth, seventh and
eighth compartments may be checked, adding that "this will be
clear 2-3 hours after receiving the final conclusion regarding the
environment in those compartments."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that most of the 118 crew has died and
there is very little hopes for finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
Navrotsky noted that the medium in compartments seven and eight
will be assessed in coming two or three hours and then the
Northern Fleet and the Russian Navy will make an official
statement on further action.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there could be no more than five to six people
in compartment nine when the accident happened. But only one body
was found there.
</P>
<P>
Navrotsky confirmed that the body of one submariner has been
found in the ninth compartment.
</P>
<P>
On the possible causes of the tragedy, Navrotsky said that the
main theory is still a dynamic external explosion. A terrorist act
inside the submarine has been fully ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and Norwegian governments have agreed that the
Norwegian divers will continue their work for recovering bodies of
crew from the sunken submarine in the area of the sub accident in
the Barents Sea "within the limits of their capabilities," chief
of the Northern Fleet Headquarters Mikhail Motsak announced.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has committed itself to concluding a contract and
covering the expenses on this dangerous endeavor. We shall
cooperate with the Norwegians as before," Motsak said on RTR
television on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the escape hatch has been opened, there is no doubt
that the crewmen are dead. My personal opinion is that the same
fate befell those trapped in other compartments," Motsak said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said official statements on the situation and the
crew are not within his competence and "will be made by other
naval officials."
</P>
<P>
No detailed examination of the area where the Kursk submarine
sank has been made so far, Interfax quoted Northern Fleet
spokesman Igor Babenko as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Up to this moment, the main task is to rescue the crew. The
rest can wait," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not deny reports that an object resembling a fragment of
a foreign submarine's tower had been found in the zone of rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said that "no haste should be made in making
conclusions before the accident area and the larger zone of the
Barents Sea has been examined," because "since World War II the
Barents Sea has been full of sunken planes, convoy vessels and
submarines, including foreign submarines."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Northern Fleet commander
Vyacheslav Popov confirmed that all the crew of the sunken
submarine Kursk are dead, the Interfax news agency reported Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"After jointly examining the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk
that sank in the Barents Sea during a military exercise on August
12, Russian and foreign experts have made the final conclusion
that the entire submarine is flooded and all the 118 crew is dead,
" Interfax cited Popov, who was in charge of the rescue operation,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that the rescue effort began immediately
after the accident and lasted throughout the following days.
</P>
<P>
"The rescue and escape hatch of the ninth compartment was
opened today and it turned out to be filled with water," the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
"The Northern Fleet Military Council deeply mourns and
expresses condolences to the families and relatives of the dead.
The memory of our comrades-in-arms will eternally live in our
hearts and in the history of the Russian navy," Popov said.

<HEADLINE> British Troops to Return to Belfast After Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- British troops will return to the
streets of the Northern Irish capital Belfast after two men were
shot dead in an apparent feud among the pro-British loyalist
guerrilla groups, police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two days after seven people were injured in a gunfire near the
town center, a gunman fired at least nine shots at two men on
Monday as they walked to their car outside a betting shop.
</P>
<P>
The dead men were members of the loyalist Ulster Defense
Association (UDA). Two people have been arrested and a number of
weapons have been recovered in the Protestant stronghold of
Shankhill Road area.
</P>
<P>
"Given the weekend's events in the Shankhill area and today's
horrific murder of two men I have requested, and the army have
agreed to, the deployment of soldiers to support the work of
police in the city," Bill Stewart, Assistant Chief Constable of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said tensions were running high but hoped the reintroduction
of troops would be only "a short-term measure".
</P>
<P>
The British army has scaled down its presence in the troubled
province since a landmark peace deal in 1998. Troops were last
seen on Belfast's streets in September of that year.
</P>
<P>
In two further separate incidents in the same area of Belfast
on Monday, shots were fired at the offices of the Ulster
Democratic Party and the offices of the Progressive Unionist Party,
both loyalists groups. The Progressive Unionist offices were set
ablaze.

<HEADLINE> Hasina to Meet Musharraf at U.N. Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina will meet Pakistani military ruler General Pervez Musharraf
early next month on the sidelines of United Nations millennium
session in New York, Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami said at a press
briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We've received a request from Pakistan that Chief Executive
General Musharraf would like to meet Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and most probably she will meet him," Sami told newsmen at the
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The three-day U.N. millennium session will begin on September 6,
and Hasina is expected to leave here for New York on September 4,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary, who is going to Islamabad Tuesday as
special envoy of Prime Minister Hasina, will also meet General
Musharraf and deliver him a letter from Hasina.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not disclose the contents of Hasina's letter
to Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Sami said his visit is to share the prime minister's perception
and concern with the Pakistani government about peace and
stability in the region and a need for enhanced cooperation in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, the foreign secretary undertook a similar trip to
India carrying a letter from the Prime Minister for Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Sami may raise the point of reactivating
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) by
holding its summit which has been stalled following military
takeover in Pakistan on October 12, 1999, toppling the Nawaz
Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
Turning down the idea that his trip to New Delhi and Islamabad
is being undertaken under the pressure from the United States, the
foreign secretary said Bangladesh wants to see the seven-nation
SAARC moving in her own interest.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh is capable of taking its decision independently
according to principles that guide the country's foreign policy,"
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Object Resembling Sub Part Found Near Sunken Kursk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- An object resembling "the barrier
of a foreign submarine tower" has been discovered 330 meters from
the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk on the bed of the Barents Sea,
the Interfax news agency quoted military sources as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military confirmed the death of all 118 crew aboard
Kursk, which went down to the bottom of the seabed on August 12
during a naval exercise.
</P>
<P>
A collision with another submarine, "most likely British,"
remains the main possible explanation for the Kursk tragedy,
Interfax quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is premature to draw any conclusions before
studying the object," they said. "The object may have been lying
on the bed of the Barents Sea for a long time."
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said earlier that they have request some
countries to provide information on their vessels' in the area of
the accident, but have so far received no response yet.
</P>
<P>
They also confirmed earlier reports that a "half-sunken
emergency buoy that is not used by Russian submarines" was found
in the area in the first days of the accident.
</P>
<P>
"The buoy was discovered at sunset, and by morning it must have
been carried away by the current," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On the time frame of the news of the tragedy, the sources said
that at about 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Saturday (August 12) the
submarine did not enter into communication and the search for it
began. The submarine was discovered at 4:35 a.m. (0035 GMT) on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. (0300 GMT), Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev
reported the incident to President Vladimir Putin, telling him
that "the sub has been discovered and the rescue of the crew is
beginning."
</P>
<P>
The sources said Sergeyev strongly advised the president
against traveling to the submarine accident site.
</P>
<P>
Putin has been under increasing criticism for not ending his
vacation in the Black Sea resort of the Sochi and go to the site
of the accident or at least rush back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The president later defended his decision, noting that he
wanted to go to the site but rejected the idea in the
consideration that his presence would hamper rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
The first rescue craft descended to the Kursk at 6 p.m. (1400
GMT) on August 13. During the first dive "the rescue craft hit the
body of the submarine and made an emergency return to the surface.
"
</P>
<P>
"Later, because the current had carried the ship away from the
submarine accident site, it took the sailors several hours to find
the sub again and resume the operations of the rescue craft," the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Find Peruvian Plants Inhibit TB Bacterial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. research team studying
medicinal plants from the Peruvian rainforests found that a large
amount of plants in the rainforests were able to inhibit growth of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium causing TB.
</P>
<P>
The finding is a first step toward developing potential drugs
that can combat the disease, which claims up to 3 million people's
lives each year, said Walter Lewis, the leading scientist of the
team and professor of biology at Washington University at St.
Louis, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected results came after months of working in
conjunction with the native Aguaruna people of Peru. Lewis and his
team lived among the tribe, collecting plant samples and learning
about specific plants the Indians use in herbal medicinal
practices.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have already known that the exposure of TB in the
remote parts of the Upper Amazon has been minimal, and the native
tribes, including the Aguaruna, have little experience with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Upon subsequent testing and analysis of the collected plants in
St. Louis in collaboration with other scientists, Lewis was
intrigued by the results.
</P>
<P>
46 percent of the 1,250 plant extracts returned from Peru and
examined by the researchers showed an inhibition against
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. "The results just surprised us," said
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Tropical rainforest plants produce above-average amounts of
secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, compounds that protect
them from huge numbers of pathogens and insects. Plant survival is
dependent on their genetic ability to produce a wide range of
these defensive compounds.
</P>
<P>
And such a high anti-TB reactivity across the broad range of
plants is due to the fact that the plants have shared
sensitivities which allow secondary metabolites to inhibit the
growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis at the unexpectedly high
frequencies, Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus FM to Visit Greece for Coordination on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides will meet Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou in
Athens late this month to coordinate efforts in resolving the
Cyprus issue, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on August 30, the two ministers will also
discuss issues relating to Turkey's European Union (EU)
partnership, as well as relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting in Athens aims at coordinating our actions on
various levels in order to achieve our main aim which is for the
Cyprus talks to become substantive," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks on Cyprus have
been held between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities, with the aim to pave the way for substantive
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement. However, no
significant achievement has been made.
</P>
<P>
A new round is scheduled to start on September 12 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was granted candidate status for the EU during the its
summit held in Helsinki in December 1999. The EU is expected to
decide its partnership with Turkey in November.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been locked in long-running disputes over
a number of issues including Aegean territories and Cyprus. Their
relations improved after they helped each other as devastating
earthquakes hit them late last year.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides will be accompanying President Glafcos Clerides to
New York for the United Nations General Assembly millennium summit
and the fourth round of Cyprus peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinian Guards Beaten by Israeli Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian guards at the
Temple Mount in East Jerusalem were beaten Monday by Israeli police
as the Palestinians were commemorating the 31st anniversary of an
arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials and witnesses said the two guards, who
work for the Waqf, or Muslim Religious Trust that administrates the
mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, were badly beaten and sent
to hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
One lost his consciousness and the other's head bled after
Israeli police hit them with batons, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"The two guards are working in the compound which houses the Al-
Aqsa Mosque and had been beaten in a very brutal way by the Israeli
police when they tried to enter the compound," Faisal Husseini,
member of the Central Committee of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in charge of Jerusalem affairs, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Forces in the West Bank, said that the guards had escorted him out
of the compound after prayers marking the 31st anniversary of the
burning of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli police said that they acted only after a Palestinian
refused to take their order not to drive into the compound.
</P>
<P>
On August 21, 1969, an Australian youth, Michael Rohan, tried to
burn down the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
He was later declared by Israel mentally unstable and sentenced
to lifetime imprisonment in a mental institution in Israel. He was
later sent back to Australia for hospitalization in a mental home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Convert Spy" Found in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli police on Monday
found the U.S. army intelligence officer who had allegedly fled to
Israel and is believed to be carrying sensitive U.S. army
documents, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities are now contacting Washington over the 49-
year-old American officer, Jeremiah Mattysse, who converted to
Judaism and deserted his base in San Antonio, Texas, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police does not have the authority to arrest
Mattysse, who is now at an Israeli police station, because he had
not violated any Israeli law and the Israeli Deportation Agreement
with the United States has no clause that enables his arrest on the
basis of suspicions against him in the U.S., said the report.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of Mattysse, who made his way into Israel from
Cyprus, were disclosed by his Israeli girlfriend, Rivka Nir, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Ministry officials said Mattysse has requested
Israeli immigration status. However, no decision has been made on
the request since it was filed two weeks ago and was subsequently
turned over to the police.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli police started to search for him on Sunday at the
request of the Prime Minister's Office and the U.S. embassy.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Party Appeals Against Election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's left-wing JVP or
People's Liberation Front Monday appealed to all democratic forces
to rally around against violence threatening the forthcoming
general elections due on October 10 in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
The JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva made this appeal after
one party member died Sunday after being assaulted by unidentified
men while displaying posters in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Silva said that they have made complains to the inspector
general of police and the election commissioner against the
killing and that they hope to brief the Colombo based diplomats
soon.
</P>
<P>
Already over 10 acts of violence have taken place against the
JVP, he said.
</P>
<P>
A chief Buddhist priest too appealed to the masses to remain
calm and called on the leaders of all political parties to conduct
free and fair elections. He asked the leaders not to allow
violence to threaten the country's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Police Lucky Kodituwakku has said the
police will take every step to maintain law and order in the run-
up to the elections and take stringent action against those who
commit acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has 42 registered parties and another 10 have sent in
their applications to the commissioner of elections to be
registered before the general elections. Nominations for the
elections will be received from August 28 up to noon on September
4 and most political parties have finalized their list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Last week the elections commissioner recognized two new parties,
Sinhala Urumaya (Heritage) led by former United National Party
member of parliament Tilak Karunaratne and Puravesi Peramuna (
Citizen's Front) led by former Minister Sirisena Cooray.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers to Further Revise Draft Law on National Common Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), is
scheduled to further revise a draft law on national common
language, so as to standardize language use and rectify the
phenomenon of using non-standardized language.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Law Committee today submitted a report on the revision
of the draft law on national common language to the 17th session
of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, which opened here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The law committee proposes to revise the sixth clause of the
draft law as "the state promulgates the norms and standards of
national common language, administers the public use of the
national common language, and promotes the standardization,
enrichment and development of national common language."
</P>
<P>
Some NPC Standing Committee members and experts suggests that
the draft law should have stricter stipulations on the national
common language while the language is used in government documents,
education agencies, news media, and publications, but have loose
stipulations on oral language.
</P>
<P>
The law committee proposes that "broadcasters, actors, teachers,
and government staff should reach the State-required grades in
terms of mandarin."

<HEADLINE> Barak Meets Russian Envoy, Urges Palestinian Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- If Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat refused to show flexibility in the peace talks, there will
be no peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, said
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remark while meeting with visiting Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister and special Middle East peace envoy Vasili Sredin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two exchanged views on how to move the
Middle East peace process forward, according to the Prime
Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know with any certainty where Arafat is heading and
the leadership is tested by its ability to make painful
decisions...We proved at Camp David that we are prepared for this,
but Arafat has still not done so, and if he doesn't show
flexibility and openness soon, there will be no agreement," Barak
told Sredin.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David summit in the United States ended on July
25 without producing a framework agreement on the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status issues including the fate of Jerusalem,
borders, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Barak also expressed his appreciation for Russia's reservations
regarding a possible unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state
on September 13, as repeatedly warned by Arafat, and said that the
international community's stance will undoubtedly influence
Arafat's positions.
</P>
<P>
In his recent visit to Moscow, Arafat was told that Russia does
not oppose an independent Palestinian state, but the timing for
declaration should be carefully considered as the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations are at a critical stage.
</P>
<P>
Sredin told Barak that he feels the negotiations are at a
critical stage and the near future will prove decisive for the
future of the process.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Vladimir Putin attaches great importance
to his ties with Barak and expects to continue the dialogue between
them at their upcoming meeting in New York when attending the
United Nations General Assembly meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sredin is currently on a Middle East tour to promote Russia's
role in the peace process. He had already met with Arafat at the
West Bank city of Ramallah on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Places Abu Sayyaf Leaders Under Watch List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of
Immigration placed Monday on its watch list two ranking leaders of
the Abu Sayyaf group responsible for the abduction of 21 mostly
foreign hostages who were held captive in Jolo, Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez ordered the inclusion
of Dhalib Andang, alias Commander Robot, and Munib Susukan in the
immigration watch list following reports that they plan to sneak
out of the country after the 10 remaining hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the watchlist order would prevent the two kidnap-
for-ransom leaders from leaving the country through any of the
international airports and seaports without any clearance from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The immigration chief issued the order after receiving
intelligence reports that the Abu Sayyaf rebels are now in
possession of stolen Philippine and fake foreign passports which
they bought as part of their plan to sneak out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The reports alleged that the Abu Sayyaf members would
immediately escape after freeing their remaining hostages to elude
government soldiers who might launch offensive and pursuit
operations against them.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez earlier placed immigration officers and agents
throughout Mindanao on double alert and ordered them to be on the
lookout for Abu Sayyaf leaders and members who might leave the
country via the backdoor.
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials were ordered to thoroughly screen all
travelers departing from the southern ports, particularly those in
Zamboanga, Davao, Slu, and Tawi-Tawi.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports indicated that the rebels plan to go first
to Malaysia or Indonesia and later transfer to the Middle East to
seek asylum in countries sympathetic to their cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Monday that it will hold a regional workshop from August 23
to 25 at its Manila headquarters to discuss a draft Asian
Environmental Outlook report.
</P>
<P>
The report, expected to be finalized by the end of this year,
will recommend policies to ADB's developing members aimed at
reversing the dramatic deterioration in Asia's environment, said
the ADB in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"Greatly increased air and water pollution are adversely
affecting people's health and well-being all over Asia while
thousands of plant and animal species are driven to extinction
every year," noted Tahir Qadri, ADB senior environmental
specialist and workshop coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is to understand the causes of depletion and
degradation, followed by prescriptions for change in our behavior
so we can reverse the alarming trend," Qadri added.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Environment Outlook will review environmental and
development policies and outline the role stakeholders --
government, civil society, and development partners -- should play
to achieve environmental objectives together with sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 stakeholders from developing countries and
international organizations are expected to attend the Manila
workshop.
</P>
<P>
After Manila, follow-up workshops will be held in Aspen,
Colorado (September 13-15); Tokyo (September 20-21); and Samoa (
September 25-26).

<HEADLINE> Russia Confirms Death of 118 Submariners Aboard Kursk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Staff of the Russian
Northern Fleet Mikhail Motsak Monday officially confirmed the
deaths of 118 crewmen on board the Kursk nuclear submarine that
went to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Motsak told state RTR television that all compartments of the
submarine filled with water and none of the crew survived.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation signaled the end to Russia's eight-day rescue
efforts, which were assisted by Norway and Britain in the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian divers who managed to open the escape hatch on the
nuclear submarine Monday found no sign of survivors and confirmed
that the Kursk was flooded.
</P>
<P>
The Russian navy said a video camera would be lowered into the
hull of the Kursk to determine conditions inside. The rescue
effort was now shifting to raising the submarine, an enormous task
that could take weeks or even months.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful submarines in
the Russian navy, was commissioned in 1995. Armed with torpedoes
and "Granite" cruise missiles, the submarine could dive to depths
of up to 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the Kursk carried no nuclear arms and both
nuclear reactors aboard are shut down. Norwegian divers have
confirmed normal levels of radiation near the submarine.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials said they were trying their best to raise the
Kursk and recover its two nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a government
mission on the tragedy, said Moscow would make an international
appeal for funds to raise the Kursk because of the enormous
expense. He indicated that it would take weeks just to draw up
plans for the salvage operation.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia Seeks More Help From Norwegian Divers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia is trying to secure Oslo's
permission to allow Norwegian divers to continue their work inside
the Kursk submarine, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The request came after official confirmation that all 118
crewmen aboard the nuclear submarine died. The Norwegians opened
the inner hatch of the Kursk's ninth compartment and found it
flooded.
</P>
<P>
"Norway is now contacting its divers directly, and they must
determine themselves the risk and expediency of continuing efforts
any further," Interfax reported, citing military-diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, Russia is also suggesting that Norway give
the diving equipment to Russian divers, they said.
</P>
<P>
If the Norwegian divers decide to continue their participation
in the operation, they "will be able to open the eighth and even
the seventh compartments," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest reports by Russia's RTR state
television, a remote video camera has filmed a sailor body near
the exit hatch of the ninth compartment.
</P>
<P>
Divers are trying to remove the body by using robot
manipulators, RTR reported.

<HEADLINE> Fourteen Myanmar Pirates Sentenced in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Higher People's Court of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region handed down second
court verdicts today ranging from imprisonment to death for 14
Myanmarese pirates charged with raiding a Taiwanese cargo ship and
setting its 21 crew members adrift in the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
The head of the pirate gang, Maung Htay Aung, was given the
death sentence with a two year reprieve. Kwaw Soe and Kyaw Soe Lin
were sentenced to life in prison, and all their personal property
was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Eleven other pirates were also sentenced to prison terms from
three to ten years. They have been handed out various fines and
been deported from China.
</P>
<P>
The pirates hijacked the Marine Master cargo ship in the small
hours of March 17, 1999, which was sailing through the Andaman Sea
south of Myanmar, heading from China's eastern port of
Zhangjiagang to Calcutta, India, when the pirates boarded the ship.
</P>
<P>
Armed with guns and knives, the pirates hijacked the ship and
seized alkali as well as crew members' valuables with a total
value of more than 5.8 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The crew was forced into a lifeboat, which floated for 10 days
before being rescued by fishermen from Thailand. Meanwhile, the
pirates disguised the cargo ship and sailed it to the port of
Shantou in south China's Guangdong Province, where they sold the
cargo of alkali. When the ship arrived at the city of
Fangchenggang in Southern Guangxi for repairs on June 8, local
police spotted it and arrested the pirates.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, this year, at a public trial at the
Fangchenggang Intermediate People's Court, the first trial
sentences were handed down. After the trial, all the pirates
appealed their convictions to the Higher People's Court of Guangxi.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Turkey Under Quake Risk: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish scientists said on Monday
that the eastern part of Turkey is under risk of possible
earthquakes, the country's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ahmet Ercan of Istanbul Technical University said that
52 percent of the earthquakes that have rocked Turkey were recorded
on the North Anatolia Fault Line (KAF), 32 percent on the West
Anatolia Fault Line (BAF) and 12-13 percent of them on the East
Anatolia Fault Line (DAF).
</P>
<P>
Ercan said that Karliova township of eastern Bingol province is
situated in a point where the KAF and DAF intersect, adding that
this intersection point is a risky place for earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday, a moderate 4.0-magnitude earthquake rocked
eastern Erzurum province, during which one person was seriously
injured and nine others were wounded when they jumped out of the
balconies in panic.
</P>
<P>
Two minor quakes, measuring 3.0 and 2.6 on the Richter scale
were recorded following the moderate quake.
</P>
<P>
Ercan said that the province is located in Erzurum Plain which
is a moist area, so tremors even if with preliminary magnitudes can
be felt strongly in the province.
</P>
<P>
"Serious geophysical works should be launched in the region.
Maps about earthquakes should be drawn up. Previous earthquakes
should be reviewed in the region," Ercan said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by the Istanbul-based Kandilli
Observatory and Seismology Institute, 39,967 people died in 17
massive earthquakes that hit eastern Erzurum, Erzincan, Kars, Mus,
Bingol and Tunceli provinces in the last century while 164,233
buildings were damaged in these quakes.
</P>
<P>
The latest big earthquake recorded in eastern Turkey took place
in Erzincan province in 1992. The 6.8-magnitude earthquake claimed
653 lives and destroyed 2,189 buildings.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Erzurum, killing 1,155
people and damaging 3,241 buildings.
</P>
<P>
Last year, two devastating earthquakes shocked Turkey's western
Marmara region and Bolu province, killing at least 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Recently, seismologists warned the government of preparing for
big earthquakes which would take place at any time in Marmara
region standing above the active KAF.

<HEADLINE> Iran Against U.S. Policies, Not American People: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami said
here on Monday that Iran is opposed to the U.S. government policies
against Iran, not the American people.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have hostility toward the American people. We respect
them but we have objections to the policies the U.S. has practised
against Iran," Khatami said in an interview with the Islamic
Republic of Iran Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Washington must change its hostile policies
toward Iran before problems between the two countries could be
solved.
</P>
<P>
As long as the same U.S. policies continue and the difficult
problems between the two countries are not settled, Iran will stand
by its "stance, interests, independence and prestige," the
president said when asked to comment on Iran-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated that Iran does not seek tension and conflict
in international relations, not even with the U.S., a country with
which Iran has "traditional difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries broke up after diplomats in
the U.S. embassy in Tehran were taken hostage in the heyday of the
1979 Islamic revolution that brought the clerics to power in Iran.
The U.S. has since maintained political isolation and economic
sanctions on Iran.
</P>
<P>
The ice began to thaw Iran's moderate President Khatami took
office in 1997, and the U.S. government even has offered to hold
direct dialog with Iran over their differences.
</P>
<P>
Iran's powerful conservative hardliners, however, were
suspicious of Washington's intention, accusing it of trying to stir
up unrest in Iran and undermine its Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last week voiced
strong opposition to any dialog with the U.S., calling for
resistance against U.S. political and cultural influence.
</P>
<P>
He told Foreign Ministry officials and diplomats: "Experience
showed that there is no common point between Iran and the U.S., so
dialog and relations with the country would solve no problem."

<HEADLINE> Manila Remains Hopeful on Peace Process With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it still expects to resume peace negotiations with the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) despite the latter's negative
pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Batenga, chairman of the government peace panel,
downplayed reports in a radio interview that the MILF has
withdrawn the authority given to its peace panel to conduct peace
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
"They did not say they have suspended talks with the government
panel. Maybe they would like to give more teeth to the panel,
guidance and instructions to the panel, for the panel to negotiate,
" Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moner Bujanaid, chairman of the MILF peace panel's
technical committee, the MILF central leadership has recalled the
authority of its peace panel to negotiate a peace settlement with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Batenga, however, said the government panel remains ready to
talk peace with the MILF, and is expecting a positive response by
as early as August 22.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that safety and security guarantees issued to
the members of the MILF peace panel would remain valid.
</P>
<P>
Batenga pointed out that the directive of President Joseph
Estrada to suspend a 9-million-peso (425,000 U.S. dollars) reward
for the arrest of the MILF's top leaders should convince the MILF
of the government's sincerity in pursuing the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
said Monday in a separate interview that President Estrada remains
serious in his bid to reach a peace agreement with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government will retain its peace panel dealing
with the MILF and the panel is "ready to come back to the
negotiating table any time that the MILF says that they are
prepared to sit down and talk."
</P>
<P>
The MILF is the Philippines' largest rebel group which has been
fighting for more than two decades in a bid to establish an
independent Muslim state in Mindanao.

LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Former MI5 intelligence agent
David Shayler returned to Britain on Monday and was immediately
arrested as he passed through immigration control in the southern

<HEADLINE> DPRK Negotiators Arrive in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) arrived in Japan Monday for a
second round of negotiations on normalizing diplomatic ties
between the DPRK and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation, headed by Ambassador Jong Thae Hwa, is
scheduled to hold two plenary negotiations, one on Tuesday in
Tokyo and another on Thursday in Kisarazu in the adjacent
prefecture of Chiba. Japanese negotiators are led by Kojiro
Takano, ambassador in charge of normalization talks.
</P>
<P>
Expected to be high on the agenda of negotiations are two
contentious issues, the alleged abduction of at least 10 Japanese
nationals by DPRK agents in the 1970s and 1980s, and Pyongyang's
claim for compensation for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule over
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The two sides clashed over both issues in the first round of
negotiations in Pyongyang in April, when the two countries resumed
normalization talks, which collapsed in 1992 after eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the two sides are unlikely to ease
their positions on the two issues and make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
They hope to lay the groundwork for substantial negotiations at
the third round of talks, expected sometime in October in Beijing
or another third-nation city, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
While in Japan, the DPRK delegation is also scheduled to meet
with former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Liberal
Democratic Party Secretary General Hiromu Nonaka.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation will head home on Friday morning.

conference on the launching of an art performance and exhibition
organized by the education committee of Changzhou City, Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang spoke highly of the ability of Changzhou's education
sector to hold such high-level art shows, calling it a result of
the city's efforts to implement the central government's policy of
improving the overall quality of students.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Heming, director of the municipal education
committee, Changzhou boasts a history of over 2,500 years and in
recent years, the local government has attached great importance
to quality education.
</P>
<P>
Local schools in Changzhou has a tradition of teaching students
learn more about art, science, sports or foreign language, the
official said. Art courses have opened in all local elementary and
middle schools and higher learning institutions in Changzhou, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To learn art or other specialties in addition to compulsory
subjects will not affect the students' normal study. On the
contrary, they will instill more curiosity and confidence in the
students, Wang noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Amend Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), will
amend the tax administration law to ensure the state's revenues,
safeguard the legitimate rights of tax-payers and penalize illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, director of the State Administration of Taxation,
presented amendment explanations to the 17th session of the NPC
Standing Committee, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In amending the tax law, more emphasis will be put on the tax
collection, which will ensure the timely and adequate collection
of taxes.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to standardize and perfect law-enforcing
activities in tax administrative departments, and protect the
legitimate rights of tax-payers.
</P>
<P>
At present, some business tax-payers have multiple accounts in
financial institutions, which makes it difficult for tax
collectors to check for illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment stipulates that business tax-payers should
present tax registrations to financial institutions before opening
accounts, and report all their accounts to tax departments.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates that taxes have priority to debts in
the business disputes, re-grouping of enterprises and bankruptcies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China is revising its 10-year-
old Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Returned
Overseas Chinese and the Family Members of Overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
At the Standing Committee of the National Committee, Gan Ziyu,
chairman of the NPC Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, explained
the draft revision of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law has helped protect the legal rights and interests of
returned overseas Chinese and their family members for the past
decade, but it needs to be revised to keep up with the times, Gan
said.
</P>
<P>
The amendments involve the encouragement and favorable policies
for returned overseas Chinese and their family members to invest
in China and punish government officials who have violated the
rights and interests of these returned compatriots and their
family members.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are now more than 34
million overseas Chinese living in over 170 foreign countries and
regions. Meanwhile, there are over 1.14 million returned overseas
Chinese and 29 million family members of those who have returned
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Most of these people are settled in Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan
and Yunnan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Egypt for Talks on Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Monday on
a brief visit for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Mubarak on his recent visits to European and
Asian countries, during which he explained the Palestinian
positions on the peace process and won their support for the
efforts of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate
rights, Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi Qedra has said.
</P>
<P>
Qedra told Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Sunday that Arafat
and Mubarak will discuss possible future steps in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of Arafat's continued consultations and
coordination with Mubarak on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks,
which are stalled over the central issue of Jerusalem, the diplomat
added.
</P>
<P>
This was his fourth visit to Egypt since July 25 when the
Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David of the United States ended
without an agreement largely due to disputes over Jerusalem, which
both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to discuss the peace process with
the Egyptian leader, an active mediator between the Palestinians
and Israelis.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for Changing Jerusalem Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The suburbs between Jews and
Arabs in Jerusalem should be changed, said a senior Palestinian
official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish quarters built over the Green Line in Jerusalem
since 1967 are not regular settlements...and a solution must be
found for them," Faisal al-Husseini, a member of the Executive
Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said at
the Orient House in East Jerusalem while meeting a delegation of
Israel's Kibbutz Artzi Movement.
</P>
<P>
The Kibbutz Artzi Movement is an Israeli organization supporting
the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, delegates voiced their support for the
proposal that East Jerusalem be the capital of the Palestinians,
while West Jerusalem be the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Green Line was the ceasefire line of the 1967 Middle East
war which divided Israel and the West Bank. The line also passes
through the middle of Jerusalem from north to the south, cutting
the city into West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war.
And since then, many Jewish quarters have been built in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the July Camp David summit, Israel proposed that the
Palestinian side could only exercise administrative powers over the
Muslim holy sites and the Arab quarters in East Jerusalem, a
proposal rejected by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
If Israel wants to keep the Jewish quarters in East Jerusalem,
then an exchange of suburbs between Jews and Arabs should be
carried out, Husseini told the delegation.
</P>
<P>
In return, he said, Arab quarters in West Jerusalem such as
Lifta and Malcha, must be put under the Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The Orient House is the PLO representative office in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Calls for Arab Summit to Seek Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh called on Monday for an Arab summit to seek restoration of
unity of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria, Shareh said the situation of lacking
unity in the Arab world must not be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders should come together as soon as possible to find
ways of putting an end to "this wretched situation of disunity,"
for the benefit of the Arab nation and the peace and stability in
the Middle East, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shareh arrived in the Egyptian Mediterranean port city on Sunday
after a brief visit to Saudi Arabia. He said that he has discussed
the issue with Mubarak, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Saudi

King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace talks between the Palestinians and
Israelis, Shareh demanded that Israel withdraw completely from East
Jerusalem for it to be an integral part of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Israel must implement the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 242, which rules that East Jerusalem is part of the Arab
territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab East Jerusalem must "return entirely and not incompletely"
to the Palestinian people, Shareh said, underlining that the
Israeli
withdrawal must be complete, without leaving it any foothold there.
</P>
<P>
He said that he handed to Mubarak a message from Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad. The message dealt with inter-Arab
relations and the Middle East peace process, Shareh said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official's current trip was also aimed at preparing
for a visit to Egypt by al-Assad, planned for the end of this
month, the first trip abroad since he assumed office last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Annual inflation rate in India
fell by 0.65 percent to 5.75 percent for the week ended on August

5.75 percent (provisional) from 6.40 percent a week earlier,
according to a weekly report issued on Sunday by the Reserve Bank
of India, central bank of the country.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in the reference week was mainly due to a 7
percent fall in prices of fruits and vegetables, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Price index under the major group "Primary Articles" fell by 1.
1 percent, while the index for "manufactured products" group rose
marginally by 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-Share Market Hits 134.99 Highest in Almost Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market
index shot up 8.82 points or 6.99 percent to close at 134.99
points on Monday, slightly coming off its session high of 135.04.
</P>
<P>
The market, of its largest point gains since May 29 this year,
was moving aggressively to its fresh high since September 18, 1997,
when it hit a high of 135.65 points, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Turnover more than tripled to 318.81 million HK dollars, which
was 213.11 million HK dollars or 201.62 percent more than the
total on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The overall hard currency B-share markets in Shanghai and
Shenzhen stood on extremely bullish sentiment resulting from hopes
of an eventual merger of the Class A and Class B shares, which
were respectively reserved for domestic and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said the merger speculation on China's stock
market has been triggering buying interest among foreign fund
managers, who are eager to gain access to the domestic A share
market, perceived as the world's best performing market this year.
</P>
<P>
The current frenzy for additional A share sales on the part of
many hard-currency share companies, with either B shares or H
shares, also added strength to the spree.
</P>
<P>
Analyst expect the government will relax the restrictive
policies on different classes of share issues available to listed
companies, which will especially help reinforce the refinancing
capability and ensure sustained growth of B share and H share
companies.
</P>
<P>
Breadth statistics remained decisively positive, with not a
single share on the negative territory and only one unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the winners' column, Benelux Ent jumped 10.11 percent to 2.
94 HK dollars, South Glass up 10.77 percent to 3.28 HK dollars,
Baoshi up 10.05 percent to 2.19 HK dollars, and Guangdong Powe
rose 10.03 percent to 6.80 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intl Container also shored up 9.94 percent to 7.08 HK dollars.
The world's largest maker of freight containers announced a nearly
50 percent rise in net profit for the half year ended June 2000,
with earnings per share up to 0.606 yuan from 0.414 yuan in the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that as the sessions progress, it
has become more apparent that investors will not be coming off the
sidelines and are most likely to catch up with follow-through
buying on blue chips. Today's key leadership group will continue
to be pushed higher. Technically, profit takers will hurdle the
advance to some extent tomorrow, but it will not rid the market of
an aggressive nature in the underlying theme.

<P>
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Tung Chee Hwa officiated at the opening ceremony of the two-month
exhibition Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 items of mock-ups and models related to Chinese rockets
and satellites as well as pictures and display panels are on show.

</P>
<P>
On November 20, 1999, the success of the maiden flight of an

Chinese aerospace technology, said Xu Dazhe, president of the
Chinese Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, the Long March rockets have been established
to a fleet of 11 models of 4 series since its first launch in 1970,

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Woos IT Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- If you are an Information
Technology (IT) professional with one or more hot skills, you can
happily enjoy your prime time in Hong Kong, since the region,
bending on establishing itself as a science and technology hub, is
desperately in need of IT talents.
</P>
<P>
Many IT professionals are not only seeing their salaries
skyrocket on an annual basis nowadays, but are now receiving
unprecedented flexibility from their employers as well, a latest
survey released by a global consulting firm said.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt Associates, a large consulting firm serves more than 75
percent of the Fortune 500, surveyed 216 large Hong Kong companies
and reported data on 38,465 IT employees with "hot skills", namely,
skills in short supply, high demand and experiencing rapid changes
in market value.
</P>
<P>
On Hewitt's Today's hot skills list, the first place goes to
Network Engineering and the second to Data Visualization. Network
engineers are typically responsible for client and server, and
Internet and Intranet development, while Data visualization
professionals apply techniques such as virtual reality to
scientific and engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
Other hot skills of today include Web infrastructure, Data
warehousing, numerical and non-numerical research, supply chain
management, voice system engineering and web security.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt's Tomorrow Hot Skills list is a little bit different
compared with Today's, but the core remains much alike: Internet-
related hot skills will continue to be in high demand in tomorrow'
s Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 and No.2 hottest skills in tomorrow are Web content
development and Web design and development, followed by Web
infrastructure and Web security.
</P>
<P>
With the ever-growing dot.com industry and the evolution of
traditional companies to an e-business environment, IT
professionals specializing in various aspects of the Internet
should soon claim the honor of 'hottest of the hot skills, said
experts.
</P>
<P>
Since the Internet may impact business in ways people have
never seen before, "IT and compensation managers everywhere may
have a tremendous challenge on their hands to be competitive
enough to attract the top talent with these specific skills," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As ways to attract IT talents, the Hewitt survey suggests
companies develop rational compensation philosophy, provide
employees with room to learn and grow, and get employee input.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Justice is
determined to bring order to the long-time jumbled judicial
appraisal field.
</P>
<P>
The ministry held a conference on the issue last Saturday and
pledged to set up, step by step, a new system of judicial
identification compatible to China's judicial reform, Beijing-
based "Legal Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Judicial evidence is one of the seven legal proofs in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Yang, vice minister of justice, a number of
provincial legislatures have or will issue local regulations on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recently issued two rules, the Methods on the
Administration of Registration of Judicial Identification
Institution and the Methods on the Administration of Judicial
Appraiser, which take effect on October 1.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, one third of China's provinces, municipalities and
ethnic autonomous regions will issue their local rules on judicial
appraisal.
</P>
<P>
China will establish systems on the qualification of judicial
appraisers, administration of licenses for the appraisers, and on
job training.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese legislature is
revising the Pharmaceutical Administration Law to strictly control
the country's drug market.
</P>
<P>
At the 17th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress today, a hearing was held for the report on the
draft revision of the law delivered by Zheng Xiaoyu, director of
the State Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
Since being implemented on July 1, 1995, the law has played a
big role in curbing the making and sale of counterfeit and
inferior drugs, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
But the law is out of date and needs to be revised to keep up
with the times, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the official explained the changes and
amendments made in the draft, including the conditions for
establishing pharmaceutical manufacturers, quality control over
raw materials and products of traditional Chinese herbal drugs.

<P>
LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will continue to
support the economic reform programs initiated by the Angolan
government, regional director of the bank was quoted by the
official news agency Angop as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Darius Mawns, who left Angola on Sunday after a week-long visit,
said the support will include the provision of bank aid, in
coordination with the United Nations development program and other
donors, the implementation of the monitored program and the
arrangement for strategies to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said that the positive signal for Angola's national economy
is the recent approval of a 33-million-U.S. dollar credit by the
World Bank managing board for social support.
</P>
<P>
While in Angola, Mawns was briefed on the government's progress
in the implementation of the monitored program agreed upon with

<HEADLINE> Kenya Plans Roads Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to undertake a study to
assess the feasibility of transferring the management and
maintenance of major roads to the private sector, because it is
unable to maintain or expand its fast road network, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be funded by the World Bank, will take nine
months, after which a consultant will be appointed to develop a
road concessions framework that will be centered around legal,
regulatory and contractual procedures.
</P>
<P>
A positive outcome of the assessment will eliminate the
miseries Kenyan road users undergo on jammed and bumpy roads,
besides the prospects of lower taxes especially the controversial
fuel levy.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal succeeds, the private sector will build a road
and operate it commercially for specified period and on terms
agreed with the government or local authority.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the government have invited bidders to
express interest in private sector road concessions consulting
services under the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility,
a new multi-donor technical assistance facility to help developing
countries improve the quality of their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see a window of opportunity for the private sector to
bail out the Kenyan government in road development program that
have stalled for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the government's expenditure on truck roads
development declined from 37.3 million U.S. dollars in 1997 to 36
million dollars in 1998 before being raised to 78.7 million
dollars in 1999, thanks to the El Nino Emergency Program support
from donors led by the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Open Inner Hatch of Russian Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers opened the inner
hatch of the sunken Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk's
ninth unit at about 1 p.m. Moscow time (0900 GMT) Monday, Russian
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Navrotsky said that the unit was filled with water. They are
now considering the possibility of examining the unit with a video
camera, Interfax quoted spokesman for the Northern Fleet Vladimir
Navrotsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
If it is established that air remains there, the government
commission, operating on the Pyotr Veliky cruiser, will decide
what divers should do next, Itar-Tass said, citing Russia's
Northern Fleet press service.
</P>
<P>
The operation is supervised by commander-in-chief of the
Russian navy Vladimir Kuroyedov and the head of the government
commission, Deputy Premier Ilya Klebanov.
</P>
<P>
The press service stressed that the British LR-5 mini-submarine
cannot dock with the upper escape hatch. Therefore, it will not be
lowered to the submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Norwegian divers opened the emergency hatch
of Kursk's ninth compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT),
and nobody was found in the docking area, which is flooded,
Russian Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov told the RTR
state television.
</P>
<P>
Experts said if the valve to the inner hatch is opened, that
would mean that hatch is also flooded. That scenario would most
probably prevent any attempt to get anybody out alive.
</P>
<P>
Measurements by the divers showed that there is no radiation
danger inside the ninth section of the Russian submarine.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of
the Barents Sea on August 12. Russian authorities said most of
those aboard probably died within minutes when the accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
With the sub stranded at 100 meters undersea for more than a
week, hopes are getting dim for finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the divers located some spaces that are not filled
with water, but the pressure in those air pockets might just be
too high to sustain human life.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Intensifies Diplomatic Activities This Week for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is intensifying diplomatic
activities this week aimed at seeking ways of helping bridge gaps
between Arab countries and Israel to push their peace talks towards
final accords, Egyptian newspapers reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will fly to Egypt's
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, and brief the Egyptian leader on his recent visits to
European and Asian countries to rally support for the Palestinian
positions on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Mubarak is also to receive Syrian Foreign
Minister Faruk Shareh to deal with the negotiations between Syria
and Israel. Shareh will deliver a message to Mubarak from Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad, said Al Akhbar and Al Gomhuria, two pro-
government dailies.
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Alexandria Sunday evening, Shareh held talks
with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on the latest developments
in the Middle East peace process, especially on the Syrian track,
and the issue of Jerusalem, at the core of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Following a brief resumption in last December after a hiatus of
almost four years, the Syrian-Israeli peace talks were stalled
again in January due to failure to overcome disputes over the
return of the Golan Heights Israel occupied from Syria in the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mubarak will meet with Yossi Sarid, Israeli former
education minister and leader of the Meretz party, in Alexandria,
said Al Ahram daily, which usually allies with the government.
Meretz, a secular and leftist party, approves of making
concessions, including on Jerusalem, to the Palestinians for
realization of peace.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to meet on Wednesday with Israeli acting
Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who will deliver a message from
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said Al Gomhuria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Moussa will meet Norwegian Foreign Minister
Thorbjoern Jagland separately on Wednesday and Thursday, it added.
Norway has played an important behind-the-scene role in the Mideast
peace process, most notably in hosting the secret talks which led
to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli interim accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin is to send a personal envoy,
Deputy Foreign Minister Vassily Seryeddin, to Egypt. Seryeddin is
due to meet Moussa on Wednesday and convey Putin's message to
Mubarak, Al Akhbar daily said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Arabs' traditional ally, is intended to revive its role
as one of the co-sponsors of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979. It has since been a key mediator in the peace
negotiations between Israel and other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Investments Can Offset Oil Price Hikes: Thai Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said on Monday that increased direct investment
could help cushion the impact of rising fuel prices on the economy,
according to a government report.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the report as saying that the Finance Ministry
's economic forecasts, which are currently under revision due to
pressure from higher oil prices, should take into account other
non-oil price factors, especially investments.
</P>
<P>
Citing Board of Investment (BOI) figures, he noted that during
the first half of the year, projects seeking BOI promotional
privileges were up over 100 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that apart from a pick-up at the BOI, new
investments were coming at a time when a number of local
industries, including plastic, pulp and battery business, have not
reached full production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The increasing investments will further boost Thai export,
which is regarded as the main engine of Thailand's economic
recovery, Tarrin said.

<HEADLINE> Rain Causes Vietnam's Rice Export to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rice exports are
forecast to be well below expectations following the extensive
flooding in the Mekong Delta this year, the latest local business
newspaper Vietnam Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Planning officials of Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development (MARD) said there was now no hope of reaching
the central government's target of exporting 4.3 million tons of
rice this year.
</P>
<P>
Instead, MARD's Planning and Projection Department forecast
final rice exports would be between 3.6 and 3.8 million tons, well
below last year's record export figure of 4.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The extensive flooding caused serious crop losses in the Mekong
Delta which contributes 90 percent to Vietnam's rice export.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50,000 hectares of rice were destroyed by recent
floods in the three largest rice producing provinces of the Mekong
Delta: Long An, An Giang and Dong Thap.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates said 300,000 tons of paddy, or 150,000
tons of rice were lost, with the damage valued at 3.6 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, demand for rice worldwide was forecast to stay at
about 20 million tons, 2.5 million tons less than in recent years.
And Vietnam's main export markets, namely Asian countries, wanted
only 3 million tons of rice this year, far less than the usual
seven million tons.
</P>
<P>
MARD figures show Vietnam's rice exports reached 2 million tons
by the end of July, 2000 at an average price of 196.50 U.S.
dollars, a decrease of 50 U.S. dollars per ton compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Vietnam held a 20 percent share of the international
rice market, making it the second largest rice exporter worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Thai Researchers Create High-Protein Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai researchers have created a
new breed of rice with 12 times as much protein as regular rice,
and plan to promote it worldwide, according to a report released
here Monday by the country's Kasetsart University.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the university declared in the report that the
new high-protein rice was "the most nutritious of the palatable
rice strains developed so far."
</P>
<P>
And it was created not by high-tech genetic modification, but
through cross-breeding the Khao Hom Nil, or black fragrant rice,
with fragrant Thai jasmine rice, they said.
</P>
<P>
Only one other breed of rice, a wild plant native to Saudi
Arabia, contains as much protein, but it does not produce high
yields and is not appetizing, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be to alter the color of the rice from black
to white, which is far more popular than colored rice in Asia, and
to find out which gene is responsible for the high protein content,
according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Local rice businessmen have already reported good results of
the trial sales of the rice, raising hopes it will be successful
on the world market.

<HEADLINE> Over 240,000 Zimbabwean Farm Workers to Lose Job due to Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 240,000 Zimbabwean farm
workers will lose their jobs after the government concludes the
acquisition of over 3,000 white commercial farms for resettlement,
the Herald reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Godfrey Magaramombe, chairman of the Farm Workers' Action Group,
was quoted by the paper as saying on Sunday that about 70 percent
of the 350,000 to 400,000 farm workers would lose their jobs as
the new settlers in the acquired farms will not need workers,
opting to use their families as labor.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge the historical injustice and the need for
equitable redistribution of land in the country but we are
concerned with the number of farm workers who will be displaced,"
said Magaramombe, who is also director of the Farm Community Trust
of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the group Lovemore Kadenge called for the
consideration of farm workers in the accelerated resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
Over 350,000 farm workers and their families make up about 10
percent of the country's total population, reaching 2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing
Ignatius Chombo told The Sunday Mail that farm workers would be
resettled.
</P>
<P>
He said some farm workers were refusing to be resettled,
preferring to find employment elsewhere or follow their former
employers.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Diver to Open Sub's Inner Escape Hatch EDS-Resend to add serial number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Norwegian diver descended to
Russian's crippled Kursk nuclear submarine Monday to try to open
the inner escape hatch of the ninth compartment, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, attempts to open it will be suspended if the
compartment is still "dry," Interfax reported, quoting Russian
Northern Fleet spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky.
</P>
<P>
"If water is discovered in the compartment, a television
camera will be sent there, Navrotsky said.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose Kursk, one of the most advanced in the
Russian Navy, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August
12 during an exercise of the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said most of those aboard probably died
within minutes when the accident occurred. With the sub stranded
at 100 meters undersea for more than a week, hopes are scant for
finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian divers opened the outer hatch of the ninth
compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The outer hatch was found to be flooded and a decision was
made not to use Britain's LR-5 mini-sub in the rescue operation,
said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission on the accident, which struck the Kursk has
said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov repeated his belief that what caused the accident was
"an external dynamic blow,"
</P>
<P>
"What it was, a certain large underwater object or a mine, we
will find out later," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Russian Navy does not have
enough pontoons to lift the submarine to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the sub will have to be brought to the surface by
international efforts, and a feasibility study of the operation
will be worked out in less than two weeks, Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and
that the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with
their radiation being at normal levels.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Near Daya Bay Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The red tide that had affected
the western Bank of Daya Bay off south China's Guangdong Province
since mid-August disappeared today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from State Oceanic Administration Nanhai Branch said,
the red tide was first spotted in seawaters near Aotou Town in
Huizhou City on August 14 and expanded to 20 sq m on August 18.
It started to disappear on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists with the Nanhai Branch, the red tide
was mainly caused by industrial waste water and sewage discharged
into Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
However, torrential rains in the region these days also swept a
large amount of organic substances containing nitrogen and
phosphor into the offshore areas, making the marine environment
ideal for the growth of non-toxic algae, they said.
</P>
<P>
The red tide had caused about five million yuan in economic
losses to local farmers who cultivated aquatic products by sunken
nets in the offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Relevant local departments were urged to pay closer attention
to red tide development in the offshore areas where hot weather
and low air pressure continue to prevail in these days.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Bureau Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's Bureau Chief Haim Mandel-Shaked resigned on Monday, the
Prime Minister's Office announced.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak had accepted the resignation of his
bureau chief," the announcement said, without giving further
details about the reason for the resignation.
</P>
<P>
Israel television Channel 2 reported Sunday night that Shaked
told his confidants recently that he has thought about the
resignation for a few months, saying that he no longer feels he has
any influence over matters and does not want to deal with the "
defective manner" in which the Prime Minister's Office is run.
</P>
<P>
Shaked's resignation came just days after the No. 2 man in the
bureau, Shimon Batat, resigned. Batat said in an interview over the
weekend that the Prime Minister's Office is run like a "banana
republic."
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister worked alone," Batat said, adding, "and
everyone has given up hope because of this. Everything in his
office is haphazard and clandestine. Barak is surrounded by
ministers who do not want him to succeed and he needs to understand
this and change direction."
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister's Office dismissed Batat's
charges as "lies."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Currently Hosts 360,000 Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese officials have claimed
that
360,000 Palestinian refugees registered in official state record
currently reside in the country, Daily Star newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Sunday in response to a recent
assertion which was made by some foreign ambassadors and diplomats
based here that Lebanon takes in only half the number of
Palestinian refugees that it claims.
</P>
<P>
However, about half of the registered refugees are working or
living in Gulf countries, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss will stress in his September 12
address to the United Nations General Assembly that it is necessary
for the Palestinian refugees to return home under the U.N.
Resolution 193.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will reject attempts by some countries, with the United
States in the lead, to impose a solution to the refugee issue,
which will not fit its demography and geography.
</P>
<P>
The officials predicted that the refugee issue will become a hot
topic again in September after the summer vacations end. The Arab
League will hold a meeting on September 3 to discuss the long-
standing issue.
</P>
<P>
They revealed that an international solution was currently being
studied over what to do with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A three-fold proposal reportedly included allowing some refugees
to return to their homeland in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, having
host countries settle refugees as permanent residents and
encouraging countries to grant citizenship status to refugees every
year, such as Canada and Australia.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Back-channel negotiations are being conducted between Israeli
and Palestinian academics to smooth over the differences on
Jerusalem and clinch a deal within the next two weeks, the
Palestinian who heads such a group told The Jerusalem Post on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The groups of academics are trying to finalize a compromise over
sovereignty on the Temple Mount, the most sacred in Judaism and
also home to Islamic shrines, which was reportedly the last major
sticking point holding up an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Hassassian, a political scientist and rector of Bethlehem
University, was cautiously optimistic that a compromise can be
reached within a month, though he said there are still difficulties
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's social reform proposals,
which he announced Saturday night, evoked strong opposition from
the opposition Likud faction while in the ruling One Israel the
worry is that the prime minister does not have votes in the Knesset
(Parliament) to ram the program through.
</P>
<P>
Likud spokesmen said the new initiative is no more than an
electioneering stunt to divert the pubic from Barak's political
woes.
</P>
<P>
Senior sources in One Israel said on Sunday that at most Barak "
will go into elections with these reforms and may succeed in
bringing back the secular voters who forsook him because of his
series of concessions to (the ultra-Orthodox) Shas." The concern in
Meretz and left-wing circles was that the emerging change of
direction in policy marked the end of the peace process with the
Palestinians and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior Palestinian official warned on Sunday that if Israel
blockades the West Bank and Gaza following any unilateral
declaration of independence, Jewish settlers there will be treated
as hostages.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "Voice of Palestine," Ahmad Abdel Rahman, general
secretary of the Palestinian National Authority cabinet, said that
Palestinians will respond to any Israeli action.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office chief Haim Shaked
has decided to resign. He said: "Barak has ceased to function as a
Prime Minister."
</P>
<P>
He told his confidents that he no longer feels he has any

dissatisfaction with the way Barak handles affairs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Fund for Patent Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set up a
special fund to help institutions of higher learning to pay for
the cost of patenting their research findings, Education Minister
Musa Mohamad said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fund under the Education Ministry is necessary to expand
research and development activities to produce more patents for
the use of the industries, he said at the opening of the
University Science Malaysia (USM) Expo 2000 here.
</P>
<P>
The fund was proposed by USM Vice-Chancellor Ishak Tambi Kechik
who said that most of the research findings of the tertiary
institutions so far only ended up as reference materials in the
libraries and were not developed or commercialized because of the
high cost of obtaining a patent.
</P>
<P>
The education minister said "the number of patents in the
country is very small compared with the developed countries, so we
must step up efforts to enhance research and development because
only then can we increase the number of patents which can be used
to develop salable products."
</P>
<P>
Efforts to set up the fund would start after the ministry
receives the working paper from the USM and the views of the other
universities, the minister said without giving the size of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
He said "we can discuss with the parties concerned or the
government can develop the fund itself or we can get contributions
from the industries."

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Diver to Open Sub's Inner Escape Hatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, attempts to open it will be suspended if the
compartment is still "dry," Interfax reported, quoting Russian
Northern Fleet spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky.
</P>
<P>
"If water is discovered in the compartment, a television camera
will be sent there, Navrotsky said.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose Kursk, one of the most advanced in the Russian
Navy, went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12
during an exercise of the Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities said most of those aboard probably died
within minutes when the accident occurred. With the sub stranded
at 100 meters undersea for more than a week, hopes are scant for
finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian divers opened the outer hatch of the ninth
compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The outer hatch was found to be flooded and a decision was made
not to use Britain's LR-5 mini-sub in the rescue operation, said
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission on the accident, which struck the Kursk has
said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov repeated his belief that what caused the accident was
"an external dynamic blow,"
</P>
<P>
"What it was, a certain large underwater object or a mine, we
will find out later," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the Russian Navy does not have
enough pontoons to lift the submarine to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the sub will have to be brought to the surface by
international efforts, and a feasibility study of the operation
will be worked out in less than two weeks, Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and
that the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with
their radiation being at normal levels.

CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government is trying to make good on the
country's energy deficit by building 28 new dams and hydroelectric
power plants between 2000 and 2009, reported Anatolia News Agency
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 28 projects, to be financed by inter-governmental loans, are
set to produce 24,791 megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, four projects are planned to be completed by 2009,
nine by 2008, five by 2007, four by 2006 and five by 2005. The
Karkamis Dam has already started operation now.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A consortium of Omani and international firms has
set up a company to build and operate a private 600-million-U.S.-
dollar wastewater network in Oman's capital Muscat, the Dubai-based
Gulf News daily Monday quoted a project official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said Muscat Wastewater Company was set up last week
after the project received government approval. Construction works
on the network will start in July next year and 49 percent of the
project will be sold to the public within five years.
</P>
<P>
Bank Muscat said last year that the project was estimated to
take 10 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's traditional Izmir International Fair would
open for the 69th time in the country's Aegean city on August 26,
reported Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 318 firms from 43 countries would attend the fair,
which would draw 369 domestic companies, said the Izmir Fair
General Manager Feyzi Hepsenkal over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Moldova will be the honorary guest country, which will send its
prime minister, several ministers and other high-ranking officials

ANKARA -- Turkey's textile sector was choked with problems and
its revenues were not compatible with world levels, reported
Turkish Daily News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Aegean Clothing Industry Foundation Serdar
Yavasoglu said that in the last three years more than 80 companies
had stopped production because of variations in the Turkish economy
and exports.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey's ready-to-wear producers should create
their own brand rather than producing for other brands and new
markets should be found in Russia, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Thai Researcher Successfully Develops Security Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Thai researcher has
successfully invented and developed a security robot which can be
controlled through the internet from all parts of the world, the
Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the Office of Research Support Fund, Pitikhet
Sooraksa, a researcher of the King Mongkut's Institute of
Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), had successfully developed a
security robot from cheapest but most quality materials.
</P>
<P>
The only 70,000 baht (about 1,750 U.S. dollars) security robot
is controlled through the internet, and can be used to guard
against significant areas with attached warning and attacking
systems of targeted 99 percent effectiveness within the radius of
three meters.
</P>
<P>
The robot consists of a telescope that can focus on a target and
send the picture to a computer monitor linked to the internet.
Owners of the robot can set the robot to either target a suspected
object, express a warning, and attack automatically, or manually.
</P>
<P>
Owners of the robot could monitor its performances from a point
in all parts of the world that could be connected to the internet,
however, the newly-developed security robot was not suitable to be
used for a personal purpose, but for a societal purpose, namely to
guard against a site of destructive weapons, or a national
heritage.
</P>
<P>
This is because if a person with an il-intention owns or
controls the robot, he/she can pose serious threats to the society,
and this is why the successful development of the robot over the
past six months has just been revealed following a careful
consideration.

In Budapest, the festivities, the biggest ever marking the 1,

MOSCOW -- The British Defense Ministry has given the go-ahead
for its deep-water mini-submarine LR-5 to enter the distress
waters of the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk for
participation in the rescue operation, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The defense headquarters of Northern Norway and the British
Defense Ministry have confirmed that now the Norwegian ship
Normand Pioneer with British rescuers and the LR-5 on board is
heading straight for the distress location of Kursk, Tass said in

MOSCOW -- Norwegian divers opened the emergency hatch of
Russian nuclear submarine Kursk's ninth compartment at 7:45 a.m.
Moscow time (0345 GMT) on Monday, Russian Northern Fleet commander
Vyacheslav Popov said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was found in the docking area, which is flooded, Popov
told the RTR state television. Popov and British and Norwegian
experts are planning ways to move deeper inside the stricken
Russian submarine, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts said if the valve to the inner hatch is open, that
would mean that hatch is also flooded. That scenario would most
probably prevent any attempt to get anybody out alive.

<P>
HARBIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Suifenhe City, located in
northeastern Heilongjiang Province, which borders Russia, has seen
120,000 overseas people visit the city, while 25,000 left China
for overseas trips so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The number was only 30,000 less than the total figure in 1999,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Global economic downturn over the past few years used to dampen
border tourism and only 60 Russians went shopping in the border
city a day during the hot season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Things have turned for the better since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
To lure more Russian travelers, the city has also expanded
tourism routes to Harbin, Dalian, Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The city has benefited well from the country's holiday economy.
The number of tourists during the World Labor Day holiday
increased from 300 a day to 1,700.
</P>
<P>
Suifenhe allocated 1 million yuan (about 12,000 U.S. dollars)
to build another four Customs passages. China and Russia also
agreed to extend exit and entry time to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Dandong, a border city to Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), also expects an increase in border tourism. Travelers to
DPRK is predicted to be more than 40,000, and overseas travelers
to China some 28,000, realizing tourism income of some 1.5 billion
yuan, 20 percent more than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Dandong, China's easternmost city in Liaoning Province, is
constructing highways to Shenyang and Dalian. It has also set up
new tourism routes to mountains, nature reserves, forest parks and

<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Aboriginal will
seek help from the United Nations to get their rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press (AAP), the top
Aboriginal group, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Commission will make its third submission to a United Nations
treaty body, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
later this month.
</P>
<P>
It will claim there is conspicuous inequality in Australia, and
allege human rights are given little value, AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
The commission's chairman, Geoff Clark, said while solutions
could only be found locally, international pressure could help
force government cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Last week we attempted to inform the government of that, but I
think they need to be told occasionally from other sources that
what they are doing is wrong, because obviously they are not
listening to our advice," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
At the last two hearings, Australia was criticized for
mandatory sentencing policies in Western Australia and the
Northern Territory, and for a lack of proper indigenous health
care.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Divers Open Russian Sub's Escape Hatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian divers opened the
emergency hatch of Russian nuclear submarine Kursk's ninth
compartment at 7:45 a.m. Moscow time (0345 GMT) on Monday, Russian
Northern Fleet commander Vyacheslav Popov said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was found in the docking area, which is flooded, Popov
told the RTR state television.
</P>
<P>
Popov and British and Norwegian experts are planning ways to
move deeper inside the stricken Russian submarine, Russian media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts said if the valve to the inner hatch is open, that
would mean that hatch is also flooded. That scenario would most
probably prevent any attempt to get anybody out alive.
</P>
<P>
The British mini-submarine LR-5 bought to the scene in a
Norwegian ship has not descended to the stricken Russian sub,
Popov said.
</P>
<P>
It may not be needed once the hatch is opened, Popov said.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk, with 118 crew on board, went down to the bottom of
the Barents Sea on August 12. Russian authorities said most of
those aboard probably died within minutes when the accident
occurred.
</P>
<P>
With the sub stranded at 100 meters undersea for more than a
week, hopes are scant for finding any survivors.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the divers located some spaces that are not filled
with water, but the pressure in those air pockets might just be
too high to sustain human life.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said the Kursk carries no nuclear weapons and
that the two nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down with
their radiation being at normal levels.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Create 1.35 Million Jobs Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will create an extra 13.5
million jobs annually over the next 10 years, according to the
local English daily Vietnam News Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under an employment strategy for the 2001-2010 period drafted
by Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, the
Vietnamese government will provide 1.35 million jobs a year and
push the urban unemployment rate to below 6 percent by 2005 and 5
percent in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The 30-percent rate of underemployment among rural workers
could be cut to 20 percent by 2005 and 15 percent in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also wants to improve the skills of the workforce.
The target is to lift the number of workers receiving basic
training to 30 percent of the total workforce by 2005 and 40
percent in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The strategy would also radically alter the composition of the
workforce: The agricultural proportion would fall to 50 percent
within 10 years. Of the remainder, 23 percent will work in
manufacturing and construction and 27 percent in the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's officials also said more investment would be
pumped into the development of tourism and service sectors, which
are expected to employ about 3.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also believe that the industrial sector alone
is capable of employing another 4.9 million workers over the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
To further ease unemployment, Vietnam wants to send between 800,
000 and 1 million people abroad to work over the next decade while
between 2.5 million and 3 million people would benefit from the
country's National Employment Program which specially assists the
unemployed and the most needy individuals.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling of Illegal Immigrants Rises in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The smuggling of illegal
immigrants into Thailand, particularly from Myanmar, is on the
rise due to strong demand for cheap labor in the industrial sector
of the country, The Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two years after the Thai government's ban on the employment of
alien labor, official crackdowns have lessened, allowing many
labor smugglers to make a comeback, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One of Thailand's ideal gateways for human smuggling is
Kanchanaburi, a border province which is near Bangkok and adjacent
to Myanmar and has up to 34 open border crossings.
</P>
<P>
Police negligence has allowed labor smuggling gangs to increase,
the report quoted an anonymous source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of human smuggling gangs operating in Kanchanaburi
has risen to 20 from five a few years ago, 14 of which are local
and the others from other provinces, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that police crackdowns on foreign labor
smuggling in the province have failed or missed their targets,
with only foreign workers and not gang members being arrested.
</P>
<P>
None of the vehicles used in labor smuggling has ever been
seized by police and some officers at checkpoints are reportedly
unusually rich and often buy brand-new cars or motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Labor smuggling gangs know well which of the at least 100
border crossings in the province are free of police and military
monitoring, making them ideal gateways for human smuggling, a
source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The gangs use more sophisticated methods now, which enable them
to make more trips and avoid arrest.

<P>
They were at the invitation of the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation of the United States and the organizational committee

COLOMBO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Department of
Wildlife Conservation last week raided an unauthorized private zoo
adjoining a tourist hotel at Moratuwa in the southern suburb of
Colombo, the official Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Department officials were quoted as saying that at the time of
the raid there were more than 10 birds and animals including
peacocks, hawks, parrots and cranes at the zoo. The caretaker of
the zoo has been taken into custody and is awaiting legal action.
</P>
<P>
All these birds and animals are protected under the law and it
is an offense to kill, capture or hold them in captivity. The law
also prohibits the sale or possession of flesh, skin or any other
parts of protected species of birds and animals.
</P>
<P>
There are 11 species of mammals and seven bird species that are
not protected by law and these include the wild boar, cobra, black-
naped hare, porcupine, rat, red monkey, black crow, house crow and
house sparrow.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, because of its diverse physical environmental and
tropical situation, harbors rich biological diversity of global
significance far larger in proportion to its size. The island has
nearly 14 percent of its land area earmarked for the conservation
of biodiversity and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized private zoos are found scattered in many parts of
Sri Lanka and function as tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
Recently at one such zoo at Ahangama in South Sri Lanka, a
supposedly tame lion had attacked and killed a tourist. The owner
of the zoo was charged in court and ordered to hand over his
animals to the National Zoo.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The British Defense Ministry has
given the go-ahead for its deep-water mini-submarine LR-5 to enter
the distress waters of the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk
for participation in the rescue operation, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The defense headquarters of Northern Norway and the British

rescue operation, it said.
</P>
<P>
A decision to use the British deep-water submersible LR-5 for
rescuing the ill-fated Russian submarine, which sank a week ago
during an exercise, was taken after Russian military specialists
on board another Norwegian rescue ship Seaway Eagle discussed the
rescue plan with British and Norwegian rescuers.
</P>
<P>
Following the decision, the British Defense Ministry received
an appropriate official request from Russia.
</P>
<P>

Atlanta Olympic Games, apart from present and past all-around
national champions Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney, and Morgan White
and Jamie Dantzscher.
</P>
<P>
Dawes also became the third American woman to qualify for three
Olympics in gymnastics after Linda Metheny was the last in 1964,
1968 and 1972.
</P>
<P>
After the Olympic trials concluded, Ray became the champion
with Amy Chow finishing second, followed by Maloney, White,
Dantzscher, Vanessa Alter, Dawes and Alyssa Beckerman.
</P>
<P>
However, the scores serve only a suggestion to a four-member
selection team headed by Romanian adviser and US women's national
team coordinator Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympian Shannon Miller, an early favorite for her
leadership and expertise on uneven bars, suffered a critical
injury after jamming her knees on her opening vault in the trials.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who has won a record seven Olympic medals, pulled out
of the nationals last month for her hairline crack in her lower
right leg, and again withdrew from the trials Sunday night after
two jumps over the vault. She came off limping, fighting back
tears.
</P>
<P>
The American woman finished in a disappointing sixth place in
last year's world  championships.

<HEADLINE> Float Bridge Collapses in SW China, Seven People Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were stilling after
a float bridge in the city of Luzhou, southwest China's Sichuan
Province, collapsed on Sunday morning due to overload.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said that dozens of people fell
into the river of Naixi after the bridge linking Jinlong and
Yufeng townships collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, built with seven boats and wood blocks, was
finished on July 28 responding to a major boat accident in the
city.
</P>
<P>
According to local people, the government of Jinlong Township
decided to build the float bridge after a boat accident in Hejiang
County, also in Luzhou city, took 130 lives on June 22.
</P>
<P>
After the bridge was opened to traffic, the township
authorities would assign at least five workers to maintain order
and ensure safety of the bridge on busy days when local fairs are
held.
</P>
<P>
However, thousands of people rushed to cross the bridge on
Sunday in defiance of the warning of the workers, causing the
boats that supported the bridge to sink.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, Sichuan provincial leaders rushed to the
scene to direct rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> World's Earliest Tiles Found in Shang Palace Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The latest excavation of some
grey pottery tiles from a palace ruins from the Shang Dynasty (c.
16th-11th century B.C.) pushed China's history of using tiles back
some 3,500 years.
</P>
<P>
Previous archeological discoveries indicated that China began
to use tiles in the Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 B.C.)
while the new findings predated the conclusion at least 500 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The pottery tiles were found around a stylobate pillar to keep
the area from getting damp around the palace groundwork, which is
located in the famous Zhengzhou Shang Capital of China's second
ancient dynasty in this capital of central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The production techniques for making pottery tiles were still
in the primitive stage, according to their irregular shapes and
rough surface, said a local archeologist in charge of the
excavation.
</P>
<P>
China's history of pottery-making could go back as far as 9,000
years, but the exact time of the birth of pottery tiles is still a
mystery. The discovery of such tiles may give clues for further
research, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
Other findings at the site belong to the Warring States (475-
221 B.C.), Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 220), Ming Dynasty (1368-
1644) and the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).

<HEADLINE> China's Youngest SEZ Stresses Marine Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province, also China's
youngest and largest special economic zone (SEZ), is determined to
become a marine economic giant in the country by vigorously
exploiting the maritime resources in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, a remote island in South China Sea, lagged far behind
the country economically in the past. But it has had fast economic
progress and gradually caught up with the economic development
pace of the whole country since it became a province in April 1988,
especially since it was declared as the country's 5th SEZ five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, the province's gross domestic product (GDP) was 47.1
billion yuan, four times the 1987 figure. The annual GDP growth
rate in the past 12 years was 11.9 percent, 2.7 percentage points
higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
It has also had noticeable increases in per capita GDP, local
revenue. And its poverty-stricken population has fallen from 2.02
million to 120,000 over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years, 9.488 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
capital has been absorbed into Hainan. During the period, fixed
asset investments totaled 155.097 billion yuan, 18.4 times the
aggregate fixed asset investment in 37 years before Hainan became
a province.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, the province did 1.219 billion U.S. dollars
worth of import and export, more than four times the 1987 figure.
</P>
<P>
China now has five SEZs: Shenzhen, Xiamen, Zhuhai, Shantou and
Hainan.

<HEADLINE> Capitel Producing More Mobile Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone producer Capitel
Group sold 3.58 million mobile phones in the first half of the
year, ranking No 1 in the country, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Capitel Group, also named Beijing Telecommunications Equipment
Factory, is benefiting from the booming mobile phone market. It
also produces the most Nokia mobile phones in China.
</P>
<P>
The Finland-based Nokia, along with Motorola and Ericsson,
controls a major share of China's mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Capitel Group and Nokia set up Beijing Nokia Mobile
Telecommunications Co Ltd, Nokia's first joint venture in China.
Both sides contributed 50 percent to what became Nokia's largest
production line in China.
</P>
<P>
Facing a rosy market and a rapid increase in mobile phone
subscribers, Capitel's full-year revenues are expected to be 20
billion yuan, with more than 7 million phones.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited He Yaoliang, Capitel's vice-president, as
saying that the group will produce seven types of mobile phones
specially designed for Chinese consumers this year and at least 10
kinds next year.
</P>
<P>
Capitel plans to produce 500,000 brand-name mobile phones this
year and more than one million next year.
</P>
<P>
Facing tough competition from around China and abroad, He said,
Capitel will first target players such as NEC and Panasonic, which
control less than 5 percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
China has 10 domestic mobile phone producers, he noted, but
they still cannot compete easily with foreign firms.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Scores Year's Best Triple Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's triple jump world
record holder Jonathan Edwards made the best leap in the world
this year at a meeting in Leverkusen, Germany on Sunday, which
seemed to set the tune for his performance at the Olympic Games in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Recovering from an ankle injury that ruled him out of the
British Olympic trials a week ago, Edwards jumped 17.62 meters on
his second attempt to better the year's previous best, set by
Italian Fabrizio Donato in June, by two centimeters.
</P>
<P>
World champion Charles Friedek, competing on his home ground at
Leverkusen, took the second place with 17.14 metres.
</P>
<P>
Edwards' winning leap was a sharp improvement on his own year's
best so far of 17.36, set at this month's Zurich grand prix. It
was a clear warning to his challengers at the Sydney Games which
open on September 15.
</P>
<P>
The first man to jump over 18 meters when he was at the height
of his form in 1995, Edwards said in Zurich that he was feeling
back to his best in terms of fitness and was concentrating on his
technique.

"Although the prices are reasonable, they might still be an
obstacle in popularizing solar equipment," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The progress of the work will depend tremendously on
publicizing the benefits of the equipment."
</P>
<P>
The project is also seeking ways to reduce the cost of solar
energy systems.
</P>
<P>
A large production base of solar cells, modules and application
systems is being built in Baoding of Hebei Province. It will, for
the first time in the country, produce polycrystalline silicon
cells, the cost of which will be much lower due to large-scale
production. When finished the yearly output volume of the new base
is expected to double that of the other eight in China.
</P>
<P>
"But this scale is still dwarfed by some giants in developed
countries, and the price should not be expected to come down
dramatically," Wang said. "But of course, things might be
different, the country is considering more favorable policies."
</P>
<P>
The solar energy systems designed for the regions are able to
produce 20 watts each.
</P>
<P>
China's Brightness Project was launched by the Chinese
Government in 1996 as an immediate response to the call of the
World Solar Energy Conference. It vows to provide power for 8
million people by the year 2005, and 23 million by 2010 by
harnessing solar and wind energy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- After more than three years of
preparation, China is implementing a project designed to turn
solar and wind energy into electricity for people living in remote
areas, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia and Tibet autonomous regions and Gansu
Province will pioneer the use of renewable energy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Wang Changgui, a leading member of the
Brightness Project, as saying that they plan to implement the
project by having local planning commissions take charge of
general operations and to establish special offices to carry out
the work, including choosing products through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
But the households to have the solar panels and windmills will
have to pay for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
The central government has invested over 20 million yuan to
start the project. Most of the funds were used to establish
necessary administrative services, scientific research and
production.
</P>
<P>
The local governments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
and Qinghai Province have taken the lead in subsidizing families
willing to install solar equipment with 200 yuan and 300 yuan
respectively. Other local governments are expected to adopt
similar policies soon.
</P>
<P>
Each set of equipment costs around 1,800 yuan; families still
have to pay the remaining 1,500 yuan to 1,600 yuan not covered by
the subsidies. The solar cells must be replaced every five years,
costing another 500 to 600 yuan each time.

He brought back two agreements with Guizhou and Yunnan for sale
of electricity to Guangdong over the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not reveal the exact amount of power to be
bought, he said the agreements will be a win-win solution for all
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of abundant hydropower and coal resources,
Guizhou has long searched for buyers for its expanded generation
capacity. Its electricity generation will grow from 5.25 million
kilowatts to 8.3 million in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In Guangdong, power from western China will help ease the
growing demand for electricity. The province already has the
largest -- 31.6 million-kilowatt -- installed capacity in China,
but will still face a shortage of 15 million kilowatts by 2005,
said Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Following its post-1980s economic boom, Guangdong has set its
sight on the cheap and clean power from western China.
</P>
<P>
The province was one of the initiators, together with the
former Ministry of Electricity, Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan
provinces, which established the South China Electric Power Joint
Venture (currently the South Company of the National Power
Corporation) 10 years ago to develop hydropower in Southwest China.

<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Double-digit economic growth is
causing Guangdong Province to look to western China and Hong Kong
for power resources, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Running at their full load of 25 million kilowatt-hours per day,
the South China power grids transmitted 3.958 billion kilowatt-
hours into Guangdong from Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi during the
first seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up 187 percent from the same period last year
and was close to the total electricity feeding into Guangdong from
western China last year, according to Guangdong Power (Group) Corp.
</P>
<P>
But that's not enough to ease power shortages resulting from
the province's booming economy. Guangdong's GDP grew 10.6 percent
to 406.28 billion yuan during the January-June period, and its
power consumption hit a record on June 5 in the daily power load
of over 22 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six years, the province started to
purchase power from Hong Kong. Hong Kong sold Guangdong 23.58
billion kilowatt-hours of power from 1979 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of the year, Guangdong used 95.91
million kilowatt-hours from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"To find a stable supplement to our own power production,
Guangdong will open its market to western China's power generators,
" said Zhong Qiquan, the provincial vice-governor, after returning
from visits to Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- All Chinese government and party
officials, including those at ministry level, are likely to be
audited when they leave their posts under a plan being worked out
by the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
The auditing of officials who are about to leave their posts is
receiving "a great deal" of attention from top leaders in the
Party and the central government, said Li Jinhua, auditor-general
of the office.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make it routine," Li was quoted as saying by
today's China Daily. "Our aim is to build a new system under which
all officials will be checked when they leave their jobs,
including when they retire."
</P>
<P>
This system has been implemented nationwide for officials at
and below county level and for heads of all State-owned or State-
controlled enterprises since last year.
</P>
<P>
In East China's Zhejiang, provincial government bureau chiefs
have also been put under scrutiny. The office is trying to include
officials from every level in the system.
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking officials being audited at present are the
former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and
the former presidents of China's five largest State banks, which
were reshuffled in March.
</P>
<P>
The auditing of the financial heads began in May and is
expected to be completed next month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the move to extend post-leaving audits to
higher-ranking officials further demonstrates the Chinese
government's determination to root out corruption in the Party and
government.
</P>
<P>
A string of senior corrupt officials, including Hu Changqing,
former vice-governor of Jiangxi Province, and Cheng Kejie, former
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, were brought to justice this year in the wide-reaching
anti-graft drive.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot solve the problem of corruption solely with post-
leaving auditing, but the system can play an important part in the
anti-corruption war," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pilot to Fly Through Bridge Opening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese pilot will fly a China-
made lightplane through a bridge opening of the No.1 Taihu Lake
Bridge at the 2000 Taihu World Grand Prix of Aviation scheduled
for October 3-6 in east China's Jiangsu Province this year.
</P>
<P>
The bridge opening, 26 meters wide and 5 to 6 meters high,
could be the narrowest space that a person can fly through in the
world. Hungarian Peter Besenyei flew through the 127m x 28m
Heavenly Door at the Zhangjiajie scenic spot in central China's
Hunan Province in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it will be more difficult for the Chinese
pilot to fly through the bridge opening which acquires the skill
of hedgehopping, and the pilot will have a much smaller space for
him to adjust his plane.
</P>
<P>
The Taihu Lake Bridge, in Wuxian County, is 4,308 meters long
with 180 apertures. The bridge consists of No.1, No.2 and No. 3
bridges, connecting the three islands of Changsha, Yeshan and
Xishan. The No.1 bridge is 1,768 meters long, with 73 bridge
openings.
</P>
<P>
The world's top 12 aerobats, from Britain, France, Czech, and
Lithuania respectively, will participate in the grand event. They
will also try to fly through the bridge opening following their
Chinese counterpart.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Asia's Largest Cross-sea Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build the
largest cross-sea bridge in Asia at Hangzhou Bay with an
investment of 6.5 billion yuan (about 783 million U.S. dollars) in
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The 40-kilometer bridge will connect Shanghai, Hangzhou and
Ningbo, three economically strong cities in east China. It will
take only two hours to commute between any two of the three cities
using the bridge.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that within 20 years once the bridge is put
into use, the social benefit generated from lower transportation
costs and less traffic accidents will exceed 44 billion yuan (5.3
billion U.S. dollars), 2.2 billion yuan (265 million U.S. dollars)
annually on average.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the bridge would also promote the development
of two excellent deep-water harbors, the Ningbo Harbor and
Zhoushan Harbor, and benefit the whole Yangtze river delta area.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the six-lane 40-kilometer bridge will last five
years, beginning in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria and discussed proposals made
by parties concerned to the Mideast peace process, Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat dealt with the details of Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks, and the proposals put forward for negotiations by the
Palestinians, Israelis and Americans, Moussa told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The discussions between the two sides concerned "proposals
currently on the table" and the ways to deal with the proposals in
a bid to help the Palestinians and Israelis "reach a fair peace,"
said Moussa, who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the proposals could satisfy the Palestinians'
demands, Moussa did not rule out the possibility. It is likely that
the Palestinian demands would be met by amending the proposals, or
introducing additions and subtractions to them.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the Palestinians will continue the coordination in the
coming period, Moussa said, adding that Arafat would visit Egypt
again in the next few days to carry on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, in the meantime, expressed rejection of attempts to
forge an imbalanced peace in the Middle East, calling on the Arab
world to resist any steps to impose a lopsided peace settlement in
Israel's favor.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians have not changed their stance on the
status of Jerusalem and the declaration of an independent state on
September 13.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is the most sensitive issue in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks. Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967
Mideast War and declared later the whole of the holy city its "
eternal and undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been conducting extensive diplomacy to help find "
creative ideas" to reconcile Palestinian and Israeli demands, while
preserving Palestinian legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wrapped up his short visit after the talks with Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Arrest 23 Terrorist Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
security forces have arrested 23 Arab terrorist suspects who were
accused of planning to carry out terrorist attacks aimed at
sabotaging the Mideast peace process, a senior Israeli security
official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, including 20 Palestinians and three Israeli Arabs,
all belong to militant Islamic groups, with some having links with
Saudi Arabia-born militant Osama bin Laden, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Israel's General Security Service (or Shin Bet) arrested 10
Palestinians and the three Israelis, while security forces of the
Palestinian National Authority arrested the other 10.
</P>
<P>
An official in Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office confirmed the
arrests and said the prime minister saw the act as a "very
important step" in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio reports said the men had been arrested over a
period of months, with some as early as in April.
</P>
<P>
The revelation came just days after the U.S. State Department
issued a travel advisory to Americans living and traveling in
Israel and the Palestinian areas, warning them to be vigilant for
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio reports said the planned attacks included
launching a missile at a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, and
abducting soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel Defense Forces soldiers and Shin Bet agents arrested 27-
year-old Nabil Okal, a resident of the Gaza Strip, on June 1 upon
his return from Egypt, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Okal confessed during his interrogation that he travelled to
Pakistan in October 1997 for religious studies, but joined a group
connected with bin Laden in order to study terror techniques.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants bin Laden to stand trial on charges he
masterminded the bombing of two of its embassies, in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, in 1998, with heavy loss of life.

JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Labor
Minister Membathisi Mdladlana Monday called on progressive farmers
in Mpumalanga province to band together with the government in
ostracizing "bad farmers", South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing commercial farmers in Mpumalanga province's fertile
Lowveld district, Mdladlana said he was "sick and tired" of
hearing generalizations that all farmers were racist or abusive
towards their laborers.
</P>
<P>
"I want (to be able) to deal with individual farmers
responsible for these unfair labor practices and the harassment of
farm workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a tour of Mpumalanga province last month, the national
parliament's portfolio committee on agriculture and land affairs
said the living conditions of farm laborers in the province were "
outrageous" and the police were reluctant to comment on cases of
abuse against them.
</P>
<P>
Local farm laborers have also accused white farmers of using
the farm commando system as a private army to oppress workers.

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for former South
African President Nelson Mandela officially announced here Monday
that a long awaited Burundi peace agreement will be signed by all
19 warring parties next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani told a news conference that Mandela,
facilitator to the Burundi peace talks, has concluded that the
Burundi Peace and Reconciliation Agreement will be signed to end
the seven-year bloody civil war in the tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, although the parties are still at odds on
a number of core issues including a cease-fire effective time,
leadership of a three-year transition period, the makeup of a
national army and the fate of political prisoners, they will fall
to compromise before next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the negotiating parties will reach a
consensus and settle their outstanding differences before the
signing ceremony," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the signing ceremony will be witnessed by leaders
of the Great Lakes region and their counterparts in other parts of
Africa as well as a host of world leaders including U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The Burundi government, the National Assembly, and 17
political parties as well as national observers, religious leaders,
women representatives and the facilitator himself will also sign
the peace accord as witnesses," Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
He said a committee would then be formed to supervise the
implementation of the agreement, which shall contain annexes and
appendices on the nature and causes of the ethnic conflict,
democracy and good governance, military and the future of refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, Burundian President Pierre Buyoya warned Saturday when
returning from talks with Mandela in South Africa that Burundi
would probably not be ready to sign the peace accord on that date.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the mediator (Mandela) clearly and directly that
we are concerned that we will not be ready. He said that he
understood and that he was going to examine the possibility, if
necessary, of fixing another date," Buyoya told a demonstration
against the peace agreement in Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been wracked by civil war since 1993 when Hutu
rebel groups rose up to fight against the Tutsi minority-dominated
army and government. More than 200,000 people have been killed in
the fighting and a further 1.2 million displaced.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive peace talks, security in the country is
worsening and rebel ambushes are on the rise as one such attack
earlier this month killed 32 people, including 27 officer cadets.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks were initiated by former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and were beefed up by Mandela, who
succeeded Nyerere as the facilitator in December 1999 following
the latter's death of leukemia.

<HEADLINE> Four Foreign Journalists Charged With Spying in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign journalists detained
in Liberia have been charged with spying and remanded in custody,
the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gugu Radebe, a freelance Johannesburg cameraman, and Timothy
Lambon, who holds dual British and South African citizenship, were
arrested along with Sierra Leonean producer Samura Sorious and
Briton David Barrie in Monrovia Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The four were arrested on suspicion of espionage while filming
a three-part documentary for the British television station
Channel 4. Liberia's Justice Department has accused them of
engaging in "clandestine activity to injure the image and
character of the president of Liberia".
</P>
<P>
Liberian Deputy Information Minister Milton Teahjay told the
BBC that the crew had been trying to implicate the country in
diamond-smuggling and gun-running, and had been found conducting
interviews with security personnel.
</P>
<P>
However, the British television they were working for had sent
their representatives to Liberia to try to negotiate their release,
while denying the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy to Africa Jesse Jackson has
reportedly appealed to President Charles Taylor to release the
four men.
</P>
<P>
"I told him their detention could only contribute to isolating
Liberia," the report quoted Jackson as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, Taylor promised to give his request "his
highest consideration" but only after the journalists appear
before a magistrate.
</P>
<P>
These efforts were joined by former South African President
Nelson Mandela, who on Monday tried to contact Taylor by telephone.
</P>
<P>
However, he was unable to reach Taylor because the Liberian
leader was meeting Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Mali
President Omar Konare about the peace process in Sierra Leone,
Mandela's spokesman Zelda la Grange said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Mandela sent a letter requesting a
briefing from Taylor Monday afternoon, trying to obtain first-hand
information before deciding on what intervention will be
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Liberia has repeatedly denounced what it says
are international plots against its president.
</P>
<P>
Both Washington and London accused the Liberian Government of
involvement in sales of diamonds mined by the Revolutionary United
Front rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President: Aid Conditions Too Harsh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here Monday that the aid conditions imposed on Kenya recently
by the Bretton Woods institutions, namely the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), were too severe.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks while speaking at the opening of the 36-
storey Times Tower Building, which was put up by the Central Bank
of Kenya and will be used by the Kenya Revenue Authority.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the IMF were harsh because they did not
understand the country's development policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the IMF agreed to resume its loan amounting to
198 million U.S. dollars to Kenya after it suspended a 205-million-
dollar loan in July 1997 on the grounds of poor governance and
official corruption.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the World Bank also approved a 150-million-
dollar credit to support Kenya's economic recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, both financial institutions provided their loans with
new tough conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We have been paying our debts for the past nine years but have
not received anything in return. Our economic growth will
definitely slow down as a result of the conditions," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The president accused the Bretton Woods institutions of not
appreciating Kenya's political stability, saying "without
political stability, there can never be any economic development
and the IMF and the World Bank should know that."
</P>
<P>
Kenyans had worked hard to improve relations with the World
Bank and the IMF yet the government's policies were still
misunderstood, he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Stresses Importance of Cyprus Issue in Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Monday reiterated the
importance of the Cyprus problem in the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"The Cyprus issue continues to be one of the Greek government's
top priorities," said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Cyprus Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou
complained that the Cyprus problem had ceased to be a primary
issue in Greece's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Kyprianou's statement, Reppas said that the
situation created within Cypriot political parties following
Kyprianou's statement was sad.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it was not the right time for rifts within
parties to be caused over these matters.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece has seen the Cyprus issue an obstacle to
the development of its relations with Turkey, saying that the
relations between the two neighboring countries could not be
normalized until the Cyprus problem was fairly resolved.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece and Turkey have since last June began to take
steps to improve their stained relations by the holding of several
rounds of low-level talks and the signing of a total of nine
bilateral cooperation agreements.

<HEADLINE> Commodities, Services Consumption Drop in Romania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Rise in inflation and
unemployment have lately led to a diminished commodities and
services consumption, reported the official Rompres news agency on
Monday quoting a National Statistics Board inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly gross income for a household amounts to 2
million lei (about 90 U.S. dollars). But related to the number of
persons in a household, the gross monthly income per person,
amounts to about 750,000 lei (34 U.S. dollars). The incomes are
generally made up of wages or other revenues such as pensions,
benefits, and the incomes earned by social work, the poll also
said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the consumption expenditure in Romania goes
to food and drink. Money spent on non-food products goes to fuel,
clothes and footwear, the inquiry also showed.
</P>
<P>
Services expenses mainly go to transport and telecommunication
fees, electricity and central heating, water and sanitation bills.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances when the Romanian national lei currency
considerably dropped as compared to the U.S. dollar, and
implicitly the purchase power, the population's consumption proved
to be quite flexible bringing about a dynamic variation of the
demand and offer.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Army Denies Kidnappings in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN) Monday said it takes no responsibility for
the kidnappings in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
In an interview released Monday by Venezuela's press, a leader
of the ELN, "Commander Pablo," said he supports the role of
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and recognized that in the past
he was in touch with Venezuelan guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Part of Venezuela's media said the ELN is to be blamed for the
kidnapping of rancher Richard Boulton a month ago and of other six
Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
The ELN is the second largest Colombian guerrilla group after
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The pact between the ELN and the Venezuelan government is of an
unwritten kind. The ELN has not committed kidnappings in Venezuela
in exchange of being allowed to undertake peace contacts with
Colombian authorities in Venezuelan territory.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be charged with being involved in any violent act
taking place in Venezuela because the agreements with the Caracas
government are alive and we have respected them all along," said
Commander Pablo.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Ice Cream, Frozen Desserts Up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ice cream and other frozen
desserts sales in the United States totaled 11.5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, up almost 3 percent from a year ago, a U.S.
marketplace service reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The biggest seller in the frozen dessert category is packaged
ice cream which captured more than 52 percent of the market share
in 1999 with sales totaling 6 billion dollars, according to
MarkeResearch.com. Frozen novelties are second in sales with a 35
percent market share equaling 4.25 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Overall sales projections for ice cream and frozen novelties
will grow almost 8 percent between 1999 and 2004, when total sales
will approach 12.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Globalization of economy and culture has an impact on the
market, said the report, as evidenced by the introduction of
products from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Product trends to watch for are the increase in the use of
health and wellness ingredients, and stronger flavored products
targeted to certain generations or ethnic populations," said the
report. The research firm said that marketers are looking at
developing flavors with an ethnic flair.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture Capital Fund-Raising Doubles in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Continuing the breakneck
speed of fund-raising in private equity, 80 U.S.-based venture
capital funds raised 17.1 billion dollars in the second quarter of
2000, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total more than doubled the 8.5 billion dollars raised in
the second quarter of 1999, said the report from the National
Venture Capital Association.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of money is being raised by established
venture funds with at least one prior operating fund, the report
said. In the first half of 2000, 98 percent of the money was
raised in follow-on funds, reflecting the institutional investor's
regard for experienced fund managers especially given today's
volatile financial markets.
</P>
<P>
On a regional level, Northern California, where 33 venture
capital funds raised 9.9 billion dollars, took the lead. Silicon
Valley is located there.
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the private equity spectrum, buyout funds
raised 15.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, private equity firms (consisting venture capital and
buyouts) raised 66.7 billion dollars in the first half of 2000, up
50 percent from the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to NVCA statistics, U.S. venture capital funds raised
51.2 billion dollars in 1999. In 1996, they raised 10.7 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government to Re-train Railway Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government, shocked
by two serious traffic accidents within a week, announced here
Tuesday that all staff of Kenya Railways will be re-trained to
improve railway safety in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister Musalia Mudavadi for Information, Transport and
Communications told the press here that the operations on the
Nairobi-Mombasa railway line had still not resumed by Monday
evening as employees and consultants worked round the clock on the
damaged line in the Athi River station.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a goods train carrying liquefied gas and crude oil
from Mombasa to Nairobi exploded at the Athi River station some 30
kilometers southeast of Kenya's capital Nairobi, claiming 27 lives
and seriously injuring over 30 others.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, a commuter train derailed at Lela near Kisumu in
western Kenya, killing 13 passengers and injured more than 30
others.
</P>
<P>
The railway staff will be re-trained at the Kenya Railways
Institute, with the progress report to be presented to the board
of Kenya Railways on a monthly basis, Mudavadi said.
</P>
<P>
He said a sub-committee on railway safety which will report to
him on a quarterly basis has been formed.
</P>
<P>
The committee will investigate the Athi River gas blast and
Lela accident, and the outcome of the committee's findings will be
made public, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that the Kenya Railways managing
director has been instructed to present a safety report in all
board meetings.

ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia (CBE) has made a gross profit of 731 million birr (about
90 million U.S. dollars) during the fiscal year ending on July 7,
2000, representing a 15 percent increase over that of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia imported nearly 2
million tons of commodities via the Port of Djibouti in the 1999/
2000 fiscal year ending in July, according to latest statistics by
the Ethiopian Customs Authority.
</P>
<P>
The statistics shows that various industrial equipment, relief
assistance and fertilizer made up the bulk of the imported
commodities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Port of Djibouti handled 4 million
tons of goods in 1999 as compared to 3 million tons in the
previous year, mainly due to the increase in the dry cargo traffic
of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia became a landlocked country when Eritrea, which used
to be one of the states in Ethiopia, declared independence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been forced to stop using Eritrean ports of Assab
and Massawa since May 1998 when border conflict broke out between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the Port of Djibouti, together with
the Berbera port in northern Somalia, has been a major outlet of
Ethiopian import and export.

JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor wants a day or two to mull over former South African
president Nelson Mandela's request to release four journalists
charged with espionage in his country, Mandela's spokeswoman Zelda
la Grange said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
La Grange told journalists here that Mandela succeeded in
talking to Taylor on Tuesday and asked the Liberian leader to
release the four, including two South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told Taylor: "It would be a wonderful gesture if he
could pardon or release the four journalists", the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Liberia was one of the countries that had helped
ensure the liberation of South Africans from apartheid and that "
it will enhance the president and his beautiful country's image"
if he could release the four.
</P>
<P>
However, Taylor told Mandela there is very clear evidence
against the journalists and he will need one or two days to
further investigate the matter and then reply to Mandela
thereafter, Le Grange added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Liberian authorities arrested the four
in their hotel rooms in the capital, Monrovia, on Friday because
they had carried out "acts against the security of the state".

LUANDA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Angolan ruling
party has reiterated that his party will not talk with rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi, Angola's official news agency Angop reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bornito de Sousa, parliamentary bench leader of the ruling
People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA), said that the
Luanda government only has "the doors open to dialogue" with those
who quit the military path and join the democratic institutions
existing in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party will not dialogue with those who proceed on
the military path", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bornito de Sousa also condemned the stand of some political
parties which called for dialogue between the Angolan government
and Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He challenged those who support such position to go themselves
and talk to Savimbi and come up with concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bornito de Sousa appealed to the MPLA members and
the people to mount surveillance on those who insist on using guns
to impose their political projects.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
said last Friday that there will be dialogue with all those who
embrace peace, those who recognize the legitimate authorities of
the country and who want to contribute to the consolidation of
democracy, reconstruction and development of Angola.

Laryea said the degeneration of the situation in Sierra Leone
has been a major worry to Ghana, as it is depleting its limited
resources on peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Mills, Salim has commended the key role Ghana
has played over the years in the resolution of conflicts in Africa,
saying it is in that vein that the OAU deemed it crucial to
consult Accra before proceeding to Freetown, Sierra Leone.

long-term oil contract would be concluded between his country and
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Seek Norway's Cooperation in Electricity Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Minerals and
Energy Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka is to discuss the
restructuring of the country's electricity industry during her
upcoming three-day fact-finding mission to Norway this week, South
African Press Association reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mlambo-Ngcuka will meet her Norwegian counterpart Olav Akselsen
and Norwegian International Development Minister Anne Kristin
Sydnes, spokesman for the South African ministry Khanyo Gqulu said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which includes five South African
representatives from the petroleum and energy sector, will also
discuss an extension of the current development cooperation
program in the energy sector with Norway.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Electricity Regulator (NER) will take
part in discussions with the Norwegian water resources and energy
directorate.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African White Paper on Energy Policy,
the NER will have to deal with many regulatory challenges that
will emerge during a restructuring of the distribution industry
sector.
</P>
<P>
To assist the NER in bringing South Africa's electricity
distribution sector in line with global trends and dealing with
the challenges as well as other electricity-related issues, Norway
has signed with the South African regulator a three-year work
plan contract with a total value of about 500,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian President Starts Peace Efforts on Congolese Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Nigerian President
Abdulsalami Abukakar is expected to talk with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba and President of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) Laurent Kabila on the conflict in the DRC, the
Nigerian press reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abukakar, who left Nigeria for Zambia's
capital Lusaka Monday as a United Nations Special Envoy to the DRC
to begin his shuttle diplomacy for peace in the region, would make
clear that cooperation with the United Nations and its mission in
the DRC is essential,.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is demanding freedom of movement for its personnel in
the DRC, and the "full participation" in the peace process of all
political factions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who has reportedly refused to enter into dialogue with
the rebels, said recently that the U.N. peacekeepers could not
enter areas under his control.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan last Friday appointed
Abubakar as the U.N. special envoy to the DRC. The appointment
came in the wake of a call by Kabila for review of the Lusaka
peace agreement signed by relevant states last year to end the
armed insurgency against his government.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Intensifies Bidding for Permanent Seat in U.N. Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- As the United Nations Millennium
Summit is drawing near, Nigeria has stepped up its efforts in its
bid for a permanent seat in the Security Council of the world body.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo will urge the immediate
reform of the UN in his address to the summit to be held early
next month in New York, Nigerian press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reform is expected to pave way for the expansion of
Security Council's permanent seats of which Africa is hoping to
grab one.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigerian newspapers quoted local observers as saying
that the lack of concession among African nations on which of them
should pick the envisaged slot may be the continent's problem.
</P>
<P>
Already, Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa are intensely bidding
for the coveted slot and have been lobbying other nations,
especially those in Africa for support.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Arthur Mbanefo, Nigerian Permanent
Representative to the UN as saying that there were plans to give
permanent seats on the Security Council to Germany and Japan
because of their financial contributions to the upkeep of the body.
</P>
<P>
Describing the move as unfair, Mbanefo said in his New York
office recently that the regions where the two countries belong
are already represented in the council.
</P>
<P>
He urged African continent to lay the much needed common ground
in the bidding for a permanent seat in the UN Security council.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines in Nigeria to Train Peacekeeping Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- About 40 U.S. marine officers have
arrived in Nigeria to train Nigerian army soldiers for future
peacekeeping operations, Nigerian press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The American officers were helping building a training base in
Maiduguri, a city in northeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The training program was decided upon during the visit of U.S.
Under-Secretary of State Thomas Pickering to Nigeria last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the U.S. was committed to spending 12.5
million U.S. dollars for the training and equipment of five
battalions of the Nigerian army.
</P>
<P>
Under another military partnership agreement, the U.S. is to
spend 10 million dollars in training, restructuring and
professionalizing the Nigerian army.
</P>
<P>
The troops after training will be ready to be deployed to carry
out regional peacekeeping operations like that in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government has repeatedly stated the country was
willing to send more troops to participate the UN operation in
Sierra Leone if the U.S. and its allies were willing to pay for
the bills.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Maize Yield to Drop by 34 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's maize output for this
year is likely to drop by 43 percent as a result of the severe
drought, according to a senior Kenyan government official.
</P>
<P>
Only 1.71 million tons would be harvested from the current
maize crop against a national demand of 2.97 million tons while
wheat yields were predicted to plummet from 270,000 tons to 108,
000 tons, Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure was quoted by
Tuesday's Kenya Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drought has caused a massive crop failure in the past three
consecutive crop seasons in nearly 75 percent of the country's
agricultural zones, Obure told the visiting Food and Agriculture
Organization Director General, Jacques Diouf, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The failure of crops and the decimation of livestock have
rendered over 3 million Kenyans dependent on relief supplies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf pointed out that solutions to food security
problems in the sub-Saharan Africa lay in a comprehensive
irrigation system, use of effective agricultural technologies and
development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought has stricken the Horn of Africa, leaving
more than 10 million people threatened by hunger.

<HEADLINE> National Parks in Western Uganda Safe: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan national parks and all
tourists attraction centers in western Uganda are secure and free
from any rebel infiltration, a surveillance report by security
agents has said.
</P>
<P>
Second Division Commander of Ugandan Army Fred Tolit told the
New Vision newspaper that the surveillance work had been completed
and that it had declared all the parks free of any danger.
</P>
<P>
"All tourists attraction centers and national parks in the
region are now safe for tourists use," said Tolit.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance team was initiated under the order of
President Yoweri Museveni in September last year to take a close
military surveillance of parks for the safety of tourists visiting
the region.
</P>
<P>
The order followed allegations by some foreign security
agencies that all parks in western Uganda had been infiltrated by
the rebels of the Allied Democratic Front (ADF) and were unsafe
for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tolit said that it was true some of the parks had been
infiltrated by the ADF rebels, "but our soldiers have combed every
inch of the parks and removed all the infiltrators."
</P>
<P>
"Tourists can now use any inch of the parks they want to visit,
" said Tolit.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Refuses EU Observers to Monitor the Coming Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibari government
has refused to permit the European Union electoral observation
mission to monitor the October presidential, general and civic
elections on the Spice Isles, the independent Guardian newspaper
here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar Revolutionary Government refused to grant
permission to the EU team despite efforts by the EU office in
Tanzania to seek the team's mandate be extended to cover Zanzibar,
the EU mission team leader, Brian Pridham, was quoted as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pridham told the paper that his team, which was following up
all stages of the elections in the country, would miss important
developments in the elections on the Isles.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, EU respects the decision of the Isles
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some political observers in Zanzibar link the Zanzibari
government's refusal to let in the EU team to the European Union's
strong pressure on the Isles authorities on allegations it ill-
treated the opposition after the 1995 presidential and general
elections.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of leading opposition Civic United Front leaders and
members and the alleged mishandling of the 1995 elections leading
to the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)'s victory made the EU
cancel financial and humanitarian assistance to Zanzibar, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Since the EU cancellation of assistance to Zanzibar, the
outgoing President Salmin Amour accused EU member states of
meddling into the Isles' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
At present, EU electoral observation mission has seven
observers in Dar es Salaam and four other major regions in
Tanzanian mainland.
</P>
<P>
The mission will be beefed up to 75 observers to enable it meet
all challenges connected to the polling exercise which will
culminate on October 29, added the report.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania is 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls simultaneously with the mainland in the
second multi-party elections this year, choosing its own president
as well as a new leader of the Union government.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan rebels of the Lord
Resistance Army attacked the Sudanese refugee camp of United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kitgum District in
northern Uganda, killing three people and burning 45 huts, the New
Vision daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Low-Income Households Moving Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 21 (Xinhua) -- While the number of U.S.
Internet users with low incomes has grown nearly 50 percent, they
still only represent 9.7 percent of the overall online population,
according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 32 percent of the U.S. population are categorized as low-
income. The study by market research firm Media Metrix found that
low-income households, defined as those with annual incomes of 25,
000 U.S. dollars or less, are generally newer to the Internet,
tend to be less experienced Web surfers and spend more time online,
about 13 hours per month, viewing more unique pages of content.
</P>
<P>
Higher-income users, on the other hand, tend to be more
experienced surfers, spending just over nine hours and viewing
about 550 pages per month in June 2000, compared to 700 for low-
income users.
</P>
<P>
Media Metrix, which samples 55,000 U.S. computers selected
through random-digit dialing and follow-up mail, said that the new
data should be of particular interest to Internet marketers,
especially in its findings that lower-income Web users are
spending more time online and surveying a larger number of sites
and pages.
</P>
<P>
Household income also appears to influence where on the Net
people surf. Lower-income groups tend to visit career and auction
sites, while higher-income audience flock to hobby-leisure, auto,
sports and travel sites, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
A recent combination of decline in computer prices and
increased Web access in academic and business environments has
made the Web more readily available to people, regardless of their
households income, Media Metrix said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise On Rate Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Monday
in an expectation that the Federal Reserve will leave interest
rates unchanged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.33 at 11,079.81.
The blue chip index fell 9.16 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 7.76 at 1,499.48 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index was up 22.81 at 3,953.15, bouncing back from a
fall of 10.53 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The market opened higher as investors showed optimism about the
rate future. But stocks fell in the early afternoon session and
recovered at the finish.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve was widely expected to leave rates alone at
the policy-setting meeting Tuesday. Bruce Steinberg, chief
economist of Merrill Lynch, said in the latest Weekly Economic &AMP;
Financial Commentary that with the economy moderating and
inflation remaining tame, the Federal Reserve will almost
certainly stay on hold at the meeting and beyond that the current
tightening cycle is over.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last
summer in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and prevent
inflation from rising. A slew of the recent reports showed the
Federal Reserve's monetary policy is working.
</P>
<P>
Among the technology issues, chip maker Intel rose Monday,
extending a rally that began last week. Ciena Corp. and Copper
Mountain, both the telecommunications parts makers, also remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.21 at 671.16 and the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Kursk Was to Launch Cruise Missile, Torpedo in Exercise: DM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Monday evening that the nuclear submarine Kursk,
sinking in the Barents Sea on August 12, was ordered to launch a
cruise missile and a torpedo to destroy a target during a naval
exercise.
</P>
<P>
"The submarine commander reported the fulfillment of the first
order and was supposed to report the fulfillment of the second one
by 6 p.m. (1400 GMT) on August 12, when the command lost contact
with it," Sergeyev told an interview with the Russian ORT
television.
</P>
<P>
"Northern Fleet Commander Vyacheslav Popov ordered the
submarine to report its position and actions. Regulations give the
submarine four hours to respond. But it never did. This is why,
starting from 6 p.m., the fleet commander took measures to
increase the readiness of the search and rescue forces," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The rescue operation began immediately after 6 p.m. on August
12, and the location of the submarine was established on August 13,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was an object near the submarine which we did not
identify. At 6:40 p.m. Moscow time (1440 GMT) the Kursk was
located and identified, but the object had disappeared," Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most likely cause of the accident was a
collision with an underwater object, most probably a large
underwater object commensurable with the Russian submarine. "The
other scenarios are less likely," he said.
</P>
<P>
A third explosion was registered on the day of accident in that
area of the Barents Sea at 11:44 a.m. Moscow time (0744 GMT), in
addition to the first two explosions, he said, adding that further
analysis is needed.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that there is no more hope for rescuing the crew
of the Kursk submarine.
</P>
<P>
"All of the submarine compartments have been flooded," he said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency buoys, which are not used by Russian submarines, had
been observed in the area of accident, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"The buoys were seen by duty crews on the Pyotr Veliky ship and
a trawler. But a boat, sent to the place where they had been seen,
failed to locate them because of high waves," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the search operation will be continued
to establish what underwater object the Russian submarine had
collided with. "Or this version will be rejected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, through its military representative in NATO
headquarters, has requested information on whether a Western
submarine may have been in the area of accident, Sergeyev said. "
The answer was negative," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian representative in Brussels was told that even if a
NATO cruiser had been in the area at that time, this fact would
not have been officially recognized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that he received a report on the accident at 12:
30 a.m. (0830 GMT) on August 13. "At 7:00 a.m.(0300 GMT) I
informed the president that the submarine had not made contact at
the appointed time. Since then, the president contacted the naval
commander and me several times. I informed the president of the
developments at least twice a day. We thought at that time that no
additional instructions were necessary," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"The president asked me if there was any need for his arrival.
I said that the rescue forces had been deployed and the situation
was under control, and that there was no need in his presence,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The duty of Kursk-type submarines has been suspended, he said.
"Not a single submarine of this class will be put out before the
causes of the accident have been established," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet To Testify in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chilean judge Juan Guzman said
Monday that on October 9, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the life senator
stripped of immunity and former dictator, will have to testify
within the framework of the investigation of the case called "
Death Caravan."
</P>
<P>
Chile's former military leader has been charged to date with
165 accusations presented by relatives and friends of the victims
of the military regime, including the crime of kidnapping 19
people related to the Death Caravan.
</P>
<P>
Due to these accusations, Santiago's Court of Appeals decided
on May 23 to strip Pinochet of parliamentary immunity, and the
country's Supreme Court ratified this decision on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the dates for medical examinations for the former
Chilean head of state, judge Guzman did not give any information
Monday, arguing it is "a secret of the summary."
</P>
<P>
In relation to the request by the plaintiff to the Defense
Ministry to provide background on the whereabouts of those who had
been arrested and still disappeared, the judge said that such
information has already been requested.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Pinochet is to hold a meeting Monday
afternoon with his team of advisors and lawyers at his residence
in this capital to talk about the steps to follow after the
stripping of his immunity.
</P>
<P>
Guzman is seeking a trial of Pinochet in one of the earliest
criminal complaints, the one involving a case known as "the
caravan of death," a military squad that summarily executed 72
political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
Guzman still faces hurdles before trying Pinochet, mainly the
legal mandate of having the retired general to undergo mental
examination.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's relatives and associates have insisted he will not
accept the exams because the Chilean law only exempts from trial
to people pronounced mad or demented.
</P>
<P>
That, Pinochet's lawyer Pablo Rodriguez said, "would stain his
image before history.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Tied in Latest Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A poll of likely voters
released on Monday put Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore
ahead of his Republican rival George W. Bush for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The poll jointly conducted by CNN, USA Today and Gallup had
Gore at 47 percent, Bush at 46 percent, Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan
at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 697 likely voters taken Friday and Saturday had an
error margin of 4 percentage points. That same poll right before
the Democratic National Convention held in Los Angeles last week
showed Bush 16 points ahead of Gore, 55 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll is one of several that have
indicated Gore made significant gains in public opinion after the
national convention.
</P>
<P>
A Newsweek magazine poll released Saturday showed Gore ahead at
48 percent to 42 percent. But such a poll which measured only
registered voters tends to give stronger results to the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> FAO Chief Vows to Help Ethiopia Realize Food Self-Sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Jacques
Diouf pledged here Tuesday that the FAO will support Ethiopia's
efforts to achieve food security and self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The FAO will do its best to mobilize donor countries to help
Ethiopia attain sustainable food security, Diouf said when meeting
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
Diouf briefed Meles about the U.N. Inter Agency Task Force in
April this year to bring about long-term food security and
agricultural development in the Horn of Africa, an official closed
to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Meles said the Ethiopian government is preparing
viable strategies instrumental in sustainably tackling the impacts
of recurrent drought which have put over 10 million Ethiopians
into starvation since late last year.
</P>
<P>
The next five-year development program of Ethiopia is mainly
focused on achieving food security and self-sufficiency in food
production, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Due attention will be given to the expansion of afforestation,
soil conservation, environmental rehabilitation and irrigation
activities in drought-hit parts of the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, efforts would be made to resettle farmers
from low land to fertile areas.
</P>
<P>
Diouf, who arrived here Tuesday, also met Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin over the food crisis in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Diouf told Seyoum that the U. N. Inter Agency Task Force has
prepared a document aimed at redressing drought and drought-
related problems in the Horn.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed the need to establish a pragmatic and
robust water control system to tackle drought in the sub-region,
according to a spokesperson of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also discussed the outcomes of the World Food
Summit held in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Summit aimed at slashing by half the number of
hungry people across the world by the year 2015, Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
He said the FAO has made progress in achieving the goals of the
World Food Summit, cutting by eight million per annum the number
of hungry people around the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is not enough because to achieve the goals we need to cut
the figure by 20 million," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diouf is on his second leg of brief visits to six East African
countries. He has already visited Kenya.
