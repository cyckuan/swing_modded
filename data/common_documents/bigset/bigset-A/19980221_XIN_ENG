<HEADLINE> SFOR to Stay in Bosnia After June: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) will stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina after
its current mandate expires in June, the North Atlantic Council
announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The council, a political core within the 16-nation western
military alliance, made the decision after consultations with
non-NATO contributors to the SFOR.
</P>
<P>
The decision, subject to a mandate from the United Nations
Security Council, was made to encourage progress in the
implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace accord, the conclusions of
the 1997 Peace Implementation Conference, and a NATO assessment of
the military situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the new Stabilization Force is to deter renewed
hostilities, and to contribute to a secure environment in order to
implement efforts to stabilize and consolidate peace in the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The new forces will have an enhanced capability to help promote
public security in close cooperation with high representatives of
the international community, the United Nations International
Police Task Force and the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision will enable the NATO military authorities to
draw up a plan of operation by June for the period after the
current SFOR mandate expires.
</P>
<P>
A consensus has been emerging among NATO members and SFOR's
non-NATO contributors that the new multinational force will be
smaller in size than the current SFOR.
</P>
<P>
NATO had planned to replace the SFOR with a deterrent force in
Bosnia after June but the plan was dropped following repeated
appeals from the international community.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on
Friday unveiled a package of new measures aimed at helping
Southeast Asian countries recover from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The package will support local private sector activities
through Export-Import of Japan (Ex-Im Bank) financial schemes,
underwriting short-term trade insurance and increasing technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
It will also promote imports from Southeast Asian countries
through Ex-Im Bank financing and efforts to find other ways to
increase access to the Japanese market for the region's products.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said the package includes provisions
for a maximum 300 billion yen (2.4 billion U.S. dollars) in Ex-Im
Bank financing for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
They said the funds will be used to finance Japanese companies'
efforts to facilitate imports from Southeast Asia and to invest in
the region.
</P>
<P>
While the package covers all Southeast Asian countries, the
largest amount of the Japanese emergency aid is directed at
Indonesia, which is the hardest-hit of all the countries in the
region, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the package, a one billion U.S. dollar trade
insurance credit line will be provided with a view to facilitating
Japanese investment in Indonesia, as well as Japanese loans to
banks and companies.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Lands Minister Anosh
Chipawa warned here Friday that the government will repossess the
undeveloped land in prime areas, especially in urban cities and
provincial centers.
</P>
<P>
He said he has directed the Commissioner of Lands in
conjunction with councils throughout the country to carry out an
inspection and re-enter upon the land which was given three years
ago but has not been developed.
</P>
<P>
Since the government is in a hurry to develop the country, all
those who own land on title anywhere in the country risk their
land being repossessed if such land has not been developed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, only the serious potential
developers will be left to develop the land, as land is given on
the understanding that it will be developed within a stipulated
time.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa told the Commissioner of Lands and the Council to
submit by the end of April this year to his office details of all
the undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry Dorothy Mulwila
said the ministry is looking for ways to shorten the time from an
application for land up to getting title deeds.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unfolds Strategy for Debt Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz Friday unfolded a strategy for better debt management
within the framework of the macro-economic policy of the country.
</P>
<P>
Aziz revealed the strategy when addressing the inaugural
session of an international management accountants conference in
the southern port city of Karachi, the Associated Press of
Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the macro-economic policy gives top priority to
strengthening economic stability and raising savings by reducing
the budgetary gap and creating conditions conducive to corporate
savings.
</P>
<P>
Debt management is one of the key elements of Pakistan's
macro-economic policy as the country's external debt servicing
increased from 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1992-93 to 2.3 billion
dollars in 1996-97, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's long-term soft loans were estimated at 30
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the present situation, direct foreign investment is the
only way to get investment in the country, he said, adding that
the government is providing incentives to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said there would be no borrowing by the private sector
from international sources without the knowledge of the State Bank
of Pakistan in the future.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to initiate a national debt
retirement program to reduce the need for short-term high-cost
borrowing, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said privatization programs would be utilized to reduce
expensive debts.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is also trying to enhance the capacity
of its institutions for efficient management of public debts.
</P>
<P>
The global environment is becoming unfavorable for
debt-burdened countries, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
If this situation is not dealt with seriously, it can lead to
disastrous consequences, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Huge Foreign Debts Due for South Korean Firms in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean companies have to
pay a total of 13 billion dollars in foreign debts, the South
Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the debts of the country's businesses were
95.3 billion dollars, of which, 32 billion came from foreign
banks, 21 billion from the overseas branches of South Korean banks
and 42.3 billion from domestic banks in trade credit.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 32 billion dollars in foreign debts, 19 billion were
trade-related debts and their maturities have been extended. The
other 13 billion were loans that foreign banks expect repayment by
the end of 1998, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, has
been in a serious financial crisis, with corporate failures and
bad loans of financial institutions since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has resulted in a sharp devaluation of the South
Korean won against the U.S. dollar and decreased international
credit.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue loan of 57 billion dollars, South Korea has to
restructure its economy and markets and shut down ailing banks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges Proactive European Role In Tackling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore Friday called on Europe to take on a more "proactive
role" in the global efforts to restore confidence in Asia's
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his keynote speech at the first Europe Asia Forum
which started here on Friday, Lee warned that the repercussions of
an East Asian meltdown will not be confined to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, East Asia, Europe and the United States must work
together to quell this panic and reassure investors, he told the
forum, which is being attended by some 70 leaders from political,
media, business and academic circles.
</P>
<P>
International banks that have lent to and multinationals that
have invested in East Asia have a vital interest in the region's
recovery, he said, adding that the world economy, its trade and
investments and its financial markets are inter-linked.
</P>
<P>
Explaining how various countries can help East Asia, the senior
minister said that Japan as the largest economy in the region can
provide the impetus for an export and investment surge.
</P>
<P>
The United States, on the other hand, must continue to reassure
Asia that it is committed to helping the region out of its present
crisis of confidence.
</P>
<P>
As for Europe, Lee said there is a perception in Asia that the
European Union (EU) has been passive in this crisis. He noted that
the EU did not make any direct contribution to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) aid packages for Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It is in Europe's interest to contain the crisis and see Asia
recover as soon as possible if they are to recover their loans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that European banks have lent 320 billion U.S
dollars to East Asia, more than what the American and Japanese
banks have done.
</P>
<P>
On their part, Lee said, East Asian governments have to
undertake painful reforms.
</P>
<P>
These governments must provide political continuity to assure
foreign investors that future governments will stay committed to
reforms. He added that east Asian economies must also open up and
be more transparent.

WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A laboratory owner and a
scientist were arrested and charged in a U.S. court on Thursday
with possessing deadly anthrax bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were Larry Wayne Harris, 46, of Lancester, Ohio,
who the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said was a member of
the Aryan Nation white supremacist group, and William Leavitt Jr.,
47, who owns a fire protection firm in rural Lagandale, north of
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
FBI charged that the two men were "involved in the construction
of a weapon." But authorities awaited testing by military
specialists to determine whether the substance confiscated from
the two men is anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is an animal disease that is deadly when transmitted to
humans.
</P>
<P>
The court papers said Leavitt and Harris offered 20 million
U.S. dollars to a medical researcher for advanced equipment with
which to test anthrax and both men showed up at his laboratory
with vials of the bacteria in their possession
</P>
<P>
Their detention hearing was delayed until Monday while the
government runs tests to determine whether the anthrax was
military grade or simply an anthrax livestock vaccine.

JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Friday that his government supports
a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with a Jewish delegation from the United States,
Netanyahu said Israel supports the U.S. policy of requesting a
fully inspection of the chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say whether Israel backs the U.S. military
buildup in the Gulf region or the possible U.S.-led military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli government and the military have to
get well prepared for possible missile attacks from Iraq,
although such a possibility is very low.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, hundreds of citizens of Tulkram in central Israel
took to the street to protest against the U.S. policy toward
Iraq. This was the first anti-U.S. demonstration held on Israeli
soil.
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators were local Israeli Arabs. They
shouted anti-U.S. slogans and called on the U.S. to pull out its
forces from the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israel Communist Party, also called Hadash in
Hebrew, is continuing to collect signatures protesting against the
U.S. threat to take military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, hundreds of people have signed their names on the
petition, calling for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis
triggered by Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors free
access to its "sensitive sites" suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain threatened to launch military strike
against Iraq if diplomacy fails to solve the Iraq-U.N. standoff
over arms inspection.

evening in a last-ditch effort to end the crisis peacefully.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi announced here Friday that 32,500 hectares of
farmland in central and northern Mozambique have been submerged
by floods since January.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement in a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The number has been down from 105,000 hectares in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, the Mozambican government is
much concerned now about how to support farms in making full use
of the maximum rainfall from March to August, which is the second
half of the agricultural year.
</P>
<P>
To compensate their damage, Mocumbi revealed, the farmers need
400 tons of various kinds of seeds. Half of the amount will be
settled by the government, while the rest will depend on
international assistance.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has entrusted the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fishery to consult with organizations such as the United
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization for help.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued Friday by the Department of Natural Calamity
Prevention and Combat showed that the mud-flow in Tumbine,
Zambezia Province early this year had resulted in 69 deaths, 72
people missing, 204 houses destroyed and 4,000 people losing all
their possessions.
</P>
<P>
Also in the province, the hike in water level in Licungo and
Namacurra River had led to three deaths, 841 houses destroyed and
977 batches of farmland submerged.
</P>
<P>
In Nampula Province in the north, 244 houses in the port city
Nacala were destroyed during a storm in January.
</P>
<P>
The same storm also destroyed 466 houses and displaced 703
families in Cabo Delgado province in the north.

<HEADLINE> Annan Arrives in Iraq on Mission to Avoid Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan arrived here Friday evening in a final attempt to seek a
peaceful solution to the confrontation between Iraq and the
U.S. over U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Annan's plane arrived at the Saddam International Airport at
around 6 p.m. local time and he was warmly greeted by Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and other Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
"I am reasonably optimistic that we will find a peaceful
solution," Annan said upon his arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The U.N chief said he was glad to visit Baghdad for the second
time. His first visit came in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that he was also optimistic that a peaceful solution
can be found and that Iraq would cooperate with Annan for that
end.
</P>
<P>
The Saddam International Airport was under heavy security, with
Iraqi security men being everywhere.
</P>
<P>
There were around 200 cameramen and foreign correspondents
gathering at the airport to cover the arrival of the top
U.N. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Annan said before leaving U.N. headquarters in New York
Thursday that he would explain the situation very clearly and get
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to understand that it is in his
best interest and in the interest of the Iraqi people to agree to
implement the U.N. Security Council Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed optimism Thursday in Paris on his way
to Baghdad that he will find a solution with the Iraq leaders,
saying he had everything for making his trip to Baghdad a success
and that he had enough space to act.
</P>
<P>
He said he was hopeful that force would not be needed to end
the standoff over U.N. weapons inspection, but "there is a great
deal of suspicions on both sides."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Continues with Image Building Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official said
here Friday that the government will continue with its image
building campaign locally and internationally to correct the
"bad" picture of the country painted abroad by some people.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency quoted David Mapmba, Information and
Broadcasting Services Minister, as saying in parliament that the
campaign is vital to counter the adverse publicity which is
having serious repercussions on Zambia both politically and
economically.
</P>
<P>
This is an apparent response to the damage of Zambia's image
that the past peaceful and stable land now has become politically
instable because of the abortive military coup and subsequent
arrests since last year.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba explained that the Zambian government will ensure that
experienced press attaches are attached at Zambia's high
commissions so as to project a good image of the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the damage of the country abroad will have been
reduced if qualified professional and experienced journalists are
stationed as press attaches.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called for more funding to recapitalize
media institutions in the country which are operating under
difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zambian governemnt has expressed worry over the
number of foreign journalists entering the country without proper
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba appealed in parliament to foreign missions in Zambia to
help accredit the journalists who come in except those
accompanying their heads of state.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Poor Train Service in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A British official study showed
that passengers are still complaining about the poor services
offered by many trains operated by private rail companies,
according to local press reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a series of surveys of passenger
satisfaction levels since rail privatization two years ago, showed
"a mixed picture" among the 19 rail companies.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that even the most highly regarded train
companies are failing to meet passenger satisfaction targets and
although 10 of the 19 companies have generally improved
conditions, seven have got worse and two are roughly the same.
</P>
<P>
The most common complaints are dirty carriages, shortage of
seats, poor station information and onboard refreshments.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, which carried out the
study, said that it would continue to work with train operators to
ensure that "messages from the surveys were translated into action
to improve services to passengers".

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran are
working closely towards a durable peaceful settlement of the
long-running Afghan conflict, the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Both Pakistan and Iran want integrity and peace in
Afghanistan, which will be good for the entire region," the APP
quoted official sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is also keeping the United Nations, the Organization
of the Islamic Conference and Saudi Arabia fully informed about
the steps being taken for restoration of a lasting peace in
Afghanistan, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said that the Taliban leadership has
challenged the authenticity of a list of religious scholars
provided to it by the Anti-Taliban Northern Alliance for a
proposed joint meeting to be held here for seeking ways to solve
the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Talibans are unhappy over the list mainly because there is
no endorsement or signatures of the party leaders in front of the
names of the nominees in the list, provided by the alliance," the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leadership also said that names of several ulema
(religious scholars) of the alliance belonged to the areas
controlled by Taliban, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Taliban had, however, assured
Pakistan that they would provide a list of their ulema for the
meeting at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will continue efforts to encourage both sides to
resolve their differences through dialogue, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> French Press Opposes Multilateral Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Federation of
French Press (FNPF) Friday expressed its opposition to the
Multilateral Investment Agreement now being negotiated by 29
member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The FNPF said in a letter addressed to the minister of culture,
Catherine Trautmann, that the agreement could force France to give
up its laws banning non-European Union investors from buying more
than 20 percent of the shares of any French newspaper or magazine.
</P>
<P>
The agreement can also trigger a flooding of foreign press
products into the French market, which will weaken the French
state aid to the local press for protecting pluralism of
expression, said FNPF.
</P>
<P>
The Multilateral Investment Agreement is aimed at liberalizing
trans-national investment among the OECD member states and asks
its signatory countries not to discriminate against foreign
companies in providing investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
France insists that the agreement respect cultural differences
of different nations and that literary and artistic properties not
be included in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed doubt that the agreement can be
signed by the end of April as is scheduled, because of many
differences between European countries and the United States and
opposition from many non-government organizations.

<HEADLINE> Hard Work Urged in Cyprus' Tourist Sector to Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
called for hard work in the tourist sector in an effort to meet
the challenges of intense competition and new developments in the
tourist world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday at a seminar on "Cyprus Tourism in the 21st
Century - Regaining Competitiveness", Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Michalis Michaelides said that tourism is
one of the most important sectors of the economy in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that some 2.1 million tourists visited Cyprus
during 1997, yielding an income of around 830 million Cyprus
pounds (about 1.66 billion U.S. dollars), the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the contribution of tourism to Cyprus' Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately 20 percent while about
12.5 percent of the working population is employed directly in
the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the competitiveness of the tourist industry
in the long run, Michaelides said, the Cyprus Tourism
Organization (CTO) is presently working toward the development of
a long-term tourist strategy with a time-span until 2010.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the strategy will be to achieve sustainable
tourism development, the maximization of economic benefits and
the protection of the viability of investments, the minister
added.

pistols and machine guns. The police returned fire.
</P>
<P>
One demonstrator was killed and three others were injured
during the clash, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Markets Recovery Cooling Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's building societies
suffered their biggest monthly outflow of savings in January for
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Building Societies Association show
that last month, savers withdrew 172 million pounds (275 million
U.S. dollars) more than they paid in, the worst month for savings
since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Building societies' mortgage lending in January also produced
depressing figures. Gross advances were 1.27 billion pounds (2.03
billion U.S. dollars) and approvals 1.25 billion pounds (2 billion
U.S. dollars), less than half January 1996's figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the building society sector is now just a third of the
size it was in January last year after the conversion of five
major societies to banks.
</P>
<P>
January's lending figures were also down compared with
December's figures. Adrian Coles, director general of the
association, said: " The figures provide continuing evidence of a
slight slowdown in the housing market recovery."
</P>
<P>
An economist in the City also said the figures indicate that
the housing market recovery in Britain may be cooling off a little
as higher mortgage rates make their mark.

As Sudan enters its 15th consecutive year of civil war,
more than 4 million people will require assistance to cope with
the effects of war and displacement, including malnutrition and
widespread disease caused by a severe shortage of adequate
health care, lacking of clean drinking water, appalling sanitary
conditions and inadequate shelter,
</P>
<P>
As part of the appeal, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) will provide essential medicines and health care,
emergency shelter, basic education, seeds, hand tools and fishing
equipment, and special care for children in difficult
circumstance.
</P>

Other United Nations agencies participating in the appeal
are the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the
United Nations development Programme, the United Nations
Population fund, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the
World health Organization.

<HEADLINE> Tracking Cancer Cells Helps Predict Leukaemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. doctors reported Friday that
a new technique to detect cancer cells left over after treatment in
children with leukaemia can help predict the possibility of relapse.
</P>
<P>
The immunological technique, called multiparameter flow
cytometry, is capable of detecting one leukaemic cell among 10,000
healthy cells, said researchers of St Jude Children's Hospital in
Memphis, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, conventional methods can detect only one cancer
cell in 100 normal ones.
</P>
<P>
Patients, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), which have
detectable residual cancer cells in their bone marrow, are four to
nine times more likely to relapse, doctors wrote in the British
medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of children who go into remission after
treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the most common form of
childhood cancer, will have a relapse.
</P>
<P>
Immunological detection of residual leukaemic cells at any point
in the treatment course is a powerful predictor of relapse in
children with ALL, researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that "patients with detectable leukaemic
cells at the end of remission induction should be closely monitored
for disease resurgence."

<HEADLINE> Spirit of Friendship Called for Among Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Friday
called for a spirit of friendship among the two communities on the
island during the bicommunal talks for a solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told reporters at his
daily press briefing Friday that statements made recently by
Turkish officials and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are
contrary to the spirit of friendship which should prevail during
bicommunal talks for a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey and Denktash, in absolute harmony, are intensifying
their efforts toward the pseudostate's recognition and are
preparing a long-term plan to achieve their goal," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cooperation, mutual respect, sincerity, good
faith, goodwill and decisiveness should prevail during
U.N.-sponsored bicommunal talks for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Statements made by Turkish officials and Denktash are
contrary to this spirit," Christofides added.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said reportedly after President Glafcos Clerides was
re-elected for a second five-year term in office last Sunday that
there will not be any face-to-face negotiations with the Greek
Cypriots unless the principle of his breakaway state "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)" is accepted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third following a
abortive pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway TRNC,
which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Christofides reiterated that the Republic of Cyprus and the
government of this republic are the only ones recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the divided
island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communites have reached a deadlock since last summer due to the
Turkish Cypriot side's refusal of the European Union (EU)
decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot government in
March this year.

</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said that

exchanged views on bialteral cooperation and issues of mutual
interest, particularly the political and economic situation in
the horn of africa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Former President Arrested by ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Former President of Sierra Leone
Joseph Momoh, believed to be a mastermind behind the military junta
dislodged eight days ago, has been arrested by the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG said Friday in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, the arrest
was made in the city Thursday night, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOMOG, Momoh is one of the leading collaborators
of the military junta that ousted the elected government in a
coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The failure to peacefully implement the peace accord the junta
signed with west African countries to end the crisis in that country
was the cause of certain advice and decision taken by the junta after
consultation with the former president and other senior members of the
All People's Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Momoh, whose government was overthrown by a coup in 1992 after
seven years in power, is now among the more than 500 senior junta
officials, military officers and supporters arrested by or surrendered
to ECOMOG forces since the junta was removed from power last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the whereabouts of the disgraced junta leader, Johnny Paul
Koroma who fled the government house after ECOMOG broke into Freetown,
still remains a riddle.
</P>
<P>
Initial report said he fled to Liberia and another report said he
is in Guinea. The controversy deepened with Koroma's recent claim on
the BBC that he was hiding in the hills of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leoneans are reportedly expressing deep concern
that none of the high ranking leaders of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) rebel group has either been captured by or surrendered to
ECOMOG so far.
</P>
<P>
RUF, who had fought successive governments of the country since
1991, allied to the junta following the coup last May. The rebel
fighters fled to the countryside after the collapse of the junta.
</P>
<P>
Reports said today that RUF fighters have taken over western part
of Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city in the south, and are moving
towards the city center.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of killing civilians and looting offices of
non-governmental organizations, including the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is said to be on the way to Bo and other major hinterland
towns where fleeing RUF and junta forces are fighting for a comeback
to Freetown.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA) has increased train services between
Dar es Salaam and the southwest region of Mbeya following the
collapse of a bridge on a crucial highway linking the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA Public Relations Manager Mwase Lungu told reporters
here Friday that the line has survived devastating floods that
crippled most of the roads and railways in the country.
</P>
<P>
It has increased the number of passenger coaches on the line
from 11 to 15, to cater to the increasing demand of passengers.
Each coach has a capacity of 96 passengers, Lungu said.
</P>
<P>
It is also considering to put more cargo wagons into service,
as demand of hauling goods increased drastically, particularly
from Mbeya to Dar es Salaam, he said.
</P>
<P>
"You see there is a lot of farm products stranded in Mbeya and
Iringa which need to come to Dar es Salaam market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty tons of tomato and 100 tons of Irish potatoes are part
of the cargo expected to be transported to Dar es Salaam from
Mbeya Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-Zambia highway has been closed to all motor
vehicles following the collapse of the Great Ruaha Bridge on the
border between the Iringa and Morogoro regions.
</P>
<P>
The dilapidated bridge collapsed when a heavy duty lorry was
crossing it early this week. Pillars of the bridge had been
partly washed away as a result of floods.
</P>
<P>
Local government has urged people to move to highland, and
cautioned passengers wishing to travel to Dar es Salaam by road
to cancel their trips, or suggested them travel by train.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania-Zambia railway was built with the aid of the
Chinese government in early 1970s. Major stations between Dar es
Salaam and Mbeya are Kisaki, Ifakara, Mlimba and Makambako. Mbeya
is on the border with Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Reports on Paphos Military Airbase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Friday
denied press reports that the recently-built Paphos military
airbase will be officially inaugurated on March 25 in the presence
of top Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
"Press reports alleging that the official inauguration of the
Paphos airbase will take place on March 25, 1998, are not true,"
government spokesman Manolis Christofides told reporters at his
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and Cyprus Weekly newspaper
have reported that the airbase would be inaugurated on March 25,
in the presence of Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos and
probably Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis. They also reported
that Greek fighters would land at the base on that day.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that no decision on this issue had been
taken and that "no date for its official inauguration has been
set."
</P>
<P>
The construction of the airbase, situated near the western
coastal town of Paphos, was completed on January 24. President
Glafcos Clerides announced that the official inauguration of the
airbase will be held after the presidential elections, which
ended in Clerides' victory last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that the Paphos airbase should be
inaugurated in a way that no one will be provoked and does not
affect the spirit which would prevail in the forthcoming
bicommunal talks aimed at a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
He said the ceremony should in no way affect accession talks
Cyprus is scheduled to start with the European Union on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The airbase was built within the framework of a joint defense
pact signed by the governments of Cyprus and Greece in
November 1993. Under the pact, Greece will provide military
assistance in case Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has said that the military airbase aims
to enhance the country's defense capabilities in response to
"Turkey's unprecedented arms acquisition program and threats
against Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The third ministerial meeting
of the Cross Border Initiative (CBI) concluded here Friday with a
consensus that member countries should complete investment
deregulation as well as relaxation of conditions for residents
work permits by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A final communique was issued at the end of the two-day
meeting attended by finance ministers from east and soutern
Africa and Indian Ocean states.
</P>
<P>
The communique praised the CBI for its contributions its has
made "in promoting sound economic management and the creation of
a policy and institutional environment conducive to the promotion
of private investment and trade among the participating
countries."
</P>
<P>
CBI is a voluntary grouping of 14 countries from the
sub-saharan Africa which include Burundi, Comoros, Kenya,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, seychelles,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It was formed in 1992 to create a framework for the
implementation of jointly agreed policies with the objective to
creat conditions for successful integration of member countries
among themselves and with the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The communique said, "Despite the obvious progress, trade
liberalisation is not complete and tariff reform needs to
encompass other duties and charges."
</P>
<P>
The CBI's focus includes measures to reduce the cost of moving
goods, services and productive resources across borders. It
concerns about the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
The CBI Member countries expressed concern about the absence
of south Africa from the forum as its trade policies limited
access of neighbouring countries to its markets.
</P>
<P>
"This has oreated unsustainable bilateral trade deficits with
South Africa in a number of countries," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It added the expeditious ratification of the Southern Africa
development community (SADC) trade protocol could ease the
current problems while dialogue would continue with South Africa
on its trade liberalisation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Allows Officials' Families to Leave Israel, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday advised the families of U.S. officials
and non-emergency staff of diplomatic missions to leave Israel and
Kuwait because of the heightened tensions between the United States
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on "anxieties" expressed by Americans in
Israel and Kuwait and not "on intelligence of an imminent threat
against Kuwait or Israel," State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said private Americans planning to make non-essential trips
to Kuwait, Israel, the West Bank or Gaza should consider whether
to call them off, and Americans already in those areas should
consider whether to leave.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told a news briefing that the U.S. assessment remained
that "the probability of Iraq resorting to the use of chemical or
biological weapons is remote but cannot be excluded." During the
1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired Scud missiles at Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Kuwait support the U.S. stand against Iraq,
including threats to bomb Iraqi weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at a time when United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in Iraq as a last-ditch effort by
the U.N. diplomats to resolve the crisis over U.N. weapons
inspection in Iraq through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Keeping pressure on Iraq, U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday
warned Iraq to give U.N. inspectors free access to suspected
weapons sites or face the threat of military action. "Either
Saddam acts or we will have to," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Duma Fails 1998 Budget Draft in Fourth Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma Friday
failed to adopt the 1998 budget draft in its fourth reading,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Deputies voted twice on the budget but it did not receive the
necessary number of votes.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov attributed the
budget's failure to the government, saying that the Cabinet does
not need it, and to them it is more convenient to work on 1/12 and
finance their cropped spending.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov recalled that president Yeltsin supports the budget.
He attended the Duma session on the draft in the first reading and
urged deputies to vote for it. The Duma has debated all the
amendments to the document, including those submitted this week,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government understands that the Russian economy is in a
crisis that could seize the country's finances as well, Seleznyov
was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Our Home is Russia and Liberal Democratic Party factions
"consolidated in opposing" the budget and derailed its adoption,
according to the Duma Chairman.
</P>
<P>
These factions have moved to continue the debate March 4, when
the Duma resumes its work after deputies return from their
electoral districts, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget draft was endorsed in the first reading on
December 5, 1997, in the second reading on December 25, 1997, and
in the third reading on February 5.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Jeered When Giving Speech on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson to the United Nations was jeered by protesters at the
University of Minnesota on Friday, and forced to abandon his
half-finished speech on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 150 demonstrators burst into the building, chanting, "No
blood for oil," "Hands off Iraq," "Clinton, Richardson you can't
hide, sanctions are genocide."
</P>
<P>
Richardson's scheduled speech is part of the Clinton
administration's campaign to persuade the Americans to support its
tough policies on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When Richardson said 75 percent of Americans support that
position, protesters shouted, "Liar! Liar! Liar!"
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the auditorium one-half hour into a scheduled
45-minute address, Richardson tried to debate with the protesters,
but ended up saluting them and cutting short his speech.
</P>
<P>
"While you have not shown respect for my point of view, I want
to say to you that at least those of you that are protesting are
engaged and I know you care about our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And I salute you and I wish you the best, but I have to tell
you on the policy toward Iraq, you are wrong. You are wrong."
</P>
<P>
While preparing for bombing Iraq, the Clinton administration
seems not to be able to convince its own citizens to support it.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, protests also occurred in Columbus, Ohio, when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was giving a speech about
the administration's policies. She was heckled by the
demonstrators, who shouted anti-war slogans.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Richardson reiterated that the United States
supports a diplomatic solution. But he maintained that Saddam
Hussein must comply with three conditions: offer free access to
all weapons sites, not politicize the U.N. inspection team and
abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan arrived in Baghdad in a last-ditch attempt to avert a war.
</P>
<P>
Richardson praised Annan's management of the U.N. and called
on Americans to pressure Congress to pay U.S. arrears of one
billion U.S. dollars owed the international body.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks to Arab World on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Coinciding with the arrival
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Baghdad in an effort to
avert possible military action against Iraq, U.S. President Bill
Clinton Friday once again threatened to use force for the
settlement of the weapons inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, beamed to Arab and Muslim nations Friday, Clinton
repeated the U.S. stand that once diplomacy fails, the United
States would resort to force to diminish Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's threat to his neighbors by reducing his capability of
producing weapons of mas destruction.
</P>
<P>
"If Saddam refuses to keep his commitments to the international
community, we must be prepared to deal directly with the threat
these weapons pose to the Iraqi people, to Iraq's neighbors and to
the rest of the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton tried to put the blame on Saddam for the possible U.S.
military action against Iraq and the casualties of the Iraqi
people the military action certainly would yield.
</P>
<P>
"If force proves necessary to resolve this crisis, we will do
everything we can to prevent innocent people from getting hurt.
But make no mistake about it, Saddam must bear full responsibility
for every casualty that results," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people, who are heirs to a
proud civilization and who have suffered for so many years under
Saddam's rule," he added.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said Clinton was trying to drive a wedge
between Saddam Hussein and his people so that the international
community would shift the blame from Washington onto Baghdad once
the United States launches its air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Baghdad Friday for
a last-ditch peace mission.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his arrival that he was "reasonably optimistic"
about his peace mission to avert escalation of the weapons
inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will leave Baghdad with a package that is acceptable
to all," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He is going to meet Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and
if their talks go well, Annan will meet Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Annan has said he expects to spend no more than two days in
Baghdad before returning to New York via Paris.

<HEADLINE> US Diplomats' Families Allowed to Leave Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait announced Friday that it received orders from Washington
to permit the families of American Embassy personnel to leave the
country as an "authorized departure" procedure.
</P>
<P>
An embassy statement said that "authorized departure does not
mean that the dependents must leave, only that they can leave at
government expense if they wish to go. It is a voluntary
departure."
</P>
<P>
"This decision was taken solely as a prudent, precautionary
measure and is not based on any intelligence of an existing or
imminent threat against Kuwait," the statement said, adding
that the embassy will remain open and continue its normal
operations.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident in the ability of the Kuwaiti forces,
supported by U.S. units, to defend Kuwait and to control any
terrorist threat," it said.
</P>
<P>
The first two batches of the newly dispatched U.S. ground
troops of more than 700 arrived in Kuwait Thursday to join the
1,500 troops deployed here last year, and several thousand more
are still on their way here.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Baghdad Friday
evening on the last-ditch diplomatic effort to end the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to take military action
against Iraq if diplomacy fails to end the Iraq-U.N. crisis
triggered by Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors free
access to all sites suspected of hiding banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restates Peaceful End to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has restated its
opposition to the use of force against Iraq to compel the country
to allow United Nations inspection of sites suspected to contain
evidence of its chemical and biological weapons capacity.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Alhaji Buhari Bala said
this on Friday in the capital Abuja when American ambassador
William Twaddell visited him for Nigeria's support to the U.S.
military campaign against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there was still room for dialogue and
diplomacy in resolving the impasse over the inspection of eight
presidential palaces by a U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Bala welcomed the visit by U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan
to Iraq in a move described as last-ditch effort to avert the
military option.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all the parties would cooperate with Annan so as
to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on Iraq to comply with the relevant
resolutions of the U.N. on the inspection of its chemical and
biological weapons sites by allowing members of UNSCOM
unrestricted access to the sites.
</P>
<P>
The minister has earlier warned of the humanitarian effects
any military attack against Iraq would have on innocent Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
While calling on the international community to ease up the
present sanction on Iraq, the minister promised that Nigeria
would continue to support Iraq within the framework of the U.N.
Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Food Relief Arrives in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of humanitarian
aid to the war-torn Sierra Leone has arrived in the port of
capital Freetown, with the arrival of a ship carrying 760 tons of
food relief from the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Ghana-flagged Holigans Town,
which docked at the Freetown port Thursday, brought in corn,
soya, sugar, high protein biscuits, pulses and vegetables after a
48-hour voyage from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to go up to Conakary in Guinea and load a further
950 tons of NGO food," said Paul Wyatt, a WFP logistics official
in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The aid is made possible after the west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has captured Freetown from the military junta led by
Major Johnny Paul Koromah.
</P>
<P>
Since Koromah's coup last May that ousted civilian president
Tejan Kabbah, Freetown has been under international embargo,
which is enforced by the ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the ECOMOG is now considering
allowing other ships to come in to ease the acute food and fuel
shortages in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Amend Constitution to Empower Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is considering amending the constitution to strengthen
the rights of crime victims, the Saturday Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to compensate and empower victims, as well as a
victims' charter, will be placed before parliament this year,
with a constitutional amendment next year, the paper quoted
Justice Minister Dullah Omar as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the paper didn't say when Omar made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
A South African Law Commission discussion paper, which is a
step on the road to legislation, will be issued next month.
</P>
<P>
Willie van Heerden of the commission said the issue was high
on the government's agenda and the process was being speeded up."
There will be conferences and workshops to get as much input as
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
One recommendation is that a victims' advisory council be
established, which could have statutory powers.
</P>
<P>
A further proposal is that a percentage of fines should be
used to create a fund to compensate victims of serious crime.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, researchers will begin visiting 4,000 households
nationwide as part of a 1.8-million-Rand (360,000-U.S. dollar)
National Victimization Survey to establish shortfalls in services
to victims. Prepared in concert with the United Nations
Development Program, it will form part of an international study.
First results are expected in June.
</P>
<P>
A major thrust of anti-crime measures this year will be to
enhance the protection of victims and witnesses, provide more
witness-friendly courts and more sensitive policing, and a
concerted move away from the widely held perception that the
constitution is "perpetrator-friendly."
</P>
<P>
Omar said international studies had shown there was a direct
correlation between enhanced victims' rights and a drop in
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, an average of 65 people are murdered every
day, and 10 people are directly affected as a result of each
murder, statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Appeals for Lifting Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Burundi appealed to a
regional summit opening here Saturday for lifting sanctions on
Burundi imposed by the regional leaders, a local report
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Ambroise Niyonsaba, Burundi minister of peace process, asked
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to convince the other leaders
of state and government of the region to abolish the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
During a courtesy visit to Ugandan Parliament Committee on
Presidential and Foreign Affairs, the Burundi minister said many
people of his country are suffering from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister, who is heading a five-man delegation
sent by his president Pierre Buyoya, claimed that restoring peace
in his country depends a lot on first improving the relationship
between Burundi and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Eriya Kategaya, foreign minister of
Uganda, said Friday that the sanctions on Burundi can not be
lifted because the situation in Burundi has worsened.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya made the remarks on the fourth ministerial meeting on
the situation in Burundi. The meeting was a preparatory one for
the regional summit on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The summit is attended by the heads of state and government
from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, Burundi, Ethiopia

from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. Salim Ahmed

This was underpinned in particular by sustained economic growth
and further reform and opening up in the mainland of China, Tung
said during a meeting with Sir Leon Brittan, visiting
vice-president of the European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on the impact of the Asian financial
turmoil on Hong Kong and the region, as well as on the need for
adequate banking supervision and information disclosure on
international financial activities.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong has a robust exchange rate regime,
sound financial systems and a well-supervised banking sector
capable of weathering external shocks.
</P>
<P>
He said: "we possess strong economic fundamentals, with a high
savings rate, large fiscal surplus, substantial foreign exchange
reserves and a remarkable productivity capacity. These positive
attributes enable our markets to make prompt and effective
adjustments,"
</P>
<P>
"We are undergoing a period of asset price adjustments in the
wake of the extensive currency alignment in East Asia. This will
help uphold our competitiveness in the world market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan briefed the Chief Executive on the latest dialogues
between China and the European Union. In response, Tung said that
he hoped the China-European Union relation would continue to be on
the march.
</P>
<P>
Tung also told Brittan that the 1998-99 Budget announced
Wednesday aimed to retain international confidence in Hong Kong
and uphold fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Budget provided for substantial
infrastructural developments which would enhance Hong Kong's
long-term competitiveness. These developments would also give rise
to a lot of business opportunities to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is Hong Kong's largest investor and third
largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tung thanked Brittan for his support in
travel convenience matters for Hong Kong travelers, and looked
forward to his continued support in presenting Hong Kong's case to
member states of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Australia No Fairweather Friend to Indonesia:Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia would not play the
part of a fairweather friend to Indonesia and would stick by the
troubled nation through good times and bad, Australian Deputy
Prime Minister Tim Fischer said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government is engaged with Indonesia for the
long haul... (and) it is in our interest to (provide) sensible
help to stabilize the region, stabilize Indonesia," Fischer was
quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Australia's leading national newspaper The Australian reported
Saturday the Australian government's national security committee
met Friday to discuss a submission which calls for Australia to
lobby the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease some elements
in the financial rescue package to avert major social upheavals.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has warned Indonesia that the 23 billion US dollar aid
package could be in jeopardy if Indonesian President Suharto took
it upon himself to set up a currency board system which would see
the country's currency rupiah set at a fixed rate to the US
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also minister for trade, said all Australia
could do was hope that the situation in Indonesia would not
deteriorate further and provide sensible advice to Australia's
northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be a fairweather friend. In fair weather
and foul weather, we are going to be engaged with helping
Indonesia sensibly during this critical time," he said.

<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos approved Saturday a master contingency plan for the possible
evacuation of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the Middle East
in case of a war in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, Ramos said that he also made
an initial release of 100 million pesos (about 2.5 million U.S.
dollars) from the Presidential Contingent Fund to start the
implementation of the contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that while he continued to pray that the Iraqi issue
is resolved through peaceful means, contingency preparations
should be fully put in place to ensure that the Philippines is not
caught flat-footed in the event the crisis deteriorates into
another armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine government, about 750,000 Filipinos
are working in Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
As part of the contingency preparations, Ramos has directed
Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday to proceed to the Middle
East early next week to coordinate with Philippine embassy
officials on the possible implementation of the contingency plan,
the presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are "country-specific" contingency plans
being prepared by Philippine embassies for OFW communities in all
Gulf states to implement the master contingency plan.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Saturday voiced its
support for a peaceful political solution to the crisis over
weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a press release that Sri Lanka
strongly believes in the need for a peaceful diplomatic resolution
of the issues involved.

Charter by all parties and compliance with the relevant Security
Council resolutions, and Sri Lanka, accordingly, appeals to Iraq
to cooperate with the U.N., the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Any military action would gravely affect the people of Iraq and
Sri Lanka therefore welcomes the diplomatic efforts of UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, which should be pursued with
determination, it added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka also welcomes the decision to increase the amount of
funds to be utilized for food, medical and other humanitarian
supplies for the Iraqi people, the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first government announcement since the crisis in
the Gulf began.

LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have agreed to
raise the strength of the sub-regional peace-keeping force
ECOMOG's troops in Sierra Leone to 15,000, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi has said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi made the announcement Thursday in Freetown, where a
delegation of ECOWAS foreign ministers were assessing the
situation, preparatory to president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's return
to power.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the United Nations to send its observer
mission now to Sierra Leone so that they could be deployed
throughout the country at the same time with ECOMOG soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian minister has recently made a tour of some west
African countries, in the course of which he announced that the
Niger Republic has promised to contribute new troops to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have by now captured Sierra Leonean capital
Freetown and are in control of most part of the country. But
troops loyal to the military junta led by Major Johnny Paul
Koromah are trying to make a comeback in many places.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Nigerian soldiers had already left for Sierra Leone
Thursday to reinforce the ECOMOG troops there.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Starts Landmark Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani left here Saturday for a
ten-day official visit to Saudi Arabia, seeking a better
relations between Tehran and Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that
Rafsanjani, the Iranian former president, brought ministers of
agriculture, oil and labor as well as a number of Majlis
(parliament) members with him in his landmark tour to the Gulf
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian political-economic delegation would discuss with
Saudi officials the latest developments in the world of Islam,
including the critical situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir
and Lebanon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani will also discuss stagnation of world oil market
and cooperation between members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise oil price.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani will meet Saudi King Fahd, Crown Prince Abdullah
and Defense Minister Prince Sultan and will also perform a
minor pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were
severed in 1988 following the killing of over 400 pilgrims,
mostly Iranians, in Mecca but they were restored after the
1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The two countries warmed up their relations last year
following a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and
Rafsanjani on the sidelines of an Islamic summit in Islamabad,
Pakistan, during which Abdullah invited Rafsanjani to visit
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the deadlocked Middle East peace
process and the critical situation in the Gulf region
following the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over arms inspection would bring Tehran and Washington closer
to improve cooperation among Islamic countries.

exporting flowers by the end of this year as several private farms
are coming up in joint ventures for commercial production, the

</P>
<P>
Several private enterprises have started commercial production
of flowers in view of demands in foreign countries, BSS quoted
Faisal Ahmed Chowdhury, vice-chairman of the Export Promotion
Bureau (EPB), as saying at flower show in Dhaka last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The soil of Bangladesh too appears to be fertile for flower
production," the EPB official added.
</P>

He further said that several experts visited this South Asian
country recently and opined that Bangladesh's soil is suitable for
producing at least 10 floral species such as orchid, heliconia,
rose and tube rose.
</P>
<P>
"We have already received an order to export 2,000 kilograms of
tube rose to Holland every month," a flower-producing farm
managing director said, adding that his farm has also launched an
8 million-taka (about 1.74 million dollars) project for flower
cultivation following an agreement signed with the Thailand-based
Asia Pot and Plant.
</P>

Some flower farmers urge the government to help the
entrepreneurs by providing bank loans on easy terms to promote the
flower export, BSS said.

from the peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan Saturday started talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on the inspections of presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in Iraqi Foreign Ministry, the Iraqi News
Agency said. But no details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Baghdad Friday evening in what is believed to
be the last-ditch effort to seek a peaceful solution to the
standoff of arms inspection between Iraq and the United Nations
Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
"I am reasonably optimistic that we will find a peaceful
solution," Annan told reporters upon arrival at Baghdad airport.
</P>
<P>
He described his mission as a "sacred duty" as U.N. Secretary
General.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my talks in the next few days will permit me and
the Iraqi leadership and President Saddam Hussein to find a way
out for this crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed hope that "he could leave Baghdad with
a package acceptable to all."
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who greeted Annan at the airport, said he shared Annan's
optimism, but stressed that it is as important to respect Iraq's
sovereignty, dignity and national security as to implement U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced hope that they can find a fair and balanced
compromise to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. spokesman announced Friday night that Annan
would extend his stay in Baghdad for one more day to four days to
discuss with the Iraqi side issues about the oil-for-food program,
which was approved by U.N. Security Council earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposal made by Annan, Iraq will be allowed to
sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil, more than a double of
the original amount, every six months under the oil-for-food
program.

NAGANO, Japan, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Finland defeated Canada 3-2
to win the bronze medal of the men's ice hockey tournament at the 18th
Olympic Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Neither team showed much intensity during the 60 minutes of play,
and thanks to somewhat sloppy penalty-killing defence, Finland put up
the first mark on the board, scoring on a powerplay.
</P>
<P>
Coming out of the face-off after Canada's Steve Yzerman was put in
the penalty box for holding, Finland's Jari Kurri took a pass from Esa
Tikkanen at 3:33 to get it in the goal.
</P>
<P>
Canada answered at 16:50 with Rod Brind'Amour rebounding a shot
taken by Adam Foote. But Finland ended the period ahead with Jere
Lehtinen getting it past Canada goalie Patrick Roy at 17:23, assisted
by Saku Koivu.
</P>
<P>
Soon into the second period, Canada tied the score on a powerplay
at 22:47 with Brendan Shanahan getting the puck in front of the
Finland goal from Wayne Gretzky and Mark Recchi.
</P>
<P>
Canada missed its chance to pull into the lead despite a two-man
advantage -- taking 6 shots during the two minutes -- and out-shooting
the Finns 11:5 and 13:4 in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
Finland pulled ahead just 17 seconds into the third period with a
winning goal by Ville Peltonen, assisted by Koivu again.

<HEADLINE> American Wrestlers Succeed in Tehran Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) - The 10-man American free-style
wrestling team Friday concluded its mission to Tehran by gaining
one golden and two silver medals, more importantly, with a success
of "Wrestling Diplomacy".
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable" the former Olympic and world champion Kevin
Jackson told Xinhua correspondent after he defeated Iranian rival
Feridun Qambari in the 85 kilogram category.
</P>
<P>
For Jackson, it was unbelievable for him to defeat Qambari who
was encouraged by over 12,000 Iranian spectators in the gymnasium,
furthermore it was unbelievable for him that the crowded Iranian
spectators gave him a warmly welcome after he beat Qambari 1:0.
</P>
<P>
Following the awarding ceremony, the exciting American black
wrestler rushed around the arena, showing the golden medal and
waving flowers to the Iranian spectators, who cheered him by loud
screaming and waving Iranian flags.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Iranian spectators around the arena even tried to
shake hands with Jackson and threw flowers and Iranian flags to
him.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian spectators are marvelous and the best I have
seen," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first golden medal that the United States gained in
Iran since the two countries severed their relations in 1980
following the stormy Islamic Revolution and the occupation of
American embassy in Tehran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The American team with five wrestlers and five sports
officials was believed to have a landmark mission of "Wrestling
Diplomacy," to pave the way for normalization of ties between
Washington and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The team came to Tehran under the invitation of the Iranian
Wrestling Federation after presidents of the two countries
underlined the importance of "cultural exchanges between the two
nations."
</P>
<P>
Wrestling enjoyed highest popularity as an ancient sport in
Iran and even today a wrestling champion is still regarded as a
national hero and a symbol of strength and power in the eyes of
the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
"It is the best way to make a crack on the wall of mistrust
between Iran and the U.S. through the mission of a wrestling
team," diplomats here noted.
</P>
<P>
"I did not felt any psychological pressure while matching
Iranian wrestler," Shawn Charles in 63 kilogram category said
after beating his Iranian rival Mahdi Kaveh 4:2 in the
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fair and friendly match," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaveh, more friendly, hugged and kissed the black American in
front of photographers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American wrestler in 54 kilograms category Zeke
Jones took an Iranian flag and waved it to the Iranian crowd, in
order to show his respect to the Iranian spectators and the
Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a political mission here," Jackson told Xinhua,
"but I hope that our trip to Tehran will encourage more exchanges
between the two nations and will have positive impacts on
relations between the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Australians Protest Against Support for Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- About 1,000 people
demonstrated peacefully Saturday in Sydney's Central Business
District, protesting against the Australian government's support
for any United States military action against Iraq, Australian
media reported.
</P>
<P>
The crowd walked for about a kilometer from Defense Plaza to
the United States consulate in Sydney, where it was addressed by
speakers including Taj Al-Halalai, the most senior Islamic cleric
in Australia, and Peter Maher, Catholic priest Father, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) and Television Station Seven
Network reported.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government dispatched 110 elite troops earlier
this week to Kuwait in support of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mustafu Alameddin, from the Australian Arab Peace Coalition,
told the marchers the Australian government should send nutrition,
food and medicine to the Iraqi people instead of throwing bombs on
civilians, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, speaking on behalf of the Australian
Democrats, said that "Australia should not go halfway across the
world to attack people who were absolutely no threat to us."
</P>
<P>
Another Sydney demonstration is scheduled for next Saturday,
the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Deputy PM to Meet Indonesian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday he has asked his deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim, to meet Indonesia's President Soeharto again to find out
the latest developments in the republic.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the Deputy Prime Minister to go and see President
Soeharto to get a proper briefing and information about his
plans," he told reporters after opening the annual general meeting
of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) here.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir did not indicate when Anwar would meet
Soeharto for the second time in the month. Anwar met Soeharto on
February 5 to discuss regional economic situation. Mahathir
himself also met Soeharto in Jakarta last month.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was asked if he had been in contact with the
Indonesian leader on the situation in that country and what he was
concerned about on the effects to be felt in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia respected Indonesia's independence to take
whatever steps in overcoming the economic problem.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is an independent country and if it wants to do
something, it should be allowed to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposal made by Indonesia to set up a
currency board, Mahathir said that was one of the rights of
Indonesia to decide.
</P>
<P>
"That is one of the rights of Indonesia to decide but attempts
to force Indonesia by pushing down the rupiah for example is a
denial of the right of Indonesia to do whatever it wants," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what kind of consensus had been reached following
his visits to a number of ASEAN countries to discuss the use of
regional currencies for intra-ASEAN trade, Mahathir said
"Everybody has agreed."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been forced to seek aid from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) after it was badly hit by the finical crisis
prevailing in the region and unrest has broken out in the country
due to price hikes.

KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese police chief

Odomel accepted the invitation personally, but added that it
is subject to recommendation from other organizations of his
government. A political impact assessment must be done before the
invitation was accepted officially, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysia Airlines will stop
its flight service between Kuala Lumpur and Macao from March 31 in
the wake of the Asian currency crisis, the Macao Daily News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the air company's regional manager in Macao
as saying that passengers have reduced because of the Asian
currency crisis, so the company decided to stop the flight to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The manager said current 12 flights per week between Kuala
Lumpur and Hong Kong can basically meet the needs of passengers in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia Airlines will become the third air company that
plans to stop air flight to Macao following the outbreak of the
currency crisis in Asia. Korea Air and Asiana said earlier that
they will drop the air route due to a shortage of passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia Airlines was the first of the overseas air
companies to use the Macao International Airport which opened for
commercial running on November 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of air companies are now using the Macao airport, which
handled more than three million passengers by early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Helps Counter Market Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Rapid growth of the private
sector in southwest China's Yunnan Province has diversified the
regional economic structure and better prepared the province to
fight market risks.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan had a GDP increase of 9.7 percent last year, while its
state-owned industrial sector reported a growth of only 0.3
percent, with major increases coming from non-state-owned
economies, statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
"The private economy has greatly helped to promote the
restructuring of Yunnan's ownship and industrial structures, and
the productive forces it emancipated or released are immeasurable
by figures alone," said Deputy Provincial Governor Cheng Yingxuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the provincial government adopted policies to
encourage the private economy. Banks grant loans to the sector,
and unauthorized charges and fees must be prohibited, and controls
over the sector eased.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the number of private household-run businesses
amounted to approximately 660,000, involving a total of 1.2
million employees by the end of last year, with some 9.2 billion
yuan (1.1 billion US dollars) of registered capital, all increased
by a range of 15 percent to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 53,500 workers in state-owned enterprises were laid
off in the province, and 48,000 of them found new jobs in private
businesses. "The private sector is becoming a major channel for
reemployment at a time when the state sector is trimming off its
payrolls to improve efficiency," Cheng noted.

<HEADLINE> Increased Budget for Information Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian parliamentarians have
urged the government to increase budget allocations for the
Information Ministry so that it can adequately administer the
flow of information.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted some parliament members both
from the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) and
oppositions as saying in parliament on Friday that the Ministry
of Information is cardinal in projecting government policies.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka central MP and former information minister Dipak Patel
said vernacular newspapers are the legitimate tool of government
to propagate its programs effectively.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should remove its direct ownership from
the public media and run them on the lines of the British
Broadcasting Corporation, saying the private media in Zambia do
not have the capacity to reach the breadth and length of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Petauke MP Esau Mwanza said the budgetary allocation for media
is too little and urged the government to invest more in
information.
</P>
<P>
Keembe MP Jeston Mulando appealed to the government to reduce
duty on news print which he said is currently too high.
</P>
<P>
Chipili MP Ntondo Chindoloma said the government information
officers should be provided with bicycles and motorcycles to make
them mobile.
</P>
<P>
About one billion Kwacha (about 670,000 U.S. Dollars) has been
allocated to the Information Ministry in this year budget to
support public media.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Deport All Illegal Immigrants: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will deport
all people illegally staying in the country, a senior official of
the Home Affairs Department said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government was trying to change the perception that it was
specially targeting black illegal aliens for repatriation,
Patrick Matlou, chief director in charge of immigration, said.
</P>
<P>
Matlou quoted an official statistics as saying that there were
thousands of such people from non-African countries such as the
United Kingdom, Germany, France, the United States, Netherlands
and India.
</P>
<P>
The problem of aliens staying in South Africa illegally has
become increasingly serious. By August last year, 110,788 had
been repatriated, while for the whole of 1996 this figure
amounted to 180,713 people, up from the 157,084 the year before.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated last year that illegal immigrants numbered
anything from 2.4 million to 4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the influx of economic immigrants and possible
criminals, visa exemptions were not granted to citizens of
countries regarded as problematic.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had recently withdrawn a visa exemption agreement
with Republic of Congo passport holders.

CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard announced in Sydney Saturday he had postponed his trip
to Malaysia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) because of the Iraq crisis,
the Australian government-owned radio reported.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister emphasized that he had not received any
information in the past few hours which indicated that the
prospects of success for the diplomatic mission of United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan had been altered.
</P>
<P>
"I still remain hopeful that mission will be successful," he
was quoted by News Radio on Parliamentary and News Network.
</P>
<P>
"It has become quite obvious to me that crucial decisions about
the possible involvement of Australian forces in military action
against Iraq might need to be taken during the next week and I
would not want the possibility to arise of those decisions being
required during my absence from Australia," Howard explained.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who was due to leave Sunday for the visit, made the
announcement at a doorstep press conference outside his Sydney
residence.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had telephoned Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad about his decision and, while disappointed, Mahathir had
understood the situation.
</P>
<P>
They were already searching for an alternative date for the
visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He had been unable to get in touch with PNG Prime Minister Bill
Skate, but had left a message for him on the postponement.

MAPUTO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi has stressed the role of education for
eradicating the development imbalances between northern, southern
and central Mozambique, the Mozambique Information Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday in Quelimane, capital city of
Zambezia Province where he chaired a foundation stone laying
ceremony for the branch school of the Instituto Superior
Politecnico Universitario (ISPU).
</P>
<P>
The expansion of college preparatory course, higher education
and vocational training to central and northern Mozambique is one
of the ways of eradicating socio-economic disparities between the
two regions and the more developed southern Mozambique, Mocumbi
noted.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that graduates from the higher learning
institutes should be encouraged to settle down in central and
northern Mozambique to promote local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are six universities in Mozambique
altogether, with three public and the others private.

<HEADLINE> Steel Company Turns Profitable After Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Wuyang Steel and Iron Company
in the city of Pingdingshan in central China's Henan province
posted a net profit of 190,000 yuan (22,892 US dollars) in January
after a merger with the high-power Handan Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
According to a front-page story of today's People's Daily, the
Wuyang company registered an accumulated loss of 600 million yuan
(72.3 million US dollars) before being taken over by Handan Iron
and Steel Company on September 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily reported that Wuyang has turned its book
into black five months after the merger by cutting the cost and
raising morals of employees.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Wuyang company cut comparable cost by 9.28
percent over the same period last year. The cost for producing
each ton of steel was reduced by 202.45 yuan over the average cost
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Wuyang company is a producer of special thick and width
steel plate. After posting losses for four consecutive years, it
was taken over by the Handan company last year, which was allowed
by the government to float securities for the merger at the stock
market. So the merger is an experiment.
</P>
<P>
The Handan company used 125 million yuan (15 million US
dollars) it raised from stock market to help Wuyang to resume
normal operation and gave it 20,000 ton of discarded steel as raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
According to the government policy, Wuyang also enjoyed
preferencies for interest reduction and exemption of its loans.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Handan helped Wuyang to set up a cost management
system and beef up its sales department.

CHANGSHA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Central south China's Hunan
Province is vowing to provide an adequate amount of farmland to
farmers in its outlying poor mountain areas as part of its effort

With more than 80 percent of its land scattering in mountain
areas, Hunan currently has 2.6 million needy people living under

capita for farmers in the poor, moutainous areas by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the plan, the provincial authorities are calling for
efforts over the next three years to terrace uncultivated mountain
slopes, transform low-yield land into high-yield fields and open
up more orchids.

<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Skating
Union president Ottavio Cinquanta said at a press conference on
Saturday that he fully supports the use of slap skates in speed
skating.
</P>
<P>
Critics argued that the use of the new skates had compromised the
sport.
</P>
<P>
"I think that (skaters) should be allowed to use all possible
systems," Cinquanta said.
</P>
<P>
"The only one thing we do not want to allow is mechanical support,
and the slap skate doesn't give a mechnical help," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He compared slap skates to the skis used by cross country skiiers,
in which the boot is not fixed to the ski.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the new equipment must be available to
all skaters for a fair race. "Everybody must be in a position to use
the same equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Slap skates, being used in the Olympics for the first time, have
produced a series of record shattering performances in Nagano,
including five world records in five distances.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Starts to Sort out SOEs' Surplus Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
started sorting out surplus assets of the state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) to pave the way to offer the loss-making industries to
private buyers at lower prices, national newspaper The Financial
Express reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The huge assets of most of the SOEs often act as a major
hindrance to their privatization," because the buyers only quote
the prices of the industrial units, not including the other
establishments and properties owned by the factories, the
newspaper quoted a senior official of the Privatization Board (PB)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prices quoted by private buyers often became far lower than
the government-estimated prices due to the huge assets, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
This had prevented the government several times from taking
decisions on their sales, besides allowing the opposing parties to
seek court injunction against privatization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Concerned ministries and corporations had already started
sorting out the surplus assets of the SOEs, enlisted for
privatization, to sell them through separate auctions, the
newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
This would enable the government to offer the SOEs to private
entrepreneurs at lower prices and speed up their privatization, PB
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said, preparations for sorting out the
SOEs' surplus assets and estimating their prices were taking time,
and this had slowed down the privatization process temporarily.
</P>
<P>
A total of four SOEs have been privatized at a total price of
22.14 million taka (0.48 million U.S. dollars) since the present
government was formed in June, 1996, and the government shares of
nine SOEs had also been off-loaded through the Investment
Corporation of Bangladesh.

NAGANO, Japan, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Hans-Peter Buraas of Norway
defeated his teammate and Austrian rival to win the men's slalom race
at the 18th Olympic Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian, who joined in the national team just two years, had
an aggregate time of one minute and 49.31 seconds from two runs for
the title, beating his compatriot Ole-Christian Furuseth to the second
place by 1.33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Buraas was timed 55.28 seconds in the first run and 54.03 in the
second.
</P>
<P>
Buraas said that the Olympic gold medal had been in his schedule
before he raced. "I planned since I got good results in Kitzbuehl this
season that I would beat my teammates and get the gold here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Thomas Sykora, who led the first run at 55.06 seconds, had
a slower time in the second run, which gave him a bronze medal in the
race at 1:50.68.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little disappointed with my run. I thought that I could do
a little better than that," Sykora said. "I made some mistakes on the
course, so I have to be content with what I have got."

Italian ski legend Alberto Tomba's career in Olympics ended in
disappointment after his medal hope smashed in the first run in which

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's GNP, Per Capita Income Expected to Fall Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross national
product (GNP) is expected to fall to 312.1 billion U.S. dollars
this year while its per capita income will plunge to 6,664 dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by LG Economic Research Institute
Saturday, South Korea, which ranked as the 11th largest economy in
1996, will fall to the 17th this year due to poor economic growth
and the won's further depreciation against the dollar caused by
the ongoing financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, South Korea became the 11th largest economy in the
world with a GNP of 484.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the South Korean Ministry for Economy and Finance
said the financial crisis triggered by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions brought the nation's per capita
income down to 9,400 dollars in 1997 from the previous year's
10,519 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The LG Economic Research Institute said the per capita income
will plunge further to 6,664 dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute predicted that South Korea will re-enjoy high GDP
by the year 2001 following years of increased cost of living, high
unemployment and low income.
</P>
<P>
However, the prediction is based on the precondition that the
economic recovery has to begin from next year with economic growth
standing at seven percent and a stabilized exchange rate of 1,100
won against the greenback.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking
United Nations official said here on Friday that Colombia is a
model country in the war against the cultivation, traffic, and
consumption of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, U.N. Under-Secretary General and director of the
International Drug Control Program, who arrived here on Friday for
a three-day visit, congratulated Colombian President Ernesto
Samper for the results obtained by his country in the war against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I consider that Colombia is an example for other countries of
the world. It has committed an incredible amount of resources and
this is the cost of this country's war against drug traffic and
consumption," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi said "the time has arrived to adopt a global
evaluation independent of the efforts of the different countries
against the drugs."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is ready to assume the evaluation process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said countries of the world must agree on a
parameter through which the counseling of the efforts of each
country in the war against drugs is defined.

<HEADLINE> Stiffer Penalties for Maid Abuse Considered in S'pore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is stepping up its
effort to curb maid abuse, as tougher penalties will be meted out
to those who abuse their maids under a new bill tabled in
Parliament, the Straits Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is passed, maid abusers could face sentences which
are one-and-a-half times heavier than what is currently provided
by the law, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which creates a new section in the Penal Code, covers
common offenses that are targeted at maids, such as simple hurt,
serious injuries, molest, insulting a woman's modesty and wrongful
confinement.
</P>
<P>
It would increase the range of maximum jail terms for these
offenses from the term between one year and seven years to the
term between 18 months and ten and a half years, the Straits Times
said, adding that the Parliament is to debate the bill when it
meets next month.
</P>
<P>
It was noted here that the bill came in the wake of a spate of
maid abuse cases, which had caught the public attention recently,
prompting the authorities to get tough.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the police disclosed that the number of molest cases
involving maids was on the rise, from 65 cases in 1995 to 100
cases in 1996. The latest statistics were not available. But press
reports show that there were at least three serious maid abuse
cases and another three molest cases dealt with by the courts last
year involving employers and their maids.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 100,000 foreign maids working in
Singapore, the report said.

BELGRADE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government on
Friday decided to revoke a decision to restrict the amount of cash
in circulation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a cabinet meeting presided over by
Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, said the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Those attended the meeting voiced their support for government
efforts to reinforce the country's financial order.
</P>
<P>
Due to an increase in money supply recently, the Yugoslav dinar
has faced the pressures of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
To ease such pressures, the government decided on February 2 to
reduce the sum of cash in circulation through administrative
measures, such as restricting the amount of salary paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
However, the move was opposed by federal officials, major
opposition parties and business and industrial communities.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- India has refused the
request of the United States to use its space for attacking Iraq,
official sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
India has ruled out allowing any foreign country to use the
Indian air, land and sea space in a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally in Gulbarga of Karnataka State in
southern India Friday, Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said that
he received a call from a "big power" on Thursday evening seeking
permission to use the Indian airspace. He said that the request
was turned down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Gujral had written letters to U.S. President Bill
Clinton and heads of other countries, asking for no creation of a
war situation in the gulf again.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, India said that it was opposed to a U.S.-led
military strike and favored a diplomatic solution to Iraq's
defiance of the United Nations' arm inspection.
</P>
<P>
"Military action would aggravate the sufferings of the Iraqi
people and would have an adverse impact on the region as a whole,"
the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expected to Regulate Fertilizer Ingredients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- After four days of
meetings in Long Beach, California, regulators and industry
officials predicted on Friday that most of the 50 states of the
United States will enact new laws to limit toxic materials in
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The Association of American Plant Food Control Officials, a
group of state regulators, is now recommending every state adopt
standards for heavy metals based on those of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Seattle Times, a daily newspaper in Washington
state, reported that across the United States, industries such as
steel and aluminum manufacturers are disposing of waste containing
heavy metals and even radioactive material by giving it free to
fertilizer manufacturers or farms, and even paying them to take
it.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, few farmers in the general public were aware of
the practice.
</P>
<P>
There is no federal law limiting the amounts of contaminants,
or requiring them to be disclosed to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Now the regulators aim at establishing a national consensus for
regulation, despite objections of the fertilizer industry which
concedes some regulation is needed but wants looser standards.
</P>
<P>
The industry's business volume stands at 12 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Washington was the first state in the country to adopt
standards, based on Canadian standards, for nine heavy metals in a
bill passed by the legitimate last week.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the Canadian fertilizer standards and
what the U.S. fertilizer industry wants, is the amount of cadmium
that would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Cadmium, a dangerous heavy metal that builds up in soils, can
be easily absorbed by plants and may cause cancer and other
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Language Movement Day Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Language Movement Day which
falls on February 21 was observed throughout the whole country of
Bangladesh Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
issued messages respectively on the eve of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the president called upon all respective of
party affiliation and opinion to put in their sincere efforts for
building an illiteracy-free Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister in her message called upon the countrymen to
properly practice the mother language in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders and mass organizations placed floral wreaths in
Dhaka Friday and Saturday at the Central Shaheed Minar where
language movement fighters were buried.
</P>
<P>
On this day, 46 years back in 1952, a number of this South
Asian country's worthy sons made supreme sacrifices to establish
the mother tongue, Bangla, as a state language of the then
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The language movement infused the spirit of Bengali nationalism
which later culminated into the war of independence in 1971 to set
up a separate homeland for the Bangla-speaking people,
"Bangladesh".
</P>
<P>
Since then the Bangladeshi people hold various kinds of
activities every year to mark the day.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are at least 2.5 million Bangla-speaking
people in the world, and it is 120 million people of Bangladesh
who established the dignity of Bangla as the state language.
</P>
<P>
The government is sincerely committed to establishing the
mother tongue as the principal carrier for the pursuit of
intellect and creative faculty and expansion of knowledge and
wisdom, the prime minister said while addressing a award-rendering
meeting in Dhaka Friday.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
finalized the selection of investors and sites to set up 50 new
garment factories as per the 1998 budget proposals, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials in charge of the selections said they will inform
the selected investors as to where their factories should be
located and by when they can start operation.
</P>
<P>
The 50 garment factories program was announced by the
government in its 1998 budget. A total of 171 applications have
been received for the 25 factories outside the Southern province,
while 43 received for the other 25 in the province.
</P>
<P>
Total investment for the factories is estimated to be at around
1.5 billion Rupees (24.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Once in operation, the factories could provide at least 12,500
jobs as the government has made it compulsory for the factories to
employ a minimum of 250 workers each.
</P>
<P>
Half of the factories are required to be set up in the Southern
province as it has a higher unemployment rate than the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
The textile and garment industry is Sri Lanka's number one
foreign exchange earner. Last year the industry has netted 135
billion Rupees (2.18 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Cut Public Spending in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
announced Friday that it will cut public spending by about 2.21
billion U.S. dollars because of a price drop in oil on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
After the reduction, the total public spending of Mexico in
1998 will be 103.57 billion U.S. dollars, Mexican Finance Minister
Jose Angel Gurria told members of the Mexican Congress of the
Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the adjustment of public spending was the only
alternative solution in the face of adverse international
circumstances. Otherwise, the government had to increase federal
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the government is conscious that the reduction of
investment could have consequences in the medium term,
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that despite the budget reduction, some lines
will still be promoted with a larger spending, such as rural
development and social welfare.
</P>

<P>
COLOMBO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The investments in the ongoing

estimated to be around 9 billion Rupees (145 million U.S.
dollars), an official said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Peace Preferred, not for Fear of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite a massive United States
military buildup and an impending war in the gulf, shops in Amman
remained open until midnight on Friday and were crowded with
customers enjoying weekend shopping.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the growing tension in the gulf region, it
is as calm as usual here.
</P>
<P>
Those who have relatives and friends in Baghdad are naturally
following the Iraqi crisis closely. They insist that they are
hopeful of peace but not in fear of war.
</P>
<P>
Osama Al Martu, who runs a watch shop in downtown Amman, told
Xinhua task force reporters, who arrived here Friday afternoon
from Beijing via Singapore and Bahrain, that he believed a war was
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Osama hoped that United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
could strike a peace deal with Iraq during his trip to Baghdad,
but was worried that Washington would find new excuses to use
force against Iraq even if the latter had accepted Annan's
requests.
</P>
<P>
The United States did not punish Israel when it occupied
territories of some Arab countries such as Palestine and Syria,
and refused to comply with relevant U.N. resolutions on the Middle
East issue, Osama recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Why on earth is Washington so determined to use force against
Iraq?" Osama asked.
</P>
<P>
Washington accused Iraq of hiding chemical weapons, he said.
But even kids knew that it was very dangerous to bomb places where
chemical weapons, if there was any, were stored.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua reporters that his brother was a university
student in Baghdad. Though his brother had no doubts that the
U.S. would launch an air strike on Baghdad, he had no plan to
leave there to seek shelter in Amman, Osama said.
</P>
<P>
In front a mosque in downtown Amman, a young man, Ahmed, said
that there was no reason for the U.S. to bomb Baghdad, and Iraqi
people were not afraid of a U.S. attack.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 1,000 people had gathered around the mosque
a week ago in protest against the United States.
</P>
<P>
United Nations employees and foreign embassy personnel in
Baghdad had begun to evacuate from the Iraqi capital before
Annan's arrival on Friday, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military buildup in the gulf continues as the first
group of a 384-strong ground force arrived in Kuwait. This will be
followed by the arrival of more than 5,000 soldiers in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign correspondents, who plan to go to Baghdad to cover
the Iraqi crisis, have been held up in Amman because of
difficulties in getting visas, and some have waited for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Xinhua task force reporters have accomplished all
the formalities and are set to leave for Baghdad on Saturday
morning.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Promote Internet in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is seeking to promote the use of
internet by common families of the developing countries, said a
official on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chuck Lankester, who is heading a sustainable development
network program in the UNDP, made the remark at a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is the fastest growing information distribution
facility in the world, with the number of its users doubling
almost every year since 1988, Lankester said.
</P>
<P>
But the Internet is not evenly spread throughout the world,
with the majority of users concentrated in the United States, he
said. The developing countries, however, are witnessing a very
slow development of this modern information network.
</P>
<P>
Lankester said that now, with the help of the UNDP, 35
countries have established an information network on sustainable
development and that 40 more countries are considering joining the
network.
</P>
<P>
What the UNDP seeking to do was to provide a kind of
liaison service for the information network, with discussion of
sustainable development as its major task, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lankester said that the UNDP was working with member states on
network designs with a precondition that governments were
committed to let everyone enjoy the information provided by the
network.
</P>
<P>
He said that until now the UNDP had discussed the matter with
about 100 governments, among which only three countries refused to
make such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
Lankester said he understands the concern of some countries
about allowing their citizens free access to the Internet. He
agreed there must be some restriction on violence and pornography
contents.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Railway Officials Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Bulgarian railway
officials have been sacked following an agreement between the
government and railway workers who had threatened to strike to
press for a pay hike.
</P>
<P>
The two dismissed officials were Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ)
Director Yordan Mirchev and Ivan Ivanov, chief of the Railway
Department of the Transport Ministry, the BTA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Mirchev's dismissal on Friday, Transport Minister
Wilhelm Kraus said a replacement had not been appointed yet.
</P>
<P>
The dismissals came a few days after a nationwide warning
strike of railway workers was prevented. The workers had
threatened to strike when the government refused to meet their
demand for a 20 percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The railway workers called off the strike alert after the two
sides reached an agreement on the pay rise. Mirchev and Ivanov,
however, became the victims of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Back in January, Kraus had expressed dissatisfaction with the
performance of the BDZ management, accusing it of delaying
structural reforms in the company.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seeks Help From G-7 to Solve Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the letter, Indonesia also asked the G-7 members to give a
"back-up guarantee" to its letters of credit (L/Cs) in particular,
official Antara News Agency Saturday quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia badly needed the back-up guarantee
particularly for its L/Cs because the country's exporters and
importers recently faced liquidity problems following the refusal
of their L/Cs abroad.
</P>
<P>
Regarding foreign debts, he said the Indonesian government was
hoping that there would be a positive response from the G-7
countries and they would also give their assistance.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's total foreign debts reached 137.424 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of last year, consisting of government debts of
63.426 billion dollars and private sector debts 73.926 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said Indonesia remained firmly committed to
the economic reform program agreed upon with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed an agreement on January 15 with IMF for
implementing economic reforms as a condition for a 43 billion
dollar bailout fund.
</P>
<P>
"The request for help form G-7 countries is not intended to
rival the IMF program. We just want to know if they have methods
that would help strengthen and stabilize the rupiah," he said.
</P>
<P>
"the move is only additional to the IMF program and aims mainly
to help the economy come out of the current crisis," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Public
Health will build water pipeline systems for rural residents to
cope with the drought expected this summer, the Bangkok Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of 865 village water pipelines, 1,000 artesian
wells and 99 water tanks with a total fund of two billion baht (44
million U.S. dollars) is aimed at providing clean drinking water
for villagers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the government is obliged to arrange
clean water despite high investment cost, since it is crucial for
avoiding health problems such as diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, some 181,790 people suffered from

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite the United Nations
chief's last-ditch effort for a diplomatic solution to the weapons
inspection crisis in Baghdad, United States President Bill Clinton
on Friday threatened again to use force for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The threat came amid further domestic opposition to
U.S. military attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a speech beamed to Arab and Muslim nations, Clinton repeated
the U.S. stand that once diplomacy fails, the United States would
resort to force to diminish Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
threat to his neighbors by reducing his capability of producing
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"If Saddam refuses to keep his commitments to the international
community, we must be prepared to deal directly with the threat
these weapons pose to the Iraqi people, to Iraq's neighbors and to
the rest of the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"If force proves necessary to resolve this crisis, we will do
everything we can to prevent innocent people from getting hurt."
Clinton stated. He added: "Saddam must bear full responsibility
for every casualty that results."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright advised
the families of U.S. officials and non-emergency staff of
diplomatic missions to leave Israel and Kuwait as a precaution
because of the heightened tensions between the United States and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin explained that the
decision was based on "anxieties" expressed by Americans in Israel
and Kuwait and not "on intelligence of an imminent threat against
Kuwait or Israel."
</P>
<P>
Private Americans planning to make non-essential trips to
Kuwait, Israel, the West Bank or Gaza should consider whether to
call them off, and Americans already in those areas should
consider whether to leave, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assessment remained that "the probability of Iraq
resorting to the use of chemical or biological weapons is remote
but cannot be excluded," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
However, the tough U.S. policies toward Iraq aroused further
opposition in the country.
</P>
<P>
When U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson was
making a speech on Iraq at the University of Minnesota, as part of
the Clinton administration's campaign to persuade the Americans to
support its policy on Iraq, he was jeered by protesters and forced
to abandon his half-finished speech.
</P>
<P>
About 150 demonstrators burst into the building, chanting, "No
blood for oil," "Hands off Iraq," "Clinton, Richardson you can't
hide, sanctions are genocide."
</P>
<P>
When Richardson said 75 percent of Americans supported that
position, protesters shouted, "Liar! Liar! Liar!"
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, a group of Arab-American leaders met with
Thomas Pickering, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs,
at the U.S. State Department, urging the administration not to use
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to oppose the use of military force and think that
there's a very significant risk of grave unrest in the Arab
world," James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute,
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group got mixed impressions from their meeting
with Pickering. Some said there was a way to see this situation
resolved diplomatically. But others said they got the feeling that
the military option is very strong.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, protests also occurred in Columbus, Ohio, when
Secretary of State Albright was giving a speech about the
administration's policies. She was heckled by demonstrators, who
shouted anti-war slogans.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Two large enterprises in
northwest China's Gansu and Shaanxi provinces have joined hands
recently as "partners of friendship" in an effort to better cope
with market risks.
</P>
<P>
The inter-provincial cooperation between the Huating Coal
Mining Area in Gansu and the Weihe Chemical Fertilizer Plant in
Shaanxi will help improve regional economic structure, increase
their market competitiveness, and promote common prosperity,
industry insiders predicted.
</P>
<P>
The mining area, which was listed as one of the country's
leading state projects in 1996, has a designed production capacity
of slightly over 10 million tons of coal annually, involving a
dynamic investment worth six billion yuan (723 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
By now, a total of 800 million yuan (96 million US dollars) has
been spent completing the Chenjiagou Mining Area with an annual
output of 450,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer plant, which was completed and became
operational in 1995, produces annually 300,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia, 520,000 tons of urea, and a dozen other products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the mine provided 240,000 tons of high-quality coal
for the fertilizer plant.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Muslim Leader Blasts U.S. Policy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- United States black Muslim
leader Louis Farrakhan blasted U.S. policy of threatening to
launch military attacks against Iraq as "insane".
</P>
<P>
He warned that U.S. attacks could turn the world's 1.5 billion
Muslims against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan made the remarks on his return to Chicago from a
global visit to Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Cuba and other nations.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters and hundreds of people gathered to welcome
him home that he had sent letters to both President Bill Clinton
and Saddam Hussein to avoid bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"I pleaded with Saddam Hussein to take the stick out of
America's and Britain's hands," Farrakhan said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his letter to President Clinton, he said he urged
the president not to use the lone superpower's might against iraq.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want the Muslim world against America. That's why
this is an unwise, insane position," he warned, citing the
potential wrath of the world's 1.5 billion Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"Those who live by the sword will perish by the sword,"
Farrakhan said, citing scripture in warning Americans against
supporting attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim leader explained his views on whether Americans
should be united behind Clinton's policy on Iraq. He said he had a
responsibility to speak out if he thought his government was wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I will not have the blood of American soldiers or the Iraqi
people on my hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan also challenged Clinton, or one of his Cabinet
members, to debate with him on the subject.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Outstanding in Water Conservancy Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Great changes have been
witnessed in water conservancy improvement over the past decade in
Guangdong Province, a booming economic power house in south China.
</P>
<P>
The province spent 29.2 billion yuan (3.5 billion US dollars)
in the past decade on water conservancy projects and construction
of hydropower stations, 12.4 billion yuan of which came from
townships and individual farmers.
</P>
<P>
It built 1,405 small hydropower stations and some major water
conservancy projects like the Tiantang Hill Reservoir, as well as
302 water supply facilities with a combined daily capacity of 1.46
million tons.
</P>
<P>
During the ten-year period, Guangdong Province also reinforced
or rebuilt more than 200 water conservancy projects and 180
embankments totalling 32,057 kilometers, and added a water storage
capacity of nearly one billion cubic meters and 53,000 hectares of
irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province improved 15,730 hectares of waterlogged
land and 5,000 square kilometers of soil erosion, greatly raising
its flood-resistant capability.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has so far worked out 11 water-related regulations to
guarantee an orderly water resources market. In the last decade,
it dealt with some 11,800 cases in violation of water supply
policies, and mediated and settle 5,454 water-related disputes.

STOCKHOLM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sweden would play a part in
a possible military strike against Iraq if United Nations
Secretary General Koffi Annan fails to make Iraq back down from
its present positions.

Sweden would take part in the possible strike in one way or

measures might be taken.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. resolutions on Iraq must be respected and implemented,
she stressed.
</P>

Sources from the Foreign Ministry said Sweden would not send
soldiers to Iraq, nor would it dispatch a 300-staff field hospital
to the Gulf as it did in 1991.

<P>
LIMA, Febreuary 20 (Xinhua) -- The meteorological phenomenon,
"El Nino", is estimated to have affected one percent of the total
agriculture cultivation of Peru, Fernando Cilloniz, General
Administrator of the Peru Foundation, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 hectares of agricultural land, located near the
banks of rivers, have been affected by overflows.
</P>
<P>
Cilloniz explained that "El Nino" would also have positive
effects on the agriculture for the next two or three years,
because water reservoirs were filling up.
</P>
<P>
He said agriculture and livestock exports would diminish 15
percent this year, compared with 1997 when they reached 811
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the downtrend in coffee prices also caused concern,
because coffee exports accounted for almost half of agriculture
exports.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Unveils New Bangkok Airport Building Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will spend 135.6
billion baht (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in building a new airport
in Bangkok in a bid to make it an aviation hub of the region, the
Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Upon its completion in 2003, the new airport, unofficially
known as Nong Ngu Hao, is expected to take over all aviation
activities of the capital in the long run, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol Sonakul, who heads a government committee studying
the investment pattern of the new airport project, said the
Airports Authority of Thailand (AAT) should set up a holding
company to operate the new airport as well as the existing one,
also known as Don Muang.
</P>
<P>
The AAT will hold 70 percent of shares of the company while the
private sector holding the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The firm will also ask Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund to finance 75 percent of all loans needed for the airport
construction, the official added.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity to serve 25 million passengers annually, the
Nong Ngu Hao airport will shoulder 70 percent of Bangkok's
expected 32.9 million passengers in 2003 and Don Muang the rest.
</P>
<P>
In the following 10 to 15 years, Don Muang would be closed and
Nong Ngu Hao, with its capacity expanded, would take over all
aviation activities of Bangkok.

TEHRAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wrestler Kevin Jackson won
the first gold medal in the free-style 85-kilograms category here
on Friday and became the first American athlete the local crowd
saw in a space of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
He beat Iranian rival Feridun Qambari 1-0 for a significant
victory which has marked a new break-through in their frozen
 sports exchange since the two countries broke relations in
1980. It is the first time for a U.S. sports team resting their
feet on Iran's land in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Jackson remained calm and used all of his skills against the
Iranian wrestler who was vocally supported by over 10,000 audience
the gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
Despite a slender victory over the Iranian, Jackson felt
quite satisfied with the result of the match.
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Jackson told Xinhua after winning the
match.
</P>
<P>
The American wrestler Melvin Douglas in the 97-kilograms on
Thursday also faced a strong challenge from Iranian wrestler Abbas
Jadidi since both of them are Olympic medallists.
</P>
<P>
Douglas tried to overcome his Iranian rival, But Qambari showed
more skills and battled Douglas down several times to win the gold
medal with strong support from the exciting Iranian audience who
shouted "Allah AKbar (God is the Greatest)" during the bout.
</P>
<P>
Along with Douglas, another American wrestler Zeke Jones in the
54km was tamed by an Iranian wrestler.
</P>
<P>
"People are happy to see the American team to win one gold and
two silvers in its first internatioal tournament held in Iran,"
one diplomat said after the match, adding that "it is good enough
for both Iran and the United States."
</P>
<P>
The United States sent five wrestlers to attend the Iranian
Takhti Cup international wrestling tournament, which was held
annually during the past 17 years to remember the Iranian
wrestling legend Gholamreza Takhti.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Major South China city
Guangzhou will adjust and improve its economic ownership structure
and rely more on foreign investment to maintain its bullish
economic momentum this year, a senior official said.
</P>

While further fortifying the share-holding position of
state-owned enterprises in fields that significantly concern the

re-organization in other fields or industries, Guangzhou
Vice-Mayor Chen Kaizhi was quoted as saying in today's China daily.

Chen said the strategy of encouraging the participation of the
non-state economic sectors, including privately-owned companies,
aims to keep well on track a batch of key industries, key
large-scale corporate groups and enterprises that specialize in
brand name or special product manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Minorities Adopt Family Planning Methods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- At an age when most rural
Chinese women are ready to have at least one male heir for the
family, Li Shuchun, who lives in an outskirtan village of Kunming,
the capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, made the rare
decision to have only one child when her daughter was born 13
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old member of the Yi minority seems quite contented
with her life today. With only one child to support, the family is
quite comfortable with its annual income of approximately 20,000
yuan (2,400 US dollars), a sharp contrast, she said, to her
childhood spent in a four-daughter family that only made several
hundred yuan. And now, her greatest hope is that her daughter will
be a college student, the first in the family.
</P>
<P>
Li is not the only person to have agreed with the one-child
plan. In this village of some 400 people, 14 couples have decided
not to have a second child, even though it is a right enjoyed by
ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Provincial family planning regulations note that urban couples
can have only one child no matter what their ethnic status,
whereas in rural areas, Han Chinese whose first-born is a daughter
can have a second child after a five-year interval, while ethnic
groups can have two children, and in border areas, ethnic minority
couples can have three.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has a population of 40.4 million and its 25 ethnic minorities
account for a third of that.
</P>
<P>
Because of a family planning policy that takes living standard
and traditions into account, and improved family planning
services, Yunnan's ethnic minorities have generally accepted the
family planning policy, according to Feng Lixue, deputy director
of the provincial family planning committee.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Han, many ethnic minorities do not prefer sons to
daughters, he added, and some ethnic groups like the Yi, Bai, and
Naxi have a higher average education level than the Han, which
makes them tend to accept modern child-bearing methods.

<TEXT>
<P>
Changing lifestyles in the countryside have reduced the need to
have more children, especially sons, which were needed by a
traditional farming culture, where family fortunes depend on the
number of hands available.
</P>
<P>
In Ala Township, said to be the No.1 Ethnic Township in Yunnan,
and in other more affluent counties and townships in the province,
the fields are no longer the primary source of income for rural
people.
</P>
<P>
With the government's open economic policy offering people more
opportunities, the men in Ala Township can find jobs paying more
than working the land does, like truck driving, construction, and
decoration, and women can still do most of the work in the fields.
</P>
<P>
To improve family planning services in rural areas, Feng said,
provincial authorities have set aside 80 million yuan (9.6 million
US dollars) for health care facilities for women and children,
training family planning workers, helping people learn more about
the population, marriage law, and child-bearing, and helping
child-bearing women choose the most suitable birth control methods.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 1.2 billion people and started its family
planning policy in the early 1980s to control the population,
which already put pressure on development and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
And, the family planning policy is not simply a one-child
policy, noted Shi Chunjing, an official who is in charge of policy
research, but included taking varying needs of different groups of
people into consideration when it was drawn up.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are no national family planning regulations
for ethnic minorities, and each province and autonomous region
formulated its own so that they accord with specific local
conditions, the family planning official said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Hit by Bad Luck in Uber Cup Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's fate doomed when
its ace player Marina Andrievskaya cried woefully with a
twisted knee, thus contributing greatly to its unexpected loss
in Uber Cup badminton qualifying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A 3-2 semifinal defeat to England means that Sweden,
second-seeded in both the Thomas and Uber Cup events, will have to
win a play-off for third place in the Uber Cup if they hope to
enter the world team finals.
</P>
<P>
Andrievskaya, a former Soviet international in her first Uber
Cup campaign for her adopted country, moved awkwardly for a deep
clear and collapsed amidst loud cries of pain while a game and 5-3
ahead against the English national champion Julia Mann.
</P>
<P>
Although Andrievskaya resumed with the knee strapped after an
interval of seven minutes, she was able to play only three more
points before falling again, lying motionless on the court, and
eventually being helped away with a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
This cost Sweden not only the opening singles but effectively
the number one doubles as well, because Andrievskaya could play no
part in that either.
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't our day. But we will have to sit down and talk
and work out a way of winning twice tomorrow," said Swedish coach
Claes Johansson stoically.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Panda Protection Base Accelerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- In a fresh effort to protect
giant pandas in China, Chengdu city government is working to push
forward the construction of the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and
Research Base.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the base in southwest China's
Sichuan Province is one of the four leading giant panda research
centers in the country. The others are in Beijing, Fuzhou of east
China's Fujian Province and Wolong of Sichuan Province,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
With dense bamboo bush and a clear spring, the base in Chengdu
houses 23 giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that there are no more than 1,000 giant pandas
living in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu authorities plan to complete the third-phase
construction of the base by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the third phase, the base will be
expanded from the current 35 hectares to 200 hectares, with a
special zone providing a natural habitat for the pandas to prepare
to return to the wild.
</P>
<P>
The whole project will cost some 450 million yuan (54 million
US dollars), half of which will come from the Chengdu municipal
government allocations and the rest is expected to come from
earnings from giant panda exhibitions and donations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects Washington's Call to Back Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
rejected Washington's call to support a possible military
offensive against Iraq as it does not want to put at risk the
safety of its nationals in the Middle East, the "Manila Standard"
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a top Foreign Department official as saying:
"We prefer a diplomatic solution to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
The government does not want to put at risk the safety of some
750,000 Filipinos working in the Middle East, said the official,
who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Stanley Roth approached Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon during an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting
held in Manila last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"He asked if we would give diplomatic support to the strike,
but the secretary said no because we have too many people there,"
said the official, adding that the government wants to avoid the
displacement of thousands of Filipinos working in the region like
what happened when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government Friday alerted Filipinos
in the Middle East to prepare for possible evacuation in case of
war between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre said that the government
placed some 750,000 Filipinos in Mideast countries at alert level
number one, which means they should prepare for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised embassies in the
region to draw up contingency plans for the possible evacuation of
Filipinos in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> NBA Referee Resigns amid Tax Scandal </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Mike Mathis became the
third National Basketball Association referee to resign in the
last twelve months on Friday when he pleaded guilty to tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
He has been a referee for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Mathis joined former referees George Toliver, Jess Kersey and
Hank Armstrong, all of whom were declared last year by the federal
government for unreported income.
</P>
<P>
Toliver and Kersey pleaded guilty and resigned last
August. Armstrong's case still is pending.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictments, the referees allegedly cashed in
their league-issued first-class airline tickets for coach class
tickets. They allegedly pocketed the difference and did not
report the income -- in some cases as much as 80,000 dollars over
a period of several years -- to the Internal Revenue Service.

<HEADLINE> Scientific Methods Effect Rise in Grain Output in Guizhou Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Mountainous Guizhou Province,
southwest China, has successfully applied a grain high-yielding
project to some one third of its grain grown acreages, and
resulted in a remarkable rise in its grain output.
</P>
<P>
Grain output remained low for so long in Guizhou, where rigid
mountainsides account for 87 percent of the grain areage. To feed
its 35 million people, the province had to purchase as much as
one million tons of grain a year from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
After profound and in-depth studies, farming experts of the
province cited local disadvantageous geographical conditions,
unfavorable climate, poor seed strains used and backward farming
methods as major reasons of the low grain output.
</P>
<P>
They then decided to adopt cross-breeding, and introduce the
use of plastic framework and transplanting of seedlings in
designated grain high-yielding demonstration areas in a bid to
address the main problems.
</P>
<P>
The experiments have turned out to be a great success. Over the
past five years, the province's annual grain output has climbed up
three stages of eight million, nine million and 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As part of the achievements, rice and maize output made up
56.79 percent of the province's total grain output in 1997, though
their grown acreage accounted for 43.6 percent of the total.

KIEV, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The heads of the Ukrainian and
Russian governments on Friday initialed a 10-year economic
cooperation program aimed at multiplying the two countries'
trade.
</P>
<P>
The program, signed here by Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and his Russian counterpart, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is
a major outcome of the latter's two-day working visit to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the two countries will cooperate more
closely in light industry, energy, aeronautics, space and the food
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told a news briefing that the program, the first
of its kind signed among the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), was "a great step forward" because it dealt with "all main
aspects of the economic relationships" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It would increase the two countries' trade by 150 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko also stressed the importance of the program,
saying that it fully reflects the urgent economic need and
interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, trade between Ukraine and Russia came to 15.3 billion
U.S. dollars, three billion less than the figure two year ago,
according to Interfax-Ukraine news agency.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The annual job fair opened on
Friday at Beijing's International Exhibition Center attracted
thousands of job-seekers in this capital city of China.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair has three parts -- a domestic enterprise
meeting, a foreign-funded enterprises meeting held yesterday and a
one-day special meeting for this year's university graduates which
will be staged tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Organizers estimated that at least 100,000 people would apply
for jobs during the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies, which usually pay a higher salary than
domestic companies, are obviously of more interest to
job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
This time some 300 foreign companies had presence, while the
number of domestic enterprises was 870.
</P>
<P>
An organizer said that market forces are leading more domestic
enterprises to switch to the job fair to hunt for the people they
need rather than wait for people assigned by government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong Development
Zone plans to give domestic foreign trade subsidiaries greater
freedom, according to customs offices, a move that will give the
zone a more important position in helping inland provinces with
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is a vital economic center in China's largest industrial
and commercial center, with 86 foreign trade companies set up by
other Chinese cities, provinces, and autonomous regions that
earned 200 million U.S. dollars in exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Both the central and municipal governments expect more companies
and more foreign trade transactions. Until June of last year, only
foreign trade companies that had 100 million U.S. dollars worth of
annual exports and manufacturers that had more than 20 million
U.S. dollars worth of annual exports could set up a foreign trade
subsidiary in the zone.
</P>
<P>
These limits have now been lowered to 50 million dollars and 10

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Trademark Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China is making substantial
progress in the protection of trademarks, with a legal system
fully developed in this sector, senior officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongfu, director of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce (SAIC), said in Beijing Friday that this development
has won praises from the world intellectual property rights
circles.
</P>
<P>
Wang was speaking at a seminar to mark the 15th anniversary of
the implementation of the trademark law, China's first law on
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the trademark law was put into effect in
March 1983, China has established a comprehensive legal system
relating to trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined the World Intellectual Property Rights
Organization in 1980, it has signed a series of international
intellectual property rights agreements and bilateral agreements
with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the top 10 countries in the world in
terms of trademark registrations in force, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The number of trademark registrations in force topped 860,000
last year compared with just 80,000 in 1982. Countries applying
for trademark registration in China increased from 26 in 1982 to
92 by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997, industry and commerce administrations around
the country investigated more than 180,000 cases of trademark
infringement. Fines of about 300 million yuan (36 million US
dollars) were imposed on violators, who were ordered to pay
compensation of about 28 million yuan (3.37 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Appeals to Save Line-Item Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
Friday appealed the Supreme Court a federal judge's decision
striking down the presidential line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear
argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before
the end of the term in late June or early July.
</P>
<P>
The line-item veto law, which took effect in January 1997,
allows the president to veto selected budget items five days after
signing a bill.
</P>
<P>
Congress may override a line-item veto by a simple majority
vote. But if the president vetoes the simple majority override, a
two-thirds majority is needed to override after that.
</P>
<P>
The law was challenged last year by a group of mostly
Democratic senators, but the Supreme Court dismissed the
challenge, saying President Bill Clinton had not yet used the
selective veto and therefore the group had no standing to bring
suit.
</P>
<P>
But another group of challengers, led by New York State, filed
suit, contending that the line-item veto is unconstitutional. New
York had standing because one of Clinton's line-item vetoes struck
out extra Medicare funding for the state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan struck
down the line-item veto law, saying it "impermissibly upsets the
balance of powers so carefully prescribed by (the Constitution's)
framers."
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, the Justice Department argues that the new
challengers also do not have standing to challenge the law, and
that in any case the law is in line with the historic relationship
between Congress and the president.

NEW YORK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended higher on
Friday with the Dow Jones industrial average up 38.36 points to
close at 8,413.94.

<P>
The 30-stock benchmark barometer declined in early trading due

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Qin on UN New "Oil-for-Food" Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- To gradually remove the
sanctions against Iraq is the only effective way for easing the
severe humanitarian situation in Iraq, Qin Huasun, Chinese
permanent Representative to the United Nations, stressed on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks at the Security Council before
it began to vote for a resolution which suggests to increase the
oil amount to be sold by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun said Iraq has been under UN sanctions for more than
seven years, and the humanitarian situation in the country has
continued to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the resolution will increase the amount of oil to be
exported by Iraq so as to increase the amount of humanitarian
supplies to be imported by the country, which china believes will
help to ease the present humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the oil-for-food program should proceed on
the premise of full respect for the sovereignty of Iraq. It should
be implemented strictly in accordance withe the memorandum reached
between the UN Secretariat and the Iraqi Government.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that after the adoption of the resolution, China
hopes that parties concerned will actively collaborate so that it
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He said China does not hope to see in the actual implementation
process any linkage of this humanitarian item with political
issues, and he urged parties concerned to expedite the review and
approval procedure and avoid any man-made delays so that the oil
export earnings could be converted into humanitarian supplies as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the present plan is merely a temporary measure for
easing the humanitarian situation in the country, Qin said, the
only effective way to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people
is to remove gradually the UN sanctions against the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports British, Irish on Kicking out Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
expressed on Friday his support for a decision by the governments
of Britain and Ireland to temporarily kick out Sinn Fein from the
multi-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's paramilitary wing, the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
was blamed for two recent murders in Belfast. The British and
Irish governments said Sinn Fein could return on March 9 if the
IRA did not engage in fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has not confirmed or denied involvement in the killings
but says a cease-fire it announced last July in a long campaign
against British rule in Northern Ireland remained intact.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the decision by Britain
and Ireland were "committed to an inclusive process, but one that
reaffirms that it is unacceptable to mix politics and violence."
</P>
<P>
"Peace in Northern Ireland is best served if all the political
leaders of Northern Ireland work to find common ground to make
common cause for peace," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I call on Sinn Fein to take the necessary steps to rejoin the
talks, and all the parties to reject violence," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright promised on Friday an emergency aid of five
million U.S. dollars to the Bosnian Serb government.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Albright, Bosnian Serb Premier
Milorad Dodik said he had also been promised some 45 million U.S.
dollars in extra aid for projects in his Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Dodik, who took office last month, "had a very good
businesslike discussion," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reperters.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright felt like a breath of fresh air had blown
through the room with regard to Bosnia," said Rubin
</P>
<P>
Rubin also praised Dodik for promising to help refugees from
Bosnia's 1992-95 ethnic war return home, and to help ensure that
indicted war crimes suspects face trial by an international
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"He promised to work intensively to facilitate voluntary
surrenders, but acknowledged that under any circumstances, all
(suspects) must face justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, at a news conference here, Dodik said he was
aiming to allow 70,000 Muslim and Croat refugees to return home by
September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he threatened to resign over lack of aid, saying
more than six million U.S. dollars he had been promised by the
international High Representative in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, to
avert a teachers' strike, had failed to arrive.

<HEADLINE> Arab-Americans Oppose Force Use on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. attack on Iraq
still seems "many days" away, said the Arab-American leaders after
they told the U.S. State Department of their strong opposition to
air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A group of Arab-American leaders met with Thomas Pickering,
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, at the State
Department, urging the administration not to use force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, President James Zogby of the Arab
American Institute told reporters that "there were some common
points of agreement but there were obviously significant points of
difference."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration threatens to bomb targets in Iraq if no
diplomatic solutions are found to resolve the Iraqi weapons
inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to oppose the use of military force and think that
there's a very significant risk of grave unrest in the Arab
world," said Zogby.
</P>
<P>
Despite the uncompromising tone of U.S. statements, Zogby said,
his group had got the impression from Pickering that Washington
remains many days away from making a decision on use of force.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. was genuinely giving U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is in Baghdad trying to avert a
war, a chance to reach a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
Annan's reports after his return from Iraq, first to the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and then to the
whole 15-member Council, would delay any decision to resort to
force, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we are still many days away from an evaluation as to
what the Secretary-General comes back with," he added.
</P>
<P>
"From what Under Secretary Pickering outlined for us, I believe
that there is, if we have the will, there is the way to seeing
this situation resolved diplomatically," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, other members of the group were less optimistic. "We
got the feeling, at least I got the feeling, that the military
option is very high," said Hala Maksoud, president of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has started a nation-wide campaign for
public support to its policies on Iraq while preparing a military
build-up in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Policy Makers Urge to Help Insurrection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of former U.S.
foreign and security policy makers on Friday urged the Clinton
administration to incite insurrection with Iraq to overthrow Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein rather than launch air strikes on the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq today is ripe for a broad-based insurrection. We must
exploit this opportunity," they told President Bill Clinton in a
letter released at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The group, representing conservative circles, includes 38
former defense secretaries, former national security advisers and
some assistant secretaries of state or defense. Most of them held
office under Presidents Ronald Reagan or George Bush.
</P>
<P>
The letter laid out a nine point plan for their proposed
insurrection.
</P>
<P>
They asked the Clinton administration to recognize a
provisional Iraqi government "based on the principles and leaders"
of the opposition Iraqi national Congress, to restore a safe haven
in northern Iraq and then help the provisional government run the
northern zone.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials will meet a delegation from the
opposition Iraqi National Congress later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has never recognized this loose
coalition as an alternative Iraqi government.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) U.S. Advises Official Families to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Friday advised the families of U.S. officials
and non-emergency staff of diplomatic missions to leave Israel and
Kuwait because of the heightened tensions between the United
States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on "anxieties" expressed by Americans in
Israel and Kuwait and not "on intelligence of an imminent threat
against Kuwait or Israel," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said private Americans planning to make non-essential trips
to Kuwait, Israel, the West Bank or Gaza should consider whether
to call them off, and Americans already in those areas should
consider whether to leave.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told a news briefing that the U.S. assessment remained
that "the probability of Iraq resorting to the use of chemical or
biological weapons is remote but cannot be excluded." During the
1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired Scud missiles at Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Kuwait are two of the a few countries supporting the
U.S. stand of threatened military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at a time when United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in Iraq as a last-ditch effort by
the U.N. diplomats to resolve the crisis over U.N. weapons
inspection in Iraq through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Keeping pressure on Iraq, U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday
warned Iraq to give U.N. inspectors free access to suspected
weapons sites or face the threat of military action. "Either
Saddam acts or we will have to," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been making diplomatic efforts to rally a
world coalition for its approach to the Iraq crisis, but it has
gained just about 20 countries' support to its potential military
operation against Baghdad as Rubin claimed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many countries including some key Gulf states such as Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain oppose any U.S. military attack against Iraq in
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's information minister on Tuesday said the emirate had
not approved use of its territory for military strikes against
Iraq while Saudi Arabia has refused to give permission to launch
attacks against Iraq from its territory, although more than 100
U.S. aircraft are based in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain is the home of
the Fifth Fleet and a base for about 40 U.S. warplanes.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Expelled from N. Irish Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, was formally expelled on Friday from the Northern
Ireland peace talks, party president Gerry Adams said.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to statements by police that Sinn
Fein's IRA allies carried out two recent Belfast murders.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein will be readmitted on March 9 if the IRA
maintains its truce, Adam told reporters in Belfast after meeting
with British and Irish ministers.
</P>
<P>
Adam also attacked what he called "a disgraceful decision" by
the two governments. "Sinn Fein has no case to answer," he added.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to seek urgent meetings with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
"We remain totally wedded to our peace strategy and the search
for peace," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said
the two governments would maintain contact with Sinn Fein during
the expulsion period.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said neither the British
nor the Irish government had taken any pleasure in agreeing the
ban.

<HEADLINE> Anti-US Demonstration held in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Turks staged a
demonstration on Friday in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul to
protest a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq, local TV
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration followed Friday prayers in the downtown
Beyazit mosque. Protesters shouted anti-U.S. slogans such as
"Murderer Americans" and "U.S.A., Get out of Incirlik" during the
rally.
</P>
<P>
They referred to the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey
which might be used by the U.S. warplanes to launch strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The base where dozens of U.S. F-15 and F-16 jets are stationed
served as an important base for air raids against Iraq during the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkish riot police, armed with riot shields and batons,
clashed with the protesters as they tried to disperse the
anti-U.S. demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 people were detained and several people injured,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
A similar protest was held in the capital of Ankara with the
participation of some university students. There were no reports
of any clash between protesters and police.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been calling on the Iraqi government to change
its stance in order to avert a possible military strike from
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Enhancing Health Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday stepped up efforts to enact a "patients' bill of rights"
by ordering all federal agencies take steps to extend such
protections.
</P>
<P>
The "bill of rights" Clinton endorsed in November would give
patients guaranteed access to specialists and emergency care, full
information on the quality of their doctors and plans and full
confidentiality of records.
</P>
<P>
A study finds many agencies on their own can enact large part
of the "bill of rights" affecting federal health plans, but that
Congress still must ensure the same protections are observed by
private health care plans.
</P>
<P>
"With the authority of the federal government, we will assure
that a third of all Americans are protected," news reports quoted
Clinton as saying before signing the order at a senior citizen's
center in suburban Wheaton, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's order imposes many of his proposed patient
protections for some 75 million Americans covered by federal
medical insurance programs including Medicare and Medicaid, and
other government health programs, as well as the nine million
federal workers and their families covered by government employee
health plans.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton noted his action still leaves more than
two-thirds of Americans with health coverage -- the nearly 180
million subscribers to private plans -- still lacking such
protections pending action by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an estimated 40 million Americans lack any health care
coverage at all.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ruling Party Urges Zanzibar Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The top leaders of the
Tanzanian ruling party have expressed concern over the
deterioration of political situation in Zanzibar as the
opposition party leaders there refuse to accept 1995 presidential
election results.
</P>
<P>
The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ruling party
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) said in a statement Friday that the
political tension will be eased if the opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) party leadership faces reality.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar -- comprising the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba in
the Indian Ocean, joined with mainland Tanganyika in 1964 to form
the United Republic of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under President Salmin Amour, claimed a narrow
victory over the CUF in the 1995 elections, but CUF questioned
the result.
</P>
<P>
Political situation has become tense in Zanzibar after 17
opposition activists, including CUF's deputy Secretary General
Nassor Seif, have been put in detention since last December on
sedition and treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The NEC meeting insisted that the 1995 presidential elections
were long over after winners were declared by electoral bodies
responsible for the polls.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the CUF's position of boycotting the house
for more than two years has given rise to political problems in
Zanzibar because many voters found them without representation.
</P>
<P>
The NEC said that it is ready for talks with other political
parties at any time, as long as such talks are helpful of
national interest and consolidating democracy.
</P>
<P>
Such talks, however, need time and proper preparations, the
NEC said, noting that opposition in multi-party politics is not
enmity but competition for control of state power through
policies and strategies of development.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Increase Oil Amount Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday decided to increase the oil amount Iraq
can export in a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the resolution of the Security Council which
was adopted unanimously, Iraq can sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil every 180 days, instead of the 2 billion dollars
worth of oil at the current stage.
</P>
<P>
The Council decided that the new "oil-for-food" plan will go
into effect after the Government of Iraq provides the Secretariat
with its new distribution plan of the humanitarian needs and get
the approval of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi
people who have been under the United Nations sanctions since
1990.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the security Council reaffirmed the
commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said it is convinced of the need as a temporary measure to
continue to provide humanitarian needs for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed the need to ensure respect for the
security and safety of all persons directly involved in the
implementation of this resolution in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Iraq to Accept U.N. Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey urged Iraq on Friday to
accept the proposals put forward by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in order to avert a military strike.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency quoted an official statement as
saying that Iraqi Charge d'affaires Saad Al Sammarrai was invited
to Turkish Foreign Ministry to discuss the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkish officials told the Iraqi
diplomat that Annan's visit to Baghdad might be the last chance
for a peaceful solution to the current Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The possible dangerous developments that will come up if
Baghdad refuses to accept Annan's suggestions were pointed out,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement, however, failed to disclose what the Iraqi
charge d'affaires said during the meeting with the Turkish
officials.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad Friday on a
peace mission to defuse the standoff between Iraq and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration, which beefed up strong military
forces in the Gulf region over the past weeks, has repeatedly
warned that a military strike will be carried out if Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein refuses to back down.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has urged all parties concerned to make every effort to
strive for a peaceful solution of the present crisis over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem visited
Baghdad to convey Turkey's position to the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, as a neighboring country of Iraq, has suffered huge
economic losses as a result of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says Ceasefire Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army's
political wing Sinn Fein said on Saturday that the ceasefire
remained intact despite a massive bombing in Northern Ireland
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb exploded outside a police station in the
predominantly Protestant town of Moira, southwest of Belfast,
injuring 11 people. The incident took place just hours after Sinn
Fein's expulsion from the multi-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he "regretted" the bombing at
Moira, and called for an end to all armed actions.
</P>
<P>
"We warned that there would be groups or individual...who would
do their best to keep us out of the peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior Sinn Fein official said his party may
refuse to return to Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that we have not decided to return to the
talks," Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told BBC
radio.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was banned from the multi-party peace talks Friday by
the British and Irish governments for IRA's involvement in two
killings recently in Belfast. It could be readmitted to the talks
on March 9 on condition the IRA refrains from further terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he had requested meetings with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Irish Premier Bertie Ahern to discuss its
expulsion from the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have lost credibility over the events of recent
weeks," McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that "Sinn Fein is not going to give up on its
peace strategy and is going to work for a more effective peace
process."

TOKYO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi left here for Moscow on Saturday for a three-day visit in a
bid to lay the groundwork for the early conclusion of a bilateral
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Obuchi and his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov will chair their first meeting of a joint
commission aimed at inking the treaty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up in January in line with unofficial
summit talks between Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin last November.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also plans to meet with Yeltsin to fix a schedule for
the Russian president's visit to Japan in April.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is also expected to attend a meeting of a
Japan-Russia government committee on trade and economy to promote
a bilateral economic cooperation plan agreed to by Hashimoto and
Yeltsin during their November meeting.

</P>
<P>
-- Definitely optimistic about a diplomatic solution to the
Iraqi crisis, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan will
prolong his stay in Baghdad until Monday in order to discuss the
enlargement of the ``Oil for Food'' program with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States has shown flexibility over the
method of inspection of Iraqi presidential sites. The U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said Friday that Washington does
not oppose adding some diplomats to the UNSCOM inspection teams,
on the condition that UNSCOM inspectors have access to all
presidential sites suspected of hiding chemical and biological
weapons, and they retain "operational control" of the inspections.
</P>
<P>
-- The fear of "a biological apocalypse" is sweeping the United
States after the FBI arrested two rightwing extremists for owning
poisonous biological materials such as anthrax. William Job and
Wayne Harris, who were arrested Wednesday night in the suburb of
Las Vegas, were militants in the organization called "Aryan
Nation," an extreme-right group established in the western state
of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Both United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz Friday said they were "reasonably
optimistic" about the perspective of a diplomatic solution to the
crisis. As a gesture of good will, Iraq allowed for UNSCOM
inspectors to enter some presidential sites for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United States President Bill Clinton made an
address to the Arab countries on Friday He accused Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein of not caring about his people and promised that

<HEADLINE> Oman Calls Annan to "Carefully Listen" to Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Oman said Saturday that
Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan "should listen
carefully" to Iraq's opinions about Implementation of
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Foreign Minister Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abudullah said
Oman considered Annan's visit to Baghdad as a mediation for a
peaceful settlement to the standoff between Iraq and the U.N. over
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions related to dismantling
weapons of mass destruction in that country.
</P>
<P>
"Annan should listen carefully to the Iraqi opinions in the
framework of U.N. resolutions," the foreign minister told the
official Omani news agency Saturday morning before his departure
for Iran on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country hoped Annan will succeed in his
mission to help end the current crisis between the U.N. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's decision in October to
bar U.N. arms inspectors from entering suspected sites of
containing chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have warned Baghdad would face a punitive
military action in case of contingency diplomatic efforts fail to
make Iraq allow the U.N. inspectors full and free access to those
suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
To avert the possible use of force against Baghdad, Annan
went for Iraq Friday in his widely believed last-ditch efforts
to persuade Iraq to back down.
</P>
<P>
Oman said Friday in a statement issued coinciding with Annan's
visit to Baghdad that the Iraqi authorities "should treat Annan's
trip as an opportunity to avoid bloodshed and damage."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the U.S. government warned that if Annan's trip
to Iraq fails, the U.S. troops in the Gulf region "must be and is
prepared to act."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Saturday urged Iraq to take the opportunity offered by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's visit to find a political
solution to the crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Annan's mission provides the last chance for a peaceful
solution, and Iraq should heed the warning and seize this
opportunity and agree to U.N. demands, Kinkel was quoted as saying
by the German press agency DPA.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel meanwhile stressed that no compromise could be expected
in the U.N. demand for unrestricted arms inspections and total
destruction of all potentially hidden depots of weapons of mass
annihilation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan had the complete support of Germany and of the European
Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kinkel expressed welcome to the U.N. Security
Council decision to allow Iraq to increase its oil exports to buy
humanitarian goods.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Carrying Dead Infants Rally Against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Carrying dead infants in arms,
thousands of Iraqis Saturday gathered at the Martyrs Square of
Baghdad to protest the U.S. anti-Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
Some 62 infants' bodies were laid there as evidence of effect
of U.N. imposed sanctions against this Gulf state for more than
seven and a half years.
</P>
<P>
These infants died due to shortages of medicine and foodstuff,
said people at the square, adding that the sanctions have claimed
over 1 million infants in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Angry people said the United States should be responsible for
the deaths of these infants, for it has been blocking the lifting
of the sanctions and prolonging the suffering of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is again warning of military attack on Iraq
despite that Iraq has implemented all relevant U.N. resolutions
and that the whole world, except one or two countries, rejects
the use of force against Iraq," said one young man there.
</P>
<P>
He added that more infants will die if the United States
should turn their warning into reality.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Expand Opening Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to open wider to overseas investors as part a
strategic move to invigorate its economy, a provincial leader said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizheng, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China, told participants in a conference on
opening up that overseas investments have played an important role
in the province's economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, one of China's oldest industrial bases, is home to 10
percent of the nation's medium-sized and large state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wen said the influx of overseas funds has provided a major
source of investment in fixed assets, He noted that overseas funds
accounted for nearly 26 percent of Liaoning's total investments in
fixed assets in 1997, and stressed that the figure has
consistently remained above 20 percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province will turn to overseas investors for some
33 percent of total investments needed to maintain economic
growth and reform state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We must open wider and rely on markets both home and
abroad," said Wen.
</P>
<P>
The 6,872 overseas-funded enterprises in Liaoning created one
million jobs and provided employment for five percent of the
provincial labor force in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's 1997 foreign trade volume hit 15 billion US dollars,
a level attributed to the province's continuous opening efforts.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 industrial output value for foreign-funded enterprises
reached 60 million yuan, 17 percent of the provincial total, said
Wen.
</P>
<P>
Economists and trade experts attending the conference noted
that Wen's remarks will be conducive to accelerating Liaoning's
opening and economic development efforts.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany, Poland Hold Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
POZNAN (Poland), February 21 (Xinhua) -- A one-day summit
between Poland, France and Germany is being held here Saturday to
promote cooperation in Poland's westward integration.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski, French President
Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were due to hold
a one-hour formal meeting at noon local time, which was followed
by an informal meeting shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders were also due to give a joint press
conference at 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It is the first trilateral summit held after foreign ministers
of the three nations launched the Weimar Triangle mechanism in
1991 in the eastern German city of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism is a forum for political leaders of the three
nations to promote contacts and to pave the way for Poland's
integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Poland is among the three Eastern European countries that were
invited to join the NATO in 1999. The other two are Hungary and
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The admission still needs to be approved by parliaments of all
the 15 current NATO members this year.
</P>
<P>
Poland is also one of the five Eastern European countries with
which the EU is due to start membership negotiations at the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
Since Poland is the largest among those Eastern European
countries seeking NATO and EU membership, French and German
officials said earlier that better coordination between Paris,
Bonn and Warsaw is very important even after the country's
admission into the EU and NATO.

and sprinted to outskate Yang in the finishing line with the advantage
of one foot.
</P>
<P>
"I have done all I can in the race," said the Chinese skater. "I
was in the leading position till the final sprint. I was almost worn
out and I even could hardly to stretch my legs."
</P>
<P>
Chun was left behind in the first eight laps, but managed to use
her power to sprint in the final.
</P>
<P>
"In short track, we are competing against each other, not againt
clock. I must save energy for the final sprint," she explained about
her victory in the post race press conference.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Chinese skaters lost to South Korean
rivals at the finishing line. In the men's 1,000m race on Tuesday,
China's Li Jiajun was overskated by South Korea's Lee Dong-sung in the
finishing sprint.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (s) was timed 1:43.343 for the silver and another South

to be content with five silvers and one bronze.
</P>
<P>
"Our skaters have done their best," Zhu said after the final event.
</P>

<P>
Ten American wrestlers left here early Saturday morning after
winning one gold and two silver medals in the tournament marking
the 19th anniversary of the 1989 Islamic Revolution. This was the
first such visit in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
Washington broke off relations with Tehran after radical
Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy and took the staffers
hostage in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The American team's visit here is seen as a "wrestling
diplomacy" which might bring about a thaw in the icy relations
between the two sworn enemies.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that more contacts will follow in the
future to work out a less-hostile atmosphere before any serious
government-to-government dialog can take place.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Announces National Education Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif announced here Saturday a draft of the National
Education Policy for 1998-2010 to elicit people's suggestions and
opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Promotion of education remains the top priority of the present
government," said Sharif while presenting the draft at the
inaugural session of the National Education Convention.
</P>
<P>
Announcing various steps to achieve universal primary
education, Sharif said that the present 2.2 percent allocation of
the gross national product for education would be gradually
increased up to four percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
He said 5.077 trillion rupees (about 115.4 billion U.S.
dollars) will be made available for the promotion of education
during 1998-2010. Of this money 228 billion rupees (about 5.2
billion dollars) will be spent to promote primary education.
</P>
<P>
A total of 75,000 non-formal primary schools will be set up by
the Prime Minister's Literacy Commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the educational policy, Sharif said, 45,000 primary
schools both in urban and village centers would be set up, and
100,000 teachers will also be appointed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said teaching of science, economics and
other subjects will be made compulsory in all the religious
educational institutions across the country.
</P>
<P>
There will be an effective monitoring system and the Federal
Cabinet will review the progress every three months, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Literacy rate in Pakistan was 15 percent in 1945 and despite
lapse of half a century it reached only 29 percent at present.
This increase in national literacy level was just half percent
annually while the increase in educational budget had been just
0.7 percent, according to Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy the enrollment rate is expected to be raised
from the present 45 percent to 65 percent in middle schools and 31
percent to 48 percent in high schools.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif said subjects of telecommunications, computer,
petroleum, textile and agriculture would be introduced at the
secondary education level. The purpose was to enable students to
use the Internet. He said district model schools would be utilized
for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
He said to meet the present day needs, the policy would
envisage special training programs both in business and industrial
sectors. The technical training, he said, would be harmonized with
the industrial requirements of the day.
</P>
<P>
On higher education, the existing higher institutions of
learning in big cities were imparting education just to 2.6
percent of the people, which is insufficient to fulfill the
present day requirements.
</P>
<P>
Under the new education policy this percentage would be
increased up to 10 percent, he said .
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked the private sector in the country to
play an active role in realizing the desired results in education.
</P>
<P>
The government would encourage establishment of educational
institutions by the private sector, he said.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Germany Assures Leading place in Medal Standing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany assured its leading
place in medal standing after winning two gold medals on the
penultimate day of the 18th Olympic Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After their biathletes won the men's biathlon 4x7.5km relay earlier
in the afternoon, the German sleders added the second title in the
four-men bobsleigh.
</P>
<P>
The German biathletes, composed of Rico Gross, Peter Sendel, Sven
Fischer and Frank Luck repeated their Olympic golden success at Nozawa
Onsen.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the race, the German team has led most of the
way, except in the second leg when it slipped to second behind Latvian
Ilmars Bricis.
</P>
<P>
The German team then regained the lead and crossed the finish line
in a time of 1:21:36.2.
</P>
<P>
The silver medal went to Norway with 20.1 seconds behind. Russia
finished third at 1:22:19.3.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Langen led his German team to win the four-man bobsleigh
after three runs with a total of two minutes and 39.41 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The German team, gold medal winners of the event in Lillehammer,
led each of the first two runs, but managed only the eighth-fastest
time in the third and final run. Luckily enough, the position did not
deny them the gold.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland took the silver in 2:40.01. France and Britain tied
for bronze with identical time of 2:40.06.
</P>
<P>
Another gold decided on snow was bagged by Norwegian Hans-Peter
Buraas in the men's slalom. The up-and-coming Norwegian skiier came
from behind to lead a 1-2 finish for the country.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Buraas, who dyed his hair red before going into the
race, clocked a two run combined time of one minute and 49.31 seconds
for his first victory in a major international competition.
</P>
<P>
Buraas placed second after the first run and then turned a
0.22-second deficit against first-round leader Austrian Thomas Sykora
into a convincing victory, witha 1.33 second winning margin.
</P>
<P>
Ole Furuseth moved up from third to win the silver in 1:50.64.
Sykora failed to convert hs first-un lead and settled for the bronze
at 1:50.68.
</P>
<P>
Italian skiing legend Alberto Tomba, bidding to become the first
Alpine skiier to win medals in four consecutive Olympics, withdrew
from the second run after placing 17th in the first run.
</P>
<P>
In the men's giant slalom on Wednesday, Tomba crashed seconds after
setting off from the first gate.
</P>
<P>
The short track speed skating competitions concluded after winners
of final three events were decided in the White Ring ice rink Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 500m final, Japanese Takafumi Nishitani became a
surprising winner with a clocking of 42.862 seconds. China's An
Yulong was second at 43.022 and another Japanese Hitoshi Uematsu came
in third at 43.713.
</P>
<P>
Canadian quarttet skated to their best in the men's 5,000m relay,
winning the title at seven minutes and 6.075 seconds. South Korea,
pre-race favourite, was second at 7:06.776 and China finished third at
7:11.559.
</P>
<P>
The women's 500m race final became a South korea-China dual. From
the starting line, China's Yang Yang (s) took the leading position.
But in the final sprint, she was outskated by defending champion South
Korea's Chun Lee-kyung by a advantage of one foot.
</P>
<P>
Chun Lee-kyung was clocked one minute and 42.776 seconds for the
crown and Yang Yang (s) collected her third silver medal at 1:43.343.
</P>
<P>
Another South Korean Won Hye-kyung was third at 1:43.361.
</P>
<P>
China's Yang Yang (a), who set a new world record of 1:31.991 in
the quarter-finals, was disqualified for pushing in the final.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the bronze medal of the men's ice hockey
tournament, Finland defeated Canada 3-2.
</P>
<P>
After 15 day competitions, Germany collected 12 golds, nine silvers
and eight bronzes to lead the medal standing. Norway, with nine
golds, 10 silvers and five bronzes, was second and Russia was third at
9-5-2.
</P>
<P>
There are two events left for Sunday, the closing day of the games.
Norwegians and Finnish are favoured to win the men's cross country
skiing 50km free in the morning and Russia will vie for the gold of
the men's ice hockey against Czech Republic in the afternoon.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With U.S. military forces poised for action against Iraq,
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan landed in Baghdad Friday
afternoon. He is there to make a last-ditch effort to negotiate a
peaceful end to the standoff between Iraq and the United States
over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Dublin and London expelled Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, from peace talks until March. It will be allowed to return
if the IRA is not involved in violence in the meantime. Hours
after the expulsion, however, a bomb exploded in a Protestant
village.
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia has retreated from a plan to peg its currency at
an artificial rate to the U.S. dollar after sharp criticism from
the International Monetary Fund and others.

<HEADLINE> Relaxed Popov Wins Title at World Cup Swimming in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A relaxed Alexandre Popov
won his speciality event of men's 100 meters freestyle with
surprisingly easy efforts as the 1998 FINA Swimming World Cup Hong
Kong opened here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With an impressive field including six current world record
holders, 10 world champions and 20 world championships medalists,
Saturday witnessed a comparatively calm day at the indoor swimming
pool in the Kowloon Park.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, the fourth here in a row, has attracted 139
swimmers from 20 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Germany came out as the biggest winners on the opening day,
with a grab of six out of the 17 gold medals on offer.
</P>
<P>
Australia, who took the top honor for team performance at last
year's event, came second with three golds, followed by Ukraine
and Denmark each with two, and Japan, Britain, Russia and Belarus
each winning one.
</P>
<P>
Hottest individual at the two-day event with his Olympic Games
and world championships titles, not to say world records, Popov
took the 100-meter freestyle title on Saturday in a time some two
and a half seconds slower than his world mark.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was not so serious today," he admitted after the
victory.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Sandra Volker became the day's top performer after
taking the women's 50 meters backstroke and 50 meters freestyle
events.
</P>
<P>
But his male teammate Mark Warnecke was not so glamourous
although he won the 50 meters breaststroke event, of which he
keeps the world record. His time of 27.60 seconds was more than
half a second slower than his world mark.
</P>
<P>
The Germans also took the men's 400 meters individual medley
and women's 200 meters freestyle events.
</P>
<P>
Two of Australia's three gold medals today came through efforts
by Geoff Huegill, a bronze medalist at the Perth world
championships. He won the men's 100 meters backstroke and 50
meters butterfly events. He said he had not expected to win both
titles.
</P>
<P>
China's Chen Yan, 17, was one of the most media-targeted
swimmers here, for her four-gold performance at last year's Eighth
National Games in Shanghai and two world records to her credit.
She then took two gold and one silver medals in the world
championships last month in Perth.
</P>
<P>
But she is competing in two butterfly events here, to the
surprise of many.
</P>
<P>
Chen only finished third in the 100 meters butterfly on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Nian Yun and another female swimmer also named Chen Yan
won the silver medals i the women's 50 meters freestyle and 200
meters individual medley.
</P>
<P>
Their male teammate Pan Licong took the bronze medal in the
men's 200 meters butterfly event.

The two-stage 5H-2 rocket blasted off from Tanegashima Space
Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, about 1,000 kilometers southwest
of Tokyo, at 4:55 p.m. (local time), and released the satellite
into space about 30 minutes after the lift-off, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the satellite, called COMETS, could not enter geostationary
orbit 36,000 KM above Earth as scheduled due to the second-stage
rocket failure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Space Development Agency of Japan
(NASDA) said it is unable to determine the satellite's current
orbital route. The cause of the failure is under investigation,
said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident marks the first failure of an H-2 rocket, Japan's
first major rocket developed entirely with domestic technology.
</P>
<P>
The 46.2 billion yen (about 366 million U.S. dollars), 2.2-ton
satellite carries a mobile antenna that measures 3.6 meters in
diameter, and advanced mobile communications equipment. It is one
of the world's largest satellites.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was to be used to develop technology for relaying
communications between observation satellites in low-earth orbits
and ground stations via relay satellites in geostationary orbit.
</P>
<P>
The launch was initially scheduled for Friday, but was
postponed because of bad weather.

<HEADLINE> Brunel Sunergy Sails Up to Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Brunel Sunergy vaulted into
second after it sailed past five boats en route in the Whitbread
round-the-world race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rounding the Falkland Islands, Brunel Sunergy, skippered by
Dutch Roy Heiner, risked to take the east of the Islands while
five of the six boats ahead were becalmed in a windless patch to
the west.
</P>
<P>
The far-to-be-reached EF Language maintained its lead in around
500 miles away before the closest chaser.
</P>
<P>
The main part of the fleet later escaped the windless
conditions and set off in hot pursuit of Brunel Sunergy, which
gained a 47-mile advantage in Heiner's gamble.
</P>
<P>
The previously luckless Brunel Sunergy finished bottom or
almost bottom in the previous four legs and had only two boats
behind prior to the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
The fifth leg of the race is a 6,670-mile trip from Auckland to
Sao Sebastiao in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Former President Visits Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
Saturday on a landmark 10-day official visit, according to reports
from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul Aziz, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal and
other senior officials, the Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such visit by a top Iranian leader since 1979
when the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution sent the two
countries' relations to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president, accompanied by a high-powered
delegation, is expected to hold talks with King Fahd on a host of
issues, especially on the Iraq-U.N. standoff over the weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Iranian embassy in Riyadh were quoted as
saying that Rafsanjani is due to raise the issue of instability
on the oil market and the role of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Organization in remedying this situation.
</P>
<P>
Tehran would work towards maintaining stable prices and thus
protecting the interests of member states, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani will also touch on improving bilateral relations
between the two big Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The past two decades saw strained ties between Iran and its
Gulf Arab neighbors, mainly over the presence of Western forces in
the Gulf, Tehran's arms-strengthening program and its advocated
export of Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
However, their relations have been warming up since last year's
elections brought to power a moderate clergyman, Mohammed Khatami,
by a landslide to succeed the pragmatic Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Iran said the strategy of Khatami's government is to develop
good neighborly relations on all spheres with the Gulf Arab states
and in particular with Saudi Arabia, whose cooperation is seen as
vital for stability in a region that has more than two-thirds of
the world's oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit held last
December in Kuwait welcomed Iran's friendly gestures, but
requested Tehran to translate words into deeds.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani and Khatami have been working hard to improve the
links with Saudi Arabia and its GCC allies - Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates .
</P>
<P>
In March 1996, then President Rafsanjani met with Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah on the sidelines of an Islamic summit in
Islamabad, Pakistan. He was invited by Abdullah to visit Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd has received three letters from Khatami in less
than four months dealing with bilateral relations and regional
stability. The most recent was delivered last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi visited Saudi Arabia
last November as part of a tour of all the six GCC states to
persuade their presence at the December Islamic summit in
Tehran. The summit proved to be a diplomatic victory for Iran.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe Rafsanjani's trip will serve as a milestone
in the progress of bilateral relations between the two largest
Gulf countries.

<HEADLINE> UAE's Humanitarian Aid Arrives in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A United Arab Emirates (UAE)
plane carrying 40 tonnes of medicine, rice and children's milk
arrived at the Saddam International Airport here Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first batch of 230 tonnes of supplies from the UAE,
the largest Arab contribution of humanitarian relief and medicines
to the Iraqi people, aimed at easing their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that a UAE plane landed in Iraq since the
U.N. sanctions were imposed seven years ago. The plane will be
followed by another loaded with the same quantity of foodstuff and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine UAE refrigerated trucks carrying 150 tonnes of
humanitarian aid are on their way for Baghdad via Jordan. The
trucks set off from the UAE last Thursday, according to UAE's
official news agency Wam.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport here, Khalifa Naser Al-Sowaidi,
board chairman of the UAE Red Crescent Association, told reporters
that the consignments of the two aircraft are a manifestation of
the position adopted by UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan against the continuation of sanctions against Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
A female member of the delegation said the delivery was
initiated by the UAE Red Crescent Association and its Women
Committee, under instructions from Sheikha Fatema Bent-Mubarak,
wife of the president.
</P>
<P>
The six members of the delegation went directly from the
airport to the Saddam Central Pediatric Hospital to see for
themselves the suffering of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
The delivery came amid worsening Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms
inspections. The U.S. and Britain have threatened a military
strike if diplomatic efforts failed to persuade Baghdad to grant
U.S. arms inspectors full access to all suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is on his
last-ditch mission to mediate a peaceful settlement of the crisis
and avert a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has called for defusing the crisis through diplomatic
means instead of military attacks. It was the first and only Gulf
Arab country openly opposing the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Al-Nahyan has repeatedly urged for normalizing Arab
relations with Iraq and lifting the seven-year-old sanctions on
Iraqi people.
