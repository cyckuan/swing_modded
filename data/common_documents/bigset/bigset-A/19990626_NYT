AS USUAL, KINGS WILL PICK ATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ hen the Los Angeles Kings traded with the New
York Islanders for star forward Ziggy Palffy six days ago, they set
themselves up for one of their typical draft days.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if your interest in the draft is focused on the
Kings, drag out your rocking chair, put your feet up and drift in
and out of consciousness today when the action begins in Boston.
Today, for the 22nd time in the 33 drafts in which the Kings have
participated, they will be without their first-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' first pick won't come until the second round, 43rd
overall, a compensatory selection awarded them when they chose not
to sign forward Matt Zultek, a player they chose in the first round
two years ago. Theoretically, the Kings could select Zultek again
today, if he's still available when their turn arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' other nine selections in the nine-round draft will be
74th, 76th, 92nd, 104th, 125th, 133rd, 193rd, 222nd and 250th. If
the Kings are to find a budding Gretzky today, they will have to do
so the old-fashioned way: by unearthing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Mighty Ducks, on the other hand, still have their
first-round selection, the 15th pick. The Ducks also will choose
48th, 83rd, 105th, 141st, 173rd, 201st, 230th and 258th.
</P>
<P>
   This draft will have a decidedly European flavor, with roughly
half of the first 20 players chosen expected to be non-North
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, which selected center Vincent Lecavalier first
overall last year, once again has the opening selection.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary circumstances, Long Beach Ice Dogs center Patrik
Stefan probably would be the automatic first choice, but his
concussions have clouded the issue. The Lightning could choose
Stefan, but right wing Pavel Brendl, a native of the Czech
Republic, might be a safer bet. Brendl had 134 points in 68 games
playing junior hockey in Calgary, scoring 73 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you,'' Lightning scout Don Murdoch
recently told the Toronto Sun. ``We have a list of four players,
and they are Brendl, the Sedin twins (Daniel and Henrik, of
Sweden), and Patrik Stefan. We already have Vincent Lecavalier, who
is a hell of a playmaker, so could you imagine Brendl playing with
him? But nothing is etched in stone, and we probably won't make our
decision until (this morning).''
</P>
<P>
   Next will come the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, followed by the
Vancouver Canucks. If Stefan doesn't wind up with the Lightning, it
is very likely he will be chosen by one of these teams.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor has the Thrashers completing a trade with the Canucks
and Chicago Blackhawks that would enable them to select both Sedins
_ left wing Daniel and center Henrik. The Sedins have hinted it's
possible they will hold out if they don't both wind up with the
same team.

KAYAKER'S ORDEAL ON COLORADO'S SOUTH FORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two weeks ago, on June 12, as Paul Bratton
and six friends put their kayaks in Colorado's South Fork River,
one hour north of Denver, Bratton suddenly felt a peculiar
reluctance to continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after noon, and it was chilly. Heavy clouds hung low
in a darkening sky. Sleet was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I won't do it today, thought Bratton, 31, a former
emergency medical technician with Metropolitan Ambulance Services
Trust and now an emergency-room nurse at Baptist Medical Center in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But he shrugged off the feeling as irrational.
</P>
<P>
   And so he headed downstream, one of seven kayakers, each paying
careful attention to the water, knowing if he didn't, he could be
up against it.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton loves that part of kayaking, a sport he took up in 1993.
He enjoys the respect demanded by a fast river, the teeth-gritting
rush of adrenaline that comes with facing white water and steep
drops.
</P>
<P>
   And that exhilaration has been matched by a growing love of the
wilderness, a desire to see and feel things he can't experience
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   That morning's run promised to be fairly easy, just a few hidden
rocks, he thought. But it would be beautiful, real wilderness, no
dams, no roads, no paths, no exit for 12.4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   And he soon grew comfortable in his kayak, relaxing, loosening
his muscles, enjoying the power of the racing water pushing him
along.
</P>
<P>
   Be cautious, he thought. Don't relax too much. Watch for fallen
pines. Be alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know fear,'' he and his buddies say to each other. ``Because
the river can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   After two hours they ``eddied out,'' clustering together in a
fairly calm pool on the downstream side of a large rock. There they
exchanged information about the river ahead.
</P>
<P>
   When they pushed off again, Bratton was last in line.
Trapped
</P>
<P>
   Fifty feet downstream from the eddy pool, the river made a turn.
Within seconds, Bratton's friends were out of sight. He was alone.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later he felt his kayak scrape a submerged rock.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, man, I boofed that one, he thought, using a kayaker's term.
</P>
<P>
   The rock jarred his boat sideways. He boofed another invisible
rock, lost control, then came to a sudden, jarring halt against ...
something.
</P>
<P>
   He was broached, turned sideways against the water.
</P>
<P>
   Almost reflexively he leaned downstream, tipping his kayak away
from the oncoming current.
</P>
<P>
   If I lean upstream the river will flood my boat, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   He felt the obstacle with his right hand, realized it was a
large, submerged tree branch with two limbs at the end.
</P>
<P>
   He was pressed against both limbs, the upper grabbing at the lip
of his boat's cockpit, the lower grasping at his kayak from below.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the tines of a huge wooden fork, held there by the
force of the water, pinned like a beetle on a cork.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't move. And he knew the river could push him under at
any moment, batter him, drown him.
</P>
<P>
   He felt the leading edge of panic, recognized it, fought it
down.
</P>
<P>
   No, he said to himself, think of how to get out.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly instinctive, that thought, part of his training,
not only as a kayaker but as an emergency medical technician and a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   In any emergency he was trained to think sequentially: What do I
do now? What do I do next?
</P>
<P>
   He felt his kayak sinking, and he was trapped in it, couldn't
get free. The upper limb had punctured the spray skirt over his
cockpit. Water was pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed that limb with his right arm, hooked it with bicep
and forearm, held himself up, felt the terrible power of the racing
water strain his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to shimmy out, rocking with his hips, seeking to unlock
the tree's hold.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was moving sideways. Worse. The river smashed against his
side, pinning him harder against the log.
</P>
<P>
   He felt the frigid water race across his legs, numbing him,
slowing him.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his paddle, saw it sweep downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, God, he thought, this is like a routine ambulance run that
turns into a nightmare. You expect to find someone with a minor cut
and instead find bodies scattered everywhere. Your thinking's
scrambled, and if you don't fine-tune, you lose it all.
Sense of helplessness
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, he was submerged to his armpits in freezing
water, his legs pinned, his right arm aching from just hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   He feared hypothermia, feared losing his ability to think
quickly, rationally.
</P>
<P>
   He searched for an analogy, some way to make sense of what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being in a happy relationship, he thought, and all of
a sudden your lover says goodbye, won't talk to you, won't explain.
</P>
<P>
   And that's it. That's the end. Bam, like that. Everything I took
for granted is over, and I can't do a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to drown here. I'm going to drown slowly.
</P>
<P>
   What will it be like? What will I feel? How long will it take?
Should I just take a huge gulp of water?
</P>
<P>
   No, he thought. Think about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   What if I just push under, all the way under. Maybe I'll wash
free. No, too risky, not until there's nothing else to do. Save
that for the end.
</P>
<P>
   His hands were numb. He wiggled his feet to get circulation.
</P>
<P>
   He felt the pulse of the water on his head and back, the
tremendous power washing over him, the surging current strangely
lulling, peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   No! Don't lose it. Keep thinking. Keep doing everything I can to
get out.
</P>
<P>
   He tried straightening his kayak again, tried dislodging it,
pushing off, breaking the limb with his hands. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   He screamed for help, heard the echoes of his own voice off the
canyon walls.
</P>
<P>
   Man, that's feeble, he thought, and almost laughed.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about what it is to drown, the physiology of it,
remembered everything he knew from training.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped he'd have a laryngeal spasm, that his airway would
simply shut off. And then ... then a few moments of burning panic
followed by a moment of euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, God, just make it quick, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   He began saying Hail Marys, Our Fathers. He prayed for peace,
for calm.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled to recall other words he wanted to say, remembered
them.
</P>
<P>
   From dust thou art, unto dust thou shalt ...
Rescuers
</P>
<P>
   His paddle saved him.
</P>
<P>
   It washed a quarter-mile downriver, and two of his friends, Dan
Miller and Rob Nix, both from Columbia, Mo., saw it and knew
something was very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At first they figured Bratton would walk down, that he'd lost
his boat, gone swimming.
</P>
<P>
   But when he didn't appear, they started walking back upriver on
the banks, deeply worried, breaking through heavy brush, climbing
cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   It took them 30 minutes to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton saw them in the distance, saw a yellow dot bobbing in
the woods, Nix's bright flotation vest. He began to scream, to
wave.
</P>
<P>
   Nix threw him a tow rope. Miller went into the water, hopped
from eddy to eddy, dived across four feet of rapids, helped free
Bratton's boat.
</P>
<P>
   Back on land, Bratton stumbled at first, hypothermic, giddy,
uncoordinated. His friends dried him, got him into warm clothes,
fed him, got him up and walking.
</P>
<P>
   He made his way downstream, he got back into his boat. He didn't
want to, not at all, but there was no choice, no other way out.
</P>
<P>
   That night they all made it into the calmer water of the Cache
La Poudre River and found their campsite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have to put you two on my Christmas-card list,''
Bratton said to Nix and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   He said little more. He couldn't talk about what had happened,
was too tired, confused.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning he woke to the smell of breakfast, the beauty of
snow-capped mountains, the sight of tumbling, shifting clouds
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, just think, you might not have seen this,'' said a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton shrugged, said, ``Yeah,'' and then wandered away to be
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kansas City, Mo., he returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks he has kept the experience inside. He thinks
constantly about what happened, senses it holds some great meaning
for him, ponders new thoughts about respect and kindness,
uncertainty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that his deepest feelings are shifting, changing, but
he doesn't understand the process yet, and still can't talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too much to explain, he thinks. And so, for now, he
plays the stoic river rat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an old friend from Metropolitan Ambulance Services
Trust brought a patient to the Baptist emergency room while Bratton
was on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I heard you almost lost it on some Colorado river,'' his
friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton smiled, shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What river?'' he said.

 Lawyers file $2.2 million settlement offer for inmates abused in
Texas prison  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Lawyers Friday filed a proposed $2.2 million
settlement offer for Missouri inmates abused in a Texas prison.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $1 million would be divided among six groups of lawyers
who represent the prisoners, with the remainder split among up to
2,100 inmates. Lawyers say it would be the nation's largest
prison-abuse settlement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey froze action on pending
prisoner lawsuits while she considers whether to approve the
proposed class-action settlement, filed in federal court in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in many of about 30 other lawsuits filed by more than 700
inmates also froze their cases this week, lawyers said. The
settlement proposal does not allow for inmates to sue outside of
the class action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of prison crowding, up to 2,100 Missouri prisoners were
housed in Texas from January 1995 to December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A September 1996 training video showed attack dogs biting
Missouri prisoners while a jailer dragged men down a hallway. An
inmate with a broken ankle slowed down, the tape showed, and a
guard shocked him with a stun gun.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company for the private jail-management firm,
Capital Correctional Resources, and Brazoria County in Texas would
pay the $2.2 million without admitting any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners had claimed that Missouri officials knew about the
abuse and did not investigate. Missouri would pay nothing under the
proposed settlement but pledges not to take settlement money
inmates receive, which it could do to cover incarceration costs.
</P>
<P>
   The state also would review all discipline infractions prisoners
received in Texas -- infractions that could delay their parole. And
Missouri pledges not to send any of the prisoners back to Texas
jails before June 15, 2004.

CASEY GETS NOD TO COACH NETS
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets' long and somewhat peculiar trek toward
naming a head coach ended Friday when the team announced that Don
Casey would continue in the job. The decision ended a seven-week
search that never truly seemed to include more than two candidates:
Phil Jackson and Casey, who served as their interim coach over the
second half of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who will present Casey as their coach at a news
conference on Monday, released a statement saying that Casey, 62,
would receive a multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   A person with knowledge of the contract said that the deal was
worth about $1.4 million during the first year and that the Nets
had an option to terminate the contract before the 2000-1 season.
</P>
<P>
   Casey has yet to sign the contract, which will be completed over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Casey nor the team's top officials were available for
comment, but a person close to Casey described his mood as
``ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that Coach Casey will return to lead the
Nets next season,'' Michael Rowe, the team's president, said in the
statement. ``He's a veteran coach with a great deal of NBA
experience who did an outstanding job last year, especially when
you consider the rash of injuries that decimated the front line.''
</P>
<P>
   After John Calipari was dismissed March 15, Casey took over the
Nets' coaching duties with the team in shambles. The club's record
was 3-17, largely because the players had rebelled against
Calipari's domineering personality. Casey's laid-back and humorous
approach immediately won over the players and they began calling
him King Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing six players to season-ending injuries, including
starters Jayson Williams and Keith Van Horn, the Nets compiled a
13-17 record under Casey. After the season, even though it was well
known that the Nets' ownership would make a bid for Jackson, nearly
all of the team's stars endorsed Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey was the right man for the job,'' Williams said Friday.
``The players respect him and his coaching staff. I think he'll do
the same job that Phil Jackson would have done and probably better
because the players really care for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets began their very public courtship of Jackson and made
him an offer of $21 million over three years. He turned down the
deal and last week accepted a five-year deal worth a reported $30
million to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. After that, it appeared
that the hiring of Casey was a mere formality for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer the Nets remained silent about their coaching
situation, the more it prompted speculation that perhaps they were
interested in Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach.
</P>
<P>
   With Van Gundy's announcement on Thursday that he would remain
as the coach of the Knicks next season, the timing of Friday's
announcement by the Nets could be taken as a sign that Casey might
have been their third choice. But there was no hint of that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players responded very positively to Coach Casey and his
staff,'' said John Nash, the team's general manager. ``We feel that
the new attitude that he and his staff have brought to the team
bodes well for the future of the Nets.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey's staff of assistants _ Jim Lynam, Eddie Jordan and Mike
O'Koren _ is an integral part of the equation. Lynam and Jordan
have head coaching experience and handled much of the team's
preparation through the final 29 games. Lynam coached the offense
and Jordan the defense, while Casey oversaw the entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   Many people within the organization believed that Casey would be
hired only if Lynam and Jordan returned, and while that is likely,
neither has committed to rejoining the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who coached Temple University to a 151-94 record from
1973 to 1981, joined the NBA as an assistant with Chicago in 1982.
He was also an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers and the
Boston Celtics. He served as the Clippers' interim head coach for
the second half of the 1989 season and became the Nets' first
assistant before the 1996-97 season, Calipari's first with the
club.

 &HT;    Johnson pulls out with injury
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ ``Making history.'' It's a phrase Michael Johnson
casually drops when the conversation turns to what makes him run.
Understandably, so. This is the man who wore the golden slippers in
the Atlanta Olympics, rewriting track history with his 200/400
meter gold-medal double and world record 19.32 in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson has to wonder if his best running days aren't
history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is injured again, this time pulling out of what was to
be the signature event of the USA Track and Field Championships _ a
showdown over 200 meters against a talented field featuring
recently crowned 100-meter world record-holder Maurice Greene.
Johnson's career has been marred by injuries since capturing
headlines at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   During a speed workout Thursday, Johnson felt a twinge in his
right quadriceps. He decided to withdraw from the championships
after he felt the injury warming up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's disappointed, for sure,'' said Brad Hunt, his longtime
agent. ``If it was a do-or-die situation, he'd strap it up and go.
But his goal is to run fast this summer, and there's no reason to
risk it.''
</P>
<P>
   By scratching from the 200, Johnson won't have the opportunity
to qualify for the World Championships in the sprint. Hunt said
that he still plans to run the 400 at the Worlds, where he won gold
in 1997 and thus enjoys an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   The news was a letdown for Greene, who had been itching to get a
shot at Johnson and his mind-boggling record of 19.32. This was to
be the race for anyone with a short attention span. Greene, 24,
fresh from clocking a world-record 9.79 over 100 meters, had hoped
to race Johnson to the finish line _ a possible world record in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been the World's Fastest Man vs. the World's
Greatest Sprinter. Now, it's Greene running to pad his credentials,
though Florida freshman sensation John Capel might test him in the
nationally televised final Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the World's Greatest Sprinter, you have to show
versatility,'' said Greene, plotting for a year to step up in
distance for a showdown opposite Johnson. ``You have to run more
than one race.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene finds himself playing catch-up for a lackluster
performance at the 1996 Olympic Trials in Atlanta, where he failed
to make the U.S. team. So he'd angled to knock Johnson off his
lofty perch and, while at it, take a piece out of his 19.32 _ a
mark some thought might last for ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I capable of running it right now?'' Greene said.
``Possibly. Do I believe I can run that fast? Yes. Can I do it this
weekend? Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Johnson, married last fall to Dallas TV reporter
Kerry Doyen, to ponder his future in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if your best years are to come or if they're in
the past,'' said Johnson, 31.
</P>
<P>
   The most lasting memory of Johnson since the Atlanta Olympics is
of him pulling up lame in his match race against Donovan Bailey.
That was in the spring of 1997, and since then Johnson has spent
most of his time nursing an assortment of hip and leg injuries. To
save his legs, his racing has been restricted largely to the 400
meters. He hasn't run under 20 seconds since Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to run the 200 the last two years, I haven't
been able to be the athlete I was in '92 through '96,'' Johnson
said. ``Because of injuries, I've been forced to be a 400-meter
runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans to stay around through next summer, likely
attempting another 200/400 double in Sydney.

 &HT;    Hurdles fiasco has Adkins thinking retirement
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ While training partner Angelo Taylor eyes a gold
medal tonight in the 400-meter hurdles, Olympic champion Derrick
Adkins is left to ponder retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins stumbled coming off the sixth hurdle in the semifinals
Friday night, finishing a distant seventh (52.28 seconds) in his
semifinal heat. Taylor won the earlier heat and posted the fastest
qualifying time of 49.09.
</P>
<P>
   For Adkins it was an end to his season _ possibly his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September, I'll decide if I want to train for next year or
give it up,'' said Adkins, dejected. ``I don't know if I have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Adkins has been slowed by injuries since the
Atlanta Olympics, and never regained the stamina that made him the
world's best hurdler. Friday night, he lacked the strength to
maintain his normal pattern of 13 strides between hurdles and
stumbled badly coming off the sixth barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins credited Georgia Tech coach Grover Hinsdale with Taylor's
development. Taylor, though, also acknowledges the help and advice
provided him by Adkins. Most afternoons, Taylor works out with
Adkins and fellow Tech grad, 400-meter runner Derek Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like training with those guys, because they're on the same
level,'' said Taylor, a Southwest DeKalb graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Century club
</P>
<P>
   With marquee 100-meter sprinters Maurice Greene (200 meters) and
Marion Jones (200 and long jump) sitting out to focus on other
events, the men's and women's titles went to Dennis Mitchell and
Inger Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a veteran of three Olympics, closed over the final 10
meters to win in 9.97 seconds _ well off Greene's recent
world-record clocking of 9.79.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race, Miller, who trains in Los Angeles with a
sprint group that includes Greene, took the final in 10.96. Second
was two-time defending Olympic champion Gail Devers in 10.97.
Devers recently moved to Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Around the track
</P>
<P>
   In the surprise of the meet, Marion Jones was beaten by Dawn
Burrell in the long jump. Jones failed to improve on her opening
effort of 22-3, and Burrell passed her on her next-to-last jump of
22-10 _ a career-best and sixth-best ever by an American. The top
three finishers advance to the World Championships, so Jones' goal
of four gold medals is still a possibility. ... It was a rough
night for the Atlanta contingent in the men's 400. Derek Mills,
Jonas Motiejunas and Milton Campbell all failed to advance from the
semifinals. ... Atlanta Olympic gold medalist Charles Austin won
the high jump with a clearance of 7-5 3/4. ... Connie Price-Smith
claimed an eighth straight shot put title.

MEXICAN WOMAN BENEFITS FROM KINDNESSES IN KC AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Two weeks ago Delia Noselo was living in a
cardboard shack in Mexico with her mother, her seven nieces and
nephews, and a mess of chickens.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old woman, who has not been able to use her legs
since she fell off the back of a truck eight years ago, had to drag
herself on her arms across the dirt floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to nursing students and faculty from Johnson County
(Kan.) Community College, Noselo lives in Kansas at Delmar Gardens
of Overland Park -- a nursing home with carpeting, a piano in the
front hallway and a window view of woods and a pond. She has a room
she shares with one other person. But most important, she is
getting the medical care she needs.
</P>
<P>
   Noselo on Friday completed her first session of physical
therapy. Through a translator, she talked in Spanish about how her
legs hurt, how she wants to learn English, how she enjoys the food
and how she doesn't miss anything from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't had much love,'' said Mary Smith, an associate
professor of nursing. Smith led students on a 10-day trip earlier
this month to practice community health care in Las Pintas, a rural
area 30 miles east of Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Smith met Noselo last year on a previous visit. What she saw
troubled her deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Noselo hadn't been bathed in weeks, her hair was matted, and she
weighed 80 pounds. She used a broken wheelchair that later
completely gave out, forcing her to crawl with her arms.
</P>
<P>
   She lived with her mother, who was busy raising her other
daughter's seven children and working as a cleaner in a butcher
shop. They had no electricity or plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no one to care for Noselo.
</P>
<P>
   Smith talked to local doctors, who said Noselo couldn't receive
government aid for medical care because she is a U.S. citizen. She
was born in Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suspects Noselo had polio as a child. She had been married
for a short time, but her husband abandoned her, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Delia is a victim,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   So when Smith returned with 11 students and other faculty
members this year, she had a plan to bring Noselo back.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy decision. It meant taking Noselo out of her
culture, where she knew the language, was familiar with
surroundings and had a family. But when Smith saw her again, she
knew it was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to leave,'' Smith said. ``She wanted to get better.
She wanted to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   For the plane trip to the United States, Noselo sent for her
original birth certificate, and a Mexican official wrote a letter
and included a photo of her as her identification. The students
used $450 left over from their medical supplies fund for her
airfare.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knew Noselo needed full-time care, but didn't know what
nursing center would be the best. At first Noselo stayed in Smith's
home. Smith soon called a friend, Pam Davidson, who recently had
become nursing director of Delmar Gardens near the college. The
center accepted Noselo without any assurance it would be paid for
her care. She has applied for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   One of Noselo's greatest needs is an electric wheelchair that
would cost $4,000. Medicaid wouldn't cover that expense, Davidson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't be dependent -- it would open a whole new
world,'' Davidson said. ``She could go to church and the grocery
store to pick out her own food -- she's never had that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the goal was for Noselo to live in a group home,
where she could live independently, share her language and her
culture.
</P>
<P>
   A Delmar nurse assistant from Argentina regularly visits with
Noselo. She gave her a book of puzzles and games in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Smith would like college Spanish students to help teach Noselo
English. In turn, Noselo would help them with Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing students and faculty, some of whom speak Spanish, visit
Noselo each day. One of the students, Kitsy Gough, 21, of Overland
Park, said Noselo lights up when she sees people she knows.
</P>
<P>
   But Gough knows that although Noselo's life has greatly
improved, living here will be a difficult adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask her how she is doing, she always uses the
Spanish expression `It's going to be a battle,' '' Gough said.

DISPATCHER'S ROLE QUESTIONED IN FIRE DEPARTMENT'S FAILURE TO
RESPOND TO MEDICAL CALLS DURING FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas City fire dispatcher is being
investigated for his role in the Fire Department's failure to
respond to emergency medical calls across the city while a
four-alarm fire was under way in late May.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, fire units were battling a blaze that destroyed a
two-block-long abandoned warehouse in the West Bottoms. About 75
firefighters -- out of about 200 usually on duty during a typical
shift -- spent two hours bringing the fire under control. More than
100 people were evacuated from neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Department records contend that the dispatcher, a Fire
Department employee, failed to send fire units to respond to seven
emergency medical calls relayed by the Metropolitan Ambulance
Services Trust in a 26-minute period.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious call was a cardiac arrest in midtown. The
patient was dead when a MAST ambulance crew arrived, but MAST's
incident report stated that the patient had been dead for some time
and that a quicker response would not have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six other calls, according to MAST, four patients were
taken to hospitals, where they were treated and released; the two
others did not require treatment.
</P>
<P>
   MAST did not disclose the names of any of the patients, citing
patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Fire Department disciplinary report obtained by
The Kansas City Star, the dispatcher told his superiors that he
thought the department was too busy fighting the fire to respond to
all but the most pressing medical calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's emergency medical system, Fire Department units
function as ``first responders.'' Emergency medical calls are
relayed from MAST to the Fire Department because fire stations are
more numerous than MAST ambulances and are placed strategically
throughout the city. The idea is for firefighters to reach the
scene of an emergency first and provide initial care until an
ambulance can get there.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing Kansas City firefighters is campaigning
for the department to take over ambulance service in the city. A
committee has been formed to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Rick Brisbin said he had not seen the disciplinary
report, but he confirmed that the incident occurred and was being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look into it,'' Brisbin said. ``We take those kinds of
things very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Fire Department regulations, dispatchers are required to
respond to any request for service that comes to them by their
computer link to MAST.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Gratton, the Health Department physician who leads the
city's emergency medical system, said he was concerned about the
incident but wanted to know more about the case before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Brisbin said officials think they know what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what went on over there,'' Brisbin said. ``But
it still prompts an investigation. We understand what it's like to
expend resources as fast as you can find them. But it's pretty
serious to get caught up in the flow of things like that.
Professional dispatchers shouldn't miss something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the disciplinary report, a supervisor ordered the
dispatcher to contact MAST officials to tell them that firefighters
were responding to emergency medical calls but had to repeat the
order ``two or three times'' before the dispatcher acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary report included a transcript of a
``fact-finding session'' in which the dispatcher was questioned by
his supervisor, acting Deputy Chief Paul Berardi.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes the dispatcher as saying: ``Three EMS calls
popped up on the MAST link that did not seem to be
life-threatening....I called MAST and told them this thing would
probably escalate and asked if they could handle the EMS calls.''
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why he decided to ask MAST to handle the medical
calls, the dispatcher was quoted in the report as saying, ``I was
trained to take care of FD (Fire Department) first.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department dispatchers are trained to juggle many
emergencies at one time, Brisbin said. However, he said he expected
the volume of calls the dispatcher was handling at the time to be
an issue raised in the dispatcher's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to deal with lots of emergencies,'' Brisbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department officials said a disciplinary hearing would be
held before punishment, if any, was rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Berardi, listed as the author of the disciplinary report,
refused to discuss it, calling it a private personnel document.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the dispatcher was told by a Fire
Department supervisor that despite the demands the West Bottoms
fire placed on the department, the department was still available
to respond to emergency medical calls.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the disciplinary report, the dispatcher is
accused of failing to send fire units on seven such calls received
between 1:01:37 p.m. and 1:27:37 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cardiac arrest, the other calls involved
reports of a traffic accident in Westport, someone suffering chest
pains in the 6400 block of Prospect Avenue, someone suffering from
shortness of breath near Interstate 435 and Interstate 29, and
another person experiencing difficulty breathing near the
intersection of 20th Street and Hardesty Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Two other calls involved reports of unconscious persons, one in
the 3900 block of Monroe Street, the other in the 6700 block of
Prospect Avenue. MAST units responded to the incidents. MAST
declined to release the names of the ambulance crew members who
responded to those calls.

JIM RYUN AND TEEN WHO BROKE HIS RECORD SAVOR MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- What becomes a legend most? Perhaps it's the grace
in which he relinquishes his hold on a piece of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Ryun, the legendary miler who now runs in search of
votes, not medals, heard recently that a high school sophomore had
broken the first major record he ever set, he was surprised, and a
bit disappointed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not because his record, the fastest mile by a high school
sophomore, had fallen. But because it had taken so long for
somebody to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years. A full generation. Countless runners had come
and gone, and his record had weathered them all. But it should have
been eclipsed years ago, Ryun said. That's the ``natural
progression'' of sports.
</P>
<P>
   So when the three-time Olympian, who's now a second-term
Republican congressman from Kansas, met Alan Webb, the 16-year-old
schoolboy from Reston, Va., who dethroned him, he eagerly went
straight for the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me a little about the race,'' Ryun asked Webb on the
front steps of the Capitol last week during a ceremony with past
and present Olympians. ``I want to hear about the pace of it.
Describe it for me. What was your last 400 meters?''
</P>
<P>
   And Webb, looking about as nervous as someone suddenly coming
face-to-face with an idol has every right to be, said, ``I went the
last quarter in 59 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' said Ryun, recalling all too well the toll the final
400 takes on the lungs and legs.
</P>
<P>
   And the wide-eyed Webb smiled the smile of youth aglow with an
elder's approval. But not just any elder's. Ryun is arguably the
greatest American miler of all time. He was still in high school
when he went to the Tokyo Olympics in 1964. He had just handed Webb
a moment perhaps more lasting than any gold medal he might someday
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' the athlete-turned-politician said before
heading back to the ceremony. ``Just keep your focus and keep
going. You've got great talent. I'll be watching with eager
expectation. God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, Jim Ryun was running. It was long before jogging,
long before shoes came in a zillion shapes and colors. He won five
national collegiate titles and became a world-record holder in the
mile, the 1,500 meters and the 880 yards. He won a silver medal in
the 1968 Olympics, even as he was suffering mononucleosis and
running in the thin air of Mexico City. On the wall of his
congressional office are eight Sports Illustrated covers with his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   There were frustrations, too, like falling in the 1,500 meter
qualifying round at the Munich Olympics in 1972. He never made the
finals. But Ryun, whose religious faith imbues every aspect of his
life, said the experience strengthened him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a great deal of success as an athlete,'' he said.
``This gave me an opportunity through a very high-profile situation
to come to grips with that it's not always going to go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish it on anybody,'' he quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun was a student at Wichita (Kan.) East High School when he
took up running, pretty much out of desperation. He had been cut
from his church baseball team and the junior high basketball team,
and he wasn't big enough for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what cross-country was all about, but one of my
first goals was to make the team,'' Ryun said. ``And if you make
the team, then you get a letter jacket, and since I was not one of
the more popular students in school, I assumed that maybe I could
get a girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Got the jacket,'' Ryun said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   His career was jump-started on a humid day in Houston, in June
1963, when he was 16 and racing in the shadows of older, wiser
runners at the U.S. Track and Field Federation National
Championships. He ran the mile in 4:07.08, a mark that stood for
nearly four decades. Until two weeks ago. That's when Webb, on a
cool night on a Raleigh, N.C., track, ran the same distance in
4:06.94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was a legendary high school distance runner,'' said
Webb, who can tick off Ryun's stats the way other kids can recite
the minutiae of ``Star Wars.'' ``It feels really, really good. It
feels great, actually. When I first did it, it took me a little
while for it to sink in. That night, I was sort of like -- wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Ryun still owns other high school titles. He became the first
high-schooler to break the four-minute mile, running 3:59 when he
was a junior at Wichita East. As a senior, he ran a 3:55.3, still
the American high school record.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Webb is closing in, and Ryun couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that he broke the record,'' he said. ``The
junior record and senior record, those are still there. It seems
like Alan might be the next possibility, and I wish him well.''

the 1968 Olympics, even as he was suffering mononucleosis and
running in the thin air of Mexico City. On the wall of his
congressional office are eight Sports Illustrated covers with his
picture.
</P>
<P>
   There were frustrations, too, like falling in the 1,500 meter
qualifying round at the Munich Olympics in 1972. He never made the
finals. But Ryun, whose religious faith imbues every aspect of his
life, said the experience strengthened him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a great deal of success as an athlete,'' he said.
``This gave me an opportunity through a very high-profile situation
to come to grips with that it's not always going to go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish it on anybody,'' he quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun was a student at Wichita (Kan.) East High School when he
took up running, pretty much out of desperation. He had been cut
from his church baseball team and the junior high basketball team,
and he wasn't big enough for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what cross-country was all about, but one of my
first goals was to make the team,'' Ryun said. ``And if you make
the team, then you get a letter jacket, and since I was not one of
the more popular students in school, I assumed that maybe I could
get a girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Got the jacket,'' Ryun said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   His career was jump-started on a humid day in Houston, in June
1963, when he was 16 and racing in the shadows of older, wiser
runners at the U.S. Track and Field Federation National
Championships. He ran the mile in 4:07.08, a mark that stood for
nearly four decades. Until two weeks ago. That's when Webb, on a
cool night on a Raleigh, N.C., track, ran the same distance in
4:06.94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was a legendary high school distance runner,'' said
Webb, who can tick off Ryun's stats the way other kids can recite
the minutiae of ``Star Wars.'' ``It feels really, really good. It
feels great, actually. When I first did it, it took me a little
while for it to sink in. That night, I was sort of like -- wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Ryun still owns other high school titles. He became the first
high-schooler to break the four-minute mile, running 3:59 when he
was a junior at Wichita East. As a senior, he ran a 3:55.3, still
the American high school record.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Webb is closing in, and Ryun couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that he broke the record,'' he said. ``The
junior record and senior record, those are still there. It seems
like Alan might be the next possibility, and I wish him well.''

LONG ROAD FOR A SHORT, WILD SEASON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They said that this lockout-shortened season would be
a blessing, a five-month sprint instead of a seven- or eight-month
marathon. In fact, this has been the longest short season in
National Basketball Association history. And for the Knicks, the
wildest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 78-77 loss Friday night, New York's Miracle Knicks
learned how to roar this season.
</P>
<P>
   The deep, dark circles under coach Jeff Van Gundy's eyes are the
signature of a dramatic season where there was no rest for the
weary. ``There was no time from the start to the end to ever gather
yourself,'' Van Gundy said Friday. ``We had one four-day break.
Other than that, it was just game after game after game. If you
were hurt at any point in the year you had no chance to get back to
feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games were much more bunched together. In that way it was
a very long season; that makes it more of a mental challenge as
well. A lot of times you might play back-to-back games, then you
have two days off. Here it was back-to-back, a day off, then
back-to-back-to-back. The regular season is always a mental
challenge, but this one, to me, was harder.'' Friday night, for the
first time, the Knicks looked tired.
</P>
<P>
   There was something more grueling, more intense about watching
the Knicks this season. Something deeply personal and intimate made
this season more riveting, more excruciating than ever. The Knicks
became a nonstop, day-to-day epic that began at this time last year
when they underwent the equivalent of root canal work: they traded
the venerable Charles Oakley for an untested and unproven Marcus
Camby.
</P>
<P>
   That trade created a deep wound in the team, and it hurt Oakley
and a loyal contingent of Oakley supporters, Van Gundy being first
among them. Then a wisdom tooth was ripped out in January when the
popular John Starks was traded for Latrell Sprewell, an
All-Star-caliber player who made headlines with Golden State for
attacking his coach.
</P>
<P>
   From Day 1 until Day 170, the Knicks have been a laboratory of
race and politics, a kaleidoscope of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy: Leaves Yale to play Division III basketball. Some say
that was an early sign of poor judgment; others call it a valiant
concession to passion. As King Edward VIII gave up the throne of
Britain to wed the love of his life, Van Gundy left the citadel of
education for the sport he loved. Goes on to be head coach of the
Knicks and comes within three games of an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Camby: Repays money that his college lost because of a
recruiting violation he was involved in. Goes from Knicks pariah to
crowd favorite to starter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell: In the most dramatic turnabout of all, goes from
recalcitrant to the rebellious hero who teaches his team to roar.
Now Disney is talking about including him in a project. And Friday
night, he tried to resurrect the Knicks, just when it appeared they
were done. With 8 minutes 57 seconds left in the game, his
3-pointer gave the Knicks a 3-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   This season has seemed long because the Knicks have been
relentless. As recently as Thursday, Larry Johnson introduced yet
another multilayered theme, the theme of Knicks as rebellious
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Johnson took his lumps. Mostly the criticism
centered on the incongruity of money and bondage: how can someone
who makes $84 million call himself a slave?
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell came to his friend's defense. Compensation that
athletes receive often adds up to hush money, an incentive to
behave, to buy homes and cars, to go off and be quiet. ``Some guys,
like Larry and myself, don't see that money when we're put in that
position,'' Sprewell said. ``Somebody else, concerned about the
money to the point of saying, `I like this hush money, I'm going to
hush up.' Not saying I should have done what I did, but they're not
going to let it go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked me, `How could you do this and do that if you
make $8 million a year?''' Sprewell added. ``I'm saying it's not
about the money, it's about me as an individual, my personal
manhood and you speaking to me as a man. Money wasn't even a factor
at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks learned to roar this season; the noise could
reverberate for a few seasons to come. Anyone who followed the team
from beginning to end feels the way you feel at the end of a great
book: exhausted, invigorated, stimulated. Sorry the story ended
this way, a 1-point loss, but glad that it's over.
</P>
<P>
   I can't remember when a short season seemed so long.

LINK TO SUSPECTED CON MAN TURNS PRIESTS INTO PARIAHS IN VATICAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ As priests, they make an unlikely pair. One is an
affable, worldly American bon vivant who zooms around Trastevere on
a raffish blue motorbike and defied his New York archbishop in the
1980s by running a trendy Manhattan restaurant to raise money for
the poor. The other is an owlish Italian canon law scholar who
serves as an emeritus judge on the Roman Rota, the court of appeals
of the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Rev. Peter Jacobs, 73, and Monsignor Emilio
Colagiovanni, 79, provided a clerical cloak of respectability for a
Greenwich, Conn., money manager who authorities suspect embezzled
more than $300 million from a web of insurance companies across the
United States. Both men insist they were badly duped by Martin R.
Frankel, who disappeared last month and is wanted by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The priests say they knew Frankel as David Rosse, a middle-aged
tycoon who claimed descent from the biblical King David and said he
was eager to give at least $50 million to the Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   They supported the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a charity
Frankel set up and then attempted to use to buy several insurance
companies in the United States. He named Jacobs as the president of
that foundation. Colagiovanni, who had his own foundation, said he
went a step further, giving Jacobs' charity power to move funds in
and out of his foundation's Vatican bank account.
</P>
<P>
   With federal investigators in the United States scouring the
records of Frankel's intricate financial transactions, those
actions have left both priests exposed and vulnerable. And it has
turned both of them into virtual pariahs inside the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said there was no
link whatsoever between The Vatican and Frankel. He also denied any
connection between Colagiovanni's Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation
and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before the scandal erupted, senior Vatican officials were
also intrigued by Frankel's professed desire to shower riches on
church charities. At least two senior Vatican officials met with
Frankel's American lawyer, Thomas A. Bolan, and tried to help his
client set up a charitable foundation that would be part of the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Bolan, a former law partner of Roy Cohn and an active figure in
Catholic charity circles in the United States, met in Rome to
discuss the foundation with Bishop Francesco Salerio Salerno, and
Monsignor Gianfranco Piovano, top Vatican officials, according to
his lawyer, Maurice R. Nessen, and the two priests. Reading from
his notes of what Bolan recollects, Nessen said Friday that the
meetings in Rome centered on how an outside philanthropist could
channel money through the Vatican to support religious causes.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Church officials are highly sensitive to any hint of a banking
scandal ever since the 1980s, when the Vatican bank was badly
tainted by its ties to the Banco Ambrosiana, which collapsed in the
wake of a huge financial scandal and the mysterious death of a
mafia-linked banker, Roberto Calvi in 1982. The pope later ordered
a clean-up of the bank that eventually led to the Vatican producing
its first healthy profits in 1993 after decades of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Salerno is now secretary of the Apostolic Signatura, the Supreme
Court of the Church. At the time of the meeting with Bolan, he was
secretary of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy
See. In an interview Friday, Salerno said he denied ever discussing
the foundation with Bolan, though he said he did so with
Colagiovanni. ``I could not refuse Monsignor Colagiovanni, he is a
judge on the Roman Rota,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Salerno said he told other Vatican officials that
``hypothetically'' nothing would legally prevent an American
financier from opening a charitable foundation in the Vatican.
``The Vatican is a sovereign state, anything can be done, but the
question is will it be authorized,'' Salerno said.
</P>
<P>
   Nessen, Bolan's attorney, said that his client had a later
meeting with Piovano, an assistant Vatican secretary of state, who
disagreed with Salerno, pointing out that Frankel could not be
allowed to control a Vatican foundation's assets, especially since
Frankel also wished to invest in insurance companies in America.
Eventually, however, the two sides worked out a compromise: the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus Foundation, Colagiovanni's cultural and
charitable organization, could act as ``founder'' _ in legal terms
as ``settlor'' _ of a new, independent foundation controlled by
Frankel. According to Nessen, the new foundation would be named
after St. Francis of Assisi and could claim links to the Vatican,
as Frankel desired. Nessen said that Salerno was aware of and
approved this arrangement in advance. Asked in writing to respond,
Salerno did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   But after Frankel's suspected embezzlement schemes came to
light, the Vatican sought to distance itself from the American's
associates in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls described Colagiovanni, who as president of the
Monitor Ecclesiasticus edits a Vatican-approved canonical law
quarterly and also runs its charitable arm, as a ``pensioner.''
Navarro-Valls said he knew nothing about Jacobs, but volunteered
that he was an ``ex-Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Salerno also pointed out Jacobs' Jewish roots after the scandal
surfaced. Neither he nor Navarro-Valls nor others mentioned the
fact that Jacobs was formally rebuked by the Catholic Church in
1983, after he ignored an archbishop's order to cease operating his
New York restaurant, The Palantine. Jacobs' right to perform
priestly duties was suspended at that time because he violated
church rules about business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who continued to serve Mass and perform weddings, said
in an interview that he believed his suspension was reversed in
1987 after he gave up the business. According to his archdiocese in
Washington, however, the suspension was reversed, but not the ban
on giving sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Priestly faculties are like a medical license, and Father
Jacobs' were never restored,'' William E. Lori, auxiliary bishop of
the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C, explained on Thursday. ``The
sacraments he performed since 1983 are not valid.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was born in New Hampshire, the son of a Jewish father and
an Irish Catholic mother. Jacobs was baptized as a Catholic, but he
only began practicing his faith while serving in the Navy during
World war II. He was ordained in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In his long, colorful and highly unorthodox career as a priest,
he has made interfaith marriages a specialty. It was, in fact, an
interfaith society wedding that brought Jacobs and Colagiovanni
together in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They first met, Colagiovanni recalled in an interview, at the
Vatican Bank, known as the Instituto per Le Opere Religiose.
Colagiovanni's foundation has an account there. Jacobs said that he
was there visiting old friends who worked in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very social fellow,'' Colagiovanni said of Jacobs.
Soon after that meeting, Jacobs sought out Colagiovanni's expertise
in arranging a Catholic Church wedding for a divorced Jewish groom
and a Catholic bride. Colagiovanni said he had no idea at the time
he was helping one of America's wealthiest men, Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
president of Seagram Co., marry Clarissa Alcock, the daughter of an
oil executive, in Caracas, Venezuela. Jacobs said he officiated at
the service, alongside a local priest and a rabbi, over the
objections of the local cardinal. An associate of the Bronfman
family said that this was untrue, and that the local priest had
officiated, with Jacobs serving as a ``greeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who has worked in the slums of New York and Washington,
D.C., also hobnobs with European aristocrats and counts the late
Princess Grace of Monaco, Walter Cronkite, Arrigo Cipriani, the
owner of Harry's Bar, among his many well-heeled friends. Another
one was Bolan.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Colagiovanni said he got another call from
Jacobs when he was on vacation in Cleveland. ``He told me there was
a Jewish millionaire who wanted to do good things for the church
and the poor,'' Colagiovanno recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He flew at Frankel's expense to New York, where he and Jacobs
and Bolan had dinner. Jacobs said he had known Bolan for 30 years
and had helped him through a variety of family crises.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the dinner, all three men drove to Greenwich, Conn.,
to meet the aspiring benefactor. Both priests said they were
surprised and impressed by Frankel's library, which was crammed
with books on Catholicism, ranging from papal encyclicals to
biographies of saints, including hundreds of tomes devoted to St.
Francis of Assisi. ``He had actually read the encyclicals,'' Jacobs
said. ``Even I haven't read them all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the priest also noticed Frankel's weird side, particularly
his obsessive fear of germs. ``He reminded me of the Jack Nicholson
character in `As Good as It Gets,' who kept washing his hands over
and over,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni, like Jacobs, received from Frankel a 13-page
autobiographical sketch that laid out his financial credentials and
his piety. Colagiovanni said he was convinced of Frankel's good
intentions, but he said that when Frankel explained his desire to
give $50 million to Catholic charities by setting up his own
foundation at the Vatican, he told him that was impossible. ``I
explained no lay person could bank there,'' Colagiovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he encouraged Frankel to start his own private
foundation. But Frankel was apparently so keen to bank at the
Vatican that he dispatched his lawyer, Bolan, to Rome by Concorde
to meet with Vatican officials.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides eventually settled on the compromise and founded
the St. Francis Foundation. Jacobs said that he learned that he was
appointed a trustee and president of the foundation after seeing
his name on a document.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also ardently pursued celebrities to add legitimacy to
his organization, sometimes even after they declined to support
him. Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman, rejected Frankel's
overtures to serve on the St. Francis foundation board. But Frankel
did not readily accept no for an answer: He paid for Iacocca to fly
on a leased Gulfstream IV executive jet from Los Angeles to Milan,
Italy, where Iacocca attended to some personal and business
affairs, a spokeswoman for Iacocca said. She said that the retired
auto executive was not initially informed about how the trip was
paid for.
</P>
<P>
   And Frankel pressured Jacobs to use his own connections. Walter
Cronkite said that he had received and rejected a request from
Jacobs to serve on the advisory board. After that conversation,
Cronkite heard nothing more about the matter until early May, when
he got a voice mail at his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Pete called and left a very cryptic message,'' Cronkite
said. ``He said, `The man who has given a billion dollars has
apparently absconded with the money, the whole thing is a mess. I'm
sorry I listed you as a member of the board of advisors. I hope it
doesn't cause you any problems.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time Cronkite heard that Jacobs had put his
name on the list of advisors. ``It was very much of a surprise,''
he said. ``I would not have thought that he would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Colagiovanni said that he told Frankel he did not want to be
involved with collecting or investing money. He signed over to
Jacobs, president of the St. Francis Foundation, the right to use
the bank account of the Monitor Ecclesiaticus Foundation, which is
in the Vatican bank. But Frankel apparently never tapped that
source: both priests said that Frankel never sent any money to
either foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel instead used Colagiovanni's connections in a different
way, persuading the priest to sign a November 1998 affidavit that
stated that money contributed to the St. Francis Foundation came
from ``funds of the Holy See.'' Frankel's lawyers used that
document to support their claims that Frankel's charity and
business dealings had the approval of the Vatican. Colagiovanni now
says that the affidavit was misleading, and that he should not have
signed it. ``I trusted him,'' he explained.

MONARCHS BRING FLAG TO KANSAS CITY IN 1924, TONIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BLAIR KERKHOFF  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Negro League World Series started for
many of the same reasons as the white World Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two leagues squabbled, battled for players, bragged that their
league was better and thought they could make a lot of money, which
proved incorrect. It wasn't National and American, but the
established Negro National League of Midwest teams and the upstart
Eastern Colored League of teams along the Eastern seaboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only natural the feuding would be settled by a showdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a showdown it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Negro World Series in 1924 lasted nearly three weeks
and was played in four cities. The best-of-nine format went the
distance and beyond. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Kansas City Monarchs prevailed over Hilldale of
Philadelphia. The pennant's 75th anniversary will be recognized by
the Kansas City Royals on Saturday as part of African-American
Heritage Night. The Royals will wear replicas of the Monarchs
uniform. The Indians will wear the uniform of the 1946 Cleveland
Buckeyes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been fun if the Royals and Phillies could have
played an interleague game for the occasion,'' said Negro League
Museum curator and historian Ray Doswell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1924 occasion came off only after J.W. ``Wilkie'' Wilkinson,
the Monarchs' white owner, Hilldale owner Ed Bolden and Negro
Leagues president Rube Foster ended their bickering and settled on
sites and how to share the gate receipts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the major-league series, the Negro Leagues decided to
take their games to neutral sites to showcase their event. The
first two games were scheduled for Hilldale Park in Darby, Pa., and
then two would be played in Baltimore. Games five through seven
were set for Muehlebach Field in Kansas City. The final two games,
if the series went the distance, would be played in Chicago's
Schorling Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why Baltimore and Chicago? Although the Negro League had been in
operation for only four years it had grown into one of the nation's
top black-owned enterprises. With 16 teams in the two leagues,
interest was soaring and fans in those cities had strongly
supported the Baltimore Black Sox and Chicago American Giants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1923 the leagues were drawing over 400,000 fans a year,''
said Bob Kendrick, the museum's director of marketing. ``Often
games were booked like a concert is today. They went where the fans
were and where they could get the stadiums.'' &QL; 
Strength vs. strength
</P>
<P>
   The series set up as a battle between the Monarchs' booming bats
against Hilldale's pitching prowess and the Philadelphia team was
called the favorite by the black press. Each had a player who would
later be elected to the Hall of Fame: Monarchs pitcher/outfielder
Wilbur ``Bullet Joe'' Rogan and Hilldale infielder Judy Johnson,
and both were outstanding in the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rogan not only was the league's best all-round player, ``he is
one of the most popular players in the game with a pleasing
personality,'' reported the Kansas City Call, which went on to crow
that Rogan once struck out Bob Meusel of the Yankees four times in
a row during a barnstorming game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was ``an asset to any team,'' the Call wrote, but
Hilldale's great strength lied in a pitching staff of ``Spitball
King'' Phil Cockrell, Lefty Winters, Red Ryan, Scrip Lee and former
Monarchs pitcher Rube Currie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was Cockrell's wet ball that caused his three
throwing errors in the first game Oct. 3 and allowed the Monarchs
to win the opener 6-2. Hilldale committed eight errors in all in an
embarrassing performance. Rogan took the victory. The Monarchs, a
road victory in their pocket, were flush with confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The feeling eroded quickly. Johnson tripled in two runs among
his three hits, Winters scattered four hits, and Hilldale romped in
the second game 11-0. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scene shifted to Baltimore, where game three ended in a 6-6
tie, called for darkness after 13 innings. Two Kansas City errors
in the ninth allowed Hilldale to push across the tying run. Rogan
drove in three runs and pitched a scoreless 13th inning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lapses cost the Monarchs in a 4-3 loss in the fourth
game. Hilldale pushed across the winning run in the ninth after
loading the bases with none out. Second baseman Newt Allen fielded
a grounder but threw wild to catcher Frank Duncan, allowing Johnson
to score the winning run. &QL; 
Back home
</P>
<P>
   Despite trailing in the series, the Monarchs were treated to a
royal welcome when their train pulled into Union Station. More than
5,000 fans and a 50-piece band greeted the team, which was escorted
to 18th Street and a parade in their honor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philadelphia team ... appears to be a rather cocky bunch
of ballplayers since they've been able to get the jump on the
Monarchs,'' reported The Kansas City Times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Times challenged any doubter of the quality of Negro League
baseball to take in the games, and many white fans did. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no dubious attitudes concerning the brand of
baseball to be exhibited ... all the elements of big-league
baseball will be present,'' The Times reported before the fifth
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The series was big news in the nation's black press but wasn't
ignored in Kansas City's white press. Reports of each game and a
box score appeared in the morning Kansas City Times or evening
Kansas City Star. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But The Times and The Star and nearly ever other newspaper in
America was caught up in the ``other'' World Series between the New
York Giants and Washington Senators, featuring one of the game's
greatest pitchers in Kansas native Walter Johnson. Huge crowds
gathered outside The Star's office each day to follow the progress
of games from New York and Washington on a giant scoreboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 150 fans from Philadelphia followed Hilldale to the
Midwest, paid their $1.65 for a reserved seat or $1 general
admission at Muehlebach Field, and felt good about their team's
chances. Hilldale was ahead in the series, outhitting the Monarchs
.246 to .182, and believed Kansas City didn't win the opening game
as much as it had lost it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hilldale felt even better about itself after winning the opener
at Kansas City 5-2 by scoring four runs in the ninth, two coming on
Johnson's homer to center. The Monarchs committed five errors, four
in the final two innings, sending home 7,000 disappointed fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some good news for the Monarchs. A 6-5 victory in the
sixth game and a 4-3 triumph in 12 innings the next day tied the
series. Manager Jose Mendez, a Cuban and former pitcher, inserted
himself in the ninth after Hilldale had tied it. He retired the
side and the next nine batters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On to Chicago, where the Monarchs pulled off the most dramatic
victory of the series in the eighth game. Trailing 2-0 in the
ninth, Kansas City had two outs and Rogan on second. An infield
single moved him to third, and Rogan scored on Hurley McNair's
single. Frank Duncan then blasted a two-run double down the
left-field line for the game-winner. &QL; 
Winner takes all
</P>
<P>
   Hilldale fought off elimination with a 5-3 victory. Seventeen
days and thousands of traveling miles after the opener, the series
came down to a final game on a cold Oct. 20 day in Chicago. Even
though Rogan hadn't pitched since the opening game in Kansas City,
the 37-year-old Mendez, who had undergone arm surgery earlier in
the year, picked himself as the starter for the decisive game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mendez -- ``El Diamante Negro'' (the black diamond), as he was
known in Cuba -- knew something about pressure games. New York
Giants manager John McGraw tried to sign him in 1905 but was
rebuffed by owners intent on keeping the major leagues white. In
1908, Mendez pitched 25 scoreless innings against the Cincinnati
Reds, who were touring Cuba. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Mendez struck out Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford in a
1-0 victory over the American League champion Tigers. He came to
the Monarchs because of his relationship with Wilkinson, who had
signed him for his touring All-Nation's team in the 1910s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Mendez was nearly unhittable, surrendering three
harmless singles and walking one. Hilldale didn't come close to
scoring and when the Monarchs pushed across five runs in the
eighth, the championship was theirs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Call stripped the bold-lettered headline across the top:
``MENDEZ PITCHES MONARCHS TO CHAMPIONSHIP.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sportswriters speak of Cy Young, Chief Bender, Mordecai Brown
and others who had many ballgames behind them as super-athletes,''
the Call reported. ``If they were super, what of Jose Mendez, who
gets off an operating table to pitch a (three)-hit shutout on a
cold day. And his years on this earth and on the ball diamonds
exceeds theirs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The celebration in Kansas City didn't last long. No sooner did
the Monarchs return that several headed south to extend their
seasons with other teams. They needed the money. The World Series
proved not to be the financial bonanza envisioned by officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 10-game attendance totaled 45,857 producing gate receipts of
$52,113.90. The largest crowd attended the Oct. 12 game in Kansas
City when 8,885 paid. After expenses, about $23,000 was distributed
to the owners of the participating teams and second- and
third-place teams in each league. The Monarchs shared $4,927.53, or
about $300 each. That's $30 per game. They could have made more
barnstorming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shares grew smaller in 1925 when the Monarchs lost to
Hilldale in the second World Series and the event was discontinued
after the 1927 series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for one year, the interest was high, the crowds were
adequate, the play was sometimes exceptional and the Monarchs were
champions of baseball, Kansas City's first major championship
team. &QL;

SECOND ATTACK KEY TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER VERDICT IN SLEEPWALKING
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER, RICHARD RUELAS   
 and VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In the end, it wasn't the 44 stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Scott Falater's second attack on his wife _ when he held
her head under the water of their backyard pool _ that convinced a
jury Friday he was guilty of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting defense claims that Falater was sleepwalking during
the bloody 1997 assault on his wife, Yarmila, the Maricopa County
Superior Court panel returned a guilty verdict after just eight
hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at the news conference after the trial what message
the guilty verdict sent, one juror, Theresa Beaubien of Glenale
said, ``You can't get away with murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater didn't flinch as the court clerk read the verdict, which
ended a monthlong trial that attracted international attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he anticipated the verdict,'' defense attorney Michael
Kimerer said later Friday. ``We certainly knew that if the jury
came back that soon it was not going to be a good verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is despondent,'' Kimerer said. ``You've just been convicted
of first-degree murder and you don't understand how this crime
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater based his bid for acquittal on the claim that his
conscious mind had remained asleep for 45 to 50 minutes as he
stabbed his wife 44 times, stashed the bloody clothes, then dragged
her into the backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   But that second attack, jurors said after the trial, removed
their ``reasonable doubt'' about the prosecution's charge. They
said they reached agreement late Thursday, but when several members
wanted a night to sleep on it, they waited until Friday to take the
final vote.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45 Friday morning, the jury informed Maricopa County
Superior Court Judge Ronald Reinstein that it had reached a
verdict. Less than an hour later, the packed courtroom heard the
announcement that could lead to Falater's execution.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, with the expressionless calm he showed during much of
the trial, turned to comfort his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay strong, mom,'' Falater said to Lois Wilcek, who sat
directly behind him, eyes red with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they do this?'' she asked her husband, stunned at
the fate of the oldest of her five children, a gifted former
Motorola engineer and self-proclaimed nerd who owns several patents
on electronics devices.
</P>
<P>
   Falater hugged Kimerer. A few minutes later, the dark-suited,
newly stamped convict was escorted by sheriff's deputies back to
the Madison Street Jail, where he has worn inmate's stripes ever
since that bloody night at the Phoenix home he shared with his wife
and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors then spoke with reporters about a complex and
gripping case that featured experts clashing over the emerging
science of sleep disorders, Falater friends and colleagues who
vouched for his character and the defendant himself, who sobbed on
the stand about killing the woman he called his soulmate and
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came off as an honest, law-abiding citizen, but I think
we're all capable of doing things,'' said juror Denise Aguirre, a
UPS driver from Phoenix. ``None of us know what happened there. We
don't know what triggered this.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Landrum, a Phoenix salesman, said he was not surprised
that witnesses for the prosecution could identify no serious rift
in the Falater marriage, no clear motive for a brutal murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no evidence of a motive,'' he acknowledged. But
then, speaking from the experience of his own failed marriage, he
added, ``If I'm having a relationship problem, there's only two
people that's going to know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find a motive, the jurors looked for a way to
understand the killing, which Kimerer portrayed as an involuntary,
senseless eruption in the peaceful domestic landscape of a happy
and prosperous family.
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors concluded that Falater may have been sleepwalking
when he first attacked his wife, stabbing her repeatedly next to
the pool pump.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of the stab wounds _ 44 _ suggested that he must
have awakened at some point, they said. The second attack at the
pool, which was witnessed by next-door neighbor, convinced them.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said he formed two basic scenarios for the attack. In
one, Falater was ``fully conscious and wide awake.'' In the other,
Falater was sleepwalking when he stabbed Yarmila, then awoke and
``panicked and tried to cover it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre said she was one of four jurors who expressed
``reasonable doubt'' about the prosecution case when the panel
began deliberations Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the eyewitness account of neighbor Greg Koons, who described
Falater's complex movements leading up to the grim incident at the
pool, persuaded her and others that the sleepwalking defense made
no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deciding factors were that we did not think it was
probable or likely for the sequence of detailed events that took
place to have happened while the person was basically
unconscious,'' said Michael Riley, a manager at Intel and the jury
foreman.
</P>
<P>
   John Merrill, a supervisor at a Gila River Reservation casino,
agreed that Koons was vital to the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been no eyewitness, he probably would have gotten
away with it,'' Merril said. ``But Greg Koons' testimony was just
too damning.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill also thought Falater could have been sleepwalking when
he stabbed Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when he dragged the body, I think he woke up. He could
have been sleepwalking and then he woke up and he saw, `Oh, look at
this. What have I done?' and I think he panicked and he dragged the
body over.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawna Wilkeyson said she thought Falater was wide awake during
the knife attack. She said the attack occurred too early that night
for Falater to have had time to fall into the deep sleep during
which sleepwalking occurs, according to expert testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some very heated discussions,'' said Riley, adding that
the panel took very seriously its responsibility in a
first-degree-murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the group weighed heavily the discrepancies between
defense and proseuction experts on sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, that's what made the deliberations so hard. We had
two groups of experts that were telling us the exact opposite
things. It came down to a choice of whose experts do you believe.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Aguirre said she found the experts to be of little
value. ``All the experts, they all have their own theory. . . .
They just confused me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors said they were unimpressed by Falater's
expressions of grief on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too rehearsed,'' said Wilkeyson. ``One of the things we
talked about was (that) during questioning by the defense he looked
at the jury almost the whole time. When the state questioned him,
he didn't look at the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Beaubien, a Glendale housewife, said Falater's interview
with a homicide detective the night of Yarmila's death contradicted
his sleepwalking claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted the fact that his wife was dead too easily, and
the fact that he did it,'' she said. ``Wouldn't you be totally
astounded that you did it? Wouldn't you be incredibly remorseful
and crying and so upset?'' While defense attorney Kimerer declined
to speak after the verdict, prosecutor Juan Martinez expressed
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least for today, Yarmila's soul can perhaps get some
peace,'' he said, his eyes bloodshot with fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has never lost a murder case, said he thought
about Yarmila each day of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a good mother,'' he said. ``She cared incredibly for
her kids. She assumed the role of wife. She participated in her
church. It's a shame it had to come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he sympathizes most with the Falater's two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something they will carry with them for the rest of
their lives,'' Martinez said. ``It will affect them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial started, he had filed his intention to seek the
death penalty. However, County Attorney Rick Romley said Friday
that his office will revisit that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Romley congratulated Martinez, the Phoenix police and the jury
for their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I think we need to sit back and kind of remember what
this was about, everybody,'' Romley said at a press conference.
``This was about a very, brutal senseless murder of a very good
woman.'' &QL;

<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn was back at first base on Friday
night and Todd Greene was fine with that.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   The lineup change afforded Greene, a catcher, some time to rest
his knees. He had little time to prepare, though, as Anaheim Angels
manager Terry Collins made the decision just prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that it was happening, when I looked at the lineup card
coming in,'' Greene said. ``I change like this depends on Mo, so he
must be up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players currently on the disabled list made their
appearances in the Angels clubhouse before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was setup man Mike James, looking as if he just
rolled in from the beach. James, who dyes his hair blond, sported
some other unusual attire _ a diamond nose stud, and one in his
lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   No word on when he will be back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Another injured Angel hanging around Friday was Tim Salmon. The
outfielder worked out his throwing arm while resting his injured
left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Collins noted most players have one of two reactions when they
see injured teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two fronts to it,'' he said. ``There are guys who
see Jimmy (Edmonds), Salmon and James and (Mike) Colangeo and Pep
Harris in there and it's a come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to some others these guys could also be a light at the end
of the tunnel _ `they are here, they are starting to work, so there
is hope.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for his thoughts, Collins was non-committal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say what I think about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tough times: While Thursday's win over Seattle was the Angels'
third in four games the team is still struggling. Coming into
Friday's game, Anaheim had won just six of its previous 18 games
and trailed 7-2 before rallying in the eighth for Thursday's 12-7
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Making their pitches: Thursday's game was a milestone for Scott
Schoenweis, who recorded his first big-league win. Mark Petkovsek
got credit for his first major-league save.

FAMED FERRY KALAKALA MAY HAVE BROUGHT WITH IT AN OIL-EATING
BACTERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They knew the ferry Kalakala was historic.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew it had a lot of rust.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't know was that the old boat rescued from the
Alaska mud last year was also a giant petri dish for what may be a
new strain of oil-spill eating bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The microbe, found in bilge gunk shortly after its arrival at
Pier 66 on Seattle's waterfront last year, has been tentatively
named for the vessel: pseudomonas Kalakala 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now being studied by a local bio-tech firm, the life form could
take a bigger bite out of nasty oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have been able to spray this in Prince William
Sound,'' damaged 10 years ago by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, said
Paul Norem, vice president of Martin Environmental Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It's even created something of an international stir among
proponents of using microbial technology to clean up oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an absolute, marvelous, 100 percent breakthrough,'' said
Terrie Trevillion, president of International Landmark
Environmental in British Columbia, which has been around since
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these microbes are found in sweetwater, like lakes.
It's very rare that you find a microbe that lives in a saline
environment like this one does,'' she said. ``I'm really thrilled
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevillion's company does work with biodegradable oil spill
absorbants in Saudi Arabia, where she said the microbe might be
effective on the salty sands.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile, venerable Kalakala, built on the hull of a
burnt-out wreck in 1935, is an art-deco silver slug of a ferry
vessel. The Kalakala, now moored in Seattle's Lake Union awaiting
repairs, once featured dances and bands on its cross-Sound voyages.
In 1967 it became an Alaskan fish processor, mired in mud,
abandoned and rusting away on Kodiak Island when a Seattle man,
Peter Bevis, spearheaded a fight to bring it back to Seattle last
year and restore it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the harbormaster and Coast Guard would let it go to sea,
however, the bilge had to be cleaned last spring. Kalakala
officials asked MET to donate its ``bioremediation'' process, which
employs oil-eating bacteria to devour gunk.
</P>
<P>
   MET donated five gallons of its microbes concentrated in a
chemical, called a surfactant, that breaks hydrocarbons down into
smaller particles. Only water and carbon dioxide are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They followed the directions and they got a clean Kalakala,''
Norem said.
</P>
<P>
   Bevis said the ``super bugs'' cleaned the bilges in two weeks,
dining on a nasty, oily buildup left after three decades of
sedentary life.
</P>
<P>
   How the new ``Kalakala'' strain developed remains a mystery. It
may have already been living in the boat before MET's superbugs
dropped by for lunch. Or it may be a mutated form of those bugs or
... OK, let's not get carried
</P>
<P>
   away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like all the other pseudonomas, a huge genus of
bacteria, small round rods under the microscope,'' said Harry
Colvin, a microbiologist from Bainbridge Island near Seattle
working for MET partners John Martin and Norem.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin is culturing the bacteria in various environments to see
if it is stronger than other oil-eating bacteria that can withstand
saltwater, cold and the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin said naming the bacteria for the Kalakala is so far
``only anecdotal.'' It must go through an official process to
determine if it is a new genus before it gets named for the place
where it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of characterizing it and the next step is
to see if the ones isolated from that particular sample can be
grown for product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norem said hydrocarbon-eating bacteria already exist naturally
in the soil and water. MET, which has acquired microbes from
locations as diverse as Texas and Alaska's North Slope, simply
enhances, cultivates and concentrates the microbes. The rod-shaped
bacteria are then put in a nutrient, to stay alive, and a
``surfactant,'' a chemical that breaks down hydrocarbons, Norem
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them something to sink their teeth into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bevis, meanwhile, said he is trying to work out a few bugs of
another kind to restore the old ferry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say there are still some past-due bills and
snafus from the previous administration that didn't keep track of
some bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bevis, however, said the Kalakala foundation he oversees expects
to raise enough money to get the boat into dry dock by the end of
the year, so its hull can be examined and repairs estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation hopes to acquire a $285,000 federal grant by fall
through the Interstate Transportation Enhancement Act. It first
must raise $195,000 on its own for the feds to match, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's confident it will happen, considering the level of support
for the old boat that's still out there. Visitors and the
all-volunteer staff celebrate weekly potlucks every Wednesday
beside the ferry. The most recent one commemorated the anniversary
of the Kalakala's refloating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need big bucks for dry dock, but things are better
than they were a year ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the boat was stuck in the mud, though millions of
tiny laborers were quietly working in its bilges.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the past week manager Davey Johnson and
general manager Kevin Malone have met a few times regarding the
direction of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and what they can do to turn
around the team's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he won't make a move just for the sake of doing so.
But if the Dodgers continue their downward journey, Malone said he
won't stand still and watch the season end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not panic. There's no need for that,'' Malone said. ``But
we're not close to the top right now, and if that's the case we
have to make changes or modifications. If we get the offense
untracked, we'll get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't (make a move) unless it's the right thing to do. But
we're in fourth place. How much further down do we have to be to do
something?''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers don't have favorable conditions to make a
blockbuster deal, since most of their marquee players are locked
into multiyear deals.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the cost-cutting, early-season trade of Dave Mlicki
constantly haunting them, the Dodgers don't figure to move one of
their starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup lingo: Johnson continued his lineup tweaking by switching
Eric Karros to the cleanup spot and moving Raul Mondesi down a slot
to fifth. Johnson said he did it for a night because the slumping
Mondesi, who's homered once in his past 81 at-bats, entered the
night with a .150 career average against Giants starter Shawn
Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi had struck out nine times in 20 at-bats against Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also started Trenidad Hubbard in center field and batted
him second, giving Devon White his second straight day off. Johnson
said he'll probably rest Eric Karros today against right-hander
Chris Brock and start left-handed hitter Todd Hollandsworth at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, Perez return: Todd Hundley caught the last two innings
in Thursday's loss to San Diego, but that wasn't planned. However,
his start today against the Giants was set. After spending 11 days
in Camp Dempsey, Hundley gets his first start.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 games, Hundley has worked on his throwing
mechanics and built arm strength by throwing balls to second and
third base under the guidance of bullpen coach Rick Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be foolish to say Todd's going to go in there and throw
better than (Angel) Pena,'' Dempsey said. ``He's been able to work
and do what he hasn't been able to do for a long time. It was good,
and we made improvements. He's going to have to keep working at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Perez (2-8, 7.38 ERA) returns for at least one more
start. He last pitched June 16, getting pulled after allowing four
runs in 31/3 innings. But Johnson's been pleased with Perez's side
work, much of which focused on long-tossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to loosen his shoulder,'' Johnson said. ``He's
been throwing from left field to home. That's the way you used to
test starting pitchers. If you couldn't throw from the left field
wall to home plate, you wouldn't start.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna update: When Antonio Osuna underwent elbow surgery in May,
the Dodgers hoped he would be back between the All-Star break and
Aug.1. Before the game at 3Com, Osuna threw his second bullpen
session, after which Johnson said the right-handed reliever could
be ready to begin a rehab stint late next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have three good sessions, and preferably four,''
Johnson said. ``He's going to throw again Sunday. We'll see how it
feels on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna threw fastballs and change-ups in his first two workouts.
He's slated to throw breaking pitches in Sunday's session. Johnson
acknowledged if things went well, Osuna could begin a rehab
assignment late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Giants manager Dusty Baker said
outfielder Ellis Burks (right knee inflammation) would be activated
from the disabled list today.... Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown
entered the night leading the National League with a 2.92 ERA.

YANKS WIN A WILD ONE OVER ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ When the Yankees and Orioles face off in Camden
Yards, they do not play baseball. Rather, they produce the missing
link of sport, infinite contests of artless wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Orioles combined for 29 hits in 3 hours 32
minutes Friday night, and ultimately, the Yankees prevailed, 9-8,
after Shane Spencer led off the ninth inning with a 415-foot home
run off Baltimore's Mike Timlin. The Yankees have won four straight
games and are 43-28; the Orioles (32-40) have lost three straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees blew a 7-4 lead, mostly due to Harold Baines'
three-run home run in the seventh inning, his second home run of
the game. But Tino Martinez tied the score, 8-8, in the eighth with
his fourth hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later Timlin fell behind Spencer, two balls and no
strikes, before throwing a thigh-high fastball that Spencer crushed
into the back of the Orioles' bullpen beyond the left-center-field
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time we play them in this ball park, it's
one of these types of games'' Yankee manager Joe Torre said. ``To
win a ball game like that, especially late, it's a huge lift for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he got the sense that Spencer was going to do
something notable in that at-bat. ``Especially 2-and-0, just the
way he was standing up there looking relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ended the game with Joe Girardi catching because
Jorge Posada left the game during his seventh-inning at-bat with a
mild contusion of his left thumb. He incurred the injury while
swinging, but he later said that he believed he would be able to
start on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, four couches in the middle of the Yankee
clubhouse were turned inward, forming a square. Before batting
practice, about half of the Yankees joined in an impromptu
discussion about the 50 greatest athletes of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The debate went on and on, Derek Jeter, Scott Brosius, Bernie
Williams and others arguing. The sight of that many players engaged
in any activity in a clubhouse is extraordinarily rare, and
telling.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was in the midst of the prattle, grinning, a little
tanner after three days in the Tampa Bay area. Martinez is from
Tampa, and the Yankees' trip there seemed to do good for his
batting average and peace of mind: he was 6 for 13 against the
Devil Rays with a double, triple, two home runs and six runs batted
in, and the confidence carried over into tonight's unprepossessing
triumph over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   To win in claustrophobic Camden Yards, Torre was saying before
Friday night's game, you must be able to throw two types of pitches
effectively, to prevent opposing hitters from anticipating a
fastball and pumping long fly balls into the seats. Hideki Irabu
started for the Yankees Friday night and had a less than mediocre
fastball, an uncontrollable curveball and a hanging splitter. And
Irabu was the better of the starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Scott Erickson needed 25 pitches in the first inning
and 27 in the third, a trend that lasted as long as he was on the
mound. The Yankees picked and pounded on him; two runs in the first
inning, another in the third, one apiece in the fourth and in the
fifth. Through five innings, Chuck Knoblauch had two hits and a
walk and an RBI, Paul O'Neill had hit the ball hard a couple of
times, and Martinez had two hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 5-3, after 4 1/2 innings, but then Charles
Johnson ripped a home run off Irabu in the Orioles' fifth and it
was 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees closed out Erickson in the sixth inning, adding
two more runs _ the second on a two-out double by Martinez, his
third hit. Strangely, Baltimore manager Ray Miller had chosen to
leave Erickson in the game, rather than replace him with the
left-hander Doug Johns; left-handed batters were hitting just .184
against Johns this year.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's passed ball cost the Yankees a run in the Orioles'
sixth, however, and in the seventh, the left-handed Mike Stanton
allowed back-to-back singles to B.J. Surhoff and Albert Belle. The
Yankees still led by two runs, and Baines had not hit a home run
against a left-hander this year; Stanton had not permitted a home
run to anyone in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Baines rocketed a three-run home run to
straightaway center field. As Baines circled the bases with his
367th career home run and his 1,531st RBI, Stanton circled behind
the mound, removed his cap and yelled in frustration.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell was bent down, grabbing his shorts
in exhaustion after his last shot of the night fell short of the
rim, and the San Antonio Spurs celebrated an NBA championship with
a 78-77 Game 5 victory Friday night at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The indefatigable Sprewell was not going to run out on the
Knicks in the game of their lives. He had hurt his team with his
mindless play early in the game, but embodying the spirit of a team
that would not let a setback foil their enchanted ride through the
playoffs, Sprewell made up for his indiscretions with 35 points. He
was just two short of another miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who missed nine of his first 12 shots and was a
liability on defense until early in the third quarter, finished the
game 13-of-27 shooting with 14 points in the fourth quarter. He was
the perfect frenetic counter for the Spurs' quiet superstar, Tim
Duncan, who finished with 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Duncan's Spurs were too tall, too deep and too
healthy as they prevailed in the series, four games to one, and
captured their first league title.
</P>
<P>
   With Allan Houston by his side, Sprewell helped erase an
11-point third-quarter deficit and put the Knicks ahead, 66-63,
with nine minutes left in the game on only his fourth 3-pointer of
the playoffs. The game went back and forth from there. Avery
Johnson gave the Spurs a 78-77 lead with 47.6 seconds left on a
jumper from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell missed a wild jumper with 27 second left. After a shot
by David Robinson did not hit the rim, he got his own rebound and
fired the ball to Johnson, who missed a 3-pointer as the clock
wound down. Sprewell had a chance to win it, but his fall-away
jumper at the buzzer fell way short.
</P>
<P>
   About three hours before the game, league officials were
choreographing the championship trophy ceremony, preparing
themselves for the Spurs' eventual victory. In the background,
coach Jeff Van Gundy leaned against a railing and watched.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not want the Spurs to celebrate on their court.
But they were not playing this just to save face; they were out
there to win. And then, well, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks looked to take fate in their own hands by doing the
little things to start the game. They were all over the Spurs'
pick-and-roll, disrupting the passing lanes that had been open in
Game 4. They were also driving the ball into the lane and not
flinching at the sight of Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   That effort gave the Knicks a rousing 30-22 lead with eight
minutes left in the second quarter after a wild, driving layup by
Houston. The fans were up, the Knicks were high on their lead. But
the Spurs remained patient and methodical and seized the
opportunity when the Knicks suffered a series of mental lapses
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprewell energized the crowd with a flashy steal and a
vicious fast-break dunk with 1:36 left in the first half, he turned
right around and left Jaren Jackson open for a 3-pointer in the
closing seconds. Jackson's shot ended a 16-6 run that left the
Spurs ahead, 40-38, at the break. In the final seven minutes of the
half, the Knicks turned the ball over three times and helplessly
watched Duncan score six of his 16 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks countered with Houston's scoring 10 points. Sprewell
was 3 for 11 from the field and was 4 for 6 from the free-throw to
add an inefficient 10 points. While disappointed by the finish to
the half, the Knicks were within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   They had to pay attention, though. The Spurs were experts at
turning up their game at the start of the third quarter. In Game 4,
they opened with a 9-0 run. Friday night, they started the third on
a 7-0 run as the Knicks turned the ball over three times and missed
their first four shots coming out of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes into the third quarter, the Spurs were ahead,
47-38. A livid Van Gundy, especially irritated at Sprewell's
defense, called a timeout and imparted a few harsh words. Whatever
he said, the Knicks got their act together. With the help of a
driving layup by Houston, followed by a jumper from him, the Knicks
pulled within four, 47-43. That led coach Gregg Popovich to call a
timeout with 7:14 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. Sprewell began making amends for his rough
start. Charlie Ward stripped Johnson on a drive, then sent a pass
to Sprewell, who went up and over Jackson for an emphatic
two-handed dunk that drew a foul. After that 3-point play, he hit a
jumper to put the Knicks ahead, 48-47, with five minutes left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic turnaround led by the Knicks' most flamboyant
player. After hitting just three of his first 12 shots, he came
back with three scores in a row. The Knicks were ahead, 52-50, with
3:28 remaining in the third. Suddenly, the shot clock on the Spurs'
side of the court went out, and there was a delay of several
minutes while a portable clock was brought in and placed in the
left corner of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The play stoppage went on as Popovich argued that both teams
should have the same shot-clock position to create the same playing
conditions. He won his argument, and a clock was positioned at the
Knicks' end. But what would this cooling-off period do to the
Knicks' momentum?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. Duncan took over. He touched the ball every time
down the floor and either scored or drew a foul. In a compact
flurry, Duncan scored nine points in the last two minutes to give
the Spurs a 59-58 lead after the third.
</P>
<P>
   The night began well enough for the Knicks. Despite a miserable
series created by an injured knee and wounded pride from being
dominated by Duncan, Johnson worked inside the paint for a couple
of early layups to help get the Knicks off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   And Houston was stopping at nothing. He was nailing the baseline
jumper, and he even slapped the floor in an uncommon display of
emotion when he leaned in and drew contact at the buzzer of the
first quarter. No foul was called, and Houston put his right hand
into the hardwood with the Knicks ahead, 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion was there, just as it has been for the Knicks the
entire finals. But the Knicks were also playing smart at this
point. They were taking away the lob passes to Robinson and Duncan,
holding off Johnson's penetration and keeping up on the boards.
They were giving themselves a chance to put the ball in Houston's
hands, and he gave them a 30-22 lead midway through the second
quarter on a twisting, driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Houston then popped a nine-foot jumper that left the Knicks
ahead, 32-24, with 6:23 left in the second quarter. But then their
emotion got the best of them. After stripping a steal, Houston flew
out on a fast break and sent an alley-oop pass to Sprewell from 20
feet away. It was too much, and too high. Sprewell couldn't gather
it and a chance was blown with the Spurs down, 34-28, with four
minutes left in the half.

SPORTS COLUMN: WITH A DRAMATIC FLAIR, BRING GRUNFELD BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Time To Say Goodbye.'' That's the song they played
in the Garden when the befuddled Rik Smits lumbered to the bench
with his sixth personal foul in the last game of the Indiana
series. (Surely you remember the Indiana series. Your short-term
memory can't be that shot.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a cute touch. The addled Dutchman trudging off the court,
with Andrea Bocelli serenading him in English, long distance, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what would transpire late in the network's prime-time
night, the men's basketball season was officially over in the land
of the knish and the calzone.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were unable to escape the coup de grace Friday night
in Seventh Avenue's Most Famous Arena, losing 78-77 to the Spurs,
who did not need to return to San Antonio to deliver the final
chop.
</P>
<P>
   So it was time to croon sweet nothings at Larry Johnson and the
rest of the Knicks. The next players on the court, the New York
Liberty, will not cuss anybody out the way L.J. did to a league
official the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty on the court. Joy Fawcett and Carla Overbeck, the
soccer moms, in the World Cup. Steffi and Venus and Alexandra at
Wimbledon. The summer of the women. Not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for the fans to finally get some fresh air. Time for
everybody's minds and ears to recuperate from the witless blare of
the Garden sound system. The Knicks closed up shop at their home
court with the same swirl of confusion that has plagued the
organization since the lockout ended. Somehow this dysfunctional
group became the first eighth-seeded team to reach the NBA finals,
a fitting epitaph for this short, strange season.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, they must move forward. On Thursday, Jeff Van Gundy
said that he had been assured by Dave Checketts that the coaching
job was his for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's conciliatory tone made it seem fairly sure that he
was not going to put on his Johnny Paycheck tape and tell Checketts
just what he could do with the job, which would have been
interesting. As a result, the Nets have done the belated right
thing by hiring Don Casey, a basketball lifer, who restored calm in
the smoldering ashes of John Calipari's flameout.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks are going to have to find a general manager. They
haven't had one since April, when Checketts took Grunfeld to dinner
and started to sing, ``Time to Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are going to need somebody to make trades, sign
players to long contracts, unless Checketts _ a basketball man,
essentially _ is going to revert to that role.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night would have really been the ideal time to do it. The
lights could have dimmed and an announcement could have been made
introducing the next general manager of the Knicks, and to the boom
of the sound system and the flash of the lights, out could have
come _ tah-dah! _ Ernie Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? George Steinbrenner did it with Billy Martin. Fired
him, then trotted him out on Old-Timers' Day and introduced him as
the next Yankee manager. Totally nuts. Totally George.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that Checketts is not Steinbrenner, and Grunfeld
is not Martin, and be correct on both counts. But, as Checketts
suggested when he hired Latrell Sprewell, where is it written that
a man cannot have a second chance? It was Grunfeld, after all, who
shipped Good Old John to Golden State for Sprewell. It was
Grunfeld, after all, who shipped Good Old Oak to Toronto for Marcus
Camby. So it took a little longer for the team to jell than the new
Garden owners wanted to wait. Tough.
</P>
<P>
   With Checketts' collaboration, Grunfeld had the wisdom to see
the need for new energy, in Sprewell and in Camby. When Checketts
was scuttling Ernie, he was also criticizing his own judgment. (He
didn't quite put it that way, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   All it would take is a dollop of flexibility. I don't recall
Steinbrenner's saying he was wrong in firing Martin. That was just
what George did on any particular day. He fired Billy. No big deal.
Admittedly, it got a little old, five Billy regimes. But what would
be the harm in a second chance for Grunfeld?
</P>
<P>
   Checketts would not have to apologize. Goodness, no. He would
just say this was the best thing for the organization at this time.
Your normal exec-speak. Then management could summon Van Gundy and
Grunfeld behind closed doors and bang their hard heads together,
and tell them to make nice this time.
</P>
<P>
   It's good enough for the merry king of the Bronx. It could be
good enough for the slick suits of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, no more foul tirades in the Garden. Not for
months.
</P>

SPURS WIN NBA TITLE ON JOHNSON'S JUMP SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally, San Antonio has a reason to forget the
Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Tim Duncan's 31 points and Avery Johnson's crucial
15-foot jumper in the final minute, the Spurs ended a 26-year wait
by clinching their first NBA championship with a thrilling 78-77
victory over the New York Knicks last night at Madison Square
Garden. The Spurs, who rose from the ashes of the old ABA Dallas
Chaparrals in 1973, won the NBA Finals, 4-1, and plan a fiesta on
the Riverwalk tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is a journey that goes to show hard work and
persistence pays off,'' said center David Robinson, the backbone of
the franchise since 1989. ``It's a dream that I've been waiting to
come true for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who averaged 27 points and 14 rebounds in the series,
nailed down the Finals MVP by winning a memorable individual
shootout with New York's Latrell Sprewell (35 points).
</P>
<P>
   As they did throughout their dominant season the Spurs won with
defense, holding the Knicks without a point in the final 3:12.
</P>
<P>
   They took a 78-77 lead on Johnson's 15-foot baseline jumper with
47 seconds remaining. Sprewell then got the ball on the right wing,
but was forced into a rare miss on an 18-foot jumper when Duncan
double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson then spun into the lane, but his shot failed to hit the
rim. The rebound was tapped to Johnson, who beat the shot clock
with a long heave that hit the rim, but New York's Larry Johnson
got the rebound in the corner with only 2.1 seconds remaining in
the game. The Knicks inbounded to Sprewell in the lane under the
basket, but he was trapped by Duncan and Sean Elliott and his
high-arching 15-footer over Duncan and Robinson came after the
buzzer and failed to hit the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get layup but I got too far under the basket and
they trapped me with those long arms,'' said Sprewell, who kept the
big-hearted, small-bodied Knicks in the game by hitting 13 of 27
shots. ``We didn't want them to celebrate on our court but they
deserved it. They are the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Without raising their voice, raising the roof or even raising
interest in the NBA Finals, the Spurs can finally raise a
championship banner. By doing a Texas two-step in the heart of the
Big Apple, the bigger, better Spurs capped a season in which they
won 46 of their last 53 games and cruised to a 15-2 record in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible feeling,'' said Duncan, who pulled out a
video camera to record the celebration before the trophy
presentation. ``These guys just hung together all season and
tonight was no different. We won games like this all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Sprewell staged one of the more memorable one-on-one
shows in Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the fourth quarter, Duncan scored 15 of 16 Spurs
points and Sprewell scored 14 in a row for the Knicks. With
seemingly boundless energy, Sprewell got San Antonio's defense on
its heels with a couple of drives and then hit a variety of
jumpers, including a pull-up 3-pointer gave the Knicks a 66-63
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan answered Sprewell's free throws with one of his own to
pull the Spurs within 77-76 as the clock slipped under two minutes.
After a double-team on Sprewell forced a shot-clock violation,
Robinson missed a short left-handed hook as he was bumped without a
call. On New York's next possession, Larry Johnson clanged a long
3-pointer off the back rim to set up Johnson's baseline jumper.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio survived a shot-clock malfunction and an amazing
11-point performance by Sprewell to take a 59-58 lead into the
fourth quarter. With their shot clock having gone out and a
replacement fixated awkwardly in the corner on the floor instead of
on top of the backboard, the Spurs seemed un-nerved as the Knicks
rallied from a nine-point deficit to take a 54-50 lead. Duncan,
however, calmly responded by scoring the Spurs' last nine points on
two bank-shots, two free throws and a three-point play in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs tried to knock out the Knicks early in the third,
scoring the first seven points of the second half to continue a
13-0 run. While the Knicks didn't score on their first eight
possessions, Jackson filled in for an ineffective Elliott with a
fast-break layup and 25-foot 3-pointer that pushed San Antonio's
lead to 47-38.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, however, responded with a 10-0 sparked by the speed
and transition aggressiveness of Sprewell, who hit two jumpers and
brought the Garden to its feet with a three-point play dunk over
Jaren Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led the entire first half until Jackson's left-wing
3-pointer with six seconds remaining allowed the Spurs to take a
40-38 lead into the locker room.

PIAZZA SITS, BUT METS STILL OVERWHELM ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The question was inevitable and Bobby Valentine knew
it was coming. Is this, the New York Mets' manager was asked hours
before Friday night's game with first-place Atlanta, the first
meeting between the division rivals this season, a big series?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was ready with his pat answer. ``It's the one we're
playing,'' he said after a pause. By game's end, the pause had to
come from Atlanta, which suffered a 10-2 loss to New York and saw
its lead in the National League East trimmed to two games.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did allow that the weekend series had some meaning, if
only to give the Mets an opportunity to see what they would be up
against the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who the Braves are,'' Valentine said. ``Now, we're
going to play them and find out what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who are the Braves, Valentine was asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the team in front of us,'' Valentine said.
``Perennial. Forever. And we get to see how we match up against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Mets matched up just fine, even if they had to
do so without their best player, Mike Piazza, who is still bothered
by a stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
   With Todd Pratt behind the plate in Piazza's place, Rick Reed
(6-3) turned in perhaps his strongest outing of the season,
limiting the Braves to one run on six hits in 6 1/3 solid innings.
Benny Agbayani, who has been playing the last two weeks with a
hyperextended left elbow that nearly kept him out of the lineup
Friday, homered to open the scoring. Reed helped his own cause with
a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets won for the 15th time in 18 games and for the first
time in Atlanta since July 13, 1997, a span of nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Since halting their eight-game losing streak on June 6, the Mets
have gained four games on the Braves in the standing. Friday
night's victory was New York's fifth straight and ninth in the last
10 games. They have played 10 straight games without an error, a
club record. And Piazza is expected back for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza awoke this morning and needed to turn his body in order
to turn his head. The symptoms from the mild concussion he suffered
Wednesday night had abated, Piazza said. But his stiff neck had
not.
</P>
<P>
   So Valentine decided he would keep Piazza out of the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a short in the electrical system, a bank of lights at
Turner Field was blacked out for at least two hours before the game
while electricians worked on resolving the problem. The game began
45 minutes late before a sellout crowd of 48,292. And it began with
Piazza on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just stiff,'' Piazza said of his neck. ``But Bobby
totally made the call to have me rest it another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said one of the things that influenced his decision
was Piazza's inability to look up. ``It seems like you'd have to do
that if you catch,'' Valentine said, adding that he did not want
Piazza to do anything to aggravate the injury and keep him out of
the lineup longer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about having to take on the Braves without his best
player, Valentine pointed out that Atlanta was without its
first-string catcher, too. Javy Lopez is on the disabled list with
a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is no Piazza. But, as it turned out, the Mets got by
without Piazza's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Atlanta's rookie left-hander, Odalis Perez, did not
make the Mets' hitters look bad at times. Perez struck out a
career-high nine in 51/3 innings, but the 21-year-old left
trailing, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani opened the scoring when he led off the second inning
with a home run, the rookie outfielder's 11th this season in just
94 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, meanwhile, was mowing down the Braves. And when the Mets
parlayed five singles and two walks into three sixth-inning runs,
Reed had a 4-0 cushion. Reed even drove in the final run of the
inning with a line single to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves answered with a two-out run, when Jones walked, stole
second and scored on Randall Simon's single. But Eddie Perez,
Lopez's replacement, flew out to deep center to end the threat.
And, after the Mets added a run on Roger Cedeno's sacrifice fly in
the seventh, it was a 5-1 game and the National League East race
was getting as tight as Piazza's neck.

ELDER STATESMAN PINCAY RIDES AWAY WITH JOCKEY TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEIDI PEDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Laffit Pincay may be in the twilight of
his riding career, but the 52-year-old proved he still has what it
takes to compete with the best.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, the oldest rider competing, won the first race and
placed in two others last night to win the 1999 NTRA All-Star
Jockey Championship at Lone Star Park with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   With his victory in the first race, he moved one victory closer
to Bill Shoemaker's record of 8,833. Pincay now has 8,757, second
behind Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about the whole thing. I'm very
emotional,'' said Pincay, who won with guest of honor Shoemaker
watching. ``I proved I can still ride with young riders and still
win races.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't unusual pressure for Pincay, who races almost every
day on the tough Southern California circuit. After three races
yesterday he had a three-point edge over Pat Day and defending
event champion Shane Sellers, who also had victories. It was
Pincay's third-place finish in the last race of the evening that
clinched the title and the $18,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
   Youth also made a showing.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Lanerie, Lone Star Park's leading jockey this season _ and
at 24 the youngest rider in the All-Star field _ finished second
with 13 points. Kent Desormeaux, 29, was third with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole competition was great,'' Lanerie said. ``I'm proud
to finish so well. I hope this could be my springboard for my
career. I know it can only help.''
</P>
<P>
   The third annual event showcases some of the country's best
riders, selected by a national panel of experts. Pincay was one of
four Hall of Famers present, along with Chris McCarron, Jerry
Bailey, and Day. Others competing were Alex Solis, Robby Albarado,
1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Chris Antley, Edgar Prado
and Eddie Martin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Pincay has grown accustomed to riding
long shots, and he proved a bit of a long shot himself yesterday in
the All-Star wager, where fans bet on the jockeys instead of the
horses. Pincay paid $20.40 for a $2 bet, while the trifecta of
Pincay, Lanerie and Desormeaux paid a whopping $5,433.00, and the
exacta of Pincay-Lanerie $467.20.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay got off to a strong start, winning the first race by
taking advantage of another's misfortune. Solis fell off
second-favorite Daggett Peak after being bumped by Bailey's horse
out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Without a jockey, Daggett Peak ran near the front of the pack,
and Pincay, on Gold Nugget, followed the horse, then moved inside
of him on the far side to take the lead. Solis walked away from the
incident with a sore neck and rode in the remaining races.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay placed fourth in the third race, leaving the contest to
be decided in the fourth. His horse, Brave Pancho, made a late
inside bid to take the show spot, behind mounts ridden by
Desormeaux and Lanerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last race I was riding for my life to try to win the
championship,'' Pincay said. ``When we hit the wire, I was
desperate to know who was second. I knew Kent won the race, so I
was hoping whoever got second wasn't a guy close to me.''

SPREWELL `IN THE ZONE' FOR A GAME OF A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His head was rocking to and fro, his corn-rowed
braids flopping behind like a spoiler on a souped-up racer.
Ten-footer. Good. Three-pointer from the top of the arc. All net.
The building began to percolate with noise and adrenaline with each
made shot, and now even scaling San Antonio's mountain of 7-footers
seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   In only the most important game of his life, Latrell Sprewell
was feeling it, that sensation you get on a basketball court when
you cannot miss from anywhere on the floor and it just does not
matter who is guarding you.
</P>
<P>
   In playground vernacular, this is called the zone, a dimension
far away from the elbows and forearms on the floor, a kind of
hermetically sealed booth with only two things inside: you and the
rim.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five points on 13-of-26 shooting. That the Knicks could
not take this contentious series back to San Antonio, that he
missed the last shot of the game with time running out and the
Knicks trailing by a point, almost did not seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled his jersey off and walked back to the sideline in
disbelief as his teammates tried to console. Moments later, as the
Spurs celebrated their series-clinching 78-77 victory, the Madison
Square Garden crowd broke in to applause as the Knicks gathered at
midcourt for their post-game prayer. Sprewell took a few moments to
compose himself and join the gathering before doing his last
television interview of the season. He was more sympathetic in
defeat than he had ever been while leading the Knicks on their run
to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   With their season on the line, the Knicks turned to the most
unlikely hero in the post-Michael Jordan era, the player described
18 months ago as a selfish loner and a franchise killer, and he
somehow willed this team back into a game they looked out of early
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he nearly won a shootout against the best player in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was early in the fourth quarter, and the Knicks were doing
everything imaginable to defend Tim Duncan. But he kept making
these impossible shots, off the backboard, straight on.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed someone to duke it out with Duncan, someone to
trade baskets and act like an All-Star _ even if Sprewell had not
been one for three seasons, even if he sat out all of last season
because he committed the most egregious act of disrespect for
authority in the league, choking his coach, an act for which he
will always be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 minutes 58 seconds left, though, he gave everyone
something else to remember. Rocking forward and stepping back for
that pretty jumper. Swish. Then he drew a foul on the other end of
the floor, after Mario Elie had delivered a 3-point dagger.
</P>
<P>
   For about 30 minutes Friday night, Sprewell transported himself
and he transported his team. Midway through the third quarter, the
Spurs and Knicks went back and forth like two kids trading blows in
a pillow fight _ with Sprewell and Duncan winding up and swinging
for the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was tearing down the court on the break, dunking on
Jaren Jackson and drawing a foul with less than five minutes left
to push New York in front.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, with all of the Garden screaming for him to miss, buried a
3-pointer a few steps in front of Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sprewell again, dropping in two jumpers from the perimeter,
clutching his fist, scowling, feeling the rush of the crowd exhort
him on.
</P>
<P>
   On it went, the Game 5 pendulum swinging to and fro with each
huge basket.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy delay to install a new shot clock, Duncan
responded by softly banking shots off the glass, drawing fouls and
going to the line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it ended, Sprewell had hit hardest. His 11-point binge
in the quarter made San Antonio woozy heading into the fourth. The
9-point bulge the Spurs had built after halftime had shrunk to one,
and it was now a matter of pride and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell summoned both, filling it up from everywhere on the
floor. As the fourth quarter began, he dribbled twice and stepped
back on the left wing, launching a perfect swish. And the foul!
</P>
<P>
   The Garden went ballistic, hollering for this imperfect player
who in so many ways was playing the perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell played as well as I have seen anyone play in the
post-season the last five years _ a performance worthy of Jordan's
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   After having been out of the NBA for more than a season,
Sprewell wanted the ball at the end of Game 5 of the finals.
Whether it was in vain or not, he earned a right to be considered
part of this franchise for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   That's what getting in the zone can do for you, take you to not
only places you've never been before but also keep you there for a
while.

<P>
   Now that Chancellor Rudy Crew has removed so many administrators
from New York City's worst schools, he faces the far more difficult
task of replacing them. Finding good candidates to do these
thankless jobs will not be easy, which is why he has hired a
headhunting firm from Washington state to scout for replacements.
But the chancellor and his vocal critic, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
will now have to address the underlying problem _ the educator
brain drain, particularly to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the city loses some of its best educators to softer
and better-paying jobs elsewhere, while the pool of replacements,
especially administrators, grows steadily smaller. There were only
about a dozen applicants for the top job at Manhattan's elite
Stuyvesant High School. At less prestigious schools, the number of
applicants can be as small as three or four. A major reason is that
the principals' union and the city have been bogged down in
contract negotiations for more than three years, despite a city
proposal that salaries would go up almost 30 percent if principals
gave up tenure. Educators who gamble on these high-wire managerial
positions do not need tenure, but they deserve a hefty salary
boost. If the union continues to balk, the state Legislature should
break this stalemate, ending principals' tenure with a law.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, whose contract will expire next year, are also
increasingly hard to find. The rate of new teachers leaving after a
few years is almost twice what it is in other big cities. Moreover,
the city's classrooms are increasingly run by uncertified teachers
as many of the best educators are set to retire over the next four
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   With their annual pay at midcareer a dismal $41,000 a year in
comparison with almost $60,000 in richer suburbs, city teachers
still received some promising news this week. Crew and Randi
Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers,
negotiated a package for extra pay and benefits to certified
teachers willing to tackle jobs in failing schools. This city-union
partnership, as well as Ms. Weingarten's willingness to be flexible
for this experiment, bodes well for these needy schools. The good
will generated by this agreement also raises hopes that teachers'
salaries will be substantially raised next year, at least enough to
keep the best from fleeing the city.

 EDITORIAL: THE SUPREME COURT TIGHTENS THE NOOSE  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The uproar over the Supreme Court's end-of-term decisions
reinforcing its preference for states' rights obscured another
distressing trend _ the court's increasing willingness to overlook
unfair procedures in death penalty cases. In two miserable
decisions shortly before it recessed, the court was so eager to
speed executions that it ignored serious flaws in trial and
sentencing proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   By a 7-2 margin, the court upheld a Virginia man's death
sentence despite the prosecution's suppression of important
evidence that the defense might have used to discredit the key
eyewitness. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens
conceded that the outcome ``might have changed'' had the documents
been disclosed in a timely way to the defense. But that still fell
short, he said, of ``reasonable probability that the result of the
trial would have been different.'' That cavalier conclusion
provoked a scathing response from the two dissenters, Justices
David Souter and Anthony Kennedy. They noted that the death
sentence might well have been averted had just one juror harbored
doubts about the eyewitness' account.
</P>
<P>
   By a narrower, 5-4 margin, the court upheld the death sentence
of a Texas killer despite the trial judge's failure to give
complete instructions to the jury as to the options available to it
in case it deadlocked over the death penalty. One option was a life
sentence without parole. Because it was unaware of this
alternative, the defendant's lawyer argued, the jury felt its only
course was to impose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas case marked the first application of the Federal Death
Penalty Act of 1994, which extended capital punishment to more than
40 federal crimes. Given the majority's casual approach to due
process, the case also marked another low moment for the nation's
highest court.

L.A. FIRM SUED IN BABY SWITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A maker of hospital identification bands has been
sucked into a highly publicized baby-switching incident at the
University of Virginia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Precision Dynamics Corp. is being sued by Paula Johnson, the
mother of one of the babies, who claims that the company's
Veri-Color identification bands' defective design allowed them to
slip off her daughter and another child, leading to the inadvertent
switch about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of the suit is the product put out by Precision
Dynamics and the problems with it,'' said Daniel Zohar, Johnson's
Los Angeles-based attorney. ``The main purpose of this product is
to enable people to identify their babies, and if the band can slip
off and is defectively made so it can slip off easily, it can't
achieve its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Precision Dynamics say the incident stemmed not
from a design flaw in their product, but from human error at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say a September 1998 report on the incident
from the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services blamed
hospital employees for not following procedures such as matching
indentification numbers on the babies' and mothers' bracelets, or
adjusting the bracelets when the babies lost weight, as babies
normally do over their first 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Precision Dynamics has been making the Veri-Color band _ its
most popular design _ since the late 1960s, said Nicholas C.
Curtin, the company's vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The company has never received ``complaints as to the design
being related to a mix-up of babies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication that this band design would contribute
to this unfortunate accident,'' Curtin said. ``It is the University
of Virginia that did not follow through on common procedures in the
maternity care area.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page complaint, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles
Superior Court, does not set any monetary damages. According to
Zohar, in California a plaintiff cannot state the amount of damages
sought in a personal injury lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are seeking monetary damages, though,'' he said,
adding that an amount will be set as the case progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Precision Dynamics has yet to be formally served with the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Johnson discovered through a DNA test that Callie
Marie Conley, the child she had been raising for nearly four years,
was not her biological daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was later discovered that Callie had been inadvertently
switched with another child who at the time was being raised as
Rebecca Grace Chittum. Rebecca was being raised by two sets of
grandparents after the couple who thought they were the child's
parents were killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Johnson filed a $31 million lawsuit against the state of
Virginia, the hospital and its staff claiming negligence and fraud.
She also has sued for custody of Rebecca and wants to legally adopt
Callie.

   NEW YORK _ The Knicks' magic carpet fell to earth with a
disheartening thud Friday night when a potential game-winning shot
by the indefatigable Latrell Sprewell fell to the floor as time ran
out on Game 5 _ and their miracles expired.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the San Antonio Spurs lifted their arms in
celebration at Madison Square Garden over their 78-77 victory and
danced on the Knicks' floor. Taller, deeper, healthier and, in the
end, just better than the Knicks, they had captured their first
National Basketball Association championship by winning the final
series, four games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Only when it was over, as the Spurs' shouts cut through the
sudden silence, did Sprewell grab his shorts and give in to
exhaustion. Only then did the Knicks give in to the ominous
elements that were against them in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   As the undermanned and physically drained Knicks filtered off
the floor, a chant grew for the home team in a crescendo from the
crowd while the Green Day song, ``Time of Your Life,'' played over
the speakers. It was quite a time.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a finish to an improbable and enchanting playoff
run for the Knicks. It ended with Sprewell scoring 35 points in an
effort to match the Spurs' superstar, Tim Duncan, who delivered 31
and was named the series' most valuable player. Smiling a wide
smile, Duncan held the trophy aloft with his fellow 7-footer, David
Robinson, a maligned superstar in seasons past who finally earned
validation for his career with a title.
</P>
<P>
   It came at the expense of a game Knicks team, especially
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all for nothing,'' said a dejected Sprewell, who finished
the game with 14 points in the fourth quarter and a 13-for-27
overall shooting effort after beginning the night 3 for 12. ``I
would rather have those last two points and have the victory. It's
disappointing once you know it's finally over, and the shot didn't
go in. The crowd was great. They've been great like that all year
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reason why I want to be here next year. It
was frustrating not to win it. Tim played well. He was on, and I
was on. It was back and forth, and no one wanted to lose. And I
think it showed. They deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   They earned it in the end. It wasn't just the 7-foot Duncan, but
also the pint-sized Avery Johnson who did the Knicks in. Johnson
gave the Spurs the 78-77 lead with an 18-foot jumper from the left
baseline with 1 minute 6 seconds remaining. The Knicks had their
chances, but Sprewell, who had hit five shots in a row, missed a
15-foot jumper. And then, with 2.1 seconds left in the game, the
Knicks set up for one last play.
</P>
<P>
   A lob by Charlie Ward went into the paint to Sprewell, who was
pinned too far under the basket by Sean Elliott and had to dribble
out into the open. He spun and fell away on a release from 6 feet
that came with one-tenth of a second on the clock. It would have
counted, but it fell a foot short of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't score when we needed to down the stretch,'' coach
Jeff Van Gundy said. ``They're a great team. They really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``As disappointed as I am in the result for our guys because I
really was hopeful for them that it would work out. They stand for,
to me, a lot of things that should be taught about the NBA and team
basketball. When it was tough going, they didn't point fingers of
blame at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The ending won't take away the magic of the journey the Knicks
took to make history as the only eighth seed ever to advance to the
finals. Two months ago, the Knicks were 21-21 and one nudge from
collapse. Van Gundy was nearly fired, the players were divided by
personal agendas and winning seemed less of a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Knicks healed and pulled off an amazing run with
miracle shots sprinkled along the path like bread crumbs in a fairy
tale. There was Allan Houston's last-second runner that bounded off
the rim and fell into a net to save the Knicks from elimination in
the first round. And the star-aligned 4-point play by Larry Johnson
to save the Knicks from defeat in Game 3 of the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   There was a glass ceiling on their success, though. They
couldn't see it, but it was there in the form of Robinson and
Duncan. The two 7-footer were like wrecking balls to the Knicks'
dream. They dominated this series and combined for 21 rebounds and
46 points Friday night. They also led their team to the free-throw
line 17 of their 25 times. The Knicks went to the line just 16
times on the night.
</P>
<P>
   `'Size was the ultimate difference,'' Sprewell said. `'They made
it hard for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was ever easy for the Knicks this season. Everything
they went through was made harder once Patrick Ewing went down
after Game 2 of their Eastern Conference final against Indiana. He
had told the team to `'get me my ring.'' But the Knicks were one
7-footer short against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful to watch,'' Ewing said, dressed in a suit for
the game. ``It was painful to see them celebrate on our floor, but
I was proud of this team. I remember all of the feelings from '94
when we lose and they all came back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has been given an assurance by Checketts that he will
return. Checketts, sticking to his policy of not giving a
definitive answer publicly until he meets with the players and
coach this week, but he said, ``I'm certain things will work itself
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy when looking at the season as a whole said: ``I am
very proud of them, everything they accomplished. Hopefully when
the pain of this loss wears off they'll look back at the last two
and three months of the season and be very, very proud of not only
what they accomplished but how they went about accomplishing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks looked to take fate in their own hands by doing the
little things to start the game. They were all over the Spurs'
pick-and-roll, disrupting the passing lanes that had been open in
Game 4. They were also driving into the lane and not flinching at
the sight of Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   That effort gave the Knicks a rousing 30-22 lead with eight
minutes left in the second quarter after a wild, driving layup by
Houston. The fans were up, the Knicks were high on their lead. But
the Spurs remained patient and methodical and seized the
opportunity when the Knicks suffered a series of mental lapses
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprewell energized the crowd with a flashy steal and a
vicious fast-break dunk with 1:36 left in the first half, he turned
right around and left Jaren Jackson open for a 3-pointer in the
closing seconds. Jackson's shot ended a 16-6 run that left the
Spurs ahead, 40-38, at the break. In the final seven minutes of the
half, the Knicks turned the ball over three times and helplessly
watched Duncan score six of his 16 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   While disappointed by the finish to the half, the Knicks were
within striking distance.

PITCHING HELP MAY COME FROM WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It may be a month before the Mariners can find
solutions to their bullpen problems through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many teams that have to decide if they're in or
out of it, and it's too early to make that call,'' said vice
president for baseball administration Lee Pelekoudas. ``Some teams
have already established that they're out of it, but if they've got
quality, the longer they hang on to it, the better leverage they
have. No one's in a hurry to move pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's anyone's guess where the M's themselves will be
at the July 31 trading deadline. Much of it hinges, as usual, on
their relief, which has been suspect _ as usual.
</P>
<P>
   If the immediate answer to the Mariners' bullpen woes has to
come from within, they would seem to have several options.
</P>
<P>
   Their lone left-handed reliever is Allen Watson, who has
struggled since his trade from the New York Mets last week. But
there are three 24-year-old left-handed relievers t Class AAA
Tacoma, and each has had some success. If no trades are
forthcoming, one of those pitchers may be back in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to be prepared for that in case we don't seek
the alternative,'' said farm director Benny Looper. ``We're always
looking to find guys from our system to fill the need. The one
thing that we can't give them in triple-A is big-league experience,
but we're trying to prepare for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The three are Damaso Marte, Sean Spencer and Jordan Zimmerman,
the latter two having pitched briefly for the Mariners this season.
Spencer worked two games in May, allowing three earned runs in 12/3
innings. Zimmerman was sent down last weekend with a 6.75 ERA in 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Marte has been developed as a starter, but the M's recently
converted him to relief, a role believed to suit him best. Marte
has had some good games but mainly has been inconsistent, with a
4.85 ERA and 30 walks, the most on the Rainiers. ``Right now, he's
walked too many to survive up here,'' Looper said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer has been working on a two-seam fastball that can sink
away from right-handed hitters, which Mariners manager Lou Piniella
suggested he develop after sending him down May 10. The UW product
has a 2.67 ERA in 23 games and, Looper said, is showing signs of
re-gaining the arm strength he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, who was promoted to the M's from Class AA New Haven,
is getting his first Class AAA experience. He has thrown two
scoreless innings in two games, and Looper said he has increased
his velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Among starting pitchers, Brett Hinchliffe has made strides in
both velocity and location after struggling when he was sent down
in May. And 20-year-old Gil Meche (2-2, 3.38) continues to impress.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners figure to be extra careful when considering
whether to promote Meche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to make the correct call on when is the time to
bring him up,'' Looper said. ``It could impact his career either
way.''
</P>
<P>
   PROJECT OVER: One prospect who won't be helping is Brien Taylor,
the former No. 1 overall pick who signed with Seattle this winter.
The Mariners thought they could help the left-hander turn around
his fractured career, but the club recently released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His aptitude was just not very good,'' Looper said. ``We
hadn't been able to make enough progress to continue the
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was headed for stardom after the New York Yankees drafted
him in 1991. But since ruining his shoulder in an off-season fight
in 1993, the 27-year-old has been buried in the low minors.
</P>
<P>
   He had too much experience to play at the Mariners' lowest
minor-league team, rookie-level Peoria, which is limited to players
with no more than two years in pro ball. When the Mariners
determined he was not ready for A-ball, they released him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tried to make Taylor into a relief specialist, and
worked on a sidearm delivery. But it never took.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the ball in his hand, he never could do it,''
Looper said. ``He had a hard time picking up any adjustments. We
stayed with him a couple of months, but saw very little, if any,
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL REPORT: Center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. spent yesterday's
pre-game resting on a table in the trainer's room. He did not dress
or participate in batting practice, but was on the lineup posted in
the Texas Rangers' clubhouse. Griffey, who left Thursday's game
with dizziness and a bad cold, did not start for just the second
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Butch Henry is sticking to his goal of returning from a
torn labrum by August. Henry has been working out twice a day and
hopes to be given clearance to start throwing on Tuesday. ``That's
all tentative, but it can't come soon enough for me,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Eric Weaver, who had surgery to remove bone chips from
his right elbow last month, threw for the third time yesterday and
is hoping to begin pitching for Tacoma by the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: By winning two of three games in Seattle this
week, the Angels finished with 78 all-time wins at the Kingdome,
the most of any visiting team. That's also more than the Mariners
have against any single opponent; Seattle's best mark in the Dome
is 75-61 against the Minnesota Twins. ... When the Mariners lost
three games earlier this month despite scoring 11 runs, they became
the first team to do that since at least 1951, according to STATS
Inc. ... The Mariners Wives are selling a set of all-occasion
greeting cards, featuring baseball artwork by children attending
The Hutch School. Proceeds from the cards, which are available by
calling 1-800-MY-MARINERS, will benefit the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center's Pediatric Oncology Department.

TITLE GIVES ROBINSON HIS JUST REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be a coronation Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson's Spurs won their first NBA title, beating the
Knicks and beating San Antonio's 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   With a body chiseled out of obsidian, a soul filled with the
light of the Lord and a game that has been criticized as too soft
for too many years, Robinson got to that place all the great ones
dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley is still dying for a championship ring. Patrick
Ewing makes no bones about it. Without a ring, the Knicks' injured
center says his NBA career feels a little empty, a little
unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   There is something forlorn about getting deeper and deeper into
a stellar career and not having that final affirmation _ not about
how good you are, but how hard you worked.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Robinson wanted and deserved his championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes a long ways toward fulfilling my dreams,'' Robinson
said, almost speechless in the wake of the Spurs' nerve-racking
Finals clincher, 78-77. ``Now I have to set new goals. But if this
was easy, it wouldn't be so sweet. You go through all those hard
times. You go through all those criticisms. That's what makes the
journey so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Now things are going to be a little different in Mr. Robinson's
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Admiral will have a ring to match all the rest of the
hardware he was collected over the years as he established himself
as one of the greatest defensive players, scorers and stars of the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But the coronation of David Robinson turned out to be something
else. It was more of a reward. A just reward.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell made sure of that by taking some of the
spotlight and almost blowing up the series and the neat story line.
</P>
<P>
   How about that for contrast?
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson vs. Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Good vs. evil, if you want to reduce things to some simplistic
form.
</P>
<P>
   Soft vs. hard, if you want to hark upon the characterizations of
these two fine NBA players with vastly different temperments and
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell _ a guy the Spurs persued hard after his coach-choking
debacle at Golden State _ showed why he wanted so badly to be set
free from the losing, overbearing surroundings with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's energy, legs and relentless drive have been on
display almost the entire postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, when the Knicks could have easily folded in
the face of the Spurs' 3-1 series lead, Sprewell upped his game,
left behind any inclination he has toward recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sprewell nearly single-handedly pushed this series back
to San Antonio, trading basket after basket with Tim Duncan, the
other Twin Tower and the Finals MVP, as the game turned from Spurs'
mandate to a white-knuckler that the Knicks seemed determined to
steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree was just awesome tonight,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got one of those rolls. You just knew that the way
they were going, he and Tim were going to go back and forth. I
coached him for two years (at Golden State) and I know that when he
gets on a roll, he's unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been Ewing on the other side of court, battling
Robinson for the right to have some peace in retirement _ or at
least on the golf course, where the ribbing about who has a ring
and who doesn't can get awful nasty.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing was sidelined. Robinson's fellow Dream Teamer and NBA
All-Star was out of action, leaving the stage wide open for someone
else to take up the Knicks' cause, to make it tough on Robinson to
get that final prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell served well. And because of his energy and effort,
Robinson's reward was all the sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us earn this one,'' Robinson said. ``It's been a
long journey. I've got to give the Knicks so much credit. They
didn't give away anything. This city has a lot to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the generosity of Robinson. That is why even though he
stepped aside to hand the scoring load over to Duncan this season,
Robinson is the one everyone wanted to see rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, everybody gets on David because they say he's not an
emotional person, he doesn't play with heart. But I think you have
seen this year that he really does,'' Spurs' backup center Will
Perdue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of taken it as a personal challenge to show that he
really does. Everybody talks about what Tim's done during the
playoffs, but I think it's pretty important to notice what David's
done and the difference he's made.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Robinson's long-awaited championship thankfully puts an
end to any questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken a lot of flak during his career,'' teammate Mario
Elie said. ``I said, `Dave, play hard and focused. You have a
chance to prove everyone wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Robinson did not single-handedly prove everyone
wrong. He had help in making his championship come real. But that's
fine. Robinson is not selfish. He did it the perfect way.

annual revenues _ is as troubled as ever. By Leslie Kaufman.

<P>
   BOOKS-JOINT-VENTURE (Undated) _ In yet another sign of the
pressure to merge that is reshaping the publishing industry, Time
Warner Books and Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster are in serious talks to
form a joint venture for their book operations, covering such
aspects as warehousing, marketing and sales. By Geraldine
Fabrikant.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHEED _ Lockheed Martin Corp., the nation's largest military
contractor, is considering selling assets valued at around $1
billion to winnow out noncore businesses and, perhaps, provide some
lift to a stock that has fallen more than 30 percent during the
last year. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-BLOCS (Rio de Janeiro) _ In an effort to bolster trade and
seek some sort of counterweight to American global economic
dominance, leaders of the world's second and third largest trading
blocs are to meet here this weekend and early next week in a
first-ever ``Latin American-European Summit'' that has already
proven divisive on several basic bread-and-butter issues. By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ECON (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ In the financial subplot
of Indonesia's political transformation, few events have
demonstrated the progress and pitfalls as clearly as the agreement
this week between PT Astra International and its creditors on how
the company will pay back more than $1 billion in debt. By Wayne
Arnold.

</P>
<P>
   NISSAN (Tokyo) _ For the first time ever, the Nissan Motor Co.
opened its shareholder meeting to the media, just one of the many
small signs that even the most traditional Japanese companies are
inching toward the greater disclosure and transparency demanded by
foreign investors. By Stephanie Strom.

   HISTORIAN-HOLOCAUST (London) _ Can a writer who thinks the
Holocaust was a hoax still be a great historian? The British writer
David Irving's books have been praised by some of the most eminent
scholars in his field. Yet to Deborah Lipstadt, author of ``Denying
the Holocaust,'' Irving is a propagandist and not a historian at
all. It is a statement that has prompted Irving to sue her for
libel in Britain. He readily admits that he has said ``there were
never any gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' but insists he is not a
Holocaust denier because his comments ``are true.''

   SPITZ-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Inside Picture Books,'' By Ellen

   NEW YORK _ Walking through Public School 202 Friday, Robert E.
Riccobono saw programs taking seed that began under his
superintendency of District 19 in the East New York section of
Brooklyn. He watched elementary school pupils participating in a
literacy program devised at Johns Hopkins University. He spoke with
a former teacher who had become an assistant principal under a
program for training administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But he also saw a chart of the school's 1999 testing goals for
reading and math, goals that were not met. Like many other schools
in the city, P.S. 202's scores plummeted from a year ago, so when
Chancellor Rudy Crew announced a shake-up earlier in the week,
Riccobono's head was among those that rolled. He was one of five
superintendents who were removed; four others were placed on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually shocked,'' Riccobono said. ``I didn't expect
it. I felt we were making strides that were recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Crew's overhaul, the firing of Riccobono is
a telling reminder of the difficulty of improving the city's worst
school districts. He was regarded as a superintendent who had taken
steps to upgrade the curriculum and teacher training in his
district. For a time, he seemed to have the support of the
chancellor and the business community. But under pressure to take
action in the face of falling scores, Crew responded this week by
cleaning house, closing 13 schools and taking direct control of 43
others, including two in District 19.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Crew refused to specify why he removed the
superintendents, but he said he based his decisions on three
criteria: management skills, leadership and the achievement test
scores of their districts. On recent tests, fewer than a third of
students in District 19 were at grade level in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy schools chancellor, Harry Spence, cited leadership
Friday as a factor in Crew's decision to dismiss Riccobono.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the challenge in District 19 as well as in other poorly
performing schools remains the same: what will work? Drawing its
students from East New York, one of the city's poorest areas,
District 19 is representative of the city's failing districts. It
has a long history of neglect, and critics say years of patronage
and cronyism are partly responsible for the dismal test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Riccobono's defenders say he took over only four years ago and
began making positive changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the chancellor has done the right thing in shaking
up the system, but this might be a case where the broom has swept a
little too widely,'' said Robert Berne, vice president of academic
affairs at New York University and a longtime observer of the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Riccobono's removal was particularly notable because, in January
1998, the chancellor and the New York City Partnership and Chamber
of Commerce selected District 19 for a Breakthrough for Learning
program, in which teachers and administrators would receive bonuses
if student achievement improved. The program also included teacher
training and regular student assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, officials with the New York City Partnership declined
comment about Riccobono's dismissal, but a statement earlier in the
week from the business group hardly rose to his defense, saying
``there is scant evidence that performance has materially
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence offered an optimistic assessment of the new initiatives
in District 19, saying they ``have begun, we believe, to bear
fruit, and we're excited about the possibilities for District 19's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked about Riccobono, he said the Breakthrough program
includes ``a continual review, and ultimately a decision about the
leadership of the district and its potential for advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in that context that the chancellor made that decision
in District 19,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers union, said,
``Obviously, the chancellor lost confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Riccobono said he understood that accountability
was part of the job. He was one of two superintendents dismissed;
one will be transferred to another job in the system, and two are
retiring. Riccobono, 53, said he might retire after 31 years in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed resigned to his situation, noting that he recently
removed 11 principals in his district. ``The principals that I let
go I'm sure felt I made the wrong decision,'' he said.

DODGERS BEAT GIANTS, END LOSING STREAK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kevin Brown was rocked by the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up two earned runs in 71/3 innings. It was his worst
outing of his career at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers still persevered and won 4-2 Friday to
end a three-game losing streak and, for a day, remain a {-game
ahead of San Diego and out of last place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe Brown wasn't knocked all over the yard by the Giants.
Two runs is a bit drastic. But for what the right-hander's done
against them, not to mention his accomplished in 3Com Park, giving
up one run is unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he gave up the two runs on five hits, his ERA
against the Giants still went up. So did his ERA at this ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Brown entered the night 6-0 with a 0.58 ERA in seven starts
against San Francisco. At 3Com, he had allowed one run in four
starts spanning 35 1/3 innings. His ERA went to 0.78 against the
Giants, 0.62 at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a change in catchers disrupted Brown. Angel Pena left
the game with tightness in his right hamstring in the top of the
sixth. He was replaced by Todd Hundley, who wasn't due back into
the starting mix until today.
</P>
<P>
   Pena's status was day-to-day. Hundley was scheduled to start
today after sitting the last 11 days to work on his throwing
mechanics. It didn't hurt that Hundley hit his eighth homer of the
season -- a solo shot _ on a 2-2 pitch with one out in the ninth
off reliever John Johnstone. It gave the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The catching change didn't matter because Brown was nearly
impeccable _ until the Dodgers starting hurting him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Brown improved to 9-4, including 7-2 after a Dodgers loss.
Giants lefty Shawn Estes (4-5) took the loss after allowing three
runs on eight hits in a season-best eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The first run Brown allowed came after a walk, but he got out of
further trouble with a double play. In fact, 10 of the first 18
outs he recorded came via the ground ball and in the first six
innings the Giants hit three balls out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh inning right fielder Raul Mondesi misplayed
Jeff Kent's leadoff single into a triple, falling twice before
tracking the ball at the wall. Brown got J.T. Snow to pop to
shortstop, but Stan Javier's grounder to second scored Kent to pull
the Giants within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's homer provided an insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia led off the bottom of the eighth with a single and
was sacrificed to second before Dodgers manager Davey Johnson took
the perilous walk to the mound to remove Brown and bring in lefty
Pedro Borbon, the Dodgers' best reliever to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon, as his 1.33 ERA would suggest, did the job. He retired
pinch-hitter Charlie Hayes on a fly to right and struck out Bill
Mueller to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw pitched the ninth for his 17th save but only his third
since June 5.
</P>
<P>
   It also why many people thought the game was over after the
Dodgers scored twice in the second inning to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros led off with a single to center, Mondesi flied to
right and Adrian Beltre walked. The runners moved up a base on
Estes' wild pitch and scored on Jose Vizcaino's single back through
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fought back with a run in the fourth inning, taking
advantage of one of Brown's few miscues. He walked Barry Bonds to
lead off the inning. Jeff Kent singled to move Bonds to third, and
the Giants' left fielder scored when J.T. Snow grounded into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers grabbed their two-run lead back in the fifth inning
by having their table-setter do just that. Eric Young singled to
lead off and stole second and third, matching his stolen base total
since May 26. Young scored on Gary Sheffield's single to right to
put the Dodgers ahead 3-1.

SECOND-GUESSERS SPARE JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the Los Angeles Dodgers fans, Dodgers
haters, letter writers, radio-show callers, sportswriters, talking
heads, second-guessers, soothsayers and sages who make up the great
``they,'' the scapegoat hunt is on, sparing nobody, just about.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the owners: The Fox people have been skewered for
everything from the Mike Piazza trade to the musical playlist at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the general manager: It's Kevin Malone's fault, some
in his own clubhouse seem to believe, for predicting a World Series
and ticking off the Dodgers' western division rivals, who've had
the nerve to play extra hard against them.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the players: Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the coaches: In fact, the coaches have been the only
ones to take the fall so far, with Charlie Hough (pitching) fired
and Rick Dempsey (third base) busted down to bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   They even blame the fans: It's !ital!your!off! fault, goes the
most counter-intuitive analysis of all. Dodger Stadium fans are too
LAid back, and that infects the players. There's the theory,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody else? Is there a secretary, parking attendant,
ticket-taker, peanut vendor, security guard or groundskeeper out
there who has escaped his/her share of the blame as the Dodgers
knock on the National League West cellar door?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when a team goes bad, the hammer of blame lands first
on the manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was this very week last year that Fox lowered the boom on
Bill Russell, along with GM Fred Claire. The Dodgers were two games
under .500 at the time, in third place, 12{ games out of first _ in
most respects better off than they are this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But the hammer hasn't grazed Davey Johnson. Not here. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a reader mentioned that he'd heard a couple of
talk-show hosts getting pretty emotional about Johnson. They
!ital!felt sorry!off! for Davey, saddled with as he is with a sack
of rocks for a ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the hands-off-Davey approach to Dodgers
dissection: Bob Nightengale's 29-paragraph column about the Dodgers
in the current edition of Baseball Weekly mentions 21 current and
former members of the team's roster and managements _ but never
mentions Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you expect at least !ital!one!off! letter to the
editor, blaming Johnson for the team's supposed underachievement?
</P>
<P>
   We bring this up not to suggest Johnson is to blame for the
Dodgers being in the ravine they're in _ or to suggest the team
could be any worse without him. We bring this up because it's an
oddity that says a lot about the Dodgers and the men who are trying
to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is that the proven winners in the Dodgers front
office and clubhouse are escaping criticism _ and the only person
who meets that description is Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is that Johnson is in the first year of a
three-year contract paying him a $1.5 million salary _ job security
that will render criticism moot for at least this season.
</P>
<P>
   And what's going on is that Johnson's reputation as a
high-maintenance employee has yet to catch up with him here _ he
has kept a remarkably low profile, overshadowed by the big-talking
GM, Malone.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like this in New York, where Johnson managed the Mets
to the 1986 World Series title during six-plus seasons there, in
Cincinnati or in Baltimore. Johnson wasn't often under .500, but
when he was, he was a big target, and he caught flak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time we really lost was in '90 _ when he got
fired,'' said San Diego Padres first baseman Dave Magadan, who
played for Johnson's Mets from '86 to '90 as Keith Hernandez's
long-suffering understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After '89, when we didn't win it, that whole offseason it was
`Put up or shut up.' (Relief ace) John Franco signed that winter.
Davey was in a no-win situation. If we won, we were supposed to
win. If we didn't win, it was his fault, because we had talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were two games under .500 when Johnson was fired in May
1990, the loser in a feud with general manager Frank Cashen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, too many times, the manager gets the blame,''
Magadan said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Reds and Orioles, respectively, were 26 and 34
games over .500 in the seasons before Johnson and those teams
parted ways, so it's not always about W's and L's.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a possible explanation for Johnson riding blame-free to
last place: L.A. fans have figured out, through hard experience
with the Dodgers, Lakers, Kings and never mind the Clippers,
there's only so much a manager or head coach can do.
</P>
<P>
   History says entrusting the lineup card to a ``proven'' winner
is a guarantee written on toilet tissue.
</P>
<P>
   By my count, 43 times in major-league baseball history a team
has hired a manager who'd already won a World Series with another
club (not counting Johnson and Colorado's Jim Leyland, hired this
season). How many times has that manager won a World Series with
his new team? Only three: Sparky Anderson (Cincinnati in the '70s,
Detroit in '84), and before him, Bucky Harris (Washington in '24,
Yankees in '47) and Bill McKechnie (Pittsburgh in '25, Cincinnati
in '40).
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, the numbers are 25 hires and only one success: Alex
Hannum, who coached Bob Pettit's '58 St. Louis Hawks and Wilt
Chamberlain's '67 Philadelphia 76ers to championships _ not to
forget the '69 Oakland Oaks of the ABA.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL's Super Bowl era, six championship-winning coaches
have switched teams, and none has taken another call from the
President.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests another reason ``they'' have spared Davey
Johnson the hammer of blame.
</P>
<P>
   They're saving it for Phil Jackson.

ANGELS BEAT A'S
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Gary DiSarcina came home Friday night and made
his presence felt at the plate in Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Troy Glaus and Jeff Huson did the rest of the work as
the Anaheim Angels put together another late rally and beat the
Oakland Athletics 4-3 before 29,911.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' fourth victory in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1 in the eighth, the Angels tied the game on a
two-run single by Vaughn. With two outs in the ninth, Huson beat
out an infield single as Glaus scored the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, the Angels' shortstop who returned to the lineup
earlier in the week after breaking his arm in spring training,
scored Anaheim's first run.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Giambi's solo home run in the sixth inning provided
the spark for a two-out, two-run Oakland rally that gave the A's a
2-1 lead. Oakland's other run came on a home run by John Jaha in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first in a six-game homestand against division
rivals Oakland and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   How the Angels fare against both teams is vital and could have a
major impact on the rest of their season. The Angels entered
Friday's game last in the AL West. The team's 32-39 record left
them 8{ games behind Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Athletics, at the mid-point of a long, grueling
road trip, entered the game in second place with a 36-36 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things hinge on how we play the teams in our
division,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said before Friday's game.
``If we get playing well enough, we're right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got off to a rocky start on Friday night. Oakland's
leadoff batter Tony Phillips got aboard when starting pitcher Omar
Olivares bobbled a routine pop up but was not charged with an
error.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Miguel Tejada, grounded into a double play. Ben
Greive singled and Giambi doubled down the right-field line,
sending Greive to third.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares walked designated hitter Jaha to load the bases.
Olivares ended the threat by getting A's right-fielder Matt Stairs
to fly out to left.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's first at-bat also started out on a promising note when
Darin Erstad walked. He advanced to second, but got no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares settled down in the second. Although leadoff batter
Eric Chavez reached on a single, A.J. Hinch struck out. Olivares
then picked Chavez off first base and Ryan Christenson grounded
out.

MARION JONES COMES UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Marion Jones' pursuit of five gold medals in the
2000 Olympics has been well chronicled. But her unprecedented
endeavor is far from a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident on Friday when Jones, 23, suffered her first
loss to an American in the long jump since 1997 in the USA Track
and Field Championships at Hayward Field. Dawn Burrell sailed a
career-best 22 feet, 10 inches to end Jones' two-year reign as
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, ranked No. 1 in the world in 1998 in the 100, 200 and
long jump was second at 22-3 and Shana Williams was third at 22-0\.
The top three finishers qualified for the World Championships in
Seville, Spain in August.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a nine-time state champion from Thousand Oaks High and
Rio Mesa High who became the first woman to win the 100 and 200
since 1948 in last year's championships, will attempt to bounce
back in the first round of the 200 today. She will not run the 100
in the four-day meet in Eugene, which concludes Sunday, after
having received an automatic berth as defending champion in the
World Championships by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hats off to Dawn, she had a wonderful performance,'' Jones
said. ``She deserved to win. I am going to be challenged and I am
going to have to face that for the rest of my career. I'm going to
have to pull it out at the end and today I didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the long jump competition on Friday, it did not look
as though Jones would need to take more than one jump. She took the
lead on her first round jump of 22-3. After fouling on her second
attempt, Jones, competing for the first time since spraining her
right knee in the Pontiac Grand Prix meet on June 12 in Raleigh,
N.C, passed on her third and fourth jumps to avoid putting
excessive pressure on the tender joint.
</P>
<P>
   When Burrell, the younger sister of former 100 world-record
holder Leroy Burrell, uncorked her 22-10 effort on her fifth jump
to move into sixth on the all-time U.S. list, Jones could only
respond with marks of 21-4{ and 21-7\ on her fifth and sixth jumps.
In the Pontiac Grand Prix, Jones rallied to win the competition at
23-0 on her last jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put anything off on the knee. I felt
surprisingly good,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When meet day comes around, I'm ready to perform and jump.
Going undefeated the entire season is obviously not a big deal
anymore. Things happen. I'm going to have to move forward. There
are no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller and Dennis Mitchell were winners in the men's and
women's 100 in wind-aided marks of 10.96 and 9.97, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a USC athlete and a 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the
400 relay, edged two-time Olympic champion Gail Devers by
one-hundredth of a second. Angela Williams and Torri Edwards of USC
were third and fourth at 11.03 and 11.05.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist, broke into tears
after winning his fourth national title. It was his first title
since having been reinstated after a two-year suspension for a high
level of testosterone. The suspension was overturned by the USATF
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Shelia Burrell, a UCLA graduate who trains at Cal State
Northridge under Matador assistant Jeff McAuley, won the heptathlon
with 6,101 points, posting top marks in the 200 on the first day at
24.04 and in the final event, the 800, in 2:11.82, to clinch the
victory over Tiffany Lott-Hogan (6,026).
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, the 1998 runner-up, was second going into the 800 in
the two-day, seven-event competition, 37 points behind Lott-Hogan _
but rocketed to the lead with a 59-second opening quarter to win
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Haynes, the 1996 NCAA runner-up for USC, was third at
5,720 to earn her first top-three, U.S. national finish. Favored
DeDee Nathan, the world indoor pentathlon champion, finished eighth
at 5,318 after she no-heighted at 5-7\ and failed to score points
in the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week I kept saying to myself, `It's going to come down to
the 800.''' Burrell said. ``When it comes down to the 800, my
attitude is just do whatever it takes to get there.''

RANGERS POUND M'S TO OPEN SIX-GAME LEAD IN AL WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ We all knew this was The Last Domestand. The Mariners
are hoping it isn't the Last Stand, period.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a two-week stretch of division games, the
Mariners were humbled by the American League West-leading Texas
Rangers 14-4 before 30,490 fans Friday in the Kingdome's final
night game. It was the Mariners' sixth loss in their last seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wears on you a lot,'' shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``But
all you can do is come back tomorrow and give a good effort,
because we need to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bloodshed is seeping from the Mariners' bullpen. On
Thursday, Anaheim scored nine runs after the seventh inning for a
comeback win. Friday, the Rangers scored 13 runs after the fifth
inning for a comeback win of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' top two starters, Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia,
will close out this series. But as manager Lou Piniella has noted _
and his club has continually proven _ relief pitching is most
important.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' bullpen has a 3.46 earned run average, best in the
American League. The Mariners' bullpen ERA is 6.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing we can do,'' third baseman Russ Davis
said. ``The defense and the offense can't let it get to them. We
just have to continue to play our game and do our half, put runs on
the board and back those guys up. Hopefully things will pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two nights, the Mariners' AL West rivals scored off
each of the six Seattle relievers, posting 20 runs in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem is not so much how the relievers have pitched.
It's that they're the best the M's have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you this: I don't have many options,'' Piniella
said. ``We'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas trailed 3-1 before pounding Frankie Rodriguez and Melvin
Bunch in a six-run sixth. The Rangers slugged three homers in the
inning, the first coming off starter Paul Abbott, who had allowed
only an Ivan Rodriguez solo homer through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, making his first start of the season after tearing the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during winter ball,
went five-plus innings, allowing three runs on five hits and three
walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased,'' Abbott said. ``I competed well, made some
good pitches and made some bad pitches. All in all, I was pleased
with it. It was fun to be out there against Texas, just being such
a big game. That part of it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth inning wasn't. Abbott said he suffered ``more of a
mental lapse'' than any kind of physical fatigue. He fell behind
leadoff hitter Juan Gonzalez 3-and-1, then allowed a 441-foot home
run. After a walk to Rafael Palmeiro, Abbott was replaced by
Frankie Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Rodriguez allowed a two-run homer to Lee
Stevens that gave the Rangers a 4-3 lead. The right-hander could
not finish the inning, issuing a two-out single and walk, and Bunch
was summoned to face Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The catcher, who had nine runs batted in at the Kingdome April
13, popped his second homer of the night, a three-run shot that put
Texas up 7-3. He added a run-scoring sacrifice fly off Bunch in the
eighth, which was followed two batters later by a two-run homer
from Gonzalez that gave the Rangers a six-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rodriguez and Gonzalez finished with five RBIs, and their
team now holds a six-game lead over Oakland and Seattle. The AL
West is often called a wide-open division, but only the
AL.Central-leading Cleveland Indians hold a bigger division lead
than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a chance to jump eight games ahead by the end
of the series. If they do, there may be another reason for fans to
get teary at the Kingdome finale.

SPURS CAPTURE NBA TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were perceived as soft. It was not long ago
critics snickered and deemed the San Antonio Spurs the Pilsbury
Dough Boys of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you can call them hardcore champions.
</P>
<P>
   Culminating perhaps the toughest run in modern day basketball,
the Spurs finished off the New York Knicks with a 78-77 Game 5
victory Friday night at Madison Square Garden to win their first
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed in each other. That's what counts for us. What
happens in our little circle ... not what everybody else thinks,''
said Spurs center Tim Duncan, named the Finals most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs became the first former ABA team to win an NBA
championship. And by no means was this title ride easy.
</P>
<P>
   After a 6-8 start, San Antonio ran rough-shod through a grueling
50-game, 90-day schedule. The Spurs went 15-2 in the postseason,
beating Minnesota in the first round, then sweeping the Los Angeles
Lakers and Portland to reach the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it took a sledgehammer to take out the undermanned
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the celebration ensued at midcourt, each Spur player
hugged one man just as tightly as they did the Larry O'Brien
Trophy. David Robinson finally earned a championship after 10 long,
hard seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was easy, though, it really wouldn't be worth the
journey,'' said Robinson, who went from winning the league's MVP in
1995 to having career-threatening back surgery two seasons later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it special. You go through the hard times,
you go through all the creases, then you're able to finally get it
done. And it's satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all happy for the big fella,'' Spurs forward Sean
Elliott said. ``He's been playing hard, he's been through so much
ridicule. But it means nothing now.''
</P>
<P>
   New York led 77-76 with 1:30 left in the fourth quarter. But
Spurs point guard Avery Johnson put in what was the game-winner
when he calmly sank a baseline jumper with 47 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Known mostly as the little guy who couldn't, Johnson turned out
to be a big hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable. My shots felt good the whole
playoffs,'' said Johnson, who played for the Sonics from 1988-1990.
``And the guys had a lot of confidence in getting me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Knicks could have taken the lead in the final 30
seconds. But Latrell Sprewell, who punished the Spurs with 14 of
his game-high 35 points in the fourth quarter, missed his last two
shots.
</P>
<P>
   With the ball and 2.1 seconds left in the game, Sprewell's
fade-away jump shot from six feet fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have two points and have the victory,''
Sprewell said. ``It's just disappointing once you know it's finally
over. ... Their size was the ultimate difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After combining for 42 points and 35 rebounds in the Spurs' Game
4 victory, Duncan and Robinson totaled 46 points and 21 rebounds
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive about the Spurs in the Finals and throughout the
playoffs was their mental toughness, which they displayed down the
stretch of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very strong team,'' New York's Allan Houston said.
``It's funny ... when you get to this point nobody wants to give
the other team credit. But the bottom line is they played better
than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of how hard-fought Game 5 was, there were 12 lead
changes and a dozen ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks were scary and it's scary to see if they had a
healthy Larry Johnson and Patrick Ewing,'' the Spurs' Mario Elie
said. ``It probably would have been a different series.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie won his third ring after winning two with Houston in 1994
and 1995. Backup guard Steve Kerr walked away with his fourth
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obviously the common denominator,'' joked Kerr, who was
part of the three championship teams with the Chicago Bulls.
``Without me, I'm sure the Bulls don't win any. Without me coming
in here this year, the Spurs probably don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the second half, Sprewell was nearly the spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   He took over in the third period when the Knicks erased the
Spurs' nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's only retort was a big one: Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Spurs afloat throughout the Knicks' surge. Duncan
scored nine of his team's last 10 points in the quarter, which
ended with the Spurs ahead 59-58.
</P>
<P>
   New York made trying to clinch a championship on their home
floor difficult from the start. Much like they did in winning Game
3, the Knicks jumped on the Spurs early.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, though, never lost its poise before closing out its
fourth straight playoff series on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of stunning,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
``You wonder if it's really true.''

DODGERS BEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kevin Brown was rocked by the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up two earned runs in 71/3 innings. It was his worst
outing of his career at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers still persevered and won 3-2 Friday to
end a three-game losing streak and, for a day, remain a {-game
ahead of San Diego and out of last place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe Brown wasn't knocked all over the yard by the Giants.
Two runs is a bit drastic. But for what the right-hander has done
against them, not to mention his accomplishments in 3Com Park,
giving up one run is unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that first pitch he threw was 97 mph, I knew it was
going to be a big game for him,'' said Dodgers shortstop Jose
Vizcaino, who played for the Giants in '97. ``I know they don't
like to face him. That's a plus. Every time he sees those uniforms,
he's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he gave up just the two runs on five hits, Brown's
ERA against the Giants still went up. So did his ERA at this
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Brown entered the night 6-0 with a 0.58 ERA in seven starts
against San Francisco. At 3Com, he had allowed one run in four
starts spanning 351/3 innings. His ERA went to 0.78 against the
Giants, 0.62 at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer (for the success),'' said Brown, who
improved to 9-4 and is 7-2 after a Dodgers loss. ``You don't look
for reasons when things are going well. When things are going bad,
you look for a reason and try and change it. It's a double-edged
sword. It could be a good place to pitch, but they're usually a
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was pulled with one out in the eighth inning because of a
twinge on his left side, the result of reaching for Jeff Kent's
single in the fourth inning. He exited with a runner on second and
the Dodgers holding a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Borbon recorded the final two outs of the eighth and Jeff
Shaw pitched the ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) went back in for the eighth and let me know he wasn't
100 percent,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I learned
before when he says something, to listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in typical fashion, dismissed the injury as being trivial
and said it wouldn't affect the status of his next start, which
happens to be in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   What can't be overlooked is the Dodgers gave Brown an early lead
on Vizcaino's two-run single in the second and from there it seemed
over.
</P>
<P>
   The first run Brown allowed came after a walk, but he got out of
further trouble with a double play. In fact, 10 of the first 18
outs he recorded came via the ground ball and in the first six
innings the Giants hit three balls out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' second run came in the seventh when right fielder
Raul Mondesi misplayed Kent's leadoff single into a triple, falling
twice before tracking the ball at the wall. Brown got J.T. Snow to
pop to shortstop, but Stan Javier's grounder to second scored Kent
to pull the Giants within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was smart enough I would have stopped pitching to have
them fix the mound,'' said Brown, who lowered his ERA to a NL-low
2.89. ``It would get me for a pitch or two. My spikes would get
caught in a hole, and then I'd get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even a change in catchers disrupted Brown. Angel Pena left
the game with tightness in his right hamstring in the top of the
sixth. He was replaced by Todd Hundley, whose solo homer in the
ninth gave the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball everywhere he wanted it to go,'' Pena said.
``He was unbelievable. Every situation he knew where to throw the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena said he expected to be ready to return Sunday.

HUNDLEY FELT READY, GEARED FOR RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: New lead) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Todd Hundley knew long before catcher Angel Pena
left the game in the sixth inning that he would probably work his
way into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Hundley knew his solo homer in the ninth wasn't the
biggest thing he did in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 4-2 win against
the Giants on Friday at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly to Hundley, and the long-term health of the
Dodgers, is the way he pounced on F.P. Santangelo's bunt in the
eighth inning and fired a strike to first baseman Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely is more satisfying,'' Hundley said. ``I'm
getting back to feeling like myself behind the play. The hitting
will happen. I'm not worried about the hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's return wasn't due until today. It was supposed to
coincide with lefty Carlos Perez's return to the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   But before the game Pena was feeling tightness in his right
hamstring. Before he pulled the muscle, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson pulled Pena from the game. ``I tried to stretch it before
the game so I could be ready,'' Pena said. ``I think I'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena said he expects to be ready for Sunday. Hundley's been
gearing up the last 11 days for today.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley caught the last two innings in Thursday's loss to San
Diego. That wasn't planned, but his start today against the Giants
was set. After spending 11 days in Camp Dempsey, Hundley gets his
first start.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 games, Hundley has worked on his throwing
mechanics and built arm strength by throwing balls to second and
third base under the guidance of bullpen coach Rick Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the baseball world, yeah, it's been (humbling),'' Hundley
said of his ordeal. ``It has nothing to do with the fans. You can't
cheat the world of baseball and expect to get away with it. I
missed two spring trainings and didn't get to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup lingo: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson continued his lineup
tweaking by switching Eric Karros to the cleanup spot and moving
Raul Mondesi down a slot to fifth. Johnson said he did it for a
night because the slumping Mondesi, who's homered once in his last
81 at-bats, entered the night with a .150 career average against
Giants starter Shawn Estes.
</P>
<P>
   And Mondesi has struck out nine times in 20 at-bats against
Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also started Trenidad Hubbard in center field and batted
him second, giving Devon White his second straight day off. Johnson
said he'll probably rest Eric Karros today against right-hander
Chris Brock and start left-handed hitter Todd Hollandsworth at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Perez returns: Perez (2-8, 7.38 ERA) last pitched June 16,
getting pulled after allowing four runs in 31/3 innings. But
Johnson's been pleased with Perez's side work, much of which
focused on long-tossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to loosen his shoulder,'' Johnson said. ``He's
been throwing from left field to home. That's the way you used to
test starting pitchers. If you couldn't throw from the left-field
wall to home plate, you wouldn't start.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna update: When Antonio Osuna underwent elbow surgery in May,
the Dodgers hoped he would be back between the All-Star break and
Aug. 1. Before the game at 3Com, Osuna threw his second bullpen
session, after which Johnson said the right-handed reliever could
be ready to begin a rehab stint late next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have three good sessions, and preferably four,''
Johnson said. ``He's going to throw again Sunday. We'll see how it
feels on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna threw fastballs and change-ups in his first two workouts.
He's slated to throw breaking pitches in Sunday's session. Johnson
acknowledged if things went well, Osuna could begin a rehab
assignment late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Giants manager Dusty Baker said
outfielder Ellis Burks (right knee inflammation) would be a
activated from the disabled list today.... San Francisco's Jeff
Kent entered the night 1 for 12 against starter Kevin Brown, but he
went 2 for 3.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Gary DiSarcina came home Friday night and made
his presence felt at the plate in Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Troy Glaus and Jeff Huson did the rest of the work as
the Anaheim Angels put together another late rally and beat the
Oakland Athletics 4-3 in front of 29,911.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' fourth victory in their past five games.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1 in the eighth, the Angels tied the game on a
two-run single by Vaughn. Huson, who singled as a pinch-hitter for
DiSarcina, and Darin Erstad scored as Vaughn drove in his 48th and
49th runs of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the ninth inning, Glaus doubled. He moved to
third on a groundout by Matt Walbeck and scored when Huson beat out
a groundball up the middle. Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada ranged
far to left, but Jason Giambi was unable to scoop his throw out of
the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, the Angels' shortstop who returned to the lineup
earlier in the week after breaking his arm in spring training,
scored Anaheim's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys whose presence might make a difference
in a game,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of DiSarcina, who
was playing just his fourth game of the year. ``It's certainly a
big piece of the puzzle, I just don't want to put a lot of pressure
on a guy who is just coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambi's solo home run sparked a two-out, two-run rally to give
the A's a 2-1 lead in the sixth. Oakland's other run came on a home
run by John Jaha in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first in a six-game homestand against division
rivals Oakland and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things hinge on how we play the teams in our
division,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said before the game. ``If
we get playing well enough, we're right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the win, the Angels remain last in the AL West, 8{ games
behind Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to turn up the heat,'' said Vaughn, whose eight RBI
in the past two games give him 801 in his career. ``When we start
playing the division games you have to come out there with a
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the win was the biggest thing about tonight's game,''
he said. ``We got a win here, that was of the utmost importance.
That's the key.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Omar Olivares pitched seven strong innings,
allowing two earned runs. Scott Schoeneweis pitched the eighth and
closer Troy Percival (2-2) picked up the win after retiring the
side in order in the ninth.

AS ENGINES HEAT UP, RACES LOSE COMPETITORS

   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Drivers could not blame a full moon, so
maybe they can blame the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can blame the start of summer for the heated exchanges
during the Street Stock race. Blame the heat for the proliferation
of blown engines. Certainly it wasn't Friday the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mid-season, maybe some of the motors are a little
tired,'' Rod Johnson suggested after winning the Grand American
Modifieds main event before 2,493 at Irwindale Speedway Friday
night. ``People may need to go through them again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Late Model, Gerrit Cromsigt and Dusty McDonald are again tied
for the points lead after Cromsigt came from last to win the 30-lap
feature. Lee Ladd of Thousand Oaks won in Mini Stock and Alex Romo
of Covina won the Street Stocks race.
</P>
<P>
   There were five blown engines and two wrecks, taking out 10 cars
on a night when only 35 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The most heat was generated in the Street Stock race.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Sallie tried to squeeze between Michael Pope and Luis Del
Real in Turn 3 of the first lap. But the space wasn't there. All
three touched and drew sparks. Pope pulled up on the outside of
turn 1, his car pointed toward the track. Sallie, from Tujunga,
pulled up directly across from Pope on the inside of the track.
They yelled at each other and then got out of the car and stomped
around for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could shoot through it,'' Sallie said. ``But they
got together. I felt like I had to get up there, it's only a 12-lap
race. I was trying to get up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Pope said he didn't see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was minding my own business and he tried to go between us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two cars finished the race, winner Romo and Del Real, from
Covina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard stuff, but I was trying to stay on my own line and
keep running my own race,'' Romo said after his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it was a busy night for Haddock's Towing.
</P>
<P>
   Only six cars finished in Late Model. Todd Burns of Riverside
blew an engine during heat races and David Hessing of Canyon
Country lost his engine in the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Porter of La Verne dropped out of the Mini Stock heat race
and failed to make the main event. John Rowe, involved in a head-on
crash with Kevin Bernhardt, failed to start in that race's main
event. In Grand American, Jim Fram of Irvine and Robert Rice of
Hawthorne tangled in turn 1, sending Fram along the turn 1 wall.
Roger Carufel Jr. of Saugus blew his Grand Am engine.
</P>
<P>
   Cromsigt, from Pine Mountain Club, took the lead from James
Weston, from Goleta, with six laps to go in Late Model. McDonald,
from Simi Valley, pushed his way past Weston to take second.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, from Canyon Country, took the lead on lap 3 of the
Grand American race and easily pulled away from others, even with a
caution with four laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had bad luck in the past, but everything was right this
time,'' he said. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end!

A WIN FROM DEEP IN TEXAS-SIZED HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So what's wrong with this picture? They've got rodeos
all over Queens and Texas is now the undisputed winter sports
champion of the American sports world.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Dallas Stars bring a Stanley Cup to the Lone Star
state. And now the San Antonio Spurs, who, for the record, began
life as the Dallas Chapparrals in the late, lamented American
Basketball Association, have brought an NBA championship to the
land of pickup trucks, sad Country ballads, and six-man football.
As far as excitement goes, this will just have to do until the
Cowboys come to camp.
</P>
<P>
   And what style! Yeah, yeah, yeah they did it with a thoroughly
modern 78-77 victory over the Knicks, but they did it by outdueling
the extraordinarily game Eastern Conference champs, who played this
entire series shorthanded, and who came within three minutes of
sending this series back to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The final hero was squeaky-voiced Avery Johnson, who created the
final score by swishing an open jump shot from the left corner with
47 seconds to play, and who then made a heads-up play by
recognizing that, because the 24-second clock was about to expire,
he had to get the ball up on the rim. New York grabbed the ensuing
rebound with 2.1 seconds left, but the additional two or three
seconds Johnson had obtained for his team looked pretty big when
Latrell Sprewell took Charlie Ward's in-bounds pass on the baseline
and found himself pretty well swallowed up by Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure the game and the championship, the Spurs had
to find a way to overcome the heroic performance of the apparently
reformed Bad Boy of the NBA. What Latrell Sprewell did in the final
game of a completely bizarre New York season was play the kind of
game a Jerry West or Michael Jordan would be very proud to have
called his own. For encased inside his 35-point spree _ what else?
_ was one dazzling stretch in which he scored 14 consecutive
second-half New York points.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture the game had, in fact, turned into an isolated
battle of one-upsmanship between Sprewell and the frightening Tim
Duncan, who, at age 23, is now officially the best player in the
history of the American Virgin Islands, the best player in the
history of Wake Forest, and the best current player in the World's
Greatest Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan finished with 31 points on a rich assortment of
turnaround jumpers, jump hooks, and basic inside moves, and he did
his very best work when it was absolutely needed. That was in the
final two minutes of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a 54-50 lead, having extricated themselves from a
47-38 deficit with a run of 10 straight and 14-3. The Madison
Square Garden crowd was frenzied. Sprewell was heating up. There
would have been no shame had the Spurs sort of relaxed and reasoned
that winning the title in the Alamodome wouldn't be so bad. Enter
Duncan, who had not yet scored in the second half following a solid
16-point first two periods. He banked in a 3-point play over two
men, hit another perimeter jumper, and then took one to the hoop
for a pair of free throws on the next three San Antonio
possessions. There is no way to exaggerate how much the Spurs
needed that lift, nor is there much doubt that they would have gone
under had somebody not stepped forward. That someone happened to be
Tim Duncan, whose 27 points and 14 rebounds per game in his first
NBA Finals only amplified the prior judgment of everyone from Jeff
Van Gundy to the mayor of San Antonio that he is already the best
player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And if anyone doubts that luck plays a part in building sports
teams, consider that had a player of Duncan's magnitude not been
available in the draft the same year that a crippling back injury
kept David Robinson out of all but six games, the Spurs would not
be the new champions. There are years, such as the one we're in,
where there is no true No. 1 pick. And there are years when a
savior is sitting there. One of those years was 1997, and San
Antonio happens to be the grateful beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks gave them a tremendous battle in the face of very
daunting odds. Four weeks ago a bounce of the ball got them past
Miami, and since then they have accomplished something that is very
difficult _ they have managed to make New York City into a very
small town. To spend time in New York this week was to know that
the Knicks were on everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
   But the real story now is San Antonio, and the happiest man on
the team is the noble David Robinson, who many believed was too
``soft,'' too passive, and just too damn gentlemanly to win an NBA
title. Now there is nothing left to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one big goal I had has been achieved,'' Robinson said.
``Now I need a new goal. And if this had been easy, it wouldn't
have been special.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy? Absolutely not. The outsized and outgunned Knicks squeezed
everything they could out of what they had to work with in a
circumstance when everyone in the basketball world knew who had the
better team. With three minutes remaining, they led, 77-75. They
never scored again. They had given it their all.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Spurs, NBA champs. It may not be like winning the 5A
gridiron title, but it's close.
</P>

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ELECTION (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Since Election Day on
June 7, the counting of the 112 million votes has slowed to a near
halt, bogged down in a morass of apparently unforeseen
difficulties. Remarkably, voters have not exploded in frustration.
By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ The July 4 gubernatorial
elections in Mexico's most populous state, which surrounds Mexico
City, are being closely watched. The central campaign issue _ crime
and how to combat it _ is one that is likely to define the
presidential race. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   RADIOASTRONOMY-INTERFERENCE (Paris) _ Radioastronomers around
the world say they cannot escape the overhead ``pollution'' beamed
down nonstop from the growing fleet of communications satellites.
At observatories like Nancay Radioastronomy Station in France and
the famed Jodrell Bank in England, where pulsars were discovered,
astronomers complain that the enormously powerful signals emitted
by the low-orbit satellites are drowning out the faint whispers
coming from the universe. And these manmade constellations, they
complain, are increasingly invading the frequencies assigned to
radioastronomy. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-DRUG-MONEY (Bogota, Colombia) _ Taking a step that is
generating heated criticism in Washington, the Colombian government
has begun to include income earned from growing illegal drugs in
the way it calculates the size of the nation's economy. The move is
controversial but necessary, Colombian officials say, to take
account of the increasingly uncontrollable reality of the drug
trade, which by obviously imprecise assessments could amount to
between one one-quarter and one-third of Colombia's legal exports.
By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-BOOKS (Beijing) _ In the cramped basement offices of the
Alpha Book Company, two editors skirt a legion of rules and
regulations in order to bring out surprisingly provocative books in
a country where, officially, all publications are state owned and
controlled. Even though 1999 has been a chilly political period,
marked by sensitive anniversaries, dissident arrests and the
closing of several liberal publications, a growing stream of
adventurous books and magazines has been bubbling up from under the
ice, many courtesy of new private companies like Alpha Books. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-NUKE (Washington) _ Senior White House officials were
informed that China might have stolen American nuclear secrets
nearly a year earlier than the Clinton administration originally
disclosed, according to current and former U.S. officials. By James
Risen and Jeff Gerth.
</P>
<P>
   HONG-KONG-CHINA (Hong Kong) _ In a move that has profound
implications for Hong Kong's legal system, China overturned a local
court ruling that granted residency here to more than a million
people. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-AIRPORT (Slatina, Yugoslavia) _ Two weeks after the first
NATO peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo, the first military aircraft
landed at the province's main airport, which NATO commanders said
could soon open to regular flights. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POLICE (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ People know that the U.N.
mission is to be the all-powerful civilian administration in
Kosovo, but its presence is barely felt. The most pressing need is
for an international police force to tackle the crime that has
flourished with the exit of the Serbian police and military forces
and many ethnic Serb civilians, the return of over 300,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees. The process of acquiring police officers from
donor countries is so time consuming that the 40 officers are
actually being borrowed from the UN mission in nearby Bosnia. By
Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-YUGO-TV (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ On Yugoslavian
television, the evening news this week showed a tranquil Serbian
village in Kosovo where contented, secure farm families were
surrounded by lush crops, tidy haystacks and trustworthy British
soldiers, one of whom sweetly petted a village dog. That same
evening there was horrifying counterprogramming, but only for the
affluent sliver of the Serbian population that has access to CNN
and BBC on satellite television. Pictures of burning Serbian
villages in Kosovo, torched by vengeful Albanians, were broadcast
along with accounts of Serbs being shot to death and fleeing by the
tens of thousands from Kosovo. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DESTRUCTION (Pec, Yugoslavia) _ Even before NATO began
bombing on March 24, there was much destruction in Kosovo. But
there appeared to be a shift, in focus and intensity, since then:
Before, the destruction was almost always confined to rural areas,
where the Serbian military could argue that it was flushing out
rebels with the Kosovo Liberation Army. In March, though, with the
onset of NATO's bombing campaign, the Serbs took the destruction to
cities like Pec, Djakovica and Mitrovica in the north, where the
Kosovo Liberation Army may have had support, but was far less
visible. The nature of the destruction in Kosovo suggests a
campaign against the Albanian people and their property that went
beyond military tactics alone. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSPACE-BATTLEGROUND (Los Angeles) _ The struggle between the
nation's cable television operators and Internet service providers
over high-speed access to cyberspace has roiled city politics in
Los Angeles, where three commissioners have resigned during debate
on policy over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BANDWAGON (Miami) _ Two weeks have now passed since Gov.
George W. Bush first hit the campaign trail. And his poll numbers
just keep getting better, the crowds keep on coming, and the money
keeps on rolling in. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF-DEPRIVATION (Mohansic, N.Y.) _ It is no secret that
Westchester County, golf oasis for the wealthy, is a golf desert
for everyone else. Though the county is peppered with 61 golf
courses, only five are open to the free-range duffer, that
particular golf subspecies who cannot afford even a mid-range
private club's $150,000 membership fee and $10,000 in annual dues.
The problem has become so bad in recent years that Westchester _
one of the most affluent counties in the nation _ is now among the
most golf-deprived, experts said. By Paul Zielbauer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton will try to
reconcile two seemingly contradictory goals next week when he
unveils a plan to cut the long-term cost of Medicare while
expanding the program to cover prescription drugs, administration
officials said. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-ROYALTIES (Washington) _ After Mobil Oil settled a lawsuit
last year charging that it had underpaid the government for
drilling rights, one of the public interest groups that filed the
suit shared its award with two federal employees. Since then, the
Interior Department has been trying to force the industry to pay
higher royalty fees to the government, but congressional critics
are now using questions about the unusual rewards to the federal
officials to delay any new regulations. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MRS.CLINTON-BANKRUPTCY-LAW (Washington) _ For more than a year,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has been fiercely engaged behind the scenes
on a legislative issue _ consumer bankruptcy _ that could prove
politically tricky for other Democrats and for her own political
ambitions. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL-DRUGGISTS (Washington) _ In the seamless realm of
cyberspace, pharmacies are shipping pills across state lines
without the requisite licenses. Doctors are writing prescriptions
for people they have never met, a practice the American Medical
Association says is unethical, but not illegal. And nobody _ not
Congress, nor the American Medical Association, or various federal
and state agencies _ knows quite how to stop it. A special report.
By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICIAN-NOVELIST (Washington) _ Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had
a certain merry smile this week when he returned to the House floor
fresh from a high-profile radio interview about his latest entry in
the political hopper: a novel, not a bill. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;  (Moving in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ Fast cars and fast women. By Maureen
Dowd.

   HERBERT-COLUMN (Undated) _ Bradley sees a longing for strict gun
control. By Bob Herbert.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules. That was
the message of a term in which the court asserted its power over
every branch and level of government, few of which emerged
unchanged from the encounter. By Linda Greenhouse. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   STATE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Washington has been
transferring power to the states on matters like welfare, providing
lawmakers with more to wrangle over and drawing more interest
groups into the fray. State authority was further strengthened by
last week's Supreme Court decisions that placed curbs on Congress'
ability to make federal law binding on the states. By Clifford J.
Levy.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CONGRESS-REVIEW (Washington) _ When Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas made a triumphant visit to Capitol Hill last week,
congressional Republicans grabbed hold of him as if he were a life
raft that could sail them all to victory. But their clutch left
some in both parties predicting that Bush's Washington allies would
only weigh down his campaign. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-APOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike being in love, being in
business sometimes means having to say you're sorry. Last week the
chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola Co. issued one of the
more elaborate public apologies by an American business leader. By
Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-LAWSUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week an independent
scientific panel reported that the courts had been wrong in saying
that breast implants caused serious disease. The battle over
implants, and similar cases in which courts appear to have reached
incorrect scientific conclusions, has meant that judges often
restrict the scientific evidence that can be presented to jurors.
By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT-DESIGN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Age isn't the only thing
creeping up on the baby-boom generation. Consumer product design
and marketing are too, like wolves on cattle. By William L.
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If you are appearance-challenged,
you are hitting speed bumps on today's exciting but fiercely
competitive job superhighway, where Youth and Beauty are zooming
past in Ferraris. You are just the candidate for a Millennium
Makeover. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BALKAN-NATIONS (Rome) _ Nearly a decade after the old Yugoslavia
began to break up, President Clinton visited the thriving, peaceful
land of Slovenia a week ago, and then saw bedraggled Albanian
refugees waiting to return to Kosovo. The contrast could not have
been greater. A glance at the four newly independent lands _
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia _
illustrates how differently they are faring now. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-FOOD-SCARES-REVIEW (Paris) _ Last month, researchers at
Cornell published findings that genetically altered corn, designed
to produce pollen toxic to pests, could also kill caterpillars of
the monarch butterflies, whose principal breeding range is the U.S.
corn belt. Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of
disapproval. But in the European Union, environmental officials are
taking the news much more seriously. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ken Alibek was a military
physician in the Soviet Union. Like every doctor, he took an oath
to preserve life and guard against medical abuse. But after doing
so, he devoted himself for 17 years not to healing but to the
science of germ warfare _ devising new ways of harnessing deadly
microbes to maim and kill people. Among his killers were smallpox,
anthrax, tularemia and plague. By William J. Broad.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 27, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules. That was
the message of a term in which the court asserted its power over
every branch and level of government, few of which emerged
unchanged from the encounter. By Linda Greenhouse. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   STATE-POLITICS-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ Washington has been
transferring power to the states on matters like welfare, providing
lawmakers with more to wrangle over and drawing more interest
groups into the fray. State authority was further strengthened by
last week's Supreme Court decisions that placed curbs on Congress'
ability to make federal law binding on the states. By Clifford J.
Levy.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CONGRESS-REVIEW (Washington) _ When Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas made a triumphant visit to Capitol Hill last week,
congressional Republicans grabbed hold of him as if he were a life
raft that could sail them all to victory. But their clutch left
some in both parties predicting that Bush's Washington allies would
only weigh down his campaign. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-APOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike being in love, being in
business sometimes means having to say you're sorry. Last week the
chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola Co. issued one of the
more elaborate public apologies by an American business leader. By
Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-LAWSUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last week an independent
scientific panel reported that the courts had been wrong in saying
that breast implants caused serious disease. The battle over
implants, and similar cases in which courts appear to have reached
incorrect scientific conclusions, has meant that judges often
restrict the scientific evidence that can be presented to jurors.
By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCT-DESIGN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Age isn't the only thing
creeping up on the baby-boom generation. Consumer product design
and marketing are too, like wolves on cattle. By William L.
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If you are appearance-challenged,
you are hitting speed bumps on today's exciting but fiercely
competitive job superhighway, where Youth and Beauty are zooming
past in Ferraris. You are just the candidate for a Millennium
Makeover. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BALKAN-NATIONS (Rome) _ Nearly a decade after the old Yugoslavia
began to break up, President Clinton visited the thriving, peaceful
land of Slovenia a week ago, and then saw bedraggled Albanian
refugees waiting to return to Kosovo. The contrast could not have
been greater. A glance at the four newly independent lands _
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia _
illustrates how differently they are faring now. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-FOOD-SCARES-REVIEW (Paris) _ Last month, researchers at
Cornell published findings that genetically altered corn, designed
to produce pollen toxic to pests, could also kill caterpillars of
the monarch butterflies, whose principal breeding range is the U.S.
corn belt. Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of
disapproval. But in the European Union, environmental officials are
taking the news much more seriously. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ken Alibek was a military
physician in the Soviet Union. Like every doctor, he took an oath
to preserve life and guard against medical abuse. But after doing
so, he devoted himself for 17 years not to healing but to the
science of germ warfare _ devising new ways of harnessing deadly
microbes to maim and kill people. Among his killers were smallpox,
anthrax, tularemia and plague. By William J. Broad.

</P>
<P>
   Face it, friends. If you are appearance-challenged, you are
hitting speed bumps on today's exciting but fiercely competitive
job superhighway, where Youth and Beauty are zooming past in
Ferraris.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen an article in The New York Times last week
with the headline ``The Chef as Beefcake.'' The message was as
arresting as some of the buff studs pictured, one naked except for
a well-placed blender: A great chef can no longer be just a pudgy,
marginally psychotic tyrant who cooks like an angel. No! Today's
top chef is a sex kitchen utensil who writes cookbooks with titles
like ``Boy Meets Grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most of us prefer the cooking staff to be clothed at all
times, that's beside the point. In careers all across America, the
homely, flabby, balding and aged are Out. The young and beautiful
are In. How about that article on the ``aerobic pop-star'' Padre
Marcelo, who's packing the churches in Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you were born before the Carter administration and
have the silhouette of a sack of potatoes. We here at Millennium
Makeovers are dedicated to the proposition that Sex Appeal boosts
any career! Let me describe a few examples from our great selection
of professional services, available at the more than 250 Millennium
Makeovers Career-Buffing Centers:
</P>
<P>
   BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY: Both Gotham Bus Co. and Alice Kramden would
have been a lot happier if one of Ralph's bright ideas had been to
join Millennium Makeovers' exercise program for those carrying a
wide load. Our staff lead bus drivers in aerobic ``Get on Board,
the Engine's Revved'' sessions. Exact change only. No smoking,
spitting, radio playing!
</P>
<P>
   BYTES `R' US: Intense workout for pasty computer programmers
looking for an upgrade. Graduates receive T-shirts that say ``Giga
Dude'' or ``Giga Gal.''
</P>
<P>
   PUMPED-UP PLUMBERS: Exercise workout for plumbers with an extra
twist: Once they can get their new ``fittings'' in Spandex bike
shorts, they attend self-esteem sessions. Graduates receive a
T-shirt with the slogan ``Plumbers Are Lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is all quite interesting, Giancarlo,'' I hear you
say. ``But what if I'm a lazy professional who doesn't want to go
to the gym with bus drivers and computer nerds?'' Not to worry, my
friend! Millennium Makeovers has a marketing staff that is working
overtime just for you.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-JACKET BOFFO: So your new novel reads like F. Scott
Fitzgerald but you look like Barry Fitzgerald. Tired of ending up
on the remaindered table while the crowds elbow past for books with
jacket photos of hunks who, inexplicably, have time to write?
</P>
<P>
   No sweat! We simply sell you a new face for your book jacket,
drawing from our vast archive of Unclaimed Fashion Model and
Theatrical Publicity Photos. Proven results! I'll bet you didn't
suspect that the Post-Feminist Siren-Scribe Naomi Wolf is actually
an 87-year-old former researcher for the WPA Writers Project. Or
that Sebastian Junger, hunkster-author of ``The Perfect Storm,'' is
really a 98-pound weakling who hasn't had a real photo taken since
that unfortunate barracuda accident off Barbados in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Makeovers also offers youth-enhancing apparel like:
</P>
<P>
   HABEAS CORPUS: Our ``hip'' line of sexy designer underwear for
that ambitious lawyer who wants to ``court'' new clients. Items can
be personalized with sayings like: ``Sustained!'' or ``Motion?
Here's Your Motion, Pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more! We've produced smash classical music CD
packages like ``Vivaldi Violin Vixens,'' ``Baywatch Beethoven'' and
``The Ring-a-Ding-Ding Cycle'' sung by Frank Sinatra and the Rat
Pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fat lady sings?'' Not if Millennium Makeovers can help it!

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since the collapse of her health-care project in
1994, Hillary Rodham Clinton has appeared to retreat from the
gladiator pit of high-profile public policy issues, devoting
herself instead to less visible topics like foster care and
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a year, Mrs. Clinton has been fiercely engaged
behind the scenes on a legislative issue _ consumer bankruptcy _
that could prove politically tricky for other Democrats and for her
own political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The high-powered banking and credit card industries,
concentrated in New York, are concerned that too many people with
money are filing for bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, and
the industries are aggressively pushing legislation to make it
harder for consumers to use bankruptcy to walk away from their
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton thinks that the legislation, which the credit
industry essentially wrote, is unfair to women and children, and
she has been just as aggressively pushing to amend it. The banking
and credit card industries are generous campaign contributors and
could favor her competitors in a run for the Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, this is one of the few causes Mrs. Clinton has
taken up that her own party is divided over. Democratic support for
the legislation is so strong that the House already passed it last
month by a veto-proof margin. And the Senate is poised to do the
same when the matter comes up later this summer. As one
administration official said, ``For many Democrats, this is a free,
pro-business vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was drawn to the issue through her longtime
interest in matters affecting women and children. Though she
supports an overhaul of the bankruptcy system and says that those
who can repay their debts should, she says the credit industry
should be held equally accountable for making credit too easily
available to people who cannot pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   She also views the legislation as making it harder for women to
receive alimony and child support if their former husbands file for
bankruptcy. While current law forces debtors to make a priority of
claims for alimony and child support, critics of the proposed
legislation say it would give equal status to credit-card companies
and other lenders seeking to recoup money from a limited pool. This
could put a single mother in competition with, say, a professional
collection agency working for a big bank or credit card company to
retrieve money from a bankrupt former husband.
</P>
<P>
   Single women now constitute the largest group of people who file
for bankruptcy, making up 39 percent of the nation's annual 1.4
million filings, according to a recent Harvard study. Single men
make up 28 percent and married couples 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big stake in this for women and children,'' said
Joan Entmacher, vice president of the National Women's Law Center
in Washington. ``It was a really critical role that Mrs. Clinton
played in having the White House insist that the final bill had to
protect those populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who support the legislation, however, have played
down the effect on women and dismiss it as not significant enough
to derail the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton immersed herself in the topic last year, before she
considered running for the seat of Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring. (She is expected to begin her campaign
shortly after July 4 with a 10-day announcement tour across upstate
New York.) Her involvement was remarkable for any first lady but
particularly for one who had been so seared by the public when she
ventured into the policy-making arena on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has essentially been functioning as a senior adviser to
the president,'' said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, author of several
books on first ladies. He said such a role could be tricky during
her Senate campaign because her involvement in various issues will
bolster her credibility as someone who cares about public policy
and legislation, and yet she needs to steer clear of implications
that she has been operating as an unelected co-president.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Mrs. Clinton sought a private tutorial in
bankruptcy law from a Harvard law professor, Elizabeth Warren, who
has strongly opposed the legislation. Ms. Warren said she met with
Mrs. Clinton alone for more than half an hour, with Mrs. Clinton
``cross-examining'' her about how bankruptcy works.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton directed her staff to delve into the details and
held numerous policy discussions. She devoted two of her weekly
newspaper columns to the issue. She penned dozens of personal notes
to lawmakers last year as the bills made their tortuous way through
the congressional process. And she, along with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., played what the bill's opponents say was a
decisive role in helping to kill the legislation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., a strong critic of the legislation,
said that he called the White House last October to alert Mrs.
Clinton that Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, was
trying to slip the bankruptcy legislation into the final omnibus
spending bill, a move that would have made it virtually impossible
for President Clinton to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said: ``I called Mrs. Clinton to say, `Stick to your
guns.' That's where she was instrumental. She weighed in, and
suddenly we were hearing a changed tune.'' The bill died.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This year, as the legislation re-emerged, Mrs. Clinton has kept
her vigil. She spoke out last month at the White House on what she
called abusive and predatory practices by credit-card companies,
which make 4 billion unsolicited offers of credit cards every year
that critics say are aimed at those least likely to pay their bills
on time _ elderly women, unemployed college students, people
without health insurance and those already in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the bankruptcy issue has been
unusual in part because her own party is split over what to do
about it. The House passed its version with a veto-proof majority
even as advisers to the president recommended he veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version is also expected to win some support from
Democrats, who are negotiating with Republicans over aspects like
means testing and requirements for credit-card companies to
disclose to consumers how much they will owe if they do not pay
their bills in full.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that so far the Senate has not
adequately addressed the concerns of Mrs. Clinton, who wants both
the priority for women and children and greater accountability by
creditors, but they are circumspect about how far the White House
will go in pressing for changes, especially if many Democratic
senators are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor is this: Some of the Democrats
sympathetic to the Republican proposals are also major fund-raisers
for their party, and the banking and credit interests are prime
sources of big campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill driven by campaign contributions,'' Nadler
said. ``I don't know that Mrs. Clinton would have gotten much
support for her Senate campaign from the big banks anyway, but this
means she won't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last election cycle, the credit industry, including
credit-card companies, banks and retailers, gave more than $4.5
million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of aggressive industry lobbying, by
retailers as well as creditors, and they spent a great deal of
money,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a spokesman for Mastercard International, said
that Mrs. Clinton had worked hard and made her opposition well
known but that she had not been able to overcome the industry's
basic argument for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hard sell to say there's a fundamental flaw in the
current law when debtors are allowed to walk away from their debts
when they have the ability to pay,'' Binzel said. ``It's fair to
say there is strong bipartisan support for bankruptcy reform.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The beating of a butterfly's wings in one hemisphere, it
turns out, really can cause a hurricane in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers at Cornell published findings that
genetically altered corn, designed to produce pollen toxic to
pests, could also kill caterpillars of the monarch butterflies,
whose principal breeding range is the U.S. corn belt.
</P>
<P>
   Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of disapproval.
But in the European Union, environmental officials are taking the
news much more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from consumers fed up with what British
newspapers call ``Frankenstein food,'' the union was tightening
regulations that have already limited the number of genetically
modified crops that can be marketed to 18. Now the
butterfly-killing corn seems likely to be barred under a tacit
moratorium on permitting any new items until the Europeans can
agree on new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where three-quarters of all genetically
modified crops are grown, consumers seem hardly to care whether
chemists have tinkered with the genes as long as the stuff looks
and tastes normal. In Europe, demonstrators in southern France this
month uprooted and burned part of a field of experimental modified
rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Britain, which grows and exports such things, Sainsbury
supermarkets have had to pull everything made from genetically
modified organisms off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the Europeans so much more nervous than Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is agricultural protectionism. Europe resents
the fact that many of the patents on genetically modified crops
with bred-in high yields and resistance to parasites are held by
American companies like Monsanto, DuPont and Dow.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a different attitude toward food in some places.
The French don't like what they call ``industrial'' tomatoes,
fruits and vegetables because they think these products just don't
taste very good.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason may be that Europeans are panicked these
days about food safety. Americans might be nervous too, if the Food
and Drug Administration had as dismal a record as Europe's
bureaucracies have racked up recently in insuring the safety of
food that comes to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly had Europeans recovered from fears that mad cow disease
could infect people who ate infected beef when a new scandal in
Belgium last month caused fear that chicken, eggs, beef, pork, veal
and maybe even milk and cheese could be contaminated with
cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of both disasters was the same cause _ adulterated
animal feed. Five generations ago, most Europeans probably couldn't
afford to eat meat except for Sunday dinner. But things have
changed, and in the rush to produce more beef cheaply for modern
consumers, feed producers in Britain and elsewhere in the 1980s
took to enriching feed grain with ground-up offal and parts of
slaughtered sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Bossies were never meant to be carnivores, and after cattle
ingested bits of sheep brain that had been infected with a
nerve-degenerative disorder called scrapies, some cows in Britain
were seen staggering around, eventually succumbing to a
scrapieslike disease.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, fear spread that if cattle could get it from eating
sheep, people could get it from eating beef.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned the adulterated feed in 1990, but pooh-poohed the
fears until 1996, when the authorities finally conceded that they
could not rule out a link between the disease showing up in cattle
and a horrifyingly similar malady that destroys the human brain,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
   British beef was banned from continental markets for most of a
decade, and sales of beef produced in most other European countries
suffered as well.
</P>
<P>
   Did European food-safety regulation improve with this
experience?
</P>
<P>
   Not in Belgium, where last March veterinarians discovered that
chickens were getting sick and not laying eggs after eating feed
that had been enriched, this time with reprocessed animal fat. The
problem was that used motor oil had been dumped into the fat vats,
contaminating the whole food chain with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Belgians until the end of May, though, to notify
consumers (or the authorities in neighboring countries) that there
was a problem with almost everything except vegetables. With little
they could trust to feed themselves with, Belgians threw out their
government in elections on June 13, just after another scare broke
_ this time over Coca-Cola; about 250 Belgian schoolchildren and
other people reported symptoms of nausea, intestinal pain and
headaches after drinking it.
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't admit liability but blamed shipping pallets
that had been treated, against European food regulations, with
toxic phenol or cresol.
</P>
<P>
   Not even wine seems safe. Last week, French inspectors seized
440 pounds of dried bull's blood that had been used, illegally, to
clarify cheap Cotes-du-Rhone and Cotes-de-Provence wines.
</P>
<P>
   All of that might seem to have little to do with genetic
engineering of vegetables, but there is a psychological connection;
a lack of confidence that the officials who are supposed to protect
Europeans from unseen dangers will do their job well, or even admit
there is a threat. In such an atmosphere, distrust of anything new
flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans also have one more reason to be wary about genetic
manipulation: Hitler had an interest in it. Nazi abuse of science
has left scars in the popular psyche that make European
environmentalist parties, especially in Germany, particularly
skeptical about the wisdom of toying with genes _ even in plants.

<P>
   PARIS _ The beating of a butterfly's wings in one hemisphere, it
turns out, really can cause a hurricane in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers at Cornell published findings that
genetically altered corn, designed to produce pollen toxic to
pests, could also kill caterpillars of the monarch butterflies,
whose principal breeding range is the U.S. corn belt.
</P>
<P>
   Americans heard this news with a momentary shrug of disapproval.
But in the European Union, environmental officials are taking the
news much more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from consumers fed up with what British
newspapers call ``Frankenstein food,'' the union was tightening
regulations that have already limited the number of genetically
modified crops that can be marketed to 18. Now the
butterfly-killing corn seems likely to be barred under a tacit
moratorium on permitting any new items until the Europeans can
agree on new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where three-quarters of all genetically
modified crops are grown, consumers seem hardly to care whether
chemists have tinkered with the genes as long as the stuff looks
and tastes normal. In Europe, demonstrators in southern France this
month uprooted and burned part of a field of experimental modified
rapeseed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Britain, which grows and exports such things, Sainsbury
supermarkets have had to pull everything made from genetically
modified organisms off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the Europeans so much more nervous than Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is agricultural protectionism. Europe resents
the fact that many of the patents on genetically modified crops
with bred-in high yields and resistance to parasites are held by
American companies like Monsanto, DuPont and Dow.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a different attitude toward food in some places.
The French don't like what they call ``industrial'' tomatoes,
fruits and vegetables because they think these products just don't
taste very good.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason may be that Europeans are panicked these
days about food safety. Americans might be nervous too, if the Food
and Drug Administration had as dismal a record as Europe's
bureaucracies have racked up recently in insuring the safety of
food that comes to the table.

   SCHOOL-MOLD (Los Angeles) _ Her fourth-grade daughter's
headaches and stomach aches grew worse and her grades started
falling, but it wasn't till another child in the class was found to
have high levels of chemicals used in the manufacture of portable
classrooms that this mom put two and two together. The results of a
series of tests ended up worse than she expected _ her little girl
had a poisonous mold growing on her lungs, a mold that has invaded
portables around the state and in Santa Clarita, planted itself in
six patients _ a teacher and five school children _ seen by one
toxicologist. By Pat Aidem. (Will move in the ``n'' California news

<P>
   LA-SCHOOL-FIASCO- (Los Angeles) _ Long before the Belmont
Learning Center turned into a toxic nightmare for Los Angeles
school officials, it was a dream: an innovative academy for
teen-agers that would be the talk of the nation, a Taj Mahal to
public education. But warning signs were everywhere _ from state
engineers and scientists, from politicians and residents, even the
man who used to own the oil field. All went unheeded. By Terri
Hardy. (Will move in the ``n'' California news file.)

   Unlike love, being in business sometimes means having to say
you're sorry. Last week, the chairman and chief executive of
Coca-Cola Co. issued one of the more elaborate public apologies by
an American business leader. In newspaper ads in Belgium on Tuesday
that followed an outright ban on the company's products after
reports of people becoming sick, Douglas Ivester said ``I'm sorry''
or ``we regret'' or ``I apologize'' five times.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, which began on June 14 and spread to France, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands a day later in varying degrees, turned into the
largest recall of Coke products in history and created a
public-relations mess for the company. Ivester's apology in the
newspaper was the second issued in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the ramifications of saying ``Sorry'' in
circumstances like Belgium's, where the government says 249 people
reported symptoms like nausea, dizziness and vomiting after
drinking Coke? One expert says it neither opens the way to lawsuits
nor prevents them _ but ought to be done nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of saying you're sorry, if it's genuine, is to say
you're sorry,'' said Steven Fink, president of Lexicon
Communications, a public relations firm that was called in by
Foodmaker Inc. after three children died from eating contaminated
hamburgers from its Jack in the Box restaurants. ``It should come
from the heart, and it should come swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have been slow to apologize _ Exxon, for
example, following the Alaskan oil spill in 1989 _ have found it
hard to recover from perceptions that they just don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester's apology stopped short of admitting liability;
Coca-Cola also released a toxicology report that suggested
something else must have caused the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   That made Coke's apology a more limited serving of humble pie
than other corporate leaders have had to dish out. In Japan,
executives not only apologize publicly but also personally, to each
person harmed in incidents. American Express apologized profusely
in 1989 for a smear campaign against Edmund J. Safra, a former
executive who founded a competing bank. That apology, by James D.
Robinson III, then the company chairman, was reinforced with $4
million in contributions to charities specified by Safra. (Robinson
is now a director of Coca-Cola.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson is considered the gold standard of crisis
management. Its chairman, James E. Burke, dealt with tampering in
its Tylenol pain-reliever capsules in 1986 by removing products
from the market permanently to prevent similar incidents in the
future _ something that has come to be seen as the ultimate
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on Coke products was lifted last week for the most part,
and the company plans to spend heavily across Europe to rebuild
public confidence. On Wednesday, after Belgian authorities let the
company reopen its bottling plants and put products back on store
shelves, Ivester felt compelled to say the S-word one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let down the people of Belgium,'' he said, ``and we're
sorry for that.''  &QL;

 PULLING BUSH DOWN BY HIS COATTAILS  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made a triumphant
visit to Capitol Hill last week, congressional Republicans grabbed
hold of him as if he were a life raft that could sail them all to
victory. But their clutch left some in both parties predicting that
Bush's Washington allies would only weigh down his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although he promised lawmakers that he would not ``bash members
of the Republican Congress,'' Bush, the son of the former
president, is in many ways already running against them. He decries
the partisan atmosphere in Washington that prevents the kind of
conciliation that leads to legislative compromise. He has sought to
soften the image of his party by calling himself a compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But who has done more in recent years to make Republicans look
like hard-edged ideologues than the House Republican majority
brought to power by Newt Gingrich? From the government shutdown of
1995 to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998, House
Republicans have been locked in bitter partisan clashes with
Clinton for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even now when their goal is to make no waves and let Bush become
their leader and spokesman, Republicans in the House cannot seem to
sidestep the kinds of controversies that could give pause to the
moderates and independent voters Bush will need to appeal to if he
becomes the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has taken place in the House this month alone. As the
peace settlement in Kosovo was being concluded and Clinton was
telling the nation it should be proud of driving back the forces of
Slobodan Milosevic, Republicans took to the floor to insist that
America had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is victory?'' asked Rep. William Goodling of
Pennsylvania. ``I call it a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Then within weeks the House was on to its debates over cultural
issues and gun control. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, moved
to the fore with suggestions that day care and contraception were
causing youth violence. He called for creationism to be given equal
billing with evolution in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan's jeremiad prompted George Will, a man of impeccable
conservative credentials, to ask DeLay on ABC's ``This Week With
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' if he was a ``blaming America
first'' kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not expected to get prettier as the presidential race
moves ever nearer to the primary contests. Both political parties
expect a spectacular budget showdown over tax cuts and spending
this summer or fall, just the sort of confrontation Republicans
have shown a penchant for losing during the Clinton years.
Democrats are seeking to use Bush's many congressional endorsements
to tie him to the cuts in domestic programs that Republicans will
have to push through if they are to carry out their budget plan and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush needs to speak out on this,'' said Roy Romer, the
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``He cannot
sit idly by and let his allies in Congress rip apart programs for
families, and then say on the campaign trail that `I'm not going to
leave anybody behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, said Bush could also be hurt by a budget fight if his
congressional allies appear to give in to Clinton for a second year
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a potentially serious mistake to embrace a
Congress that may ultimately frustrate the desires of the grass
roots of the Republican Party,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists that his ties to Congress will not be a liability.
His persistently high poll ratings indicate that Congress is far
less of a drag on him than Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal are on
the leading Democratic contender, Vice President Al Gore. ``My job
is to talk about prosperity with a purpose, which I will do,'' Bush
said. ``I think attempts to tie me to DeLay and all that stuff, I
don't think it's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned voters could always elect Bush and then punish
Republicans in Congress by splitting their tickets and putting
Democrats in control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that Americans will not be as
alienated from Congress as Democrats hope. A survey conducted by Ed
Goeas, a Republican strategist, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, found
that even though 52 percent of voters disapprove of the job
Republicans in Congress are doing, the electorate splits 39 percent
to 39 percent when voters are asked if they would prefer a Democrat
or a Republican for Congress. Twenty-two percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to look like the embodiment of change when you
come to the Capitol and pose with the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard,
predicted that Bush could eventually pay more for consorting with
the lobbyists who packed his Washington fund-raising reception on
Wednesday than for courting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has said in the last two weeks that he's an opponent of
the status quo,'' Kristol said. ``Then he shows up at the Hilton
with 2,000 embodiments of the status quo and Washington insiders.''

   WASHINGTON _ When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas made a triumphant
visit to Capitol Hill last week, congressional Republicans grabbed
hold of him as if he were a life raft that could sail them all to
victory. But their clutch left some in both parties predicting that
Bush's Washington allies would only weigh down his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although he promised lawmakers that he would not ``bash members
of the Republican Congress,'' Bush, the son of the former
president, is in many ways already running against them. He decries
the partisan atmosphere in Washington that prevents the kind of
conciliation that leads to legislative compromise. He has sought to
soften the image of his party by calling himself a compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But who has done more in recent years to make Republicans look
like hard-edged ideologues than the House Republican majority
brought to power by Newt Gingrich? From the government shutdown of
1995 to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998, House
Republicans have been locked in bitter partisan clashes with
Clinton for years.
</P>
<P>
   Even now when their goal is to make no waves and let Bush become
their leader and spokesman, Republicans in the House cannot seem to
sidestep the kinds of controversies that could give pause to the
moderates and independent voters Bush will need to appeal to if he
becomes the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has taken place in the House this month alone. As the
peace settlement in Kosovo was being concluded and Clinton was
telling the nation it should be proud of driving back the forces of
Slobodan Milosevic, Republicans took to the floor to insist that
America had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is victory?'' asked Rep. William Goodling of
Pennsylvania. ``I call it a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Then within weeks the House was on to its debates over cultural
issues and gun control. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, moved
to the fore with suggestions that day care and contraception were
causing youth violence. He called for creationism to be given equal
billing with evolution in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan's jeremiad prompted George Will, a man of impeccable
conservative credentials, to ask DeLay on ABC's ``This Week With
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' if he was a ``blaming America
first'' kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not expected to get prettier as the presidential race
moves ever nearer to the primary contests. Both political parties
expect a spectacular budget showdown over tax cuts and spending
this summer or fall, just the sort of confrontation Republicans
have shown a penchant for losing during the Clinton years.
Democrats are seeking to use Bush's many congressional endorsements
to tie him to the cuts in domestic programs that Republicans will
have to push through if they are to carry out their budget plan and
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush needs to speak out on this,'' said Roy Romer, the
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``He cannot
sit idly by and let his allies in Congress rip apart programs for
families, and then say on the campaign trail that `I'm not going to
leave anybody behind.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, said Bush could also be hurt by a budget fight if his
congressional allies appear to give in to Clinton for a second year
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a potentially serious mistake to embrace a
Congress that may ultimately frustrate the desires of the grass
roots of the Republican Party,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush insists that his ties to Congress will not be a liability.
His persistently high poll ratings indicate that Congress is far
less of a drag on him than Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal are on
the leading Democratic contender, Vice President Al Gore. ``My job
is to talk about prosperity with a purpose, which I will do,'' Bush
said. ``I think attempts to tie me to DeLay and all that stuff, I
don't think it's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned voters could always elect Bush and then punish
Republicans in Congress by splitting their tickets and putting
Democrats in control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that Americans will not be as
alienated from Congress as Democrats hope. A survey conducted by Ed
Goeas, a Republican strategist, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, found
that even though 52 percent of voters disapprove of the job
Republicans in Congress are doing, the electorate splits 39 percent
to 39 percent when voters are asked if they would prefer a Democrat
or a Republican for Congress. Twenty-two percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to look like the embodiment of change when you
come to the Capitol and pose with the Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard,
predicted that Bush could eventually pay more for consorting with
the lobbyists who packed his Washington fund-raising reception on
Wednesday than for courting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has said in the last two weeks that he's an opponent of
the status quo,'' Kristol said. ``Then he shows up at the Hilton
with 2,000 embodiments of the status quo and Washington insiders.''

   ROME _ A decade after the old Yugoslavia began to break up,
President Clinton paid a visit to the thriving, peaceful land of
Slovenia a week ago, followed quickly by a visit to bedraggled
Albanian refugees waiting to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast could not have been greater, and the quick
succession of Balkan photo-ops hinted at how differently the
various parts of what once was Yugoslavia are faring these days.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson was hard to miss: The earlier these countries broke
off from Belgrade _ and the weaker the Serb claim to their land _
the better they are doing now.
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons among the republics that have broken away from
the Serb-dominated country that is still called Yugoslavia are more
complicated than that, because each of these lands had a different
role to play in the old Yugoslavia, and that role helped determine
its fate in the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the four newly independent lands _ Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia _ illustrates how
differently they are faring now.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia, the old Yugoslavia's economic powerhouse, has been the
biggest winner.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it break away first, with a war that was over in a
few days in 1991, but it always did have the best economic chance
to survive on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia had strong, historic ties to its neighbors Italy and
Austria, and those ties lent realism to its ambitions to be part of
the new Europe. Today, they help account for the stability that
prompted Clinton to hold it aloft as a model for the rest of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenians' purchasing power, at two-thirds the Western European
average, is close to that of Greeks, perhaps even equal.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia also benefited from ethnic homogeneity; only a
smattering of Serbs and Croats live there alongside Slovenes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it qualified for consideration for future membership
in both the European Union and the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia was next to break away from Belgrade, in bitter fighting
in 1991 and 1992 that was followed by an ethnic cleansing campaign
in 1995 that evicted Serbs from Croatia and western Bosnia. The
Croats were the Serbs' major rivals in the old Yugoslavia, and
sizable numbers of Serbs lived within Croatia, so its secession was
traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's leader, Franjo Tudjman, is a communist turned
nationalist, much like Milosevic; he too has cemented power under a
form of government that a British expert on the region, Timothy
Garton Ash, calls demokratura _ virtual dictatorship based on free
but not always fair elections and an authoritarian grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   In Serb-led Yugoslavia, the results of this style of rule are by
now well known. Milosevic has kept power during nearly a decade of
conflicts and international embargo, but the Serbian economy is in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia the picture is more mixed. Tudjman's brand of
nationalism has yielded some prosperity, but Croatians are
polarized politically, with Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union
pitted against a harassed and divided opposition. Corruption is
widespread; heeding Western advice, Tudjman has sold off
nationalized industries, but the businesses have often gone to his
cronies. The banking system has been milked to fill his party's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the United States has supported the government in
Zagreb, and America is Croatia's biggest source of foreign
investment. Big construction contracts have gone to Enron Corp. and
Bechtel Corp. Recently the United States lifted an embargo on arms
sales and it has discussed drawing Zagreb closer to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the same human-rights advocates who have denounced Serb
atrocities against Bosnia's Muslims and Kosovo's Albanians are very
critical of Tudjman as well. His government's troops have been
accused of war crimes in the ethnic cleansing of Serbs in 1995, and
of not meeting all the commitments they made in signing the 1995
Dayton accords to pacify Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has had a mixed effect. Croatian tourist
destinations are deserted but the ports have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman was recently treated for cancer. Later this year Croatia
will hold elections, and the opposition is hoping to oust him. But
their divisions considerably reduce the chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia was hurt even more grievously in the breakup of
Yugoslavia, and the Kosovo war only complicates the picture.
Bosnian independence came at the price of a three-year war
characterized by Serb campaigns of ethnic cleansing, the siege of
Sarajevo and the division of the land, under NATO-led peacekeeping,
into a Serb-led republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. The war's
ferocity reflected the extent to which Croats, Serbs and Muslims
were intermixed.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, rampant inflation in what is left of Yugoslavia has
strengthened the marka, the new Bosnian currency, while it has
weakened the role of the Yugoslav currency, the dinar, in the
Bosnian Serb republic. But that region once did 70 percent of its
trade, mainly oil products and timber, with Yugoslavia, and in the
wake of the Kosovo war that business has withered.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a blow to Bosnia as a whole, whose economy now
relies almost entirely on international reconstruction money _ $5.1
billion over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, a fragile political balance created by the Dayton
accords and enforced by NATO soldiers has held. This month, when a
Bosnian Croat, Ante Jelavic, assumed Bosnia's rotating presidency,
he pledged to accelerate Bosnian integration into the West. But
roughly 800,000 Bosnians remain displaced and only a few thousand
have returned to prewar homes in areas now controlled by other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, the southernmost of these lands, is the poorest; it
obtained independence in 1992 without a fight (it has deep ethnic
divisions but an insignificant Serb minority), and is often
portrayed as a contrast to its explosive neighbor, Kosovo. But
Macedonia also seems to be proving that a tolerant and enlightened
political leadership is no guarantee of economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year elections produced a coalition government that united
the leaders of Macedonia's most polarized ethnic groups _ the
Macedonian Slavs (the majority) and the Albanians (about a quarter
of the population). The government inherited a stable but
dirt-poor, economy, with unemployment about 35 percent. Now the
Kosovo war has had a devastating effect. More than 250,000 Kosovar
Albanians poured in, taxing the economy and jeopardizing the ethnic
balance; lost trade and deals cost an estimated $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived last week, the Kosovar Albanians he visited
were still waiting in Macedonia to go home, even as NATO used the
country as a route north for its peacekeepers. To the Macedonians
he pledged Western help to keep the country on the ``path of
prosperity, and even stronger democracy and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonians, and others in the region, will be watching to see
how soon it arrives.

<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Rexhina Gashi, a 68-year-old Albanian woman
too stubborn to leave her block, says she stood on her balcony and
for two months watched the Serbs tear her city apart.
</P>
<P>
   First came the looting. On her street, a once-graceful row of
houses and shops with wooden roofs that runs from the main square
here to a white mosque, it was mostly soldiers and their
girlfriends. But some Serb civilians drove up with cars, she said,
cramming their trunks full.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the burning: Soldiers ignited bombs, she said, that
exploded into flames, quickly consuming the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Now this street, a market for half a millennium, is a heap of
bricks and metal, singed electrical wire looped around ash and
rubble. This work of destruction _ and it took a lot of work to
topple so much in so short a time _ was repeated across Kosovo,
often house to house, inflicting a vast amount of damage that has
barely begun to be tallied.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO began bombing on March 24, there was much
destruction in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there appeared to be a shift, in focus and intensity, since
then: Before, the destruction was almost always confined to rural
areas, where the Yugoslav military could argue that it was flushing
out rebels with the Kosovo Liberation Army who lived, or could
hide, among Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   In March, though, with the onset of NATO's bombing campaign, the
Yugoslavs took the destruction to cities like Pec and Djakovica in
the west and Mitrovica in the north, acting apparently out of pure
revenge, and a desire to drive the Albanians away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Schellenberg, shelter coordinator in Kosovo for the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees, said he had seen more houses
destroyed fully: dynamited from the basement, set aflame
meticulously on every floor, and with roofs not merely damaged but
burned through.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests a campaign that went beyond military tactics. ``If
the KLA killed some police officers, in revenge the Serbs destroyed
an entire street,'' Mrs. Gashi said. ``When NATO attacked, they
burned everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovica, virtually untouched before the NATO bombing, rows
of shops and houses downtown _ now patrolled by French peacekeepers
_ have been bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a park?'' said Leon Ahmetovic, 26, a Kosovo Albanian
who returned to Mitrovica Friday, speculating on the motive. ``I
don't know. To exterminate Albanian people? They thought they could
stay here a long time? Maybe so. Maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   He went down the street to see, for the first time since he fled
in early April, the mini-market that he and his family owned for
eight years. There were no windows. The ice-cream freezer was
burned and melted. All the goods were gone, some $5,000 worth.
Embers remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be my shop,'' he said. Asked if he would
rebuild _ a question that collectively will determine the future of
Kosovo _ he said he was too discouraged to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this?'' he said. ``No. I have no money. It's too hard.
Maybe in a long time. But I don't think so. I have to start from
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops arrived in Kosovo only two weeks ago, and so it is
too early for any but the most preliminary assessment of the damage
to property in Kosovo. But Schellenberg, whose organization must
cope with housing more than a million people displaced by the war,
has made an early survey, both by air around the province and by
foot here in Pec. And it is possible to compare the destruction
seen today to the damage from last year's fighting between Yugoslav
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army that was chronicled in an
extensive study finished earlier this year by the U.N. refugee
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In that earlier survey of 89,998 houses in 625 villages _ areas
most damaged up to that point _ Schellenberg said 36 percent were
damaged to some extent, and 31 percent were considered
uninhabitable. That amounts to 27,672 uninhabitable houses, all in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   From his new preliminary survey almost two weeks ago, he said he
believed another 8,000 to 10,000 houses were now uninhabitable in
urban areas, mostly Pec, Djakovica and Mitrovica. In Pec, he said,
45 percent of the houses are uninhabitable, with some areas as much
as 90 percent destroyed. In Djakovica, he said, 30 percent of the
houses are uninhabitable. The capital city, Pristina, and Prizren,
in the south, did not suffer extensive damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also estimates that another 2,000 to 3,000 houses have been
destroyed in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   This spring's destruction was all the more devastating, he
suggested, because he saw ``not a single'' house damaged in last
year's fighting and later repaired that had been left intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those houses which were temporarily repaired were
destroyed again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw interesting exceptions: Schools, Serb and
Albanian, were largely spared. As were big apartment buildings,
owned presumably by influential people. Most influential people
happened to be Serbs, regardless of who actually lived there.
``These were not damaged, which is good for the housing stock,''
Schellenberg said. ``But it's a clear indication there was a system
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the damage was inflicted by the Yugoslavs, but there is
also damage from the NATO air campaign. In an observation supported
by two weeks of visits across Kosovo, Schellenberg said that most
of the bombs, in fact, seemed to hit specific targets like military
barracks and police stations.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, several border villages were heavily damaged by
NATO bombs, as were bridges and houses near where the bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   The war has hurt more than houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Bela Crkva in Kosovo's southwest, Isuf
Zheniqi, 39, returned to find his two buses, which provided half
his income, burned down to the frames. Here, villagers say 64
people were massacred, many of them the young men who were the
town's future.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Safet Popaj, 60, looked over his burnt home and
announced: ``Kaput.'' In addition to the house, he said he lost
about 11,000 pounds of wheat, 6,600 pounds of corn and all seven of
his cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough killing here,'' he said. ``But, you know,
economic casualties _ that's 100 percent of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Rogova, Rexhep Shala, 64, stood in his
own destroyed house but said it was not important on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``To survive we can just eat bread,'' he said. ``But to rebuild
_ now we are 20 years behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of hard-nosed practicalities, Schellenberg said he
believed the U.N. high commissioner for refugees would be able to
provide shelter for the returned refugees before winter. As in
Bosnia, the reconstruction in Kosovo will begin with efforts to
create one room in the house safe from weather. Then, by
mid-October, the plan is to make sure that room can withstand the
cold of winter.
</P>
<P>
   For that, he said, there are enough materials pledged by the
United Nations, the European Union, the United States and other
donors.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term reconstruction requires a much greater effort,
not all of it monetary.
</P>
<P>
   A discouraging sign was the dozens of fires eating through
houses in a Serb and Gypsy neighborhood in Mitrovica. Albanians
looted jewelry, pots and pans, carpets. Mothers and children looted
together. Yet more homes were crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the same to us,'' Nexhat Gjeloshi, 25, a Kosovo
Albanian, said as he walked unconcerned past the smoke. ``They did
worse to us.''

   House Bill Makes It Harder to Seize Property
</P>
<P>
   A surprising coalition of liberals and conservatives on the
House Judiciary Committee persuaded the House to pass a bill that
would sharply limit the power of the police and prosecutors to
confiscate property in narcotics and other criminal cases. The
measure marked the first time in nearly 30 years that Congress had
taken away from law enforcement some of the vast powers it approved
at the height of the war on drugs.
</P>

   The 375-48 House vote is more than enough to overcome opposition
from the White House.

   Loan to China Approved
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a no-brainer for the World Bank: Give China a
loan to move 58,000 poor farmers _ volunteers only, please _ to
more fertile land in western China. But there was a hitch: The land
was partly settled by Tibetans. Congress and the administration
protested that the project would help China dilute the presence of
ethnic Tibetans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a remarkable fight between Washington and the
bank, which ultimately decided to overrule its biggest shareholder
and go ahead with the loan _ but only after another review to make
sure the resettlement violates none of its own rules.

   Senate Kills Steel Bill
</P>
<P>
   No one has Washington wired like the steel lobby. At least,
that's what everyone thought. For a year Big Steel has been
complaining about big imports. It got the Clinton administration to
crack down on Japanese, Korean, Russian and Brazilian steel
``dumped'' in the United States at super-cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   But it wanted more: a law setting quotas on the amount of
imported foreign steel. The House went along, but now the Senate,
in a surprise vote, said this was no time to turn to protectionism.

   AMA to Form Union
</P>
<P>
   Long before HMOs came along, Americans envied doctors for their
incomes and independence. But in this age of managed care, doctors
have started to sound like blue-collar workers, complaining about
shrinking incomes and being pushed around. As a result, the
American Medical Association has approved a startling resolution to
form a union to help the many doctors who believe banding together
is the only way to stand up to managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the AMA, which represents 34 percent of the
nation's doctors, insist that the union's goal will be to improve
patient care, but many health-care experts say its main goal will
be identical with that of any other union: to fatten its members'
paychecks.

   Senate Backs U.N. Payment
</P>
<P>
   The United States took a big step toward paying nearly $1
billion in back dues to the United Nations. The Senate voted 98-1
to pay the arrears in exchange for a reduction in the overall U.S.
contribution to the United Nations from 25 percent to 20 percent of
its budget.
</P>
<P>
   There is still far to go before the dues are actually paid,
however. The bill now goes to the House, where Republicans are
threatening to add anti-abortion provisions, as they have in the
past. That could lead to a presidential veto.

   Then Peter Norton, a software entrepreneur, bought the letters

forgiving gesture, Norton said Ms. Maynard had every right to sell

   Party Nixed
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was to be one of those lavish celebrations that
the uninvited are meant to envy: a party at the city-owned Brooklyn
Navy Yard to launch the debut issue of a slick magazine called
Talk. There would be celebrities, fireworks and the Manhattan
skyline to serve as a majestic backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   And the hosts had the requisite aura of clout. Tina Brown, the
former editor of The New Yorker, is now the editor of Talk. And
Harvey Weinstein is co-chairman of Miramax Films, one of the
magazine's backers, and a partner with the city in plans to turn
the Navy Yard into a movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   But mere speculation that the visage of Hillary Rodham Clinton
might grace the magazine's first cover was reason enough for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely opponent if she runs for the Senate,
to deny the use of the Navy Yard for the party. The action
attracted a lot of publicity _ the free kind for the magazine, the
bad kind for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor's aides explained that they were already
harboring logistical concerns about the party when they saw an item
in The New York Post that Talk's first issue would feature the
first lady. It also did not go unnoticed that Mrs. Clinton is
friendly with Weinstein, a generous contributor to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that item, a Navy Yard official explained, ``We felt
that the party was beginning to take on a political cast,'' which
``could easily violate our policy against hosting political
events.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's executives reveled in the buzz that the
disinvitation attracted; Ms. Brown even joked that she might ask
the mayor whether his official residence, Gracie Mansion, was
available for the event.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor wasn't in a partying mood. When questions about
the matter persisted at a news conference a day later, he abruptly
ended the session and left the room.

   What Do Women Want?
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does one piece of research touch on so many burning
issues, starting with: How come women think a waif like Leonardo di
Caprio is the cutest ever one week, and then line up for
craggy-faced Sean Connery the next?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may have to do with a woman's menstrual cycle,
according to a study by British and Japanese psychologists that
found that the appeal of rugged male looks rises with a woman's
chances of conception.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the journal Nature, was prompted by the
mystery of why courtship is more confusing for human guys than
animal guys, for whom having the most exaggerated set of masculine
traits _ the brightest plumage or longest tusks _ has always been a
sure way to get a date. Since the ability to grow such equivalents
of a jutting chin indicate robust health, animal mating appears to
be driven by a search for the best genes.
</P>
<P>
   But women aren't like that, at least according to what they had
told earlier researchers: When given a choice among male faces,
they would generally opt for one with smoother, softer _ more
feminine _ features. To reconcile this gap, the researchers turned
to the menstrual cycle, after pondering one other recently
established fact: that women's general distaste for men's smell
abates around the time of ovulation, when fertility is at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, in fact, found only two factors that dampened the
hunk-to-sweetie-pie swing. Women taking birth-control pills picked
a Mr. Right and stuck to him, and so did women asked to pick a face
for a long-term relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The study concedes that this adds up to a controversial view, in
evolutionary terms, of a women's ideal mating strategy: Go ahead,
marry Mr. Nice-and-Boring, but don't throw away that bad boy's
number.

   ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. _ Hoisting a bat that looked huge on a
10-year-old, Benjamin Gold stood nervously at the plate under his
floppy orange Orioles cap.
</P>
<P>
   His parents watched from lawn chairs behind the backstop. His
tutor studied the play from behind the first-base line, pointing a
video camera at Benji for a post-game critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving around too much in the box _ and dropping his
hands,'' the tutor, Mark Venditti, had noticed during Benji's first
at-bat. Between innings, he had talked to the boy about making an
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Benji took a mighty swing and tapped the ball toward the
pitcher's mound, then scampered toward first base. It was good
enough for an infield hit. And the runner on third base made it
home, so Benji was credited with a crucial run batted in, an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that American childhood has become a serious
venture, parents like Loren and Debbie Gold are paying $70 an hour,
sometimes more, to private coaches to sharpen the skills of their
Little League ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Golds, who harbor no illusions about athletic
scholarships or big money in the professional leagues, hiring a
tutor seemed a logical way to help a child whose heart was broken
into pieces with every strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for his self-esteem,'' said Mrs. Gold, a 43-year-old
employee recruiter. ``He was getting to the point where he just
wanted to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard last year,'' Benji agreed. ``When you strike out,
you know, and people say you should be off the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents find themselves in a spot these days. The increasingly
competitive nature of childhood makes parents feel practically
obligated to give their children every possible edge in academics
and athletics. And yet, the rigors of self-improvement for children
_ preschoolers now go to foreign language camps _ can take an
exacting toll on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message used to be, `Be the best you can be,'' said
Cynthia Kowa-Basler, a middle-school counselor in Dixon, Ill. ``Now
the message is simply, `Be the best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kowa-Basler said one eighth-grade student sat and wept in
the counselor's office because he did not believe he could live up
to his parents' expectations. The counselor scheduled a meeting
with the parents to deliver her professional advice in the bluntest
of terms: ``Back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golds, who have two children, share the ambivalence of many
parents. On one hand, they want to encourage Benji and their
daughter, Samantha, to take piano lessons, play sports and
participate in social activities. But they fear an overload.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, who is 11, has talked about feeling ``stressed out''
by all of her activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an 11-year-old starts talking about being too stressed,''
Mrs. Gold said, ``it makes you stop and wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Beck, a sociologist at Northwestern University, said
child rearing has taken a more management-style approach,
especially among parents who are well-educated and successful. In
some ways, he said, children have come to be seen a bit like growth
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an earlier generation, parents were younger, going at life
without much of a plan, a little courageous and a little foolhardy,
a kind of what-the-heck attitude,'' Beck said. ``But many of
today's parents are more serious. They put off having children for
a career. And having had success in their careers, they use the
same goal-oriented principles when it comes to raising their kids.
They study what's needed for success. They look at the competition.
It's all a very rational, very market-oriented approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In his novel ``Wobegon Boy,'' Garrison Keillor suggested that
parents of an earlier time seemed to have better things to do than
obsess about their children. ``They did not read books about
parenting, and when they gathered with other adults, at Lutheran
church suppers or family get-togethers, they didn't talk about
schools or about the prevailing theories of child development,'' he
wrote. ``They did not weave their lives around yours. They had
their own lives, which were mysterious to you.''

<P>
   In part, parents have become more intimately involved in the
activities of their children because they now must act as
chauffeurs, carting their children from piano lesson to tennis
court to soccer match, driving minivans to the league games that
have replaced the unchaperoned pickup games of the old
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crop of parents can scarcely take sole blame for the
image of the overzealous Little League parent. Accounts of
bothersome parents ranting from the bleachers go back to the days
before the 60-year-old Little League.
</P>
<P>
   But today's frenetic competition among children, and among the
parents of children, has turned up the pressure to win. It is
perhaps not surprising then, in a service economy where almost
anything can be taught and anyone trained, that Junior's batting
flaws are something to be repaired by a service that advertises in
the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   When a child goes into a slump, plenty of parents pick up the
telephone and call Grand Slam USA, one of the many places around
the country that now provides baseball instructors to boys and
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday morning, we get the frantic calls from parents,''
said Leland Fisher, an owner of Grand Slam, in suburban Palatine.
``They'll say, `It's an emergency _ the boy struck out twice on
Saturday _ we need help right away.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the average young ballplayer still relies on pals or a
parent, private tutoring has become a familiar part of the social
landscape around the country, said Lance Van Auken, a spokesman for
Little League Baseball Inc., in Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not any doubt that there's a lot more private
instruction out there,'' said Van Auken, who noted that a big
portion of the students were girls, trying to win college
scholarships in softball. ``There are no hard numbers, because it's
privately done by parents. But you hear a lot of anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for instruction has also popularized baseball camp. A
handful of such camps a generation ago has grown to a big business,
Van Auken said, with dozens and dozens of camps around the country,
especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Hlavacek, 14, practices batting, he takes tips from
an instructor who works as a professional scout. The help has paid
off. The boy, who just graduated from the eighth grade in the
Chicago suburbs, has a red-hot batting average of over .500.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Allison, who is entering her senior year of high
school, takes lessons for fast-pitch softball. She has also been an
outstanding ballplayer, and hopes to play on a college team.
</P>
<P>
   To their father, Jerry Hlavecek, who pays more than $100 a week
for the lessons, the private instruction has helped their talents
soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to play the sport at a higher level, this is the
only way you're going to get there,'' said Hlavacek, a business
executive. ``How do you think Ken Griffey learned to hit? Somebody
taught him, that's how.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and children say it works better to have a
professional as coach, rather than a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confrontation that normally happens between a father and
son _ it doesn't happen,'' Hlavacek said.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Michael, agreed. ``You don't really listen to your
dad,'' he said. ``He sometimes yells. And sometimes, he doesn't
know what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a coach also helped domestic relations in the McEnerney
home in Mount Prospect, northwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband didn't want to get into any more arguments with my
son,'' said Maureen McEnerney, whose 14-year-old son, Matthew, and
17-year-old daughter, Christie, take private lessons. ``My kids now
love the game even more. Plus they get along better with their
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McEnerney, a hairdresser, and her husband, William, an
electrician, get the impression that other people think hiring
sports tutors seems excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's like playing a musical instrument,'' Mrs.
McEnerney said. ``It's a mechanical thing. It's a matter of
studying and learning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day after his latest ball game, Benji went to the ball park
to train under the eye of Venditti, a 26-year-old software salesman
who played two seasons with the Zanesville (Ohio) Greys in the
independent Frontier League. Venditti tutors four players on
Benji's Orioles team. In all, he works with about 20 players, from
age 8 through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atta boy, Benji,'' Venditti called out, as Benji swatted a
line drive. ``You're doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gold and her husband, Loren, watched the practice from
their lawn chairs, praising their son afterward _ ``Nice lesson,
Benji,'' they said. Gold, a 45-year-old electrical engineer, said
he worked long hours and could not spare much time to play with
Benji himself.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he had time, Gold would not be much help. ``I was no
ballplayer,'' he said smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Not all fathers bow out like Loren Gold. Around the batting
cages of the league are fathers who strut like Babe Ruth, sounding
as if they know everything about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the owner of Grand Slam in Palatine, says he cringes at
what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid will be crying, `I don't want to play, I don't want to
play,' and the father is pulling him along,'' Fisher said.
``Sometimes, the biggest thing the instructor does is simply build
up the kid's confidence. After all the criticism from the parent,
they need to be told they're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Fisher said, the instructors will turn the tables
and give an overbearing father a taste of his own medicine. The
instructor will ask the father to step into the cage and try his
luck with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he's liable to see that it's not so easy, after all,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Or he must face the fact, he added, that the child's lack of
skill was just an inherited trait.

<P>
   His English halting, his hand never far from a cigarette, Ken
Alibek sat in his office near Washington on a gray day about a year
ago and said he would readily give up his life if that were what it
would take.
</P>
<P>
   He told of a death threat. A serious one. But his demeanor in
recounting the incident was calm, even peaceful. In hours of
interviewing and talk, and in subsequent conversations over the
course of a year, he seemed to be a warrior with an eye not so much
on victory as on redemption, a man trying to make amends for a dark
past.
</P>
<P>
   Alibek was a military physician in the Soviet Union. Like every
doctor, he took an oath to preserve life and guard against medical
abuse. But after doing so, he devoted himself for 17 years not to
healing but to the science of germ warfare _ devising new ways of
harnessing deadly microbes to maim and kill people. Among his
killers were smallpox, anthrax, tularemia and plague.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a theory. Mishaps of infection killed peers and
once struck him with a raging fever. In time, Alibek was promoted
to the top of the Soviet Union's sprawling effort to advance germ
warfare, which employed more than 60,000 experts even as Moscow
publicly denounced biological weapons as immoral and repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Alibek was born a Kazakh and sprang from the
region's ancient nobility _ the Asiatic hordes that gave Moscow the
jitters _ his lineage was impeccable from a socialist perspective.
His grandfather was a hero of the communist revolution in
Kazakhstan and was the republic's first people's commissar of
internal affairs, responsible for the police and security there in
the 1920s and 1930s. His father was decorated for bravery in World
War II and served as a police official in Alma-Ata, the old name of
the Kazakh capital now known as Almaty.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade ago, that whole world began changing. Soon after
the Soviet Union fell apart in late 1991, Alibek quit his
germ-warfare post and cut his ties with the Russian military,
hoping to free himself from labors he had begun to despise. Still
in Moscow, he worked for a Kazakh bank.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1992, he recounts in his new book, ``Biohazard''
(Random House), he returned home to a newly independent Kazakhstan,
where high officials asked him to head a military program they said
they were establishing in germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled, he declined the offer, his hands trembling in anger
and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he defected to the United States, ready to blow the
whistle on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After a year or so of secret debriefings, intelligence officials
offered him a new identity. Shorn of his past, he could become a
new person, with a new life and a new job.
</P>
<P>
   He declined. Instead, Kanatjan Kalibekov changed his name to
make it sound more American, becoming Ken Alibek. Eventually, he
decided to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government officials asked me not to,'' Alibek said in his
office. ``For five years, they tried to keep me silent.''
</P>
<P>
   American experts feared for his life, suspecting that former
Soviet bosses and associates might seek revenge, he recalled. But
Alibek decided to run the risk. ``You know,'' he said, ``if a
solution of this problem would cost just my life, that's a pretty
fair cost.'' After a visitor expressed surprise at his statement,
he said it again, deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he continued, drawing near, his wide face
hinting at his Central Asian roots, ``we're very close to serious
changes. The problem is biological terrorism. If we don't start
discussing this situation openly _ if we don't start developing
serious protection in many areas, using political approaches,
medical approaches, scientific approaches _ we'll face serious
problems in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Alibek went public with that message, appearing in
television and newspaper interviews. His book details the germ
weapons that he says Moscow made, including warheads for long-range
missiles. He not only suggests that germs were sold abroad as the
Soviet state collapsed and Russian scientists sought new ways to
support themselves, but he also names the names of many high
officials, rogue scientists and former colleagues, potentially a
dangerous thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his motives is remorse. ``Of course I feel
guilty,'' Alibek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived with this situation for years, and with the knowledge
of the situation,'' he continued. But after defecting to the United
States and meditating on the work of Russia's germ warriors, he
said, ``Even for me it was scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous, huge, sophisticated program,'' he said.
``A lot of people were involved, a lot of resources. And all people
who were in charge were very important, had a lot of privileges
like personal cars, special telephone lines, special medical
treatments _ you know, a lot of such things. And of course, that's
why not a lot of people want this program to be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that Russia still harbors a clandestine program for
germ warfare and said he hopes his revelations will help force
Moscow to end its deceptions and redeem itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is angry,'' he said. ``It has denied what I am saying.
But I will continue my disclosures. My final, ultimate objective is
to have Russia as a partner _ but after, just after, we know
everything that is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightmares used to haunt him, he said. Wrapped in a
claustrophobic anti-germ suit, he would be trapped in a production
maze, caught amid fermenters brewing swarms of deadly microbes. But
such dreams, he said, are rare now that he has left that world and
spoken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's some kind of relief,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in Kazakhstan, Alibek was fascinated by the
image of medics saving lives amid battlefield smoke. ``It struck me
that military physicians were soldiers after their own fashion,
waging a private war,'' he writes in his book.
</P>
<P>
   In medical school, he planned on being a psychiatrist, on
banishing demons. But instead he was lured into the secretive world
of germ weapons, drawn, he said, by careerism, patriotism and the
firm belief that America, too, was lying about its renunciation of
such deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral argument,'' he said in his book, ``for using any
available weapon against an enemy threatening us with certain
annihilation seemed to me irrefutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek has his critics, ranging from nationalist Russians who
consider him disloyal, to Americans who blame him for working with
biological weapons in the first place. These critics call him an
opportunist and worse. Having jumped off the sinking Soviet ship,
they charge, he is now trying to soothe a guilty conscience, sell
books and make money, just another former thug trying to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Alibek dismissed them. ``The book is done,'' he said. ``People
should make their own conclusion about what was going on'' in
Moscow's secret biological maze, and about the implications of the
Soviet collapse. ``It doesn't matter what they think about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he recently received a flier from a Moscow-based
company, Bioeffekt Ltd., that offered, by mail, various strains of
tularemia, a highly infectious germ that causes chills, fever and
can kill _ a germ that was central to the Soviet arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kislichkin, formerly a scientist at Obolensk, a top
Soviet biological warfare center, was listed in the flier as the
company's president, Alibek says in the book. Dozens of such
businesses have risen out of Soviet ashes, he added, ``contributing
to an alarming proliferation of biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, as well as during his interviews, he talks
repeatedly of Yury T. Kalinin, who Alibek says was his old Soviet
boss in germ warfare and remains a force in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever return to Moscow, you won't be leaving,'' Alibek
said a Russian visitor warned him, passing on a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alibek, 48, is employed at Hadron, Inc., a company in
Annandale, Va., that does consulting work for the federal
government. As in his public advocacy, he hopes to advance germ
defenses. His research centers on a way to boost the body's immune
system to heighten overall protection against deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream,'' he said of creating a shield against the
kinds of bullets he once made as a warrior.

 &HT;    Young Republicans gather in Ohio
 &HT;    By Meggen Lindsay
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They came to campaign. They came to network. They
came to hear their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And over four days they've drawn an impressive speaking list:
Charlton Heston and GOP presidential hopefuls John Kasich and Lamar
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The approximate 650 ``young'' Republicans, mostly white, many in
their 30s, converged at the Regal Hotel in Cincinnati this week to
elect officers, pass resolutions and meet politicians during the
four-day Young Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a lobbyist, I'm an accountant. I don't have a
political agenda,'' said California delegate Mark Szulc, 37, a
former national executive director of the Young Republican National
Federation. ``As cheesy as it may sound, I come to meet the future
leaders of our country. It's nice to be able to meet these people
on an informal basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which requires members to be between 18 and
40, approved a platform, elected its national officers, rallied
support for conservative causes _ and did its share of partying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to do the business and have as much fun as
possible in the process,'' said J. Mance Bowden III, executive
director of the Young Republican National Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, the Oscar-award winning actor and president of the
National Rifle Association addressed the convention Thursday
afternoon. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander spoke Friday
afternoon, while Ohio Congressman John Kasich will speak tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was encouraged by the number and dedication of the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the future of our party,'' he said. ``They are always
a big help on campaigns. I'm here trying to earn their support _
they make up a whole new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander spoke during a luncheon, initially taking cracks at
Democratic candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country doesn't need a president whose chief
accomplishment is being the number one cheerleader in Clinton's pep
rally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring parents, kids and schools to be the most important
campaign issues, Alexander urged giving parents tax breaks and more
flexible working schedules, but emphasized that the responsibility
for children lies with the parents, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is not at Washington, D.C., the answer is at
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the Republican campaign, he warned about deciding
the GOP candidate too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make a mistake on nominating the best candidate, we will
have 16 years of Clinton and Gore,'' he said. ``We'll be better off
if we have a contest within the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Republicans can't beat Gore without a strong
debate, Alexander suggested having monthly debates among the GOP
candidates to ensure his party's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is too important to be bought and it ought not to
be inherited,'' he said. ``A sure fire way not to have the
best-prepared candidate is to anoint him or her without a
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about GOP opponent George W. Bush, Alexander replied,
``He's not tested, he's not seasoned. He's good in the Texas
league, but he hasn't played in the national league.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches seemed to energize the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are opportunities you just don't get on a regular
basis,'' said national committee woman Janie Wolfe, 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Republicans were also there for the nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chairman of Illinois' delegates, Gary Mendenhall, joked
that the best benefit about the convention was ``drinking beer.''
He later rephrased the fun as ``a state-to-state camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, which was hosted by the Ohio League of Young
Republican Clubs and the Blue Chip Republicans, took a little over
a year to coordinate. Cincinnati won the bid from a sight selection
committee, who came to the Queen City for a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a great opportunity to show off a great time in
Ohio,'' said Bob Bennett, Ohio Republican Party Chairman. ``We have
a strong and active YR organization in Ohio, and this is another
way to energize young people.''

 UNDATED: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in Kazakhstan, Alibek was fascinated by the
image of medics saving lives amid battlefield smoke. ``It struck me
that military physicians were soldiers after their own fashion,
waging a private war,'' he writes in his book.
</P>
<P>
   In medical school, he planned on being a psychiatrist, on
banishing demons. But instead he was lured into the secretive world
of germ weapons, drawn, he said, by careerism, patriotism and the
firm belief that America, too, was lying about its renunciation of
such deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral argument,'' he said in his book, ``for using any
available weapon against an enemy threatening us with certain
annihilation seemed to me irrefutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alibek has his critics, ranging from nationalist Russians who
consider him disloyal, to Americans who blame him for working with
biological weapons in the first place. These critics call him an
opportunist and worse. Having jumped off the sinking Soviet ship,
they charge, he is now trying to soothe a guilty conscience, sell
books and make money, just another former thug trying to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Alibek dismissed them. ``The book is done,'' he said. ``People
should make their own conclusion about what was going on'' in
Moscow's secret biological maze, and about the implications of the
Soviet collapse. ``It doesn't matter what they think about me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he recently received a flier from a Moscow-based
company, Bioeffekt Ltd., that offered, by mail, various strains of
tularemia, a highly infectious germ that causes chills, fever and
can kill _ a germ that was central to the Soviet arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Kislichkin, formerly a scientist at Obolensk, a top
Soviet biological warfare center, was listed in the flier as the
company's president, Alibek says in the book. Dozens of such
businesses have risen out of Soviet ashes, he added, ``contributing
to an alarming proliferation of biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, as well as during his interviews, he talks
repeatedly of Yury T. Kalinin, who Alibek says was his old Soviet
boss in germ warfare and remains a force in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever return to Moscow, you won't be leaving,'' Alibek
said a Russian visitor warned him, passing on a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alibek, 48, is employed at Hadron, Inc., a company in
Annandale, Va., that does consulting work for the federal
government. As in his public advocacy, he hopes to advance germ
defenses. His research centers on a way to boost the body's immune
system to heighten overall protection against deadly germs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my dream,'' he said of creating a shield against the
kinds of bullets he once made as a warrior.

 &HT;    Airstream still riding high
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON CENTER, Ohio _ Audrey Farley of Florida had just
finished touring Airstream Inc.'s main assembly plant Thursday when
she and other curious members of the Wally Byam Caravan Club
International found their way to one of the company's latest motor
homes, the 39-foot Land Yacht XL.
</P>
<P>
   Farley, owner of an Airstream trailer for 20 years, peeked in
the bedroom, admired the wood kitchen cabinets and leather couches
and stopped with a look of wonderment in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was doing some comparison shopping, Farley laughed
and said, ``No, honey. I'm just wishing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of Farley's affection is a $220,000, top-of-the-line
motor home complete with television, stereo system, microwave and
queen-sized bed. About a dozen of these swank homes on wheels will
be available for sale by end of August.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years the Airstream name has been synonymous
with quality and comfort. To many, Airstreams are the Cadillacs of
RVs.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were quarantined
in an Airstream trailer upon returning from their mission to the
moon in 1969. Today, space shuttle astronauts are driven to the
launch pad in an Airstream motor home.
</P>
<P>
   While a long-time favorite of well-heeled retirees, in more
recent years Airstreams have also become revered by younger
consumers and celebrities. Actors Anthony Edwards and Tom Hanks are
among the more famous Airstream owners who use them as dressing
rooms or to get to and from movie sets.
</P>
<P>
   The only place in the world where Airstream trailers and motor
homes are built is in Jackson Center, population 1,400, a rural
community about 60 miles north of Dayton in Shelby County.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure why Airstream founder Wally Byam picked Jackson
Center to open a plant in 1952. Byam started building them in
California in the early 1930s, but was forced to stop production
during World War II after the aluminum alloy he was using was
classified as a critical war material.
</P>
<P>
   Byam, for whom the Wally Byam Caravan Club International is
named, resumed production in 1947. He started building Airstreams
in Jackson Center, most long-time employees believe, because he
wanted to improve Airstream's distribution in the Eastern United
States and received economic incentives from the village, said Mark
Wahl, Airstream's vice president of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Byam died in 1962. But the Airstream product lives on as
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   Each afternoon at 2 o'clock, employees conduct tours for a few
dozen people, mostly Airstream owners and potential owners who want
to see how the product is made.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, with the Wally Byam rally taking place
in Fairborn, those tours have become larger and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Wahl. ``We think it's important for people to
see how their products are built,'' he said, adding that some come
specifically for the chance to see their own trailer or motor home
being built.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Uyematsu of California took a tour Thursday morning with 40
other early arrivals for this year's Wally Byam rally. Uyematsu
became an Airstream convert in 1968 for one simple reason: ``It was
easier to tow than the one I had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is overwhelming for me,'' said Eileen Stadler of Oregon,
as she toured the plant with her husband, Bill. Both retirees, the
Stadlers are spending their entire summer in their 3-year-old
Airstream motor home. Next on the travel itinerary is a road trip
to Stadler's native Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   It's this type of loyalty that helped Airstream weather the
tough times, such as the late 1970s when gasoline availability was
at an all-time low. That blow severely curtailed production and
prompted the company to lay off three-quarters of employees, shut
down facilities in Versailles, Ohio and Cerritos, Calif., and merge
all its operations into Jackson Center.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Airstream has more than 400 employees who work out of
Airstream's eight facilities in Jackson Center. They make 11 motor
homes and 12 trailers each week. The current manufacturing cycle
for a trailer is about eight days, while motor homes taken an
average 13 days to complete. Wahl estimates it takes about 300 work
hours to assemble some of the longer trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've improved on efficiency, but the units are much more
complex today,'' Wahl said.
</P>
<P>
   The main assembly plant feels more like an overgrown garage than
the well-oiled manufacturing center it is.
</P>
<P>
   There's no assembly line; rather, teams of workers perform
various tasks in different buildings. One team assembles the
trailers' famous rounded shells out of large sections of aluminum
and aluminum alloy, while other employees build the chassis that
are later mated with the shells.
</P>
<P>
   Following assembly, finished units are inspected and tested for
leaks in a booth that simulates strong winds and torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year marriage of Jackson Center and Airstream seems
solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a very good business partner. We are really
blessed to have them here,'' said Jackson Center Mayor Scott
Klopfenstein, a former employee in Airstream's engineering
department and mayor for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Airstream generates significant income for the
village. But Klopfenstein also is proud of the other things
Airstream has provided the community, such as the two new village
welcome signs erected earlier this month and the new generator for
the village fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Airstream is equally enamored with Jackson Center. Airstream
plans to expand its 249,000-square-feet of manufacturing space to
accommodate larger models of trailers and motor homes with even
more amenities, and all of that expansion will take place in
Jackson Center, Wahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed some strong roots in the community,'' he said.
``There's a great work ethic here. It just makes sense to stay.''

<P>
   During years of fighting liability suits, makers of silicone
breast implants paid out more than $7 billion in verdicts and
settlements to women claiming injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, came a correction of sorts. An independent
scientific panel issued a report suggesting the courts had been
wrong; implants, the scientists said, didn't cause serious diseases
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing earlier panels, the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academy of Sciences said silicone implants can cause
localized problems. But the report said there was no persuasive
evidence that the implants caused the more serious ailments that
some juries had blamed on them, like lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The report, far too late to retrieve the $7 billion, made the
courts look foolish, hoodwinked by scientific speculation. It
highlighted sharp differences between legal and scientific
approaches to the search for truth, and increased the growing
pressure on the legal system to move away from its tradition of
letting juries sort out conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science has become so sophisticated, and it is involved in so
many lawsuits, that the courts are having to come to terms with how
they are going to deal with it,'' said Paul R. Rice, a professor at
American University's Washington College of Law. ``And they are not
doing a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between scientific and legal approaches centers on
differing definitions of certainty. The two systems have different
goals, which often come into conflict in courtroom battles.
</P>
<P>
   Science, which never stops searching for answers, has a high
threshold for reaching conclusions: 95 percent certainty, some
scientists say, is necessary to decide that one thing probably
caused another. But the law must stop its search at the conclusion
of each case. So juries in civil cases are told that a mere
preponderance of the evidence _ 51 percent _ is enough certainty to
render a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   While the breast implant report was regarded by many as
authoritative, the battle is far from over. Lawyers for plaintiffs
attacked the report as little more than a rehash of earlier
studies, some of which were financed by the manufacturers, and
suggested that scientific research would one day conclude that
there were serious problems with the implants.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years critics of the way the legal system uses
scientific evidence have been winning. For years, judges have been
defending themselves against accusations that they permitted ``junk
science'' guesswork to persuade juries to conclude that all sorts
of products were responsible for illnesses and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the criticism that courts were letting juries be
misled with untested scientific theories and, sometimes, mere
speculation, the Supreme Court and lower courts across the country
have begun to make new rules limiting scientific and technical
evidence that is presented to before juries. In a series of cases
beginning in 1993, the Supreme Court has said trial judges should
be more vigilant ``gate keepers,'' assuring that ``scientific
testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant but reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over breast implants and similar cases in which the
courts appeared to have reached incorrect scientific decisions have
accelerated the trend, which has often meant judges restrict the
scientific evidence that can be presented to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   As legal cases have become increasingly technical, said Peter H.
Schuck, a Yale law professor, the different legal and scientific
approaches have clashed more openly than ever before. ``Science is
always gaining new information,'' Schuck said. ``The law is the
opposite. It has to make a decision so people can get on with their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal system long ago recognized that legal and scientific
determinations might contradict each other, he said. For decades,
for example, individual smokers have had difficulty winning damage
suits against tobacco companies despite the overwhelming scientific
consensus that tobacco is linked to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the inconsistencies are a small price to pay
for a legal system that does not have the luxury of waiting for
scientific certainty. ``People just have to get used to the idea
that the legal system is imperfect,'' said Saul Levmore, a
professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say the courts have used their lower standard
of proof to encourage big verdicts in liability cases that are
supported by little more than weak theories. ``It is bad for the
rule of law,'' said David Bernstein, a professor at George Mason
University Law School in Arlington, Va., ``because the tort system
is supposed to be based on the proposition that you only pay when
you actually cause injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to insist on more definite scientific evidence
began in the 1980s, Schuck said, when some judges grew skeptical of
some of the scientific claims in high-profile cases. Judges began
to insist that plaintiffs' lawyers present epidemiological
evidence, for example, to back up the claims of doctors and other
expert witnesses that the products at issue had caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two huge cases brought such critiques from judges. They involved
the claims of Vietnam veterans who said they were harmed by the
defoliant Agent Orange, and the claims of people who believed birth
defects were caused by the morning-sickness drug Bendectin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics called the plaintiffs in those cases blackmailers who
were capitalizing on the sympathies jurors have for injured people.
Such cases began a momentum that will now be spurred further by the
report on the silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice and some other legal experts say startling disclosures
about companies that are exonerated by science after paying
billions of dollars are only part of the story. ``What about all
the cases of people who are now dead,'' he asked, ``and the company
was responsible and never had to pay?''

</P>
<P>
   But some critics say the courts have used their lower standard
of proof to encourage big verdicts in liability cases that are
supported by little more than weak theories. ``It is bad for the
rule of law,'' said David Bernstein, a professor at George Mason
University Law School in Arlington, Va., ``because the tort system
is supposed to be based on the proposition that you only pay when
you actually cause injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to insist on more definite scientific evidence
began in the 1980s, Schuck said, when some judges grew skeptical of
some of the scientific claims in high-profile cases. Judges began
to insist that plaintiffs' lawyers present epidemiological
evidence, for example, to back up the claims of doctors and other
expert witnesses that the products at issue had caused injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two huge cases brought such critiques from judges. They involved
the claims of Vietnam veterans who said they were harmed by the
defoliant Agent Orange, and the claims of people who believed birth
defects were caused by the morning-sickness drug Bendectin.
</P>
<P>
   Critics called the plaintiffs in those cases blackmailers who
were capitalizing on the sympathies jurors have for injured people.
Such cases began a momentum that will now be spurred further by the
report on the silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice and some other legal experts say startling disclosures
about companies that are exonerated by science after paying
billions of dollars are only part of the story. ``What about all
the cases of people who are now dead,'' he asked, ``and the company
was responsible and never had to pay?''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With its preference for crossfire over consensus,
harangues over handshakes, the New York Legislature has long
engaged in an us-vs.-them tribalism that influences everything _
from the favors it bestows on constituents to the allocation of
water coolers in the Statehouse. Now, though, the coarse political
customs here have become so entrenched that state leaders have been
all but unable to perform their most fundamental duties.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget is three months late, preventing school systems
and nonprofit groups from doing modest planning. Significant
health-care proposals lie virtually untouched and the Legislature
cannot even agree on minor criminal justice initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the current vitriol, Albany used to be considered
something of a parliamentary freak show. But gridlock fueled by New
York-style partisan passions is spreading to state capitals around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is emerging in part because Washington has been
transferring power to the states on matters like welfare, providing
lawmakers with more to wrangle over and drawing more interest
groups into the fray. State authority was further strengthened by
last week's Supreme Court decisions that placed curbs on Congress'
ability to make federal law binding on the states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the transformation of federal-state relations,
the other root of the partisanship has been growing political
competition. After decades in which control of most state
legislatures was solidly in the hands of one party or the other,
perpetual losers have turned the tables. In the once-Democratic
South, Republicans have made steady inroads. In the Midwest, the
balance in many legislatures is so precarious it has repeatedly
shifted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this doesn't breed an environment of mutual
respect, cooperation and good feeling,'' said Chuck Chvala, a
Democrat who is now majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate for the
second time in the 1990s, after serving as minority leader twice.
Just last week, a Republican state senator, Bob Welch, demanded an
ethics investigation of Chvala, contending that he had committed
the sin of working on the budget in private.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits, which affect elected officials in almost 20 states,
have also had an impact, casting out entrenched lawmakers and
making its easier for opposition parties to win seats. The
newcomers, knowing their stay is limited, have less incentive to
try to push them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, these tensions are likely to escalate because
parties in control after the next election will be able to draw
district lines based on the 2000 census, helping them _ through the
wonders of gerrymandering _ to stay on top.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, partisanship is not necessarily bad, especially if it
shakes up legislatures where one-party supremacy led to stagnation.
Not every statehouse has turned unruly. Today's good fiscal times
can go a long way toward salving disputes. It may be that
constituents are content to let lawmakers bicker the months away.
Still, the new tone is evident in many capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fights over seats, another factor has been the
evolving character of lawmaking. Once strictly a part-time vocation
_ practically a hobby _ the post of legislator has become very
time-consuming in many states, with legislatures taking on some of
the trappings, and political sensibilities, of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, legislative leaders are setting up centralized
committees to collect political contributions, largely from donors
with business before their legislatures. Through these committees,
the leaders can maintain discipline among the rank and file, which
is more beholden to them for campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible symbol of this new era may have been the
squabbling earlier this year in the Alabama Legislature between
newly emboldened Republicans and old-guard Democrats. The
lieutenant governor, the first Republican to win the position in
this century, hunkered down in the Senate chamber for a
round-the-clock session, refusing to take a bathroom break lest the
Democratic senators trump him in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have also seen more contentiousness. In North
Carolina and Indiana, control over the lower house has ricocheted
from one party to the other and back again, with the newly ousted
minority stewing in exile and plotting its return to power.
California has often witnessed turmoil this decade _ including
tardy budgets a la Albany _ in part because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, in roughly 65 percent of the states either
major party has a reasonable chance of seizing control, an increase
from less than 50 percent two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you had a 90-to-10 percentage split, it was almost a
nonpartisan state; partisanship didn't mean much to anybody,'' said
Malcolm Jewell, an emeritus professor of political science at the
University of Kentucky. ``There wasn't any point in trying to stick
together. You didn't need party cohesion.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, New York is not one of the places where
legislative races are more competitive. Partisanship in Albany
stems largely from the rivalry between the two houses, and not the
feuding inside. There are no term limits, and the majorities _
Republicans in the Senate, Democrats in the Assembly _ have used
the rules to cement absolute dominance.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, the skirmishes around the nation leave the
impression that there has been a steady Albany-ization of state
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are much more partisan, looking toward the next
election,'' said Paul Mannweiler, a Republican who is minority
leader in the Indiana House but who has also been speaker. ``We are
in the minority now, but we have to get back to the majority. To do
that, you have to draw some partisan differences.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Age isn't the only thing creeping up on the baby-boom
generation. Consumer product design and marketing are too, like
wolves on cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' 79 million boomers, now 35 to 53 years old
and at the peak of their earning power, make an exceptionally fat
herd. They represent an enormous new market of special needs
because they are getting older and have money to burn. But tell
them that advancing age is the issue behind what they're about to
buy and enjoy and they stampede.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, industries from automobile makers to soft drink
bottlers are developing sheep's clothing: a new generation of
easier-to-use products specifically designed and marketed to a
population that refuses to acknowledge the prospect of failing
eyesight, hearing and dexterity. Boomers can believe that life
hasn't changed, but the landscape of products is shifting subtly
around them.
</P>
<P>
   From bathroom fixtures to recreational equipment, the design of
everyday objects is slyly morphing. Existing products like
household utensils are being redesigned and new products like
retirement-community vehicles are being introduced with the
intention of luring the aging consumer by creating stylish products
that quicken the pulse while cosseting the creep of infirmity. What
to do about the march of time? Give it great costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the richest group of people who ever existed,'' said
Bruce Hannah, a professor of design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
``And they're willing to pay for three things: ease of use, safety
and comfort. That plus the best design. Couple that with
discretionary income and you have a market.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate challenge: selling age-related products to older
consumers without asking anyone's age. For the boomer buyer who
means to stay young into senior citizenship, it's like the reverse
of being carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mention the age word,'' said Linda Halfmann, an
associate product manager for bathing products at Kohler, one
company benefiting from the record amounts of money spent by
boomers on home improvement. Whirlpool baths with grip rails are
replacing standard tubs, which can't knead aching backs and weary
legs. Shower stalls now routinely include seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the sales force they're smart showers,'' Ms. Halfmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   For industry, the stakes are high. At an automotive engineers
convention in March, Lear Corp., the world's largest independent
supplier of auto interiors, held its breath as it introduced the
TransG, a minivan refitted with aging drivers in mind. The vehicle
included larger controls, more legible instrument panels, sliding
floors for easier cargo loading and powered swiveling seats to help
passengers enter or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In consumer clinics, they have been asking for this type of
design, but they don't want to be told when it's there,'' Leslie
Touma, Lear's director of corporate relations, said of the
company's focus groups. ``Packaging is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Touma said response to the TransG at the convention was
positive and strong. ``The point of this vehicle is that the design
is modern, exciting, not built to accommodate older people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much recent product development is a movement
called universal design, which proposes products be accessible to
the widest range of people, from the very young to the very old, by
taking all their limitations or disabilities into account.
Marketers love it too and have pushed it in areas important to
boomers, like home improvement and gardening. It's a kind of
philosophical expansion of ergonomics, design values that became a
buzzword in the 1980s for products promoted as user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Good Grips, a line of 15 kitchen utensils introduced in 1990 by
Oxo International, was the first big touchdown for universal
design. Created by an entrepreneur for his arthritic wife, the
roly-poly, pudgy-handled utensils were especially popular with
boomers, who responded to both their look and ease of use. Grips
have generally become larger and rounder, in response. Later this
year Oxo, which has expanded its kitchen line to 350 items, is
introducing handyman tools like screwdrivers and car tools like ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. is also test-marketing a universal design _ a
pinch-waisted, two-liter plastic bottle called the Grip that
requires less hand strength.
</P>
<P>
   Universal design may be intended to improve products for
everyone, but it also effectively disguises boomers, huddled at the
center, as a marketing target. Using these designs, manufacturers
hope to accompany boomers into old age, erasing the seams between
stages of life like cream on wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are things middle-aged people just naturally want,
like sports cars. Two-seat sportsters, or so-called midlife-crisis
cars like the BMW Z3 and the new Ford Thunderbird due next year,
are popular with boomers who recall the cars they owned or coveted
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very hungry audience, very nostalgic for the cars of
their youth,'' said Robert Mitchell, product communications manager
at BMW. ``So we've taken their comfort into account _ those cars of
the '60s were pretty snug.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's two-seaters are built with stiffer bodies and reflexes
in mind, incorporating automatic transmissions, larger door cuts,
lower door sills, elaborate suspensions, better legroom and heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not designed for bugs-in-the-teeth racing
enthusiasts,'' said Gianfranco Zaccai, a designer and co-founder of
Design Continuum, an international design office.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational equipment is also catering to an aging market that
wants to play with high performance but not pay in discomfort or
danger. Bombardier's Ski-Doo 2000 Grand Touring snowmobiles are
wider, steadier and slower, seat a party of three and have heated
hand grips. The company's GTX RFI Sea-Doo personal watercraft have
a fold-down reboarding step for those who find it hard to get back
on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to tell a client this is a product to
accommodate the frailties of age,'' said J. Walker Smith, a
managing partner with Yankelovich Partners Inc. ``It's better to
say that it's better designed for the adventure. It makes the
adventure more accessible.''

intention of luring the aging consumer by creating stylish products
that quicken the pulse while cosseting the creep of infirmity. What
to do about the march of time? Give it great costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the richest group of people who ever existed,'' said
Bruce Hannah, a professor of design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
``And they're willing to pay for three things: ease of use, safety
and comfort. That plus the best design. Couple that with
discretionary income and you have a market.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate challenge: selling age-related products to older
consumers without asking anyone's age. For the boomer buyer who
means to stay young into senior citizenship, it's like the reverse
of being carded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mention the age word,'' said Linda Halfmann, an
associate product manager for bathing products at Kohler, one
company benefiting from the record amounts of money spent by
boomers on home improvement. Whirlpool baths with grip rails are
replacing standard tubs, which can't knead aching backs and weary
legs. Shower stalls now routinely include seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the sales force they're smart showers,'' Ms. Halfmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   For industry, the stakes are high. At an automotive engineers
convention in March, Lear Corp., the world's largest independent
supplier of auto interiors, held its breath as it introduced the
TransG, a minivan refitted with aging drivers in mind. The vehicle
included larger controls, more legible instrument panels, sliding
floors for easier cargo loading and powered swiveling seats to help
passengers enter or leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In consumer clinics, they have been asking for this type of
design, but they don't want to be told when it's there,'' Leslie
Touma, Lear's director of corporate relations, said of the
company's focus groups. ``Packaging is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Touma said response to the TransG at the convention was
positive and strong. ``The point of this vehicle is that the design
is modern, exciting, not built to accommodate older people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of much recent product development is a movement
called universal design, which proposes products be accessible to
the widest range of people, from the very young to the very old, by
taking all their limitations or disabilities into account.
Marketers love it too and have pushed it in areas important to
boomers, like home improvement and gardening. It's a kind of
philosophical expansion of ergonomics, design values that became a
buzzword in the 1980s for products promoted as user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Good Grips, a line of 15 kitchen utensils introduced in 1990 by
Oxo International, was the first big touchdown for universal
design. Created by an entrepreneur for his arthritic wife, the
roly-poly, pudgy-handled utensils were especially popular with
boomers, who responded to both their look and ease of use. Grips
have generally become larger and rounder, in response. Later this
year Oxo, which has expanded its kitchen line to 350 items, is
introducing handyman tools like screwdrivers and car tools like ice
scrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. is also test-marketing a universal design _ a
pinch-waisted, two-liter plastic bottle called the Grip that
requires less hand strength.
</P>
<P>
   Universal design may be intended to improve products for
everyone, but it also effectively disguises boomers, huddled at the
center, as a marketing target. Using these designs, manufacturers
hope to accompany boomers into old age, erasing the seams between
stages of life like cream on wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are things middle-aged people just naturally want,
like sports cars. Two-seat sportsters, or so-called midlife-crisis
cars like the BMW Z3 and the new Ford Thunderbird due next year,
are popular with boomers who recall the cars they owned or coveted
as teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very hungry audience, very nostalgic for the cars of
their youth,'' said Robert Mitchell, product communications manager
at BMW. ``So we've taken their comfort into account _ those cars of
the '60s were pretty snug.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's two-seaters are built with stiffer bodies and reflexes
in mind, incorporating automatic transmissions, larger door cuts,
lower door sills, elaborate suspensions, better legroom and heated
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not designed for bugs-in-the-teeth racing
enthusiasts,'' said Gianfranco Zaccai, a designer and co-founder of
Design Continuum, an international design office.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational equipment is also catering to an aging market that
wants to play with high performance but not pay in discomfort or
danger. Bombardier's Ski-Doo 2000 Grand Touring snowmobiles are
wider, steadier and slower, seat a party of three and have heated
hand grips. The company's GTX RFI Sea-Doo personal watercraft have
a fold-down reboarding step for those who find it hard to get back
on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to tell a client this is a product to
accommodate the frailties of age,'' said J. Walker Smith, a
managing partner with Yankelovich Partners Inc. ``It's better to
say that it's better designed for the adventure. It makes the
adventure more accessible.''

   Similarly, sports equipment is taking aim at customers whose
skills are rusting. Shaped skis, wide-headed tennis rackets and
large-headed golf clubs now dominate their sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling youth to an older population'' by creating
products that make it ``easier for them to perform at higher
levels,'' said Stephan Hienzsch, vice president of sales and
marketing for Volant Skis, ``though they've hit a wall in terms of
improvement and they're declining in physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Treadmills and stair-step devices are being redesigned as
hybrids like the Precor EFX Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer, a
no-impact machine popular in health clubs. ``Every major
manufacturer of fitness equipment today is alive and well because
of the baby-boom generation,'' said Jim Birrell, director of design
at Precor. ``Now that they're older, the vanity part is falling out
and the maintenance part is falling in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new products address infirmities in stealthier ways. The
SoftBook, a leather-bound electronic reading device that is the
size and shape of a book, has the type of feature that could prove
irresistible to older consumers _ a stroke of the finger makes the
print larger, without the appearance of a large-print publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure the baby boomers are putting on us is to be
normal,'' said Bill Moggridge, a principal of IDEO, which designed
SoftBook. ``Now that their products are being associated with
disability, they want them to be universal, like computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier's Neighborhood Vehicle, a low-speed electric car
developed for retirement communities, hopes to meet the market of
aging boomers head-on. ``Our aim was to provide a hybrid between a
car and a golf cart to accommodate people who are thinking to
retire to gated communities,'' said Denys Lapointe, vice president
of design for Bombardier Recreational Products. ``There is a
resistance to retirement tools. We styled the NV to be more upbeat
than a golf cart. The comparison is to a true car. It goes a little
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   At a top speed of 25 miles per hour, the end of the road is
going to be no big threat.

INTERNET TRADE IN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RAISES LEGAL, ETHICAL
QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Pa., Ariz., Colo., Ill., Texas, La., Kan.)  (mk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dr. Leandro Pasos, 68, was struggling to make a
living when, about a year ago, an unusual advertisement in a
Seattle newspaper caught his eye. Doctors with active licenses, the
ad said, could earn up to $10,000 a month doing ``fully automated
online medical reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was placed by Performance Drugs Inc., a fledging company
that had set up shop on the Internet to market Viagra, the
diamond-shaped blue pill that offers millions of men the hope of
better sex through chemistry. The company had lined up pharmacies
in Miami and Las Vegas to ship the pills to patients. But it needed
doctors to write the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   As an orthopedic surgeon, Pasos specialized in ailments of the
bones and joints, not impotence. Still, he signed up with
Performance Drugs. For a salary of $5,000 a month, he agreed to
review questionnaires submitted electronically by prospective
Viagra patients, authorizing prescriptions as he saw fit. As he
later explained to investigators, ``I needed a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Pasos join the ranks of a growing breed of physicians:
cyberdoctors. His patients were strangers to him; his examinations
took place in the facelessness of cyberspace. That got Pasos into
trouble with the Washington Medical Quality Assurance Commission,
which in May cited him for unprofessional conduct for prescribing
drugs to people he had not physically examined, and fined him $500.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pasos declined to be interviewed, and his lawyer said
no patients had been harmed, the officials who put an end to his
career in online prescribing like to think his case will serve as a
warning. Yet their efforts have barely been noticed in the
flourishing electronic drug market, a new brand of commerce that is
raising questions of medical ethics and law.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, pharmacies are shipping pills across state lines
without the requisite licenses. Doctors are writing prescriptions
for people they have never met, a practice the American Medical
Association says is unethical, but not illegal. And nobody _ not
Congress, not the American Medical Association, not various federal
and state agencies _ knows quite how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strictly the Wild West of drug dealing via the
Internet,'' said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., who is pressing Congress to
hold hearings on the problem. Buyers, he warned, should beware:
``We don't know where these drugs are manufactured. We don't know
if the people taking them have conditions that should preclude
them. We know nothing and neither does the public. No one is
watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind prescriptions is that certain drugs are
dangerous enough to warrant authorization from a doctor, a
``learned intermediary,'' in the lexicon of medicine. Typically,
once the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug for sale, it
is prescribed by doctors, who are licensed by state medical boards,
and dispensed by pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical
boards. But on the Internet, said William Hubbard, associate
commissioner for policy at the Food and Drug Administration, ``you
might as well just put drugs on the shelf down at the drugstore and
say, `Take your pick.'''
</P>
<P>
   Online prescribing is closely tied to another recent phenomenon:
the emergence of three new ``lifestyle drugs,'' medicines meant to
enhance quality of life, as opposed to curing disease. In addition
to Viagra, they are Propecia, the first pill to treat baldness, and
Xenical, a new diet pill. Yet other drugs are readily available
with a cyberdoctor's consultation. Among them are Celebrex, for
arthritis; Valtrex, for herpes; Claritin, for allergies, and Zyban,
an anti-smoking pill.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is a burgeoning black market on the
Internet, driven primarily by foreign companies selling everything
from infertility pills to antidepressants without even the pretense
of a doctor's orders. But beyond having Customs inspectors stop
those foreign shipments at the border, there is little the
authorities can do. So they are focusing on companies like
Performance Drugs, though whether they can rein them in is a matter
of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the politicians are going to be able to do
anything to us,'' said Bill Reeves, who runs Viapro.com, a
Phoenix-based Web site that sells Viagra. He reiterated a quote he
once heard: ``It's kind of like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about anyone with a credit card can buy medicine from sites
like Viapro.com. For a fee that typically ranges from $35 to $85,
patients receive an online medical consultation, which consists of
filling out a health history questionnaire. If the doctor approves,
the pills arrive in the mail, shipped either by a pharmacy or the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much business these sites do. But Reeves and
others say they have no shortage of customers, drawn by low prices,
convenience and, in the case of Viagra, the promise of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, is there any shortage of doctors. ``I probably
have 5,000 names of doctors who want to participate,'' said Bill
Stallknecht, co-owner of ThePillbox.com, based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Patients learn who their doctors are when the medication arrives
in the mail. State licensing investigators learn the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pasos, the few doctors who have been disciplined
include an Illinois psychiatrist who runs a holistic health center
and a Colorado doctor who supervises a cosmetic surgery clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Why they do it is anybody's guess. The Colorado doctor, Benjamin
Johnson, 32, said he thought the work was legitimate until
regulators disciplined him for unprofessional conduct. ``Maybe,''
he said, ``I got caught up in the excitement of being involved in
something cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leandro Pasos was not trying to be cutting edge, just hoping to
earn some extra cash. A 1954 graduate of Tulane University's
medical school, Pasos had practiced medicine for more than 40
years, both in this country and his native Nicaragua, when he
spotted the Performance Drugs ad. He was working just two hours a
week, documents from the Washington Medical Quality Assurance
Commission show, treating patients for lower-back pain at a
Seattle-area clinic.
</P>
<P>
   He sent in his resume, showed up for an interview and was hired
on June 16, 1998. His one-page contract made the work sound simple.
``Our automated review system,'' said the job description,
``enables the physician to review several patient charts at a
glance.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was short-lived. That summer, an investigator
for the Louisiana medical licensing authority bought Viagra by mail
from Performance Drugs, and tipped off the Washington Medical
Quality Assurance Commission when the pills came with Pasos' name
on the label.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, an investigator for the Kansas Board of Healing
Arts bought Viagra over the Internet from Performance Drugs. This
bottle, too, carried Pasos' name. The board obtained a court
injunction against the doctor, accusing him of practicing medicine
without a license in Kansas, and called its counterpart in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Pasos' career in Internet prescribing came to an end on Sept.
17, said his lawyer, Robert Beckerman. That was the day after the
commission wrote a letter to the doctor, asking him to meet with
its investigators. Not long afterward, Performance Drugs went out
of business, although its orders are now being handled by a new
company, Lifestyle USA, which operates out of the same office, a
fifth-floor suite in a building on the edge of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators met Pasos on Oct. 8, in Beckerman's office.
``I have never signed a prescription for Viagra, ever,'' Pasos
insisted at the outset, according to a transcript of the session.
Technically, that was correct. According to Pasos' contract, there
was no need to, because the dispensing pharmacy kept a copy of the
doctor's medical license on file. ``Orders are assumed approved,''
the contract said, ``unless otherwise notified by the physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pasos said he used discretion in considering the
medical questionnaires. Patients with heart conditions were
rejected for Viagra because it might be dangerous. As to how he
knew patients were telling the truth, he replied: ``I have to
assume you are telling the truth. Even if you come to my office,
you can tell me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasos did not know much about Performance Drugs. He told
investigators he did not know who wrote the medical questionnaire.
He did not know how many requests for prescriptions the company
handled. He did not know the names of the drugstores filling the
prescriptions. He did not talk to pharmacists with questions. ``I
would refer the calls to the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you comfortable doing this kind of work?'' the
investigators finally asked. ``Not so much,'' Pasos replied. ``I
had no choice. Without a job, I would be going on welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But the job did not turn out to be as lucrative as Pasos had
hoped. In the end, he said, he collected only $2,500 from
Performance Drugs, half a month's pay for three months of work.
</P>
<P>
   If the world of the cyberdoctor is perilous, so too is that of
the Internet pharmacist. Bill Stallknecht has managed to survive
it, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Stallknecht is a devoted Libertarian, and his political
philosophy informs his views about conducting medicine in
cyberspace. (Last year, he ran for Congress in Texas under the
party's banner, garnering 1 percent of the vote, he said.) He is
also a pharmacist, and has owned the Pill Box Pharmacy, a group of
five drugstores in the San Antonio area, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he took his business online, at the behest of a
brother-in-law who prepares Web sites. The idea at first was simply
to advertise. The pharmacy specializes in compounding, creating
special formulations of drugs not readily available. Among its
products, in that pre-Viagra era, was an injection therapy for
erectile dysfunction, a remedy Stallknecht promoted on his Web
site. By the time Viagra was approved, in March 1998, he was
swamped with requests for the drug. By last August, he was filling
100 to 200 electronic orders for Viagra a day. Around that time, he
said, he also established another Web site, Medicalcenter.net, to
recruit doctors willing to prescribe Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   He views with disdain the paternalism of the medical
establishment, which he says has an interest in trying to put
people like him out of business. ``Have you heard any patients
being unhappy?'' Stallknecht asks. ``All the power bases say, `We
don't want them cutting into our sacred cow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, ThePillbox.com sells four prescription drugs: Viagra;
Propecia, the baldness pill; Xenical, the diet drug; and Claritin,
the antihistamine. Each, Stallknecht maintains, is safe enough to
prescribe without a physical examination, a view the Food and Drug
Administration does not share.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugstores also operate online. CVS Corp., for instance,
recently purchased Soma.com, an online pharmacy that does not use
cyberdoctors. It verifies prescriptions with patients' doctors by
telephone, and is licensed in every state it ships drugs to.
ThePillbox.com, in contrast, is licensed only in Texas;
Stallknecht's position is that when patients visit his Internet
site, they ``actually come to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company fills only prescriptions written by Texas
doctors. Stallknecht would not say why, but if Texas doctors are
writing prescriptions for a Texas pharmacy, there is less chance of
running afoul of regulators in another state.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if Stallknecht is just one step ahead of the
law, he says, he is. He keeps meticulous records of every
prescription he fills, and comes to work every day expecting
investigators to walk through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under scrutiny all the time,'' he said. ``I tickle 50
states all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to build an electronic drugstore: just a
valid doctor's license, a relationship with a drug wholesaler, and
an American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, has been the experience of Eric Thom, vice
president of Confimed.com, an online pharmacy based in Seattle.
Confimed was founded last July, at the height of the Viagra craze,
by an obstetrician-gynecologist whom Thom described as ``an
entrepreneur.'' The company vice president agreed to describe the
process, but without using the name of the founding doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At Confimed, the doctor and drugstore are rolled into one;
Washington, like some other states, permits doctors to dispense
medicine. The doctor began, Thom said, by hiring a Web site
designer. Then, Thom said, ``he called his pharmaceutical
representative, gave them his American Express number, ordered
about 200 pills and started listing his site on some search
engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom sees nothing unethical in this. Confimed, he said, is not
gouging patients; its price for Viagra is $9.50 for a 50-milligram
pill and $11 for 100 milligrams. ``You would likely pay right in
that range at the neighborhood drugstore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Confimed site offered complete information about
Viagra's side effects and about who should not take the drug. And
Thom said he took great pains to design a patient questionnaire
that would be more thorough than any doctor's visit, using his
marketing experience to construct the questions in such a way that
patients would be forced to read them. ``We've taken precautions
every step of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials in Washington state have not taken any action
against Confimed, said the company's lawyer, Jeffrey Johnson.
Kansas, which has moved aggressively against Internet pharmacies,
has obtained a court order preventing Confimed from doing business
there. Johnson said the company would seek to overturn the order in
court. Both he and Thom said they believed strongly that Confimed's
business is legitimate. ``We are trying to be the standard of
cyberconsultation,'' Thom said.
</P>
<P>
   The standard of cyberconsultation, said Dr. Nancy Dickey,
president of the American Medical Association, is an oxymoron;
there can be no standard, she maintains, when patient and doctor
are strangers. At its convention in Chicago on Thursday, the AMA
voted to develop model state legislation to limit Internet
prescribing, and urged that cyberdoctors be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not ethical,'' Dr. Dickey said. ``It is not good
quality medicine, and it would appear to be driven largely by a
desire to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which represents
state pharmaceutical licensing authorities, goes one step further.
``Any site that uses a questionnaire without a legitimate
patient-physician relationship, we consider illegal,'' said Carmen
Catizone, the board's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: Pharmacies can fill only valid prescriptions.
Prescriptions written by cyberdoctors, he says, are not valid.
Therefore, Catizone reasons, it is illegal for druggists to fill
them.
</P>
<P>
   To help guide consumers, the pharmacy association recently
developed its own seal of approval. Earlier this month, the group
began accepting applications from Internet drugstores that want to
carry the seal. So far, about a dozen have applied.
</P>
<P>
   But Klink, the Pennsylvania congressman, is skeptical. ``That
seal can be replicated and counterfeited,'' he said. ``Are they
willing to take responsibility for each and every product sold over
the Internet that they put their seal on?''
</P>
<P>
   Klink has asked the General Accounting Office to study Internet
drug sales, and is hoping Congress will hold hearings soon.
Meanwhile, federal and state regulators are trying to determine
their authority. In April, the Food and Drug Administration
convened a meeting of interested agencies. ``Nobody,'' Hubbard
said, ``has explicit total authority to take over this problem and
solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, which regulates drug manufacturing, has no jurisdiction
over how doctors prescribe the medicines it approves. The Drug
Enforcement Agency has control over the sale of narcotics. The
Federal Trade Commission, which can regulate advertising, might
play a role, but only if it can document deceptive or unfair trade
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Pfizer, the manufacturer of Viagra, filed a
complaint with the commission alleging that cyberdoctors are
deceiving consumers by ignoring the advice on the drug's label to
physically examine patients. Richard Cleland, an FTC lawyer, would
not say whether an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves understaffed state licensing authorities, who say
that Web sites are elusive targets. Cyberdoctors can be tracked
only in one way: by ordering drugs and seeing whose name is on the
prescription. Web sites appear and disappear overnight. And the
Internet is hardly a medium that can be reined in one state at a
time; even if every cyberdoctor in the United States were put out
of business, drugs would still be available from Web sites
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever try, as a kid, to take the sand and make a dike
to hold the ocean back?'' asked Mark Stafford, the lawyer for the
Kansas Board of Healing Arts who handled the civil suit against
Pasos. ``That's kind of what it's like.''

A NEW GRAY MARKET AS CHINA LOOSENS GRIP ON PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In the cramped basement offices of Alpha Book Co.,
metal desks are stacked with manuscripts and a large poster of a
chimp in a red blazer headed ``The Boss'' dominates the room.
</P>
<P>
   Here, two thirtysomething editors, both with American graduate
degrees, skirt a legion of rules and regulations in order to bring
out surprisingly provocative books in a country where, officially,
all publications are state owned and controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Their hottest seller _ a collaboration with a state publishing
house _ is a translation of Paul Fussell's 1983 ``Class: A Guide
Through the American Status System.'' And they recently were hosts
of a book party for one of their authors, Yu Jie, whose chatty
essays tackle topics like the importance of dissent and how China
has changed since the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere has opened enough so that we can put out things
we are interested in,'' said Shi Tao, the managing director of
Alpha, which was founded last year. ``We do a lot of critical books
because people want to read them. And we want to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   So far 1999 has been a chilly political period, marked by
sensitive anniversaries, dissident arrests and the closing of
several liberal publications. But a growing stream of adventurous
books and magazines has been bubbling up from under the ice, many
courtesy of new private companies like Alpha Books.
</P>
<P>
   There is no free press, of course. But these new publications
discuss a wide range of issues from corruption to sex to the need
for democracy in China in a frank and lively way virtually unheard
of in China before the 1990s; a number have become best sellers,
extremely popular among educated urban Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   And at some level, China's government has accepted, if not
embraced, these publications _ which at any rate are now probably
too numerous to control easily. Officials mostly turned a blind eye
toward the heavy traffic through legal loopholes that brings most
progressive books and magazines to press. And many experts see the
publications as possible harbingers of greater official freedom in
a country where the government has previously assiduously regulated
the printed word.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment it is free market economics that is spawning
liberalization and eroding government control: Having lost their
once hefty subsidies in the move to a market economy, the state
publishers have become increasingly willing to print controversial
material, looking to make money by catering to consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I'm now able to publish my books is entirely
thanks to the emerging marketplace,'' said Mo Luo, an essayist and
author of the recent ``Notes from a Loser: A Free Thinker's Life
Experiences.'' ``In the current consumer environment you can't
survive publishing books that are dull and boring. So the
liveliness of the publishing world has opened up; there is wider
space for speaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, nonetheless, limits to that space, and newspapers in
particular remain under tight control of a government clearly
mindful of the broad reach of the daily press. But with intense
business competition and a growing variety of publishing options,
even quite sensitive books and articles now often see the light of
day _ although often through circuitous routes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example, all 50,000 copies of the May issue of
Beijing Literature were destroyed after an official loosely
connected with the magazine objected to a historical essay
extolling democracy _ a blow for free speech. But weeks later, that
same essay is already scheduled to appear in the July issue of
another publication, one with a different government sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, even though the government suspended the publishing
license of a progressive magazine called Way in February, a host of
equally adventurous magazines have taken up the torch, publishing
essays that have variously condemned totalitarian states, sung the
merits of free speech and favored a trial for the former ruler of
Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Violators of human rights ``cannot
rest peacefully,'' an article says.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics in getting such controversial words into print are
legion: Independent book editors collaborate with struggling state
publishers, essentially subcontracting to provide both a manuscript
and marketing skills. Monthly magazines call themselves ``book
series,'' since periodicals are more tightly regulated than books.
Magazine editors ally with cash-strapped government agencies to
secure licenses to bring out magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Panorama Magazine, for example, is a new upscale magazine of
culture and social thought, whose soul (and editors) are in urbane
Shanghai. But it is officially put out by a distant textbook
publisher, the Liaoning Educational Publishing House, which wanted
to diversify and hoped that owning a lively magazine would attract
new book authors.
</P>
<P>
   Another increasingly popular method for bringing out books is
for independent book companies to purchase directly from a state
publisher a new ``book number'' _ the government license plate that
each new book carries to indicate it is legally published.
</P>
<P>
   All these arrangements give progressive intellectuals access to
printing presses, and give state publishers access to cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complicated process and there are many
secrets,'' said Li Yu, a book agent and general manager of the
Beijing Blue Monsoon Culture Co., a book company.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's clear that the market economy can be seen as a way to
move toward intellectual freedom. And the government is itself to
an extent adjusting to the situation; you can see they're tacitly
accepting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Through these cracks have emerged a steady stream of popular
books that are testing the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are massive numbers of publishers who are concerned with
economic gain, so I've been able to publish my books even though I
know there are senior officials who are very unhappy with the
content,'' said Yu, whose first book of essays, ``Fire and Ice,''
was a major hit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of today's progressive authors, Yu said he had been
writing for many years but only recently started publishing his
essays, which, for example, poke fun at Mao's personality cult and
recall his own struggle to conform to life at the military college
where incoming college freshman were sent for political
indoctrination after the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He notes with some satisfaction that although Hong Kong and
Taiwanese newspapers had predicted his books would be banned, he
published his fourth volume this spring, and has more requests than
he can handle from magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways the situation is very awkward, but at least now
someone like me is able to publish these kind of essays _ and
that's not bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive magazines and book series have also continued to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of Observe magazine, published early this year,
features a translation of ``Power of the Powerless,'' the 1978
essay by Vaclav Havel, who is now president of the Czech Republic,
which analyzed totalitarian regimes and the value of resisting
them. It is followed by a critique of post-totalitarian states that
must seem close to home to China's leaders. ``The powerholders have
no choice but to add a little law (but by no means rule of law),
consumerism is on the rise, and corruption grows steadily more
serious,'' reads the essay.
</P>
<P>
   Articles in Frontiers endorse the ``opening up of public
opinion,'' and criticize the country's death penalty; one in Reform
shows how government growth figures overstate actual economic
progress, and one in Panorama praises a gay version of ``Swan
Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is now willing to tolerate much more freedom in
the exchange of ideas,'' said Xiao Gongqin, a professor of modern
history and essayist in Shanghai. ``So long as you're not chanting
slogans like `Down With Jiang Zemin,' the atmosphere is much more
relaxed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Every author is aware of forbidden territory, however, even if
the acreage has shrunk over the years. Publishers and editors risk
official criticism and even their jobs if they aid and abet
projects that stray too far over the invisible and ever changing
line.
</P>
<P>
   In this sensitive year, editors and authors agree that limits
have contracted somewhat. Essays that last year might have been
reprinted in official newspapers now settle in obscure academic
journals, and state publishing houses have been more cautious in
selling their book licenses. And references to the Tiananmen
protests, difficult at the best of times, are this year out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a state publisher refused to put out a book
by a young intellectual until several passing references to the
1989 crackdown were removed, said Xu Xun, project director of Alpha
Books, which had invested in the book.
</P>
<P>
   But most editors said they were content to lay low for the
moment, since all hope that freedoms will expand once the
anniversaries pass. ``We're brand new and don't want to commit
suicide,'' said an editor of Panorama, who refused to be
identified. ``When circumstances allow, we'll say things that are
politically a bit more out of line or run pieces even more worthy
of being called spiritual pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs that at least some in the government favor
cutting the publishing industry loose, officially allowing private
publishers to operate. Last year, just before a major government
book fair, hundreds of independent publishers and agents were
allowed to organize a shadow fair in the same town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that last year will be the last gasp of official
efforts to strictly control books, newspapers and magazine,'' said
Yu, the writer. ``Now that economic reform in China has reached
this extent, it's hard to go back. Recent actions have been largely
symbolic acts to scare others.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, he and others said they have gained considerable
room for maneuver. ``With an increasing number of magazines, if I
can't publish something in Beijing, I can always go to Shanghai or
Wuhan,'' said Yu. ``And if a magazine gets shut down because the
government is not happy with its views, another will pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   A new book called the ``Fallen Temple,'' a fond recollection of
the underground avant-garde that existed during Mao's era, was
first rejected by two Beijing publishers and then taken by the
Xinjiang Young People's Publishing House, in far western China.
</P>
<P>
   It is an odd game of cat-and-mouse, where the mice are
multiplying and the old cat often seems not terribly hungry.
</P>
<P>
   When Way was very publicly closed down this spring, its founders
were told that they had strayed from their mandate: The magazine,
which covered a broad range of topics, came under the aegis of the
Beijing Committee on Science and Technology and should have stuck
to scientific matters, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief battle to save the magazine, the editors
scattered. But they did not fall into line. They are now working on
the start-up of a new newspaper featuring articles on culture and
leisure, the Chinese Cooperation News, this time sponsored by the
Ministry of Agriculture.

 &HT;    Southern foresees smoother trading
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. is off to a smooth start this summer with
its electricity trading business, and executives do not foresee a
repeat of last year, when a sudden heat wave sent wholesale prices
soaring to crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, Southern was dealing with an
unprecedented run-up in national wholesale electricity prices,
triggered when Midwesterners ramped up air conditioners all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the Midwest, the prices power companies paid for
wholesale electricity rose from $30 to $7,000 per megawatt hour,
and several smaller trading companies were unable to meet their
obligations. An average U.S. home uses 1 megawatt hour of
electricity per month.
</P>
<P>
   The city-owned utility of Springfield, Ill., defaulted on
contracts to sell power to several large utilities because of the
trading volatility. One of those agreements was to sell power to
Southern for $10 million _ much less than the wholesale market
value at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute is still being litigated, though Southern
executives say the Atlanta-based company made more money than it
lost in the wholesale trading frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thrive on volatility. The key to commodity prices is supply
and demand,'' said Gary Morsches, chief operating officer of
Southern Company Energy Marketing, the company's energy trading
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Morsches said he does not expect a repeat of last year's
defaults, even if temperatures and prices skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit controls have been strengthened throughout the
industry, and weaker players have left,'' he said. ``Poorly
capitalized entities are not being traded with.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Brian McGee, Southern's director of forward power
trading, wholesale markets have already seen a price spike this
year. Hourly prices in the Northeast rose from $40 to $1,000 per
megawatt hour during a June 7-8 heat wave but created no problems
for trading companies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the market has been ``pretty quiet'' so far, he said.
The big question is whether unforeseen shortages are created if
power plants are shut down during the high-demand summer months, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Company Energy Marketing is 60 percent owned by
Southern and 40 percent by Houston-based Vastar Resources, a
natural gas company. The wholesale trading unit represents one of
Southern Co.'s moves into unregulated utility markets.
</P>
<P>
   Southern operates the unit and is due to raise its stake to 75
percent during the next three years. SCEM buys and sells
electricity across the country but is prohibited from sales inside
Southern's regulated service territory in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   SCEM operates a 24-hour electricity and natural gas trading
floor that can accommodate as many as 200 traders at Perimeter
Center. The operation will more than double in size when it moves
to new quarters in nearby Sandy Springs in December.
</P>
<P>
   Southern is on a crash program to purchase power plants around
the country to become less dependent on volatile electricity
sources for its wholesale business.
</P>
<P>
   Even after $1.3 billion in power plant purchases in California
and the East Coast, only 5 percent of the power sold will come from
Southern's own system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOHANSIC, N.Y. _ Almost every Saturday night, Ron Bucci, a
chiropractor from Tarrytown, kisses his wife and three children
goodbye and drives the family van up to Mohansic Golf Course, where
he sleeps in the parking lot with carloads of other men from
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Bucci arrives around 8 p.m., early enough to tap a few
balls around Mohansic's putting green, down a bottle of beer or two
at the bar and engage in ritual male banter. Sleep is scarce, and
by 4 a.m., the groggy platoon of unshaven fathers, husbands and
boyfriends wanders into the cozy clubhouse to collect the holy
grail of public-access golf: a Sunday morning tee time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got mailmen up there sleeping, construction workers,
correction officers, cops, accountants,'' said Bucci, 40, a
seven-year veteran of the Mohansic sleepovers. ``If the manager of
the course wants to get an early spot, he's up there sleeping,'' he
said. ``I'm lucky. I have a van. Some guys sleep in the front seat
of their car.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Westchester County, golf oasis for the
wealthy, is a golf desert for everyone else. Though the county is
peppered with 61 golf courses, only five are open to the free-range
duffer, that particular golf subspecies who cannot afford even a
mid-range private club's $150,000 membership fee and $10,000 in
annual dues.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, by contrast, is home to 64 private and 50 public
courses. In southern Connecticut, many towns operate their own
public courses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so bad in recent years that Westchester _
one of the most affluent counties in the nation _ is now among the
most golf-deprived, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The county's five public courses, operating at
capacity, were host to 270,000 rounds of golf last year, meeting
less than 20 percent of the estimated demand for 1.5 million annual
rounds, according to a report by the National Golf Foundation. ``If
there was anywhere in the country that I would build a golf course,
it would be in Westchester County,'' said Angelo Palermo, the
Florida-based golf-course consultant who submitted the report to
county officials in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   County officials appear ready to take such advice to heart. By
the end of this week, County Executive Andrew J. Spano plans to
choose from among five multimillion-dollar bids, including one from
his own Parks Department, to build a public course on the grounds
of the defunct Hudson Hills Golf Club in New Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a slam-dunk project,'' Palermo said, ``this
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new course is still at least two years from reality. Though
the county bought the 170-acre property from IBM in December 1997
for the bargain price of $3.5 million, officials have done little
with the land, which is dense with bramble, bogs and white-tailed
deer.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schwartz, Spano's deputy, said constructing the course
would cost less than $10 million, a relative bargain. Nowadays,
with land scarce, and environmental regulations ever more complex,
even a starter golf course can cost $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they manage to get a tee time, Westchester golfers
face less-than-ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public golf is nuts,'' said Frank Madalone, 33, a dentist from
Yonkers, swinging a 3-iron just off the first tee on a recent
Friday at Sprain Lake Golf Club, where 54,197 rounds were played
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play on the weekend, it's insanity. The fairways overlap,
balls flying everywhere,'' he said, shaking his head. ``It's like a
firing range out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he added, taking the measure of the course before
him, ``even for $12, it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on weekdays, Westchester's public courses are crowded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: If you want a tee time at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon on a weekday, on a 95-degree day, you can probably
find one,'' said the county's parks commissioner, Salvatore
DeSantis.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of public golf is not unique to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place that is undersupplied in golf as much as the
New York area,'' said David Leibowits, a golf course developer at
Centennial Golf Club, a 27-hole course in Putnam County that
charges $105 for a weekend round. ``People drive an hour and a half
to two hours for golf,'' he said. ``The demand is unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things have conspired to make that so.
</P>
<P>
   After an ebb in golf's popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, more
women and youths are playing than ever, industry analysts said.
That is especially true in Westchester, home of some of the most
exclusive private clubs in the country and a 32-year-old
professional tournament now known as the Buick Classic, at
Westchester Country Club in Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is evident at Ardsley High School, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf club used to be five kids,'' Henry Tina, the school's
golf coach, said at Mohansic's second hole on Saturday. ``I got 18
kids now. Where are they going to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he said, local private clubs allowed the
team to practice on their courses. Now they squeeze onto Sprain
Lake's course.
</P>
<P>
   Pro golf's marketing of its young, camera-ready stars like Tiger
Woods has also brought legions of young wannabes to public courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have so many guys wearing pink now,'' said Anthony
Federico, of Ardsley, waiting with Tina under a maple tree at
Mohansic's second hole.
</P>
<P>
   Money is also a factor: The economy's years-long boom has made a
decent set of clubs a less intimidating purchase, and a public
course's greens fee is often less expensive than a movie, soda and
popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence of the surge, however, the quality of the
public courses has dropped as they absorb more rounds from
inexperienced players. Last year, golfers played 30 million rounds
on New York state's 857 courses, industry statistics show, an
average of about 35,000 per course.
</P>
<P>
   But in Westchester County, Dunwoodie, the least active course,
clocked 48,884 rounds, according to the county's Parks Department.
Saxon Woods, in Scarsdale, crammed in 61,772 rounds. ``That's
seven-minute tee-time intervals,'' Palermo said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many local golfers leave.
</P>
<P>
   Federico and Madalone, the dentist, both said they drive up to
two hours to play more expensive golf in Dutchess County,
Connecticut or Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Federico lamented. ``It seems like such a shame
that we're in such a wealthy county.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another, perhaps more disturbing trend that veteran
golfers say is sweeping Westchester County's public-access golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more anger on the golf course,'' said John
Lewandowski, 52, a sales and marketing executive from South Salem,
after whacking a 150-yard drive past Mohansic's first hole one week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, they don't care about anybody else. They don't rake the
bunkers. They don't wait for people to leave the green.''
</P>
<P>
   What really galls him is the flying balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll hit close to you to sort of move you along,''
Lewandowski said, leaning on his putter. ``That can be dangerous.
Golf balls hurt.''

CLINTON PLANS TO CUT LONG-TERM COST OF MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Maine, Fla., Del., Iowa, R.I., La., Mont., Mass.,
Calif.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will try to reconcile two
seemingly contradictory goals this week when he unveils a plan to
cut the long-term cost of Medicare while expanding the program to
cover prescription drugs, administration officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would make structural changes in Medicare to encourage
competition and efficiency in the care of the elderly and the
disabled. It would also require major new infusions of cash from
the federal treasury, said officials who are putting final details
of the plan in place.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Clinton would insist that the government
offer drug coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. Drug
coverage should be ``universal, voluntary and heavily subsidized,''
a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Republicans and some Democrats in Congress want to
start gradually, by covering medicines for the lower-income
beneficiaries who most need assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens to his proposal, Clinton will reshape
the debate simply by demanding that coverage of prescription drugs
be made available to all Americans over the age of 64 and to those
of any age who are severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying that the benefit has to be universal is a major
contribution to the debate,'' said Martin Corry, director of
federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Though often lost in the hubbub over new benefits, the original
reason for trying to redesign Medicare was to avert a financial
crisis. Administration officials said the president's plan would
keep Medicare solvent in these ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would steer Medicare patients to
certain hospitals that promise to give the government a deep
discount on complicated, expensive procedures like heart bypass
surgery and hip replacement operations. Many studies have found a
higher quality of care at hospitals that perform a large number of
such procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare would use competitive bidding to buy a wide range of
goods and services, including hospital beds, wheelchairs and other
medical equipment. The government would also try to negotiate
prices far below those set in existing fee schedules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare would get a huge infusion of cash from the treasury:
$700 billion, representing 15 percent of federal budget surpluses
anticipated over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable transformation seems to have occurred in the last
year. The question now is not whether Medicare should cover
prescription drugs, but how.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over that question, including the sheer complexity
of designing a benefit affordable to both elderly people and to the
treasury, could easily stymie efforts to provide drug coverage in
this Congress. But the issue will become more urgent as 76 million
baby boomers qualify for Medicare over the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said:
``The desired outcome is to cover prescription drugs for everybody.
That's the approach we're contemplating. Large numbers of middle-
and upper-income Medicare beneficiaries have little or no drug
coverage, but high out-of-pocket drug costs. If you target the
solution to low-income people, you're not taking care of the
problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries have paid for Medicare throughout their working
careers,'' Jennings said. ``If you say that certain people on
Medicare can have drug coverage and others don't, you will
undermine the broad support that exists for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will depict drug coverage as one element in a
comprehensive plan to shore up Medicare, White House officials
said. But health policy experts and politicians doubt that Medicare
can be ``fixed'' by the passage of one bill, however comprehensive.
In the next two decades, they predict, Congress will continually
tinker with the program, searching for ways to enhance benefits
while trimming payments to hospitals, doctors and other health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every type of health care provider is pleading with
Congress to restore Medicare money cut just two years ago by the
Balanced Budget Act. Thus, beneficiaries, eager for drug coverage,
and health care providers have competing claims to the same pot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were ready to portray the
coming debate over Medicare as a struggle between needy
beneficiaries and a greedy health care industry. So far, they said,
the 1997 cuts appear to have done more harm to the financial
condition of the industry than to the health of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes, home care agencies and health maintenance
organizations have been complaining bitterly about the cuts. But
Corry of the AARP said, ``There has not been a spontaneous outcry
among beneficiaries, or an upsurge in complaints about denial of
access to home care, nursing homes or hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton describes affordable prescription drugs as ``the
greatest growing need of seniors.'' And he notes that drugs have
become an integral, indispensable part of modern medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people use one-third of all prescription drugs sold in
the United States. On average, each Medicare beneficiary has more
than 18 prescriptions filled each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House says that 15.5 million Medicare
beneficiaries have no insurance for prescription drugs, and 6
million of those beneficiaries have incomes more than twice the
official poverty level (above $16,480 a year for an individual and
$22,120 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every member of Congress has heard pleas from
constituents unable to afford medicines they need. ``The public in
America is getting gouged,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
``That's what our constituents tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is cautious, and the reason can be summarized in
one word: cost.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, national spending on prescription drugs grew
by an average of 11 percent a year, which is more than double the 5
percent rate for health care spending overall. The increase
reflects the development of new, more expensive, more effective
drug therapies and greater use of prescription drugs, driven in
part by more aggressive marketing aimed directly at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and health maintenance organizations report that drugs
are their fastest-growing cost.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal-state program for poor families, does
cover prescription drugs, and even though it gets substantial
discounts from manufacturers, Medicaid now spends more on drugs
than on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Concannon, the commissioner of human services in Maine,
said the state's Medicaid program spent $140 million a year on
prescription drugs, compared with $40 million on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen deMontmollin, vice president of AvMed Health Plan, a
large nonprofit HMO in Florida, said drug spending for his members
rose 33 percent last year, to $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last week, Republican senators like
William Roth Jr. of Delaware, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John
Chafee of Rhode Island expressed support for Medicare coverage of
drugs, but said it should be provided first to the neediest
beneficiaries. Moderate Democratic senators like John Breaux of
Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
expressed the view of the Republican majority. He cautioned against
``any rich new benefit'' and said, ``A targeted approach, focusing
on low-income seniors, is the best solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux was chairman of a 17-member commission that was supposed
to advise Congress and the president on the future of Medicare. The
panel did not agree on much, but did provide authoritative
bipartisan backing for the view that Medicare is antiquated because
it does not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux proposed drug coverage for 3 million low-income
beneficiaries, and he said it would cost the government $60 billion
over 10 years. The White House rejected the proposal as
``inadequate and inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Reps. Henry Waxman and Pete Stark of California, agree with
Clinton that drug coverage should be available to all
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a premium of $45.50 a month.
Under current law, with no change in benefits, the monthly premium
is expected to double in a decade, to $101 in 2009. Any premium for
prescription drug coverage would be added to that.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the poorest
people would not have to pay the full premium for drug coverage
under Clinton's plan. ``Some people will get help with the premium
at the lower end of the scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer
group, said, ``It makes sense for seniors to pay a significant part
of the cost through a premium.'' But, he said, it is ``absolutely
essential'' for the government to pay the premiums for Medicare
beneficiaries with incomes as much as 35 percent above the poverty
level (up to $14,931 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   ``Administration officials told me they were willing to pay the
full premium on the drug benefit for people with incomes up to 120
percent of the poverty level,'' Pollack said. ``I urged them to do
better than that, to go to 135 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-income beneficiaries are already eligible for federal
assistance in paying their basic Medicare premiums. But in studies
going back to 1991, Pollack has repeatedly documented the failure
of the federal government and the states to locate the people
eligible for such subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials have told the White House that if Medicare
begins to cover prescription drugs, many more low-income people
would have an incentive to step forward and claim the federal
subsidies to which they are entitled.

PEACEKEEPERS, AT LAST, REOPEN PRISTINA AIRPORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLATINA, Yugoslavia _ Two weeks after the first NATO
peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo, the first military aircraft landed
here Saturday at the province's main airport, which NATO commanders
said could soon open to regular flights.
</P>
<P>
   A hulking Russian cargo plane touched down at 1:19 p.m.,
followed moments later by a French C-130 in what was an
orchestrated effort to highlight the cooperation of Russian and
allied troops after the diplomatic standoff caused when a
contingent of Russians occupied the airport on June 12, hours
before NATO's forces started streaming into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, appeared
at the airport with his Russian counterpart, Col. Gen. Viktor
Zavarzin, and both pledged to work together toward peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that once NATO ferries in the necessary radar and
other equipment to get the airport functioning over the next week,
regular military flights could begin, followed by relief flights
and, eventually, even commercial ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all part of bringing Kosovo back to normality,''
Jackson said outside the airport's terminal, whose windows were
blown out by NATO's repeated airstrikes against Yugoslav troops
based there.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the airport, located about 10 miles west of the
capital, Pristina, should help speed the deployment of sorely
needed troops, equipment and relief supplies. The peacekeeping
force has grown slowly as the NATO allies have had to amass troops
in Macedonia and then move them north along narrow roads,
increasingly crowded with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said he
had called on the allies to move more quickly to build up their
forces in Kosovo, which has been wracked by violence and
retribution between the province's remaining Serbs and the
returning Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of looting have continued, despite pledges by NATO
commanders to step up foot and vehicle patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, gunshots echoed around Pristina. Late Friday, U.S.
marines at a checkpoint in Gnjilane were involved in another
firefight that left one Serb dead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, said Saturday that
the gun battle appeared to have begun as a shootout between Serbs
and Albanians. He said that the dead man had been killed by a
bullet from an AK-47, the weapon of choice among armed Serbs and
Albanians, not an American M-16, issued to marines. Three Serbs and
two Albanians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday about 200 Albanians demonstrated in Mitrovica, where
Serbs have cordoned part of the city. But the protesters were
persuaded by Hashim Thaci, the leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, not to provoke a confrontation. Jackson and Sergio Vieira de
Mello, the U.N. special representative for Kosovo, met with Serbs
in the city's hospital in an effort to calm tensions.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Jackson welcomed the arrival of 39 Russian
soldiers on the cargo plane Saturday, along with tons of equipment,
a day after Russia's Parliament approved the deployment of as many
as 3,600 troops in Kosovo. ``I'm very keen to get every soldier I
can at the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is opening under the terms of an agreement reached
in Finland a week ago between American and Russian ministers that
resolved the embarrassing impasse created when the Russians used
their de facto control of the airport as leverage in securing a
role for Russia in NATO's operation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement itself reflects the lingering wariness between
NATO and Russia, which was evident when Russian troops refused for
a time to let British troops enter the airport to prepare for the
news conference. Under the agreement, the first 12 military flights
are evenly divided between NATO and Russian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin emphasized that Russia's participation would make the
peacekeeping force truly multinational, even though NATO troops
will still make up the overwhelming majority of the force, which
will eventually grow to nearly 60,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   The media controlled by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, in particular, have stressed Russian participation as
part of their message that Milosevic in fact kept control of
Kosovo, and the foreign force in the province consists partly of
fellow Orthodox Slavs, the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have witnessed are the latest steps to ensure a
multinational presence in Kosovo,'' Zavarzin said as the Russians
unloaded cargo from their aircraft. Russian troops will operate as
distinct units in the American, French and German sectors of
Kosovo. Some 700 will control the airport grounds, providing
security and maintenance, although NATO forces will have
responsibility for air traffic control. ``We have to fulfill this
mission together,'' Zavarzin said.

   KOSOVO-WARCRIMES _ IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ Churned earth has
replaced the neat rows of mounds that told the world a mass grave
was here. A few detached body parts may remain in the clods of
dirt, along with the errant shoe or muddy blanket once used to wrap
a body. But gone are the corpses, the most compelling evidence of a
heinous crime. The story of the Izbica (Is-BEE-tsa) massacre, in
which more than 140 people are said to have been executed, is one
of seven counts in the war crimes indictment against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. Here in Kosovo that justice will be
terribly difficult to attain even where there has not been
intentional evidence tampering. There is ample opportunity for
evidence to be ruined simply by the passage of time and intrusion
of innocent people to crime scenes that have no guard, no fences or
even any markings. Developing. (Kunstel, Cox News Service). 25.

   SYDNEY-PROFILE-COX _ SYDNEY, Australia _ Sydney 2000 backers
like kangaroos, but they'd rather you come to their country looking
for something a little more sophisticated. Discussing Sydney's
image while dining at Nick's, a harborside restaurant in the
Darling Harbour area of downtown Sydney, the worries seem
overblown: A monorail (bearing an advertisement of an Olympic
sponsor) and water ferries traverse the harbor ahead. Within
walking distance are shops, restaurants and the massive hall where
wrestling, judo and a host of other Olympic sports will be played.
This has the look, the feel and the amenities of one of THE
gathering spots during the Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15,
2000. And unlike Atlanta in 1996, Sydney's downtown gathering spot
already exists. ``That is one of the nice things: We've got this
great gathering spot that is already in place, waiting for the
Olympics,'' said Peter Christopher, a newspaper executive guiding a
visitor through the city. Although there are worries about the
Olympic bribery scandal affecting the organizers' ability to raise
the rest of the money to host the 2000 Olympics, venue construction
and other preparations are in good enough shape that supporters are
able to worry about things like image. (Reetz, Cox News Service)

   MEXICO-DROUGHT _ ZACATECAS, Mexico _ A late spring storm was
enough to bring out thirsty rattlesnakes in Mexico's high central
plains, but it didn't impress farmer Apolonio Hernandez. With a
face as parched and wrinkled as the land he tries to farm,
Hernandez sat impassively under a mesquite tree while clouds
spattered the ground several miles away. Once again, Central and
Northern Mexico is suffering from drought that's jeopardizing
everything from vegetables for export to beans for domestic
consumption. It's the kind of periodic episode in this central
Mexican state that puts people out out of business, communities in
crisis and sends desperate people searching for work in Mexico's
cities or in the United States. Even with rainfall, the governor
says, Mexico's water problems won't subside without a major
overhaul of agricultural policy. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). 30.

 PEC, Yugoslavia: behind it.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the damage was inflicted by the Yugoslavs, but there is
also damage from the NATO air campaign. In an observation supported
by two weeks of visits across Kosovo, Schellenberg said that most
of the bombs, in fact, seemed to hit specific targets like military
barracks and police stations.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, several border villages were heavily damaged by
NATO bombs, as were bridges and houses near where the bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   The war has hurt more than houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Bela Crkva in Kosovo's southwest, Isuf
Zheniqi, 39, returned to find his two buses, which provided half
his income, burned down to the frames. Here, villagers say 64
people were massacred, many of them the young men who were the
town's future.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Safet Popaj, 60, looked over his burnt home and
announced: ``Kaput.'' In addition to the house, he said he lost
about 11,000 pounds of wheat, 6,600 pounds of corn and all seven of
his cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had enough killing here,'' he said. ``But, you know,
economic casualties _ that's 100 percent of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Rogova, Rexhep Shala, 64, stood in his
own destroyed house but said it was not important on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``To survive we can just eat bread,'' he said. ``But to rebuild
_ now we are 20 years behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of hard-nosed practicalities, Schellenberg said he
believed the U.N. high commissioner for refugees would be able to
provide shelter for the returned refugees before winter. As in
Bosnia, the reconstruction in Kosovo will begin with efforts to
create one room in the house safe from weather. Then, by
mid-October, the plan is to make sure that room can withstand the
cold of winter.
</P>
<P>
   For that, he said, there are enough materials pledged by the
United Nations, the European Union, the United States and other
donors.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term reconstruction requires a much greater effort,
not all of it monetary.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court rules.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message of a term in which the court asserted its
power over every branch and level of government, few of which
emerged unchanged from the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, the court reconfigured the federal-state
balance of power in three decisions that carved out a broad sphere
of immunity for the states from the reach of federal law. Those
decisions had a subtext with even more far-reaching implications,
indicating the court's unwillingness to credit Congress' own view
not only of the way legislation should be written but even of the
justification for federal legislation at all in areas where
Congress has deemed it preferable to stitch the states into a
uniform, nationwide rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the court any more solicitous of the executive branch,
rejecting the Clinton administration's plan for conducting the 2000
Census and insisting that there was no alternative to the
traditional head count for apportioning seats in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the states, the court invalidated California's
two-tiered welfare policy that disadvantaged new arrivals, a policy
the new federal welfare law had authorized. On the local level, the
justices rejected Chicago's approach to preventing gangs from
taking over neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a court that doesn't defer to government at any
level,'' Walter Dellinger, an acting solicitor general earlier in
the Clinton administration, said the other day. ``The court is
confident it can come up with the right decisions, and it believes
it is constitutionally charged with doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the court's lack of deference to its ostensibly co-equal
branches that was most notable. In fact, at a time when Congress
and the executive branch have appeared nearly paralyzed by partisan
stalemate and by their own internal weaknesses, one could almost
feel governmental power in Washington flowing in the court's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court makes decisions,'' one federal judge, surveying the
scene from a courthouse far from Washington, observed recently,
``and a willingness to actually make decisions puts you in stark
contrast with all the people who just talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The court did not make many decisions: only 75, half the number
of cases decided each term in the mid-1980s, and the June 23 end of
the term was the earliest closing date in 30 years. But the cases
the justices did choose from among some 7,000 petitions for review
were arrayed along society's pressure points, from police authority
to questions of discrimination, citizenship and disability rights.
</P>
<P>
   The term that begins next October promises, if anything, to be
even more intense, with a resumption of the federalism debate in at
least three new cases and with religion also added to the mix in
the form of a case on aid to parochial schools. There will also be
a major test of the court's willingness to defer to the executive
branch when it decides whether the Food and Drug Administration has
authority to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The term was a triumph for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who
after 27 years on the court, 13 of those as chief justice, is
stamping his deeply held vision of state sovereignty on the court's
jurisprudence. As the federalism debate has waxed and waned over
the years, he has never diverted his attention from his goal of
curtailing the national government's authority over the states, and
he appears on the verge of succeeding to a degree that would have
seemed implausible only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three federalism decisions handed down on the term's
final day, the chief justice's majority opinion holding states
immune from suits for patent infringement was the most blandly
written and appeared narrowly cast.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath its mild tone, it was aggressively far-reaching. In
rejecting Congress' factual premises for having made states liable
for patent infringement in the first place, the opinion assumed for
the court a veto power beyond any it has exercised in modern times.
The court flatly declared that Congress lacked a sufficient reason
for enacting the patent law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is telling Congress, `We think it's not as necessary
as you apparently do, so you lose,''' Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law
School said in an interview. ``It's a complete lack of deference.''
</P>
<P>
   The only shadow over the ascendant states'-rights majority is
the narrowness of its hold on the court. The three cases were all
decided by 5 votes to 4, an alignment that now seems to admit of no
compromise or middle ground. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the chief
justice's majority, while Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer made up the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the dissenters vowed never to yield _ as Rehnquist
did himself when he was on the losing end of the same debate half a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The alignment reflected in the federalism cases held true in
most of the court's closely fought cases _ actually, and typically,
a rather small subset of the docket. Thirty-four of the term's
cases, or 45 percent, were decided by 9-0 votes, unanimous in
outcome if not always in reasoning. Only 16 _ 21 percent _ were
decided by votes of 5-4, a group that included some important civil
rights and criminal procedure cases as well as the decision barring
statistical sampling for the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 16 cases, 14 found the four most liberal justices _
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer _ arrayed against the three
most conservative, the chief justice and Scalia and Thomas. That
left the outcome up to O'Connor and Kennedy, the justices
statistically in the middle of the court (as indicated by the fact
that over the course of the term, each dissented only eight times,
the fewest of any justice, compared with 14 dissenting votes by
Thomas, to their right, and 20 dissenting votes by Stevens, to
their left.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 5-4 cases, O'Connor voted with the conservative bloc 10
times and the more liberal group four times; Kennedy's split was
12-2. The conservative group prevailed in eight of the 14 cases
that reflected a clear ideological split.
</P>
<P>
   Ideological labels on this court can be quite misleading.
Liberalism on the court is a relative concept, as demonstrated by
the court's decision during the term that the government may select
aliens for deportation on the basis of their political views.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote was 6-3, with Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer
dissenting, their dissents were aimed not at the constitutional
merits of the court's rejection of the selective-enforcement claim
but rather at the narrower issue of whether the court should have
addressed that part of the case at all after earlier indicating
that it would not do so. Immigration law is one area where the
court retains a posture of deference toward administrative
enforcement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the spectrum remain committed to free speech
principles. A First Amendment decision striking down a federal
prohibition of broadcast advertising for casino gambling was
unanimous.

   Reading the disabilities law narrowly to exclude coverage of
people with correctable impairments like nearsightedness and high

   In the majority opinion, O'Connor noted that 160 million people
have disabilities, most of them correctable, so Congress could not
have meant to include them all. Stevens and Breyer said in dissent
that Congress' figure should be taken as illustrative of the
problem the statute was supposed to address rather than a

   For years the court has been trying to decide whether Section
1981, one of the Reconstruction-era civil rights laws, prohibits

had to be dismissed when the lawsuit was settled.

   Two months ago, after weeks of internal debate over the
constitutional ramifications of this issue, the court selected
another case and scheduled it for argument in October. But the
parties in that case, United Brotherhood of Carpenters vs.
Anderson, then settled their dispute, and as its final act before
beginning the summer recess, the court announced that this case had
been dismissed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the major cases.
</P>
<P>
   STATES GET PROTECTION FROM AN ARRAY OF LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   In a trio of decisions, all by the same 5-4 vote, the court
invoked a broad principle of sovereign immunity to shield states
from suit for violations of federal law. The court struck down two
federal laws, both enacted in 1992 to authorize suits against
states for violations of federal patent and trademark laws. The
justices also overturned a 35-year-old precedent under which states
that entered the commercial marketplace _ in that case, by running
a railroad _ were regarded as having waived their immunity from
suit for their activities there.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three cases, those in the majority were Rehnquist
and O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases, Alden vs. Maine, No. 98-436, held in an
opinion by Kennedy that states could not be sued in their own
courts by state employees for violations of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. Since the justices had made it clear in a 1996
decision, Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, that such suits could not be
brought in federal court, the decision left state employees without
recourse when they believe their rights under federal labor law
have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government itself can still sue on a state
employee's behalf, but the Department of Labor is not equipped to
bring more than a token number of such lawsuits on behalf of the
4.7 million people in the country who work for state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The other two federalism cases grew out of lawsuits by the
College Savings Bank, based in Princeton, N.J., against the state
of Florida, a competitor in the marketplace for investment funds
for college tuition. The College Savings Bank charged Florida with
false advertising of the state program, in violation of federal
trademark law, and with infringing its patent on its investment
program.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion by Rehnquist, Florida Prepaid vs. College Savings
Bank, No. 98-531, held that the states are immune from patent
infringement suits, while Scalia wrote for the majority in College
Savings Bank vs. Florida Prepaid, No. 98-149, that states are also
immune from trademark suits.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LOSES ON CENSUS
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the Clinton administration's plan to conduct the 2000
Census with the help of statistical sampling, the court ruled by a
5-4 vote that the Census Act made the traditional head count
mandatory for the figures that will be used to apportion the House
of Representatives. The court indicated that statistical
adjustments may be made for the other purposes of the Census,
including state redistricting and the distribution of federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor wrote for the majority in Department of Commerce vs.
U.S. House of Representatives, No. 98-404. The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.

   ON CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES, SOME REINING IN OF AUTHORITY
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance that
was aimed at preventing gang members from controlling neighborhood
streets. The law authorized the police to arrest anyone who,
refusing a police order to move on, remained ``in one place with no
apparent purpose'' in the presence of a suspected gang member.
Voting 6-3 in Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the court said the
ordinance gave too much discretion to the police to target innocent
people. Stevens wrote the majority opinion. Scalia dissented, along
with Rehnquist and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a case growing out of an independent counsel's prosecution of
Mike Espy, the Clinton administration's former secretary of
agriculture, the court ruled unanimously that giving gifts to a
federal official does not violate the law against illegal
gratuities unless there is a demonstrated connection between the
gifts and the official's actions. Scalia wrote the opinion in
United States vs. Sun-diamond, No. 98-131, which rejected the
independent counsel's expansive theory of the gratuity statute.
</P>
<P>
   There were several cases dealing with police behavior and
raising questions of privacy under the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition against unreasonable searches. Among these was the
court's unanimous ruling that the police violate ``the right of
residential privacy at the core of the Fourth Amendment'' when they
take journalists and photographers into people's homes to witness
searches or arrests. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Wilson vs.
Layne, No. 98-83.
</P>
<P>
   In another search case, the court ruled, 5-4, that people who
are temporarily in a private home to conduct business there may not
challenge the validity of a search of the home, because they
themselves have no ``legitimate expectation of privacy'' there.
Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in Minnesota vs. Carter, No.
97-1147. Ginsburg dissented, along with Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
A concurring opinion by Kennedy suggested that a social guest,
rather than someone doing business, would be able to challenge a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Two search cases concerned automobiles. The court ruled
unanimously, in another opinion by Rehnquist, that issuing a
speeding ticket does not automatically give the police the
authority to search the car. The case was Knowles vs. Iowa, No.
97-7597.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court also ruled that once the police do
have probable cause to search a car, they can search the personal
belongings _ in this case, a pocketbook _ of passengers who are
themselves under no suspicion of illegal activity. The vote in
Wyoming vs. Houghton, No. 98-184, was 6-3. Scalia wrote the
majority opinion, and Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld the first death sentence to come
before it under the new, greatly expanded federal death penalty
law, rejecting a challenge to the jury instructions along with
other issues. Thomas wrote the majority opinion in Jones vs. U.S.,
No. 97-9361, with dissenting votes by Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   IN DISABILITY CASES, A NARROWER DEFINITION
</P>
<P>
   In a series of three cases, all decided by the same 7-2 vote,
the court took a restrictive view of the definition of disability
under the Americans With Disabilities Act. People whose impairments
can be alleviated by medication, glasses or other devices are
generally not disabled and so do not come under the law's
protection against employment discrimination, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the cases, the disability claims the court rejected
were based on vision problems. O'Connor wrote the majority opinion
in Sutton vs. United Air Lines, No. 97-1943, finding that two
nearsighted sisters, with vision correctable to 20/20, were not
disabled despite the airline's refusal to hire them because of
their vision. In Albertsons Inc. vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591,
Souter wrote for the majority, rejecting a discrimination claim by
a truck driver who was dismissed because he was functionally blind
in one eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No. 97-1992, O'Connor wrote
for the majority that an employer did not discriminate by
dismissing a truck driver whose high blood pressure prevented him
from obtaining federal certification to drive a truck. Stevens and
Breyer dissented in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving a separate issue under the Americans With Disabilities
Act, the court ruled 6-3 that isolating people with disabilities in
big state institutions when there is no medical reason for their
confinement is a form of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This decision, Olmstead vs. L.C., No. 98-536, did not require
states to move patients en masse into group homes, but said that
states should have a plan for doing so at a ``reasonable pace''
when medically appropriate and not unduly disruptive to the state's
budget. Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, with Thomas, Scalia
and Rehnquist voting in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting another federal law, the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Act, the court ruled that students with
disabilities who require special care during the school day are
entitled to the care at public expense, as long as a doctor is not
required to deliver the necessary services. The vote in Cedar
Rapids vs. Garrett F., No. 96-1793, was 7-2. Stevens wrote the
majority opinion. Thomas and Kennedy dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that a worker who has applied for or
received disability benefits under Social Security is not barred by
that fact from suing an employer for discrimination under the
Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer wrote the opinion in Cleveland vs. Policy Management
Systems, No. 97-1008, which reconciled an apparent conflict in the
two laws: Social Security, which provides benefits to those too
disabled to work, and the disabilities law, which protects those
who can work if provided with reasonable accommodations.

WASHINGTON: Ginsburg and Breyer.

<P>
   ON CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES, SOME REINING IN OF AUTHORITY
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a Chicago anti-loitering ordinance that
was aimed at preventing gang members from controlling neighborhood
streets. The law authorized the police to arrest anyone who,
refusing a police order to move on, remained ``in one place with no
apparent purpose'' in the presence of a suspected gang member.
Voting 6-3 in Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121, the court said the
ordinance gave too much discretion to the police to target innocent
people. Stevens wrote the majority opinion. Scalia dissented, along
with Rehnquist and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a case growing out of an independent counsel's prosecution of
Mike Espy, the Clinton administration's former secretary of
agriculture, the court ruled unanimously that giving gifts to a
federal official does not violate the law against illegal
gratuities unless there is a demonstrated connection between the
gifts and the official's actions. Scalia wrote the opinion in
United States vs. Sun-diamond, No. 98-131, which rejected the
independent counsel's expansive theory of the gratuity statute.
</P>
<P>
   There were several cases dealing with police behavior and
raising questions of privacy under the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition against unreasonable searches. Among these was the
court's unanimous ruling that the police violate ``the right of
residential privacy at the core of the Fourth Amendment'' when they
take journalists and photographers into people's homes to witness
searches or arrests. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Wilson vs.
Layne, No. 98-83.
</P>
<P>
   In another search case, the court ruled, 5-4, that people who
are temporarily in a private home to conduct business there may not
challenge the validity of a search of the home, because they
themselves have no ``legitimate expectation of privacy'' there.
Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion in Minnesota vs. Carter, No.
97-1147. Ginsburg dissented, along with Stevens, Souter and Breyer.
A concurring opinion by Kennedy suggested that a social guest,
rather than someone doing business, would be able to challenge a
search.
</P>
<P>
   Two search cases concerned automobiles. The court ruled
unanimously, in another opinion by Rehnquist, that issuing a
speeding ticket does not automatically give the police the
authority to search the car. The case was Knowles vs. Iowa, No.
97-7597.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court also ruled that once the police do

<P>
   FOR THE HARASSED AND THE POOR: A STRENGTHENING OF RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that bars sex discrimination in
schools, the court ruled 5-4 that school districts can be liable
for damages for failing to stop one student from subjecting another
to severe and pervasive sexual harassment. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion in Davis vs. Monroe County, No. 97-843. Kennedy
dissented, along with the chief justice, Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that state welfare programs may not restrict new
residents to the welfare benefits they would have received in their
home states. The 7-2 decision, Saenz vs. Roe, No. 98-97, had the
effect of overturning a portion of the new federal welfare law,
which authorized states to set up two-tiered benefit systems.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, written by Stevens, was also significant for its
reliance on the long-ignored Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
14th Amendment, a possible signal that this provision, which
provides that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States,'' could become a new source of protection for individual
rights. Rehnquist and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous opinion, the latest to examine a much-disputed
congressional district in North Carolina, held that district lines
drawn primarily for political reasons are not invalid simply
because they are drawn with a consciousness of the district's
racial composition.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, overturned a
judgment that North Carolina's 12th Congressional District, which
is heavily Democratic and 47 percent black, was an unconstitutional
racial gerrymander. Thomas' majority opinion appeared to give the
states some breathing room as they prepare for the post-2000 round
of redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court held that companies making ``good
faith efforts'' to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws
will not be liable for punitive damages, even if a senior official
intentionally violates company policy and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Kolstad vs. American Dental Association, No.
98-208, interpreted a 1991 amendment to the Civil Rights Act of
1964, which for the first time authorized awards of punitive
damages for intentional job discrimination. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion, from which Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   CASINOS AND VOTER INITIATIVES WIN ON FREE SPEECH GROUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously struck down a 65-year-old federal ban
on broadcast advertising of casino gambling. Writing for the court
in Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assoc. vs. U.S., No. 98-387,
Stevens said the law ``sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful
speech about lawful conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision extolling the First Amendment value of
uninhibited ``communication with voters,'' the court struck down
Colorado's restrictions on the process of getting initiatives on
the ballot. Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Buckley vs.
American Constitutional Law Foundation, No. 97-930, while Rehnquist
and O'Connor and Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulations the decision invalidated were requirements
that people circulating petitions be registered Colorado voters and
wear badges identifying themselves by name.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION CASES MEAN MORE AUTHORITY FOR GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   An area in which the court gave considerable deference to the
government was immigration law, with the court sharing Congress'
and the administration's narrow view of the rights of noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 6-3, in a deportation case involving a group of
Palestinians in Los Angeles, that the government does not violate
the Constitution by selecting aliens for deportation based on their
political views and associations. Scalia wrote the majority opinion
in Reno vs. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, No.
97-1252, with Ginsburg, Souter and Breyer dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a second deportation case the court ruled unanimously that
foreigners who have committed serious crimes in their home
countries are ineligible for refugee status here regardless of the
risk of persecution they face if deported. Kennedy's opinion in
Immigration and Naturalization Service vs. Aguirre, No. 97-1754,
upheld the Clinton administration's view of how a would-be
refugee's criminal past should be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   IN BUSINESS-CONSUMER CASES RULINGS FOR BOTH SIDES
</P>
<P>
   Among a number of important business cases, the court limited
much of the Federal Communications Commission's authority to
supervise telephone deregulation under the Telecommunications Act
of 1996. Scalia wrote the majority opinion in AT&AMP;T Corp. vs. Iowa
Utilities Board, No. 97-826. The vote was 5-3, with Souter, Thomas
and Breyer dissenting and O'Connor not participating.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous opinion on the use of expert testimony was a
substantial victory for defendants in product liability suits. In
Kumho Tire vs. Carmichael, No. 97-1709, the court gave federal
judges new authority to keep expert testimony of questionable
reliability away from juries. Breyer wrote the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In an important ruling on how the judicial system should handle
class action lawsuits in mass tort cases, the court set aside a
$1.5-billion settlement in an asbestos suit, covering some 186,000
claims, on the ground that it was unfair to other asbestos victims,
and was the product of a possible conflict of interest on the part
of the lawyers who designed and settled the case.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Ortiz vs. Fibreboard Corp., No. 97-1704, was 7-2.
Souter wrote the majority opinion, and Breyer and Stevens
dissented.

 WASHINGTON: bill died.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, as the legislation re-emerged, Mrs. Clinton has kept
her vigil. She spoke out last month at the White House on what she
called abusive and predatory practices by credit-card companies,
which make 4 billion unsolicited offers of credit cards every year
that critics say are aimed at those least likely to pay their bills
on time _ elderly women, unemployed college students, people
without health insurance and those already in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the bankruptcy issue has been
unusual in part because her own party is split over what to do
about it. The House passed its version with a veto-proof majority
even as advisers to the president recommended he veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version is also expected to win some support from
Democrats, who are negotiating with Republicans over aspects like
means testing and requirements for credit-card companies to
disclose to consumers how much they will owe if they do not pay
their bills in full.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that so far the Senate has not
adequately addressed the concerns of Mrs. Clinton, who wants both
the priority for women and children and greater accountability by
creditors, but they are circumspect about how far the White House
will go in pressing for changes, especially if many Democratic
senators are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Another complicating factor is this: Some of the Democrats
sympathetic to the Republican proposals are also major fund-raisers
for their party, and the banking and credit interests are prime
sources of big campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill driven by campaign contributions,'' Nadler
said. ``I don't know that Mrs. Clinton would have gotten much
support for her Senate campaign from the big banks anyway, but this
means she won't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last election cycle, the credit industry, including
credit-card companies, banks and retailers, gave more than $4.5
million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of aggressive industry lobbying, by
retailers as well as creditors, and they spent a great deal of
money,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a spokesman for Mastercard International, said
that Mrs. Clinton had worked hard and made her opposition well
known but that she had not been able to overcome the industry's
basic argument for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hard sell to say there's a fundamental flaw in the
current law when debtors are allowed to walk away from their debts
when they have the ability to pay,'' Binzel said. ``It's fair to
say there is strong bipartisan support for bankruptcy reform.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOHANSIC, N.Y. _ Almost every Saturday night, Ron Bucci, a
chiropractor from Tarrytown, kisses his wife and three children
goodbye and drives the family van up to Mohansic Golf Course, where
he sleeps in the parking lot with carloads of other men from
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Bucci arrives around 8 p.m., early enough to tap a few
balls around Mohansic's putting green, down a bottle of beer or two
at the bar and engage in ritual male banter. Sleep is scarce, and
by 4 a.m., the groggy platoon of unshaven fathers, husbands and
boyfriends wanders into the cozy clubhouse to collect the holy
grail of public-access golf: a Sunday morning tee time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got mailmen up there sleeping, construction workers,
correction officers, cops, accountants,'' said Bucci, 40, a
seven-year veteran of the Mohansic sleepovers. ``If the manager of
the course wants to get an early spot, he's up there sleeping,'' he
said. ``I'm lucky. I have a van. Some guys sleep in the front seat
of their car.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Westchester County, golf oasis for the
wealthy, is a golf desert for everyone else. Though the county is
peppered with 61 golf courses, only five are open to the free-range
duffer, that particular golf subspecies who cannot afford even a
mid-range private club's $150,000 membership fee and $10,000 in
annual dues.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island, by contrast, is home to 64 private and 50 public
courses. In southern Connecticut, many towns operate their own
public courses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so bad in recent years that Westchester _
one of the most affluent counties in the nation _ is now among the
most golf-deprived, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The county's five public courses, operating at
capacity, were host to 270,000 rounds of golf last year, meeting
less than 20 percent of the estimated demand for 1.5 million annual
rounds, according to a report by the National Golf Foundation. ``If
there was anywhere in the country that I would build a golf course,
it would be in Westchester County,'' said Angelo Palermo, the
Florida-based golf-course consultant who submitted the report to
county officials in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   County officials appear ready to take such advice to heart. By
the end of this week, County Executive Andrew J. Spano plans to
choose from among five multimillion-dollar bids, including one from
his own Parks Department, to build a public course on the grounds
of the defunct Hudson Hills Golf Club in New Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a slam-dunk project,'' Palermo said, ``this
is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new course is still at least two years from reality. Though
the county bought the 170-acre property from IBM in December 1997
for the bargain price of $3.5 million, officials have done little
with the land, which is dense with bramble, bogs and white-tailed
deer.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schwartz, Spano's deputy, said constructing the course
would cost less than $10 million, a relative bargain. Nowadays,
with land scarce, and environmental regulations ever more complex,
even a starter golf course can cost $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they manage to get a tee time, Westchester golfers
face less-than-ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public golf is nuts,'' said Frank Madalone, 33, a dentist from
Yonkers, swinging a 3-iron just off the first tee on a recent
Friday at Sprain Lake Golf Club, where 54,197 rounds were played
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play on the weekend, it's insanity. The fairways overlap,
balls flying everywhere,'' he said, shaking his head. ``It's like a
firing range out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he added, taking the measure of the course before
him, ``even for $12, it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on weekdays, Westchester's public courses are crowded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: If you want a tee time at 3 o'clock in
the afternoon on a weekday, on a 95-degree day, you can probably
find one,'' said the county's parks commissioner, Salvatore
DeSantis.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of public golf is not unique to Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place that is undersupplied in golf as much as the
New York area,'' said David Leibowits, a golf course developer at
Centennial Golf Club, a 27-hole course in Putnam County that
charges $105 for a weekend round. ``People drive an hour and a half
to two hours for golf,'' he said. ``The demand is unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things have conspired to make that so.
</P>
<P>
   After an ebb in golf's popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, more
women and youths are playing than ever, industry analysts said.
That is especially true in Westchester, home of some of the most
exclusive private clubs in the country and a 32-year-old
professional tournament now known as the Buick Classic, at
Westchester Country Club in Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is evident at Ardsley High School, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf club used to be five kids,'' Henry Tina, the school's
golf coach, said at Mohansic's second hole on Saturday. ``I got 18
kids now. Where are they going to play?''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he said, local private clubs allowed the
team to practice on their courses. Now they squeeze onto Sprain
Lake's course.
</P>
<P>
   Pro golf's marketing of its young, camera-ready stars like Tiger
Woods has also brought legions of young wannabes to public courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have so many guys wearing pink now,'' said Anthony
Federico, of Ardsley, waiting with Tina under a maple tree at
Mohansic's second hole.
</P>
<P>
   Money is also a factor: The economy's years-long boom has made a
decent set of clubs a less intimidating purchase, and a public
course's greens fee is often less expensive than a movie, soda and
popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence of the surge, however, the quality of the
public courses has dropped as they absorb more rounds from
inexperienced players. Last year, golfers played 30 million rounds
on New York state's 857 courses, industry statistics show, an
average of about 35,000 per course.
</P>
<P>
   But in Westchester County, Dunwoodie, the least active course,
clocked 48,884 rounds, according to the county's Parks Department.
Saxon Woods, in Scarsdale, crammed in 61,772 rounds. ``That's
seven-minute tee-time intervals,'' Palermo said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many local golfers leave.
</P>
<P>
   Federico and Madalone, the dentist, both said they drive up to
two hours to play more expensive golf in Dutchess County,
Connecticut or Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Federico lamented. ``It seems like such a shame
that we're in such a wealthy county.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another, perhaps more disturbing trend that veteran
golfers say is sweeping Westchester County's public-access golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more anger on the golf course,'' said John
Lewandowski, 52, a sales and marketing executive from South Salem,
after whacking a 150-yard drive past Mohansic's first hole one week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, they don't care about anybody else. They don't rake the
bunkers. They don't wait for people to leave the green.''
</P>
<P>
   What really galls him is the flying balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll hit close to you to sort of move you along,''
Lewandowski said, leaning on his putter. ``That can be dangerous.
Golf balls hurt.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The lines of people standing outside
office buildings in Kosovo's capital show where they think the
power lies. Saturday, dozens of young people were filling out forms
applying for jobs at the new headquarters of the U.N. mission here.
</P>
<P>
   Another line of people waited outside the central NATO military
police station to report theft or damage to their property over the
last few months. By contrast, the Serbian government building, once
the bastion of local power, stands almost deserted, its windows
blown out and three British soldiers guarding the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   People know that the U.N. mission is to be the civilian
administration in Kosovo. As yet, however, its presence is barely
felt. A U.N. flag flies over the former Defense Ministry building
and a few white U.N. cars are parked outside. The offices are
largely empty and smell of new paint.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is still at the stage of recruiting people, the U.N.
secretary-general's special representative to Kosovo, Sergio Vieira
de Mello, acknowledges. He himself is only an interim chief and
does not know when a permanent representative will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   He has yet to appoint his five civilian regional administrators
although last week he said he had selected three. One priority is
to appoint six local judges to deal with the dozens of suspects
arrested by the few military police who arrived with the NATO
forces on charges ranging from petty theft to multiple murder. That
has taken all week and the judges have yet to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing need is for an international police force to
tackle the crime that has flourished with the exit of the Serbian
police and military forces and many Serbian civilians and the
return of over 300,000 Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   For these past two weeks, what little policing that has taken
place has been the work of NATO soldiers whose powers to stop every
incident of looting, burning, harassment or other violence have
been severely stretched.
</P>
<P>
   The first 40 police officers of a planned 3,000-strong
international police force will arrive on Tuesday, more than two
weeks after NATO arrived in Kosovo. The process of acquiring police
officers from member countries is so time-consuming that the 40
officers are borrowed from the U.N. mission in nearby Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials estimate that it will be three months before all
3,000 officers are in place. ``We don't enjoy what the armies
enjoy,'' said Fabricio Hochschild, special assistant to the acting
head of the mission. ``We're a cash-strapped, under-funded
organization. We don't have civil administrators and police who can
be put on planes and brought here in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian diplomat who ran the U.N. mission
in Cambodia, pleaded for understanding. ``Governments would not
provide funds'' for Kosovo, before June 14, two days after NATO's
entry, ``when they got a Security Council resolution,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Staff will increase gradually, he said, and interpretation of
the United Nations' exact mission here and how to structure
civilian administration are only now being decided. ``We are
inventing right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is bogged down in technicalities, waiting for
headquarters to decide on key issues of international law, such as
how to structure immigration, customs and security at Kosovo's
border in a way that will ensure the still formally existing
sovereignty of Yugoslavia over this ruined province. Who will pay
pensions, social security and salaries of state employees is
another dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello has been shuttling around trying to keep the
political scene free of strife, bringing together the leaders of
the Serbian and Albanian communities together to try to prevent an
increase in violence. ``If we let ourselves be discouraged by early
signs of intolerance, we will not succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been sharply criticized over one of the most obvious
tasks, securing public buildings and records. U.N. officials did
move in to seal the district court building, and all the documents
still inside, shortly after arriving in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Executive Council, the main government building in the
city, and virtually every other official building were ignored.
Even when reports emerged of Serbian officials destroying documents
in the government building, the United Nations merely asked the
Serbian head of government, Zoran Andjelkovic, to desist.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after two days when reporters spotted government
workers loading up a truck full of paper material that the United
Nations took more determined action. A full 12 days after NATO
troops came into Kosovo, soldiers were posted in the government
building to prevent any further material being removed.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira de Mello said it had been his decision, since he had to
request the use of NATO soldiers and effectively take them away
from their job of restoring general security. ``I have to choose
between static tasks or the active tasks they are doing to secure
the environment,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A member of the mission criticized the U.N. stance on the
government building, saying it set a weak precedent in the crucial
early stages of the mission. He warned that the failure to act in
such instances could embolden the Kosovo Liberation Army, which in
the absence of any other authority has already assumed de facto
control in several towns and villages across the province.
</P>
<P>
   This process of shifting control has been illustrated all this
past week at Pristina hospital as Albanian doctors and medical
staff returned to take up their old jobs. Some had been laid off
just three months ago, some as long as 10 years ago, by a policy
that favored Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival, along with wounded soldiers of the KLA, raised
tensions to such a degree that the Serbian staff began to fall
away. Saturday, a young man in civilian clothes was guarding the
main door of the surgical ward. He readily admitted he was a member
of the KLA and said that there were no more Serbian personnel at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should they expect to keep their jobs, after they pushed
out all the Albanians?'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Along the street at the university faculty buildings, a convoy
of 50 cars of Serbian families was pulling out of the city, leaving
for Serbia or Montenegro. They were leaving modern, prosperous
looking homes. On the doors of each, in Albanian, were scratched
taunting messages. ``Jaha, don't touch,'' read one, as if an
Albanian had already marked it as his property.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer who gave his name only as Ivan said the KLA had
taken over the power station where he worked at Obilic, not far
from Pristina, and told the Serbian personnel to leave. Then, Ivan
said, he received threats on the telephone. ``That's what did it
for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic was there trying to persuade the Serbs not to leave.
But as the convoy drove off, he threw his hands up. ``No, I failed.
I couldn't persuade them.''

 &HT;    Playing, promoting new music tops orchestra league agenda
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When more than 1,500 musicians, office staff, board
members and volunteers representing many of the nearly 900
orchestras affiliated with the American Symphony Orchestra League
congregated in the Windy City earlier this month for the league's
annual confab, they had one topic on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Music.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound obvious. But it ain't necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1942 and chartered by Congress in 1962, the orchestra
league is the symphonic world's nonprofit trade organization. Soon
to move to New York City from its longtime base in Washington,
D.C., the ASOL's mission is ``to provide leadership and service to
American orchestras while communicating to the American public the
value and importance of orchestras and the music they perform.''
</P>
<P>
   But orchestras are in the business of making music, and it's the
business end that gets much of the ASOL focus and support.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the focus has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the 21st century, the organization has launched a
five-year initiative dedicated to the performance of contemporary
American music. Dubbed ``Music for a New Millennium,'' the effort
involves more than encouraging the playing of new music; it's about
helping orchestras succeed in presenting works ``to the audiences
who want to hear it, though they may not know it yet,'' as Henry
Fogel, president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, put it to
conference delegates.
</P>
<P>
   How can orchestras identify compelling new music, perform it
with confidence, promote it effectively and get audiences to
embrace it?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the questions that propelled the three days of
conference activities, which also included performances by the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Civic Orchestra and the
Chicago Youth Symphony and Concert orchestras. Panel discussions
featured a mix of contemporary composers, critics and orchestra
managers, while break-out sessions dealt with such in-the-trenches
staff concerns of education and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   There were no easy answers to the initial questions, and the
perpetual issues of accessibility and elitism wove through the
comments of many panelists.
</P>
<P>
   Does new music have to be difficult to be good?
</P>
<P>
   Does presenting ``accessible'' works _ as in music a lot of
people can take to easily _ qualify as pandering?
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Christopher Rouse said he
doesn't think accessible and good are necessarily incompatible.
``We've celebrated inaccessible too long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said he sees a new trend in the music of young
composers that not only is increasingly melodic, but also
emphasizes the spiritual and emotional aspects of musical
expression over the often intellectual concerns of 20th century
modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Music is about communication, Rouse said, and ``any music is
accessible that engages the listener's senses and emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Borda, executive director of the New York Philharmonic,
was interested in communication as well, but that which occurs
around the performance experience. ``We have to discover new ways
of inviting people into our concerts,'' she said. She suggested
taking some cues from art museums and the ways they make events out
of new exhibitions. She also sees great potential in reaching new
listeners as well as ticket-buyers through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Rockwell, arts editor for the New York Times, raised a
provocative question: ``Is it wrong to segregate new music?'' he
asked, suggesting that while it's important to include some modern
and/or new music during the regular subscription season, it may
also be worth pursuing special programming. He also suggested
presenting new music in smaller performance halls as well as
providing concerts at cheaper prices. ``Make tickets affordable to
the people who want to go to hear those kinds of music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a given to most conference participants that
unfamiliarity with a new work or composer can hamper an audience's
understanding or enjoyment of the piece. But keynote speaker
Michael Steinberg, who writes the concert program notes for the New
York Philharmonic, said it's more important that the orchestra
musicians understand the music they're playing.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg quoted the modern composer Arnold Schoenberg, who
said: ``My music isn't modern, it's just badly performed.''
According to Steinberg, ``conviction'' on the part of the conductor
and the players was necessary to give life to a new piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   The ASOL's intent is to help make that happen. The ``Music for a
New Millennium'' initiative is both ``a celebration and an array of
activities,'' said the Chicago Symphony's Fogle.
</P>
<P>
   The means to the end include an interative Web site _
www.newmusicnow.org _ which was launched at the conclusion of the
conference; composer residencies; and performances, discussions and
special presentations at each conference over the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that audiences often disliked much of the music of
the 20th century, the ASOL's membership is hoping to make the music
of new millennium a different story.

U.S. IS SAID TO HAVE KNOWN OF CHINA SPY LINK IN 1995  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior White House officials were informed that
China might have stolen U.S. nuclear secrets nearly a year earlier
than the Clinton administration originally disclosed, according to
current and former U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was told about China's apparent theft of U.S.
nuclear weapons technology in July 1995, soon after it was detected
by the Energy Department and the Central Intelligence Agency,
several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the administration has left the impression that the
White House first learned about the matter in April 1996, when
Sandy Berger, then President Clinton's deputy national security
adviser, was briefed on the case by Energy Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with current and former officials show that
warnings about possible Chinese nuclear espionage received
high-level attention within the Clinton administration early in the
government's investigation of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1995, within months of first learning of the case, the
director of Central Intelligence was convinced that the evidence
showed that China had stolen design information from America's most
advanced nuclear warhead, and had briefed Clinton's national
security adviser on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the investigation into China's apparent theft of the nuclear
secrets languished, plagued for the next four years by what many
officials now describe as miscommunication, bureaucratic inertia
and outright bungling by several agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory has been dismissed
from his job for security violations in connection with the FBI's
investigation of the case. But the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, the FBI's
prime suspect in China's theft of nuclear secrets, has not been
arrested or charged with any crime, and some U.S. law enforcement
officials now doubt whether they will ever be able to bring
espionage charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the first high-level official lost his job in the
fallout from the case. Victor Reis, assistant secretary of energy
for defense programs and the official overseeing the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons labs, submitted his resignation to
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that China may have stolen nuclear secrets first came
to the attention of the White House during a meeting in July 1995,
when the White House Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, was informed of
the problem by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Panetta and other
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Energy Department officials had also been told
that the CIA had gathered intelligence about the possible theft,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta then called the CIA director, John Deutch, to find out
what the agency was doing about the case, Panetta said. Deutch, who
had also just received a call about the same matter from Deputy
Energy Secretary Charles Curtis, told Panetta he would investigate.
Panetta then told Deutch to work with the National Security Council
at the White House on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that he had not heard about the case first from officials
in his own agency, Deutch called Panetta back a day or two later
and told him what the CIA knew about the spy case, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A brief reference to such meetings between Energy Department,
CIA and White House officials in the summer of 1995 is also
included in a new report on he case issued by the president's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch finally briefed the national security adviser, Anthony
Lake, on the case in November 1995. Lake said he did not recall the
briefing, but he and White House officials said there was a record
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Lake, Deutch received a full briefing from
the CIA analysts, who convinced him that design information on the
nuclear weapon _ known as the W-88 _ had been stolen by Beijing,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not told of the evidence in 1995 by Panetta, Lake,
or any of the other officials who had been briefed, according to
the National Security Council spokesman, David C. Leavy. Berger
also did not tell Clinton about the case following his briefing in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, now the national security adviser, has said that it was
not until after he received a second, more specific briefing in
July 1997 that he told Clinton about security problems at the
nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Berger did take some action after his 1996 briefing, Leavy said,
including directing that Congress be secretly informed. In that
meeting, he also agreed with Energy Department officials on the
need to strengthen security at the weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Working along two separate tracks initially unknown to each
other, CIA and Energy Department officials first began to unravel
the case in the spring of 1995, when weapons designers from the Los
Alamos laboratory told Energy Department intelligence officials
that they were convinced China had stolen design information on the
W-88, based on their analysis of a series of Chinese nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, U.S. officials received a package filled
with Chinese government documents, which arrived by DHL express
service, officials say. Officials refused to say where the package
was received or how they determined the identity of the sender.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials analyzing the documents quickly focused on one
that included what appeared to be classified design information
about U.S. nuclear weapons, including the W-88. Dated 1988, the
document also included a hand drawing of a U.S. nuclear warhead
re-entry vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But initially, the CIA did not tell the Energy Department _ or
anyone else in the government _ that it had obtained the W-88
document, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A former senior CIA official said that soon after the agency
realized the significance of the W-88 document, Deutch ordered him
not to disseminate it to other U.S. intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But other current U.S. officials familiar with the matter said
that Deutch did not try to suppress the document. Instead, they
said the document was not distributed immediately because it took
time for the CIA to translate and analyze it. Deutch refused to
comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, by August 1995 the Energy Department's analysts
had obtained a copy, even though it would not be officially
distributed throughout U.S. intelligence agencies until that
December.
</P>
<P>
   By then, analysts had concluded that the document indeed
included U.S. nuclear secrets, officials say. At that time, the
document did not include a caveat saying that the source of the
document was believed to be a double agent.
</P>
<P>
   After the analysts reported to Deutch in November, a broader
review, dominated by the Energy Department, reported similar
conclusions in April 1996. Berger was then briefed that same month,
and the FBI opened its criminal investigation on May 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But in late June or July 1996, the FBI dropped its
investigation, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA had just re-issued the W-88 document with a warning that
the agency now believed that the source of the document was a
double agent. The CIA's new assessment, coming a year after it had
first received the document, led the FBI to ``stand down,'' or
suspend, its investigation, the senior U.S. official said.

WASHINGTON: U.S. official said.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suspension of the investigation lasted for about six weeks
in the summer of 1996, according to the official. It resumed after
the Energy Department assured the FBI that, even if the source was
a double agent, the document nonetheless contained accurate,
classified data about the W-88 warhead, and so represented a
security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA agreed that the information in the document was
accurate, and also continued its own analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But while the FBI re-started its investigation, it remained a
low priority, FBI officials now concede. Only one or two agents
were assigned to the investigation in 1996, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, when the Justice Department denied the FBI's request to
seek court authorization to wiretap and electronically monitor Lee,
a move that has since become the subject of congressional inquiry,
the FBI still had only three or four agents on the case. Today, in
the midst of a public furor over Chinese atomic espionage, the FBI
has assigned 40 agents to the investigation.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dr. Leandro Pasos, 68, was struggling to make a
living when, about a year ago, an unusual advertisement in a
Seattle newspaper caught his eye. Doctors with active licenses, the
ad said, could earn up to $10,000 a month doing ``fully automated
online medical reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was placed by Performance Drugs Inc., a fledging company
that had set up shop on the Internet to market Viagra, the
diamond-shaped blue pill that offers millions of men the hope of
better sex through chemistry. The company had lined up pharmacies
in Miami and Las Vegas to ship the pills to patients. But it needed
doctors to write the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   As an orthopedic surgeon, Pasos specialized in ailments of the
bones and joints, not impotence. Still, he signed up with
Performance Drugs. For a salary of $5,000 a month, he agreed to
review questionnaires submitted electronically by prospective
Viagra patients, authorizing prescriptions as he saw fit. As he
later explained to investigators, ``I needed a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Pasos join the ranks of a growing breed of physicians:
cyberdoctors. His patients were strangers to him; his examinations
took place in the facelessness of cyberspace. That got Pasos into
trouble with the Washington Medical Quality Assurance Commission,
which in May cited him for unprofessional conduct for prescribing
drugs to people he had not physically examined, and fined him $500.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pasos declined to be interviewed, and his lawyer said
no patients had been harmed, the officials who put an end to his
career in online prescribing like to think his case will serve as a
warning. Yet their efforts have barely been noticed in the
flourishing electronic drug market, a new brand of commerce that is
raising questions of medical ethics and law.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, pharmacies are shipping pills across state lines
without the requisite licenses. Doctors are writing prescriptions
for people they have never met, a practice the American Medical
Association says is unethical, but not illegal. And nobody _ not
Congress, not the American Medical Association, not various federal
and state agencies _ knows quite how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strictly the Wild West of drug dealing via the
Internet,'' said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., who is pressing Congress to
hold hearings on the problem. Buyers, he warned, should beware:
``We don't know where these drugs are manufactured. We don't know
if the people taking them have conditions that should preclude
them. We know nothing and neither does the public. No one is
watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind prescriptions is that certain drugs are
dangerous enough to warrant authorization from a doctor, a
``learned intermediary,'' in the lexicon of medicine. Typically,
once the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug for sale, it
is prescribed by doctors, who are licensed by state medical boards,
and dispensed by pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical
boards. But on the Internet, said William Hubbard, associate
commissioner for policy at the Food and Drug Administration, ``you
might as well just put drugs on the shelf down at the drugstore and
say, `Take your pick.'''
</P>
<P>
   Online prescribing is closely tied to another recent phenomenon:
the emergence of three new ``lifestyle drugs,'' medicines meant to
enhance quality of life, as opposed to curing disease. In addition
to Viagra, they are Propecia, the first pill to treat baldness, and
Xenical, a new diet pill. Yet other drugs are readily available
with a cyberdoctor's consultation. Among them are Celebrex, for
arthritis; Valtrex, for herpes; Claritin, for allergies, and Zyban,
an anti-smoking pill.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is a burgeoning black market on the
Internet, driven primarily by foreign companies selling everything
from infertility pills to antidepressants without even the pretense
of a doctor's orders. But beyond having Customs inspectors stop
those foreign shipments at the border, there is little the
authorities can do. So they are focusing on companies like
Performance Drugs, though whether they can rein them in is a matter
of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the politicians are going to be able to do
anything to us,'' said Bill Reeves, who runs Viapro.com, a
Phoenix-based Web site that sells Viagra. He reiterated a quote he
once heard: ``It's kind of like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about anyone with a credit card can buy medicine from sites
like Viapro.com. For a fee that typically ranges from $35 to $85,
patients receive an online medical consultation, which consists of
filling out a health history questionnaire. If the doctor approves,
the pills arrive in the mail, shipped either by a pharmacy or the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much business these sites do. But Reeves and
others say they have no shortage of customers, drawn by low prices,
convenience and, in the case of Viagra, the promise of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, is there any shortage of doctors. ``I probably
have 5,000 names of doctors who want to participate,'' said Bill
Stallknecht, co-owner of ThePillbox.com, based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Patients learn who their doctors are when the medication arrives
in the mail. State licensing investigators learn the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pasos, the few doctors who have been disciplined
include an Illinois psychiatrist who runs a holistic health center
and a Colorado doctor who supervises a cosmetic surgery clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Why they do it is anybody's guess. The Colorado doctor, Benjamin
Johnson, 32, said he thought the work was legitimate until
regulators disciplined him for unprofessional conduct. ``Maybe,''
he said, ``I got caught up in the excitement of being involved in
something cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leandro Pasos was not trying to be cutting edge, just hoping to
earn some extra cash. A 1954 graduate of Tulane University's
medical school, Pasos had practiced medicine for more than 40
years, both in this country and his native Nicaragua, when he
spotted the Performance Drugs ad. He was working just two hours a
week, documents from the Washington Medical Quality Assurance
Commission show, treating patients for lower-back pain at a
Seattle-area clinic.
</P>
<P>
   He sent in his resume, showed up for an interview and was hired
on June 16, 1998. His one-page contract made the work sound simple.
``Our automated review system,'' said the job description,
``enables the physician to review several patient charts at a
glance.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was short-lived. That summer, an investigator
for the Louisiana medical licensing authority bought Viagra by mail
from Performance Drugs, and tipped off the Washington Medical
Quality Assurance Commission when the pills came with Pasos' name
on the label.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, an investigator for the Kansas Board of Healing
Arts bought Viagra over the Internet from Performance Drugs. This
bottle, too, carried Pasos' name. The board obtained a court
injunction against the doctor, accusing him of practicing medicine
without a license in Kansas, and called its counterpart in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Pasos' career in Internet prescribing came to an end on Sept.
17, said his lawyer, Robert Beckerman. That was the day after the
commission wrote a letter to the doctor, asking him to meet with
its investigators. Not long afterward, Performance Drugs went out
of business, although its orders are now being handled by a new
company, Lifestyle USA, which operates out of the same office, a
fifth-floor suite in a building on the edge of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators met Pasos on Oct. 8, in Beckerman's office.
``I have never signed a prescription for Viagra, ever,'' Pasos
insisted at the outset, according to a transcript of the session.
Technically, that was correct. According to Pasos' contract, there
was no need to, because the dispensing pharmacy kept a copy of the
doctor's medical license on file. ``Orders are assumed approved,''
the contract said, ``unless otherwise notified by the physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pasos said he used discretion in considering the
medical questionnaires. Patients with heart conditions were
rejected for Viagra because it might be dangerous. As to how he
knew patients were telling the truth, he replied: ``I have to
assume you are telling the truth. Even if you come to my office,
you can tell me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasos did not know much about Performance Drugs. He told
investigators he did not know who wrote the medical questionnaire.
He did not know how many requests for prescriptions the company
handled. He did not know the names of the drugstores filling the
prescriptions. He did not talk to pharmacists with questions. ``I
would refer the calls to the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you comfortable doing this kind of work?'' the
investigators finally asked. ``Not so much,'' Pasos replied. ``I
had no choice. Without a job, I would be going on welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But the job did not turn out to be as lucrative as Pasos had
hoped. In the end, he said, he collected only $2,500 from
Performance Drugs, half a month's pay for three months of work.
</P>
<P>
   If the world of the cyberdoctor is perilous, so too is that of
the Internet pharmacist. Bill Stallknecht has managed to survive
it, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Stallknecht is a devoted Libertarian, and his political
philosophy informs his views about conducting medicine in
cyberspace. (Last year, he ran for Congress in Texas under the
party's banner, garnering 1 percent of the vote, he said.) He is
also a pharmacist, and has owned the Pill Box Pharmacy, a group of
five drugstores in the San Antonio area, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he took his business online, at the behest of a
brother-in-law who prepares Web sites. The idea at first was simply
to advertise. The pharmacy specializes in compounding, creating
special formulations of drugs not readily available. Among its
products, in that pre-Viagra era, was an injection therapy for
erectile dysfunction, a remedy Stallknecht promoted on his Web
site. By the time Viagra was approved, in March 1998, he was
swamped with requests for the drug. By last August, he was filling
100 to 200 electronic orders for Viagra a day. Around that time, he
said, he also established another Web site, Medicalcenter.net, to
recruit doctors willing to prescribe Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   He views with disdain the paternalism of the medical
establishment, which he says has an interest in trying to put
people like him out of business. ``Have you heard any patients
being unhappy?'' Stallknecht asks. ``All the power bases say, `We
don't want them cutting into our sacred cow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, ThePillbox.com sells four prescription drugs: Viagra;
Propecia, the baldness pill; Xenical, the diet drug; and Claritin,
the antihistamine. Each, Stallknecht maintains, is safe enough to
prescribe without a physical examination, a view the Food and Drug
Administration does not share.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugstores also operate online. CVS Corp., for instance,
recently purchased Soma.com, an online pharmacy that does not use
cyberdoctors. It verifies prescriptions with patients' doctors by
telephone, and is licensed in every state it ships drugs to.
ThePillbox.com, in contrast, is licensed only in Texas;
Stallknecht's position is that when patients visit his Internet
site, they ``actually come to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company fills only prescriptions written by Texas
doctors. Stallknecht would not say why, but if Texas doctors are
writing prescriptions for a Texas pharmacy, there is less chance of
running afoul of regulators in another state.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds as if Stallknecht is just one step ahead of the
law, he says, he is. He keeps meticulous records of every
prescription he fills, and comes to work every day expecting
investigators to walk through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under scrutiny all the time,'' he said. ``I tickle 50
states all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to build an electronic drugstore: just a
valid doctor's license, a relationship with a drug wholesaler, and
an American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, has been the experience of Eric Thom, vice
president of Confimed.com, an online pharmacy based in Seattle.
Confimed was founded last July, at the height of the Viagra craze,
by an obstetrician-gynecologist whom Thom described as ``an
entrepreneur.'' The company vice president agreed to describe the
process, but without using the name of the founding doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At Confimed, the doctor and drugstore are rolled into one;
Washington, like some other states, permits doctors to dispense
medicine. The doctor began, Thom said, by hiring a Web site
designer. Then, Thom said, ``he called his pharmaceutical
representative, gave them his American Express number, ordered
about 200 pills and started listing his site on some search
engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom sees nothing unethical in this. Confimed, he said, is not
gouging patients; its price for Viagra is $9.50 for a 50-milligram
pill and $11 for 100 milligrams. ``You would likely pay right in
that range at the neighborhood drugstore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Confimed site offered complete information about
Viagra's side effects and about who should not take the drug. And
Thom said he took great pains to design a patient questionnaire
that would be more thorough than any doctor's visit, using his
marketing experience to construct the questions in such a way that
patients would be forced to read them. ``We've taken precautions
every step of the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials in Washington state have not taken any action
against Confimed, said the company's lawyer, Jeffrey Johnson.
Kansas, which has moved aggressively against Internet pharmacies,
has obtained a court order preventing Confimed from doing business
there. Johnson said the company would seek to overturn the order in
court. Both he and Thom said they believed strongly that Confimed's
business is legitimate. ``We are trying to be the standard of
cyberconsultation,'' Thom said.
</P>
<P>
   The standard of cyberconsultation, said Dr. Nancy Dickey,
president of the American Medical Association, is an oxymoron;
there can be no standard, she maintains, when patient and doctor
are strangers. At its convention in Chicago on Thursday, the AMA
voted to develop model state legislation to limit Internet
prescribing, and urged that cyberdoctors be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not ethical,'' Dr. Dickey said. ``It is not good
quality medicine, and it would appear to be driven largely by a
desire to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which represents
state pharmaceutical licensing authorities, goes one step further.
``Any site that uses a questionnaire without a legitimate
patient-physician relationship, we consider illegal,'' said Carmen
Catizone, the board's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: Pharmacies can fill only valid prescriptions.
Prescriptions written by cyberdoctors, he says, are not valid.
Therefore, Catizone reasons, it is illegal for druggists to fill
them.
</P>
<P>
   To help guide consumers, the pharmacy association recently
developed its own seal of approval. Earlier this month, the group
began accepting applications from Internet drugstores that want to
carry the seal. So far, about a dozen have applied.
</P>
<P>
   But Klink, the Pennsylvania congressman, is skeptical. ``That
seal can be replicated and counterfeited,'' he said. ``Are they
willing to take responsibility for each and every product sold over
the Internet that they put their seal on?''
</P>
<P>
   Klink has asked the General Accounting Office to study Internet
drug sales, and is hoping Congress will hold hearings soon.
Meanwhile, federal and state regulators are trying to determine
their authority. In April, the Food and Drug Administration
convened a meeting of interested agencies. ``Nobody,'' Hubbard
said, ``has explicit total authority to take over this problem and
solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, which regulates drug manufacturing, has no jurisdiction
over how doctors prescribe the medicines it approves. The Drug
Enforcement Agency has control over the sale of narcotics. The
Federal Trade Commission, which can regulate advertising, might
play a role, but only if it can document deceptive or unfair trade
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Pfizer, the manufacturer of Viagra, filed a
complaint with the commission alleging that cyberdoctors are
deceiving consumers by ignoring the advice on the drug's label to
physically examine patients. Richard Cleland, an FTC lawyer, would
not say whether an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves understaffed state licensing authorities, who say
that Web sites are elusive targets. Cyberdoctors can be tracked
only in one way: by ordering drugs and seeing whose name is on the
prescription. Web sites appear and disappear overnight. And the
Internet is hardly a medium that can be reined in one state at a
time; even if every cyberdoctor in the United States were put out
of business, drugs would still be available from Web sites
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever try, as a kid, to take the sand and make a dike
to hold the ocean back?'' asked Mark Stafford, the lawyer for the
Kansas Board of Healing Arts who handled the civil suit against
Pasos. ``That's kind of what it's like.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Call it the Big Lie show.
</P>
<P>
   This summer season, it's about how Serbs have not lost control
of Kosovo, how the once-vilified NATO forces are merely carrying
out Slobodan Milosevic's policy of protecting Serbs from Albanian
terrorists, and how, despite the odd hiccup, things are going
pretty darned well in the Yugoslav province that Serbs regard as
their holy land.
</P>
<P>
   On the state-controlled television that Milosevic has used so
masterfully in the last decade, the evening news last week showed a
tranquil Serbian village in Kosovo where contented, secure farm
families were surrounded by lush crops, tidy haystacks and
trustworthy British soldiers, one of whom sweetly petted a village
dog.
</P>
<P>
   That same evening there was horrifying counterprogramming, but
only for the affluent sliver of the Serbian population that has
access to CNN and BBC on satellite television. Pictures of burning
Serbian villages in Kosovo, torched by vengeful Albanians, were
broadcast along with accounts of Serbs being shot to death and
fleeing by the tens of thousands from Kosovo into what is left of
Milosevic's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The production values shaping the show on Belgrade television go
back 12 years to the town of Kosovo Polje, where Milosevic, then an
obscure Communist bureaucrat, found his nationalist legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia does not exist without Kosovo! Yugoslavia would
disintegrate without Kosovo! Yugoslavia and Serbia are not going to
give up Kosovo!'' Milosevic declared in a speech that he made sure
was broadcast on television. That speech launched both his career
as a top politician and the cycle of violence that would obliterate
multiethnic Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Since reality, in the form of 21,000 heavily armed, NATO-led
troops who have effectively turned Kosovo into a foreign country,
has betrayed Milosevic's best-remembered and most fundamental
promise as a Serb leader, it appears to have been decided at the
highest levels in Belgrade that reality is not in the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo episodes of this season's Big Lie, like previous ``news''
programming during the Bosnian war about how mendacious Muslims in
Sarajevo were laying siege to themselves to get world sympathy, are
part of a pattern of mass deception that has characterized a decade
of Milosevic's nationalist wars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy that sells defeat as victory, ignores the
periodic floods of Serbian refugees flowing into Serbia from lost
war zones and leaves millions of Serbs in ignorance or confused
denial of human-rights atrocities committed in their name by
Milosevic's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Grisly evidence of Serbian atrocities in Kosovo that has been
broadcast around the world in the last two weeks has not reached
the majority of Serbs whose main source of information is state
television.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the privileged few who, thanks to satellite dishes,
have seen the pictures of rotting corpses being pulled from wells
or shallow graves, the images seem to prompt what Westerners regard
as counterintuitive reactions, somehow confirming that Serbs are
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little strange and proud people, and my opinion is
that nobody likes Serbs,'' said Angelina Arbutina, 32, a
well-traveled Belgrade basketball player who has starred on the
Yugoslav national team in the Olympics and European championships.
She says she flips back and forth in the evening between local and
satellite television, finding the truth somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is war, what happened in Kosovo,'' Ms. Arbutina said.
``If we killed Albanians, I'm sure the Albanians killed Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll published in Nin, a Belgrade newsmagazine,
about two-thirds of Serbs do not believe Western news accounts of
Serbian atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll, by Medium, a private firm, paints a picture of
Serbian public opinion that is nationalistic and misinformed. This
poll of 800 urban and rural Serbs, conducted in personal interviews
to avoid the demographic distortion that comes from telephone polls
in this poor country, found that nearly four out of five Serbs
support the peace agreement that ended the 10-week war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It also found, though, that only 14 percent support the
withdrawal of nearly all Serbian armed forces from Kosovo, and 80
percent said turning the province over to NATO peacekeepers was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story is very old in our public opinion polls,'' said
Srbobran Brankovic, polling director for Medium, referring to
popular misunderstanding about how lost wars in Croatia and Bosnia
were packaged for Serbs on state television. ``The pattern in state
media is to tell the people just those details that are convenient.
Our television says that we managed to keep Kosovo inside Serbia.
They never say how many Serb fighters were withdrawn or how many
Serbian refugees have fled. They just say that their security is
being secured by United Nations and Russian forces.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Friday that Serbs ``are going to have
to come out of denial'' about atrocities in Kosovo. He said that in
order to receive aid they would have to ``decide whether they think
it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed, and
all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their
homes, and all those little girls were raped and all those little
boys were murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about such Western demands, Brankovic said that, for
Serbs, they always backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know about the atrocities, and those who do
know are not feeling guilty,'' he said. ``Everything we get from
the West is pressure, pressure, pressure. It makes the people
homogenized. We have some growing anti-West feeling in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   This postwar season, though, as the pace of misleading images on
state television accelerates, there are a number of indications
that the credibility of Milosevic's television programming is
beginning to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Belgrade television's coverage of the conflicts in
Croatia and Bosnia, in which all the violence, destruction and
death occurred somewhere else, coverage of Milosevic's lost war
with NATO has to compete with what many Serbs can see and hear for
themselves.

<P>
   The Serbian leader's euphonious promises about quickly
rebuilding war-damaged bridges and factories do not square with the
hard-scrabble lives of many people, who are struggling with
gasoline shortages, soaring unemployment and collapsing foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television shows government ministers going throughout Serbia
talking about reconstruction, but everyone can see it is a joke and
that there is no money,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a senior research
fellow at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade and a
political adviser to the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic.

</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the 50,000 Serb refugees that
Yugoslav aid officials estimate have fled Kosovo and traveled north
to Serbia, a number that has never been mentioned on state
television. It reports, instead, that conditions are good for Serbs
to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent refugees from coming to the Serbian capital and
becoming a highly visible contradiction of state television news,
the police are stopping Kosovo's fleeing Serbs on the main highway
about 18 miles south of Belgrade. They direct them to smaller towns
in central Serbia. A similar diversion occurred when more than
250,000 Serbs fled Croatia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lack of money, too, is becoming increasingly hard to
hide. In recent days, hundreds of Yugoslav soldiers, some armed and
drunk, have blocked roads in central Serbia, demanding unpaid wages
and cursing Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   No details of these protests, which have reportedly blocked
roads near two major towns in central Serbia, have been mentioned
on state television. The police confiscated videotape used at the
barricades by local television in the town of Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   What television news focused on recently, instead, was how the
peace agreement in Kosovo had succeeded in fulfilling Milosevic's
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up heroic resistance, and we have risen above the
aggressor in every aspect of the struggle,'' Gorica Gajevic,
general secretary of the ruling Socialist People's Party, said in a
speech in the federal Parliament broadcast on the evening news.
Similarly, Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav prime minister, announced
on television that ``our country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty have been defended.''
</P>
<P>
   By claiming that Kosovo has not been lost, it appears that state
television has ventured beyond mendacious news broadcasting into a
realm of bad comedy. More than a dozen Serbs who were asked in
Belgrade last week about the claim smiled wanly and shook their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that on TV,'' Branislav Nakic, 36, a printer, said,
rolling his eyes. ``But nobody believes it.''

COMMENTARY: BEACH BLANKET LINGO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There must have been something interesting in that
Clinton yakathon. But every time the president was asked at his
Friday press conference why he is so polarizing, whether he is
responsible for coarsening the culture or if it bugs him to be
trashed by his vice president, he vanished into a nattering nimbus
of positivism.
</P>
<P>
   So let's not talk about Bill Clinton. He is SO over. Let's talk
about dirty magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring to Penthouse and Playboy. I have in mind the
wildly popular new macho men's magazines. One that is popular here,
Maxim, originated in Britain, where such magazines are known as
``laddie books.'' They are the kinds of magazines you used to see,
oil-stained, around your mechanic's shop.
</P>
<P>
   They are about cheesy babes, beer, bathroom humor and scoring
tips. Guys snap them up.
</P>
<P>
   What do men really want? Since Freud didn't ask this question,
it's left to me, in this season of beach reading, to pursue the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Art Cooper, editor of the stylish GQ, is bemused by what the
dumbed-down laddie books reveal about the state of mind of American
men at the turn of the century. Cooper edited Penthouse in the
mid-'70s, but never thought he'd see the mainstreaming of the
flesh-peddling two decades later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a reaction against political correctness,''
Cooper says. ``It's a reaction against the women's movement. It's
for guys who really want to be 14 again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the age of Adam Sandler and Mike Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Dennis, publisher of the raunchy Maxim, which recently had
a cover story on ``Squealers: what women say the morning after,''
says he wants to ``do for men what Cosmo has done for women. ...
It's own-up time for guys; it's OK to be a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his circulation, after only two years, is 950,000, which
is 225,000 more than the most popular upmarket men's magazine, GQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our core beliefs is that men are incapable of talking
to other men unless they are making jokes,'' the 52-year-old Dennis
says. ``Most men don't know how to react to women. The tide of
political correctness has reached proportions that are almost
sickening. Yesterday I held a door open for a woman. She turned to
me and asked if I could see she had arms. I told her, `You have
more arms than manners.'''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Dennis tell it, these new skin rags are an expression of
deep principle. But the truth is messier. The male-magazine buying
public seems eager to embrace simple-minded gender stereotypes.
Maxim's manifesto on the Web instructs women: ``If we see you in
the morning and at night, why call us at work?''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really make sense that these frat-boy mags are
thriving because men are confused and threatened by feminism, since
the women's mags have all gone retro and tarty too, preaching the
low-cut, high-heeled Cosmo girl attitude about trapping a man.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a new magazine called Cosmo Girl! intended to
train even younger girls in man-trapping techniques. The premier
edition of the magazine for girls 12 to 17 features Ben Affleck
stickers, articles like ``Reel Him In ... Learn How to Set Your
Bait'' and, naturally, the latest on alleged nude pictures of Leo.
</P>
<P>
   With formerly innocent women's magazines like Mademoiselle
filled with stories like ``Guys &AMP; Sex, What They Think About
Foreplay, Experienced Women and Lust vs. Love,'' both sides of the
drugstore aisle seem sex-addled.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim is already so popular it has spawned its own spinoff
called Stuff. The cover this month screams, ``Fast cars, hot sex,
cold beer.'' Of its Czech cover girl, the magazine drools, ``In or
out of her swimsuit, Daniela Pestova has the world's heat-seeking
missiles trained once again on the Eastern bloc.'' Among the
revelations in ``50 Things Women Don't Want You to Know'' is No.
46: ``If she tries to kill herself, she will probably botch the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Penthouse's Bob Guccione Jr. has gotten into the laddie-book act
_ surprise! _ with Gear. It features a sexily scowling Carrie Otis
in a bikini this month and redundantly proclaims itself ``The Sex
Issue.'' It offers stories like ``O Come, All Ye Unfaithful: why it
might actually be impossible for a man to be monogamous.''
</P>
<P>
   Vive la difference, but this is ridiculous.

COMMENTARY: AMERICA IS READY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the introduction to his book ``Making a Killing _
the Business of Guns in America,'' Tom Diaz writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1960, more than three-quarter of a million Americans
have died in firearm suicides, homicides, and unintentional
injuries. In 1995 alone, 35,957 Americans died by gunfire: 18,503
in firearm suicides, 15,835 in firearm homicides, 1,225 in
unintentional shootings, and 394 in firearm deaths of unknown
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiply those ghastly figures by three and you get the
approximate number of people treated in emergency rooms for
nonfatal gun wounds. Gun violence is one of the great American
pastimes. Children are far more familiar with its rituals than they
are with, say, the rules of baseball or football.
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half ago the House of Representatives, acting in
the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, had a chance to take a tiny
step toward reversing the pervasive slaughter of Americans by guns.
But the Republican majority, led by the likes of Tom DeLay, made
sure that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay contends that ``guns have little or nothing to do with
juvenile violence.''
</P>
<P>
   What did pass the House was a patently unconstitutional measure
allowing public schools to post the Ten Commandments on classroom
walls. No wonder someone cried out during the gun debate, ``This
House is in a state of denial.''
</P>
<P>
   A better idea was offered by Bill Bradley, the former senator
who is running a quixotic campaign for president. Bradley said that
if he makes it to the White House he will seek approval of a series
of gun-control measures that go beyond anything the House
considered in its debate.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a complete ban on the manufacture, sale,
distribution and possession of the cheap handguns known as
Saturday-night specials. He called for all handguns to be
registered and said potential gun owners should first be required
to pass a safety course and obtain a license. He said all gun
dealers should be banned from residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 750,000 Americans have been killed by guns since 1960,
and yet these common-sense proposals, long sought by staunch
advocates of gun control, are considered so radical they have no
chance of getting a serious hearing in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments yes, gun control no.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley denounced the National Rifle Association and the members
of the House who refused to consider meaningful gun-control
legislation. He suggested they were out of step with the majority
of Americans, especially those mothers who fear that their children
are endangered by the ``unregulated flow'' of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's about time to stand up to the NRA,'' said
Bradley. ``What I'm hearing out there is that there is this shift.
People think that regulating who can own a gun, and that means no
children and no felons, and regulating what guns are available, and
that means no assault weapons or Saturday-night specials, are
reasonable steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he also supports proposals to limit the purchase of
handguns by any one person anywhere in the country to one a month,
to require background checks at gun shows, to require trigger locks
on handguns and to substantially increase the license fees for gun
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination, is also a strong gun-control advocate,
although his proposals have not as yet been as far-reaching as
Bradley's. A spokesman for the vice president said a strong
pro-gun-control position would be spelled out by Gore this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a speech he delivered in California this month,
discussed the very real fear of violence that millions of American
students feel each day when they go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``A graduating (high school) senior today is less likely to have
tried drugs and alcohol than 20 years ago,'' he said. ``Today's
senior is less likely to get pregnant while still a teen and more
likely to believe in God. Our children are basically good children.
... So why is it so difficult in this country to have a rational
dialogue about reducing gun violence?''
</P>
<P>
   Ask the leaders of the NRA. And their stooges in the majority
party in Congress.

 &HT;    Atlanta's gay pride festivities reveal openness, resistance
 &HT;    By Jay Croft and Holly Crenshaw
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The banners hanging in downtown and Midtown are
simple: ``Celebrate,'' they proclaim over a rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   But celebrate what?
</P>
<P>
   In their first appearance, the banners meant to promote this
weekend's gay pride events also illustrate for some a key
contradiction of gay life in metro Atlanta, ``the city too busy to
hate'' in the heart of the Bible Belt: 300 flags fly, but not one
states what is being celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banners are a step in the right direction, but I wish they
mentioned `gay' or `lesbian' pride,'' said fitness trainer Warren
Thompson. ``I don't want to call it a cop-out, but I perceive it as
a way to not offend.''
</P>
<P>
   And that unintended dual message _ a recognition of what has
been achieved and the hurdles that remain _ will be drawn into
focus during Atlanta's pride festivities, which are expected to
draw 300,000 homosexuals and their supporters from around the
region. Even as they enjoy relative acceptance in one of the
nation's gay meccas, gay Atlantans face an unyielding resistance to
anything more than superficial progress, many activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates list Atlanta as having the third-highest
concentration of gays in the nation, behind only New York and San
Francisco. Although numbers and rankings are impossible to verify,
the gay and lesbian presence here is obvious. Homosexuals support
their own shops, bars and restaurants, visit gay doctors and auto
mechanics, exercise at gay gyms, worship openly in churches and
temples, read their own newspaper, and enjoy the neighborhoods they
helped revitalize _ most notably Midtown, as close to a ``gay
community'' as can be found anywhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 30 years into the gay rights movement, some community
leaders question whether pride events remain relevant or necessary,
especially in gay strongholds such as Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) says the festivities are
politically pointless in gay-friendly big cities but can still be
valuable in smaller towns like Tulsa, Okla., where he was grand
marshal for its first pride parade this month.
</P>
<P>
   But gays in Georgia can still be denied housing, lose custody of
their children or be fired from jobs simply because they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   And so, even in an accepting environment such as Atlanta, there
are major hurdles for gays and lesbians:
</P>
<P>
   _ The city of Atlanta has tried since 1993 to offer domestic
partner benefits for employees, but the state continues to fight
such a change in court.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bomb exploded at a lesbian nightclub two years ago, injuring
five people, and gays still fear violence and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia remains one of 10 states without a hate-crime law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anti-gay sentiment is often evident, from Cobb County's 1993
resolution condemning homosexuality to a Kirkwood minister's fear
last year of a ``homosexual takeover'' to the Southern Baptist
Convention's statements this month reasserting its opposition to
homosexuality. The convention also condemned President Clinton for
designating June as Gay Pride Month.
</P>
<P>
   All of these obstacles, and others, are good reasons to come
together in big numbers, some activists say. Glen Paul Freedman,
co-chairman of the Atlanta Pride Committee, emphasizes that pride
events create an atmosphere of solidarity and support, which can
inspire gays and lesbians to further political action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody takes little steps (toward coming out), and
attending pride helps them make those first steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movement is about more than recognition that we exist,''
added Jane Morrison, an attorney with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund. ``It's about equality, and that is why we need to
keep on marching.''
</P>
<P>
   And so today, spectators and supporters will flock to Peachtree
Street to watch the parade into Piedmont Park, and TV crews will be
poised to shoot footage for tonight's newscasts. About 170 groups
will ride on floats or march, including early gay rights pioneers
and the Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, who usually
garner the most applause. Perfectly sculpted gym boys will give way
to people of all shapes, sizes and colors, and to flamboyant drag
queens, leathermen and ``Dykes on Bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 people marched in the city's first gay-rights rally in
June 1970, with no media notice. That year, gays in five other U.S.
cities held similar events to mark the first anniversary of the
birth of the modern gay-rights movement, when police raided a
Greenwich Village, N.Y., gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and the
patrons _ tired of repeated, longtime harassment _ fought back,
igniting four days of riots and a new resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Salo, a graphic designer, was at some of Atlanta's earliest
gatherings, including the 1976 parade where he ``came out'' as a
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even back then, Atlanta was one of the places that people were
saying to go to if you were gay,'' said Salo, 47. ``Before, you
could easily move about in the gay subculture, but I had never seen
such an assembled, visible presence.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as May 1978, a story in The Atlanta Constitution noted
the impact of the city's growing gay population on ``almost every
facet of society _ politics, education, business, the media, the
arts.'' Still, some of the people quoted were afraid to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The newly visible gay community began to feel more assailed
starting in the late '70s _ by Anita Bryant, then AIDS, then the
religious right. As a result, more gays felt it necessary to come
out.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some gay leaders say their objectives have become so
diverse that it's no longer possible to concentrate on one goal.
Instead, activists are channeling energy into ensuring workplace
equality, the right to marry, insurance availability and other
everyday concerns that heterosexuals often take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very full plate of issues for people to deal with,''
said New York historian and author Eric Marcus. ``We've got a huge
menu.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all the gains and setbacks, pride events have grown _
often serving as a barometer of their time. Some years the events
were angry, others somber, and some were little more than
freewheeling street parties.
</P>
<P>
   Dilia Loe moved to Atlanta from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., last year
to run the Atlanta office of the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation, one of three national gay organizations with offices
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's pride celebration gives us a chance to celebrate our
culture and our civic milestones here,'' Loe said. ``But there will
be thousands of people who absolutely will not want to be in front
of the camera, and for some people, it takes all the courage they
can muster to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, gay men and women have been drawn to big cities
such as Atlanta for jobs and cultural opportunities, and to seek
the anonymity of a large gay population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, gay people have migrated here as a way of escaping
the scrutiny of small towns,'' said Atlanta City Councilwoman Cathy
Woolard, the first openly gay elected official in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the entire country, there may be some places
for gay people that are more comfortable than Atlanta,'' she said.
``But in the scheme of things, Atlanta rates right up there _ which
is not to say that we don't suffer prejudice in Atlanta or other
gay-friendly places, because it still exists everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I, as an openly gay city councilperson, feel it on a
somewhat regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other urban centers, Atlanta's gay development was a
byproduct of its broader, post-war growth _ with gays and lesbians
swept up in the general population boom.
</P>
<P>
   Dana White, an Emory University professor of Urban Studies, said
Atlanta's appeal to gays and lesbians also was accelerated by the
construction of Hartsfield International Airport, business leaders'
focus on economic expansion and positive public relations, the
city's civil rights legacy, and the counterculture of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a town that was developing, where you could make your
mark,'' said Phil McDonald, special assistant to Mayor Bill
Campbell. ``The city leadership created this climate where gay
people felt not like they would be accepted, but where they would
have an opportunity to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the doubled-sided nature of gay life in Atlanta
is played out in the political arena, with city officials often
taking a more progressive stance than state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted in 1986 to ban discrimination among its
workers, and in 1993 the city instituted a domestic-partner
registry _ but it is largely symbolic and carries no legal weight.
Campbell has appointed a 12-member advisory panel on gay issues,
and he signed an executive order requiring companies that do
business with the city to prohibit discrimination based on sexual
orientation. But enforcement requires someone to complain before a
company can lose a contract or have to begin diversity training _
neither of which has happened, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we take two steps forward and then slide back,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the starkest example is the city's 6-year-old attempt to
grant its employees domestic partner insurance benefits. The state
Supreme Court struck down the ordinance, then accepted a revised
version. But state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine refuses to
allow the city to change its policies to allow the coverage, saying
it would encourage illegal sexual relationships. All employers in
Georgia must gain Oxendine's approval, except those large enough to
self-insure.
</P>
<P>
   The city sued Oxendine over his ruling, and the case is ongoing
in Fulton County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the Pride festival or parade to change Oxendine's
_ or anyone else's _ mind about homosexuality or to put an end to
job discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the parade still pushes the envelope a little more,'' said
Thompson, the fitness trainer. ``It reminds straight people of the
sheer numbers. On the other hand, on some of the real big, serious
things, we still have a long way to go.

BEIJING OVERTURNS HONG KONG RULING ON IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a move that has profound implications for Hong
Kong's legal system, China on Saturday overturned, in effect, a
local court ruling that granted residency here to more than a
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by China's legislature to reinterpret provisions of
the Hong Kong constitution that were the basis of the ruling is
tantamount to overruling Hong Kong's highest court. And it marks
Beijing's most overt intervention in the affairs of this former
British colony since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While widely expected, the move elicited a torrent of protest
from lawyers and pro-democracy politicians here. They said it would
jeopardize the rule of law and the high degree of autonomy that
Hong Kong was promised in its transition from a crown colony of
Britain to a Chinese metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement issued by the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, Beijing declared that Hong Kong's Court
of Final Appeal had erred in its landmark ruling, which granted
residency to all children born in mainland China who have at least
one parent living in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision of the Court of Final Appeal is not consistent
with the Basic Law,'' said the official New China News Agency,
referring to the Beijing-drafted constitution that governs this
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's decree brings to an end a five-month drama that pitted
Hong Kong's British-style legal system against China's.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute laid bare the deep ambivalence that Hong Kong people
feel toward their mainland brethren. And it forced this
independent-minded enclave to face the reality that _ whatever the
niceties of the Sino-British agreement known as ``one country, two
systems'' _ Hong Kong is now part of a single country that will not
hesitate to assert its suzerainty, in matters legal or political.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does this set a precedent,'' said Margaret Ng, a
lawyer and member of the legislature here. ``It sanctions political
intervention in the judicial system in Hong Kong. It ushers in a
whole culture of mainland political figures criticizing and putting
pressure on Hong Kong courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters crowded around the government headquarters
on Saturday afternoon to protest the action. Several carried a huge
banner that said, ``Tung Chee-hwa ruins the rule of law, ruins Hong
Kong.'' Tung, a shipping magnate, is the chief executive of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Critics trained most of their fire on Tung rather than Beijing.
He asked the Chinese government to act because of fears that the
court decision would have inundated this already teeming city with
mainland immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's action also provoked concern from the United States,
which has kept a low profile on Hong Kong affairs since the
hand-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether the common-law system in Hong Kong will
maintain its integrity,'' said Richard Boucher, the U.S. consul
general. ``Our concern is that reinterpretation could become too
easy a precedent. It could undermine future cases and influence
future behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung denied that Hong Kong's legal system had been undermined.
While he said he had been reluctant to ask Beijing to insert itself
in Hong Kong's affairs, he did not rule out doing so again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to emphasize is that we have taken this course of
action because there were really no other alternatives, and it is
not something we would want to do in the future, if we can help
it,'' Tung said.

<P>
   Hong Kong's drama began last January when its court extended
residency rights to mainland Chinese children regardless of whether
their parents were Hong Kong residents before or after their birth.
That sweeping language threw open the doors to an estimated 1.6
million mainland Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The court managed to upset people on both sides of the border.
Mainland officials objected because they said the court was trying
to usurp the authority of China's legislature. Because the ruling
involved the movement of Chinese citizens between the mainland and
Hong Kong, Beijing said the court should have referred the case to
the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government, meanwhile, warned that the newcomers
would swamp this city of 6.8 million, swelling unemployment,
jamming schools and hospitals, and blighting the environment. Hong
Kong estimated the influx would cost $91 billion in additional
capital spending.
</P>
<P>
   With anti-immigrant sentiment running high, Hong Kong last month
asked Beijing to invoke the rarely used device of reinterpreting
the Basic Law. On Saturday the Chinese legislature responded by
limiting the right of residency to mainland children whose parents
were residents at the time of their birth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here estimated on Saturday that this would reduce the
eligible immigrants from 1.6 million to fewer than 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   While public support has been resolutely behind the government's
efforts to limit the entry of mainlanders, pro-democracy leaders
said Hong Kong would pay for its action by opening itself to future
meddling by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you break open a hole in the legal system for one group of
people, then nobody is safe,'' said Martin Lee, the leader of Hong
Kong's Democratic Party. ``Nobody knows how large this hole will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the critics were simply stubborn in
their refusal to adapt to life after the hand-over. ``You must
accept that there is a new constitutional order,'' said Elsie
Leung, the secretary of justice.

DELAYS MOUNT IN INDONESIA VOTE COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When former President Jimmy Carter came to
observe Indonesia's general election nearly three weeks ago, he
called it ``the most complex electoral system'' he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only the start of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Election Day on June 7, the counting of the 112 million
votes has slowed to a near halt, bogged down in a morass of
apparently unforeseen difficulties. A new, much extended deadline
of July 8 for the final result is described by some experts as
desperately over optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, voters have not exploded in frustration. Thorough
news coverage, generally restrained political parties and a daily
avalanche of partial results seem to have helped keep the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still see the process, despite its flaws, as
essentially honest,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, said Smita Notosusanto, who heads an electoral
monitoring group called Unfrel, ``People already know what the
result is going to be. PDI is the winner and Golkar is the
runner-up.'' She was referring to the projected results for the
Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle, headed by Megawati
Sukarnoputri, and the incumbent party of President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Press coverage has also made it clear to the voters that these
electoral results _ in the complex system to which Carter referred
_ are just the first of several steps in choosing a new president
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Voters cast ballots for just 462 seats in a partly appointed
700-member electoral assembly where power will ultimately be
determined by a combination of coalition-building and bare-knuckle
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Having cast their ballots, Indonesians are now simply spectators
as the vote is counted and as the process then moves through its
complex stages _ the convening of regional parliaments, then the
national Parliament, then the electoral assembly and finally the
all-important choice of president.
</P>
<P>
   But although Carter and others could see these complications
coming, few people imagined the tangle that the vote tabulators
have gotten themselves into.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials had confidently predicted that a semiofficial
``quick count,'' which has so far tallied fewer than 80 percent of
the votes, would be completed within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   An ``official count'' based on returns from the 27 provinces
formed by Indonesia's 13,000 islands had been delayed until this
week, and then delayed again by political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   The explanations for the delays would seem to test credibility,
but both foreign and Indonesian electoral analysts generally accept
them. Broadly, officials say, Indonesia has not had a free election
since 1955, and the new process is hobbled by inexperience,
incompetence and a flurry of mostly minor protests.
</P>
<P>
   There are a host of other problems: Vote tabulators who feel
they have not been paid enough refuse to forward their results. New
computers are used to send results by e-mail but the files cannot
be read by the system used in Jakarta. A herd of elephants
terrorizes a convoy of ox carts delivering ballot boxes in Lampung
province, forcing it to spend a night in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Sticklers are also causing problems, election officials and
outside analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem is the fastidiousness of election authorities, who
do not want the parties to come back and complain,'' a foreign
election expert said, ``and so they dot every `i' and cross every
`t.'''
</P>
<P>
   In one example, there seems to be an overly rigid observance of
a requirement that all poll watchers from the 48 contesting parties
sign off on local results. In many cases, the delays have meant
that these people are no longer available. In others, members of
small parties that were shut out in the vote are refusing to
endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a number of small parties feel very, very disillusioned
as a result of the outcome,'' said the election expert, who like
all foreigners monitoring this sensitive election spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a foreign expert said, election authorities appear
confused and slow in responding to thousands of protests, generally
involving allegations of local vote-buying and intimidation rather
than any systematic campaign to steal the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably what is happening is that the count is being put on
hold pending those decisions,'' this expert said. ``And
consequently you see things now in a state of suspended
animation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real power blocs, the half-dozen leading parties, have
been busy. Already, the next stage of the electoral process is in
full swing, with secret meetings and enigmatic public statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the scenes, the ritual mating dance is under way as the
bigger parties work on putting together some kind of
understanding,'' the Western diplomat said. Once the final count is
in, hard-nosed coalition-building can take place.

BUSH IS ON EASY STREET EARLY IN HIS CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two weeks have now passed since Gov. George W. Bush
first hit the campaign trail. His poll numbers keep getting better,
the crowds keep on coming, and the money keeps on rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot go on this way forever for the frontrunner for the
Republican nomination for president in 2000, or so conventional
wisdom holds. But for ``W,'' the trail moniker the governor of
Texas has picked up, it has been nothing but smooth sailing so far
in these first two weeks of his official candidacy, as he has
traveled to nine states, from the Midwest to New England to here in
Florida, to pitch his campaign message of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm some kind of fired up!'' Bush blurted on Friday at a
fund-raiser here on his first campaign stop in Florida, where his
younger brother, Jeb Bush, is the governor. In most of the polls
conducted after his first 10 days on the road, the Texas governor
continues to lead Vice President Al Gore by close to 15 percentage
points and has increased his lead over his nearest Republican
rival, Elizabeth Dole, to a formidable 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, polls indicate he now has more support among
GOP voters than all 11 of his Republican primary rivals have
combined. His opponents have been taking pot shots at him, calling
his ``compassionate conservatism'' a fuzzy, ill-defined notion that
tries to be too many things to too many people. But he continues to
pitch it, as he did here, telling a crowd of 500 or so supporters
in Miami:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a conservative mind and a compassionate heart. It is
conservative to cut tax rates and compassionate to help families
still left struggling. It is conservative to set high education
standards and hold kids to them and it is compassionate to see that
not one kid gets left behind. It is conservative to expect people
on welfare to find work but compassionate to encourage charity and
help those who really can't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jeffrey Manchester, a Miami business management consultant
who contributed $1,000 to hear the governor and pick at finger
food, that approach bespoke Republican moderation as much as
anything and had ``just the right balance,'' Manchester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says that education is just about the most important
issue facing this country today, and it pleases me no end that the
governor touched on that at the very start and then kept returning
to it,'' Manchester said. ``I liked what I heard. I have no problem
with being conservative and compassionate at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor had finished speaking and was working the crowd,
slapping backs, embracing and being embraced, now winking, now
posing for a souvenir picture, now whispering earnestly in an ear.
He had been introduced by his brother, Jeb, and the two of them had
mugged a bit at the podium about the family thing, the political
dynasty thing, as in Kennedys and Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   Would George W. get Manchester's vote? ``Let's see how he does
further down the road,'' Manchester said. ``Don't they all run into
some challenging difficulty sooner or later? I'll be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, one of the most respected Democratic pollsters,
said last week after running still another Bush survey that she was
``startled'' at how strongly Bush was suddenly running among women
and Hispanic voters, normally Democratic-leaning constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, too, is the number of Republican leaders who have
now climbed aboard the Bush bandwagon, many of them over the past
two weeks. He now has over half of the party's governors, senators
and members of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the money thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is so far ahead in fund raising _ he expects to top the $20
million mark by the end of this month and double that by primary
season next spring _ that he may forgo accepting federal matching
funds and the spending limits that come attached.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, on his sweep through Florida on Friday, in which he
touched down at Fort Myers, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, he
collected $2.5 million, campaign aides said. That is more money
than some of his rivals have collected in a full year of fund
raising. Randy Enwright, a Republican consultant who once was
executive director of the Florida Republican Party, predicted that
before Election 2000 is over, Bush will have raised more money in
Florida than all his rivals will combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take some of Al Gore's money, too,'' Enwright said,
suggesting that potential Gore donors might turn to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's campaign pitch has now settled into a predictable
format and rhythm, as usually happens with candidates. He offers
standard hot-button lines, well-tested jokes and themes centered
for the most part on tax cuts, better schools, a stronger military,
personal responsibility and stronger families and communities.
</P>
<P>
   But the themes are only broadly sketched. He promises details
later, once the themes are set, a promise that does not satisfy his
critics, who accuse him of on-the-one-hand/on-the-other-hand
waffling. What the Bush stump speech does not include are
hard-edged, head-on attacks on Gore, President Clinton and
Republican rivals. Sensitive and divisive issues like abortion and
affirmative action are relegated to the background, though Bush
says he is opposed to both, generally.
</P>
<P>
   Among his top priorities, Bush says, are tax cuts and an
increase in military spending. The cuts, he argues, would spur the
economy to even greater heights. The extra military spending is
needed, he says, because of the spread of international terrorism
and because more and more countries are developing missile
capabilities. He does not touch much on the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal. But when he does, by indirection, saying he would never
disgrace the dignity of the Oval Office, he draws his biggest
applause. One of his biggest laughs comes when he takes a sideswipe
at Gore for claiming to have helped invent the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore no more invented our current prosperity than I
invented the Internet,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own gaffes out on the trail, he has thus far
committed only a few of the kind that reporters and opponents
pounce on early in a campaign as indications that a candidate has a
lot to learn or may not be up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   There was that moment in the first day or so on the road when he
committed what is generally classified a political no-no. He
declared flatly that he would win the first big contest of Election
2000, the straw poll that Iowa's Republican Party has scheduled for
Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Having set the bar, he now must clear it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that interview in which he referred to the people
of Timor as ``Timoreans'' _ they are Timorese _ and that remark in
Richmond, Va., in which he confused Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly fatal stuff. Yet it forced him to confess that ``this is
a big world, and I've got a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But should I be fortunate to be elected,'' he quickly added,
``I'll be ready. I'll be ready to assume the office.''
</P>

<P>
   SPECTACLE ISLAND, Mass. _ An island just cannot get any more
down and out than Spectacle Island did.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the exact opposite of St. Tropez, or the anti-St.
Lucia. Imagine a hideous, stinking, toxin-leaking dump right in the
middle of Boston Harbor, which itself used to be compared to a
toilet, what with sewage and all. A 100-acre hellhole just three
miles out from Boston that no one was allowed to land on, and who
in the world would want to anyway?
</P>
<P>
   For some in this sorry life, though, there is redemption. For
people, for islands, even for whole harbors, given a great deal of
work and the right historical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of officials and advocates boated over to check on
Spectacle Island's progress on Friday _ and invited the first
reporter to land there since the island's transformation, they said
_ they surveyed a newly terraformed world still in the making, but
already easy to imagine as a park inviting enough to attract
tourists as planned, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Spiraling dirt roads led up a grassy, man-molded hill that
offered a 360-degree view of the harbor, once considered the
dirtiest in the United States and now, after a court-ordered
cleanup costing billions of dollars, redeemed enough that many
parts are swimmable and dolphins deign to visit.
</P>
<P>
   To one side lay Boston's lopsided skyline _ the two great
skyscrapers and the financial district cluster of smaller ones _
and to the other, the scattering of other harbor islands long so
little used that many Bostonians do not even know they exist.
</P>
<P>
   The public pier was partly finished, the man-made beach was
already washed with seaweed and spotted with jellyfish, and here
and there, roses and daisies bloomed, kept alive in these dry weeks
by water barged over from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   It gets better. Last week the U.S. Department of Transportation
announced a $1 million grant to make Spectacle Island a futuristic
land of zero-emission power. It will be powered by solar-energy
collectors, and offer visitors rides in electric cars and on an
electric boat and electric bicycles, becoming a kind of demo for a
post-fossil-fuel world, and a model for other national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be 200 years of trash piled here,'' said Sheila
Lynch, chairwoman of the Spectacle Island Park Advisory Committee
and director of the consortium overseeing the zero-emission grant,
as she trod a new road past saplings and rose bushes. ``To see it,
in 12 years, go from a very bad landfill to a zero-emission park is
like seeing a phoenix rising from the ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the serendipitous twist that turned Spectacle
Island's tale from woe to winning: None of this could have happened
without the $12 billion highway project known hereabouts as The Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   That big digging involves sinking the city's Central Artery
underground, along with adding a third tunnel to Logan Airport. All
that tunneling produced a lot of dirt, much of it contaminated.
Without a place to put all that dirt, the project could not have
gone forward. Meanwhile, the dumps on Spectacle Island needed to be
capped so they would stop leaking into the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short _ a story of more than a decade of
legal battles, politics, obtaining of permits, public pressure and
assorted city-state-federal struggles _ Spectacle Island ended up
getting about a third of the Big Dig dirt, more than 3 million
cubic yards of it. In return, the Big Dig builders were obligated
to provide ``mitigation'' services, from containing the old waste
to building a visitors' center, trails, beach and mussel habitat
area.
</P>
<P>
   All that piled and compacted dirt made the island grow about 60
feet upward to become the tallest point in the harbor. When it is
finished, planners say, Spectacle Island, which is co-owned by the
city and the state, will become a gateway point for the new
national park consisting of the harbor's 30 islands and peninsulas,
which include colorfully named spots like Hangman Island, Bumpkin
Island, Button Island and World's End.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are afoot to develop, gingerly, several of the islands,
and to vastly increase public access to them, turning them into
what one official described as a sort of poor man's Nantucket,
where city folk could take quick public ferries out to enjoy
seaside views, wind-surfing, nature education and the like.
Currently, only about 100,000 people a year ferry out to the
islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So change awaits several of the islands, but surely none will
embody as dramatic a turnaround, as telling a history, as
Spectacle, which was so named because its original form, two mounds
connected by a sand bar, resembled a pair of spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Long a summer gathering point for the Massachusetts Indian tribe
for which the state is named, it was used as pastureland in
colonial times; as a quarantine hospital site in the 18th century;
then as a resort spot that, by the mid-19th century, had gained
such ill repute for its gambling and dancing that the authorities
closed it down.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston businessman then installed a horse-rendering plant on
the island, and for years it absorbed thousands of Boston's equine
corpses. For much of the 20th century it was simply a dump, and
produced so much methane that in 1960, underground fires broke out
and smoldered there for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Defense Department, which had owned the
strategically located islands at the mouth of the harbor, sold
them, and most became part of a state park. But there was no money
to fix Spectacle until the Big Dig came along.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though still owned by the city and state, it is effectively
the ward of the kind of complex, interlocking, impeccably inclusive
public-private partnership typical of many 1990s projects.
</P>
<P>
   On the boat to the island were federal transportation and park
officials; state environmental and park officials; New England
Aquarium, Boston Edison and University of Massachusetts project
managers; environmentalists; members of advisory committees for
Spectacle Island and for the whole island park, and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was crowded on deck. But cheery.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Spectacle Island, said Brian MacDonald of the New
England Aquarium, ``is like the greatest story you can tell about
recovery.''

 &HT;    Fractured GOP in California poses challenges for Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush airlifts his presidential
dream to California this week, a state rich with opportunity but
fraught with political peril.
</P>
<P>
   Long before anyone casts a vote, California _ with more than 10
percent of the delegates needed to win the GOP presidential
nomination and about 20 percent of electoral votes needed to win
the White House _ is shaping up as a key 2000 battleground.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for Bush lies in a vote-rich Hispanic community
he has targeted and a cash-rich high-tech community that seems up
for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bush, and all GOP contenders, the California peril lies
in a fractured state party that is reeling from defeats. In the
nation's most populous state, Bush lacks the support of a
Republican governor. That's because last year, for the first time
in 16 years, Californians put a Democrat in their governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to turn this party around,'' said California GOP
Chairman John McGraw. ``We got a drubbing last year.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, who is remaining neutral in the presidential primary,
says Bush could be the guy to do it. At many of his campaign stops
in the past two weeks, Bush has claimed he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' he says frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where Republicans appear to have done about
everything they could to drive away Hispanic votes in recent years,
Bush backers are sure the Texas governor is the man to turn it
around. A recent Los Angeles Times poll showed him running away
from the GOP field, garnering support from 50 percent of those
surveyed. Elizabeth Dole was second at 13 percent. No other
Republican was in double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because everybody thinks he is the one. He's
going to lead us out of the desert,'' said Bush backer Allan
Peters, who has had no trouble attracting people and their
checkbooks to a Bush fund-raiser in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising, at least this week, will not be a problem for Bush
anywhere in California. He will raise about $2 million at seven
fund-raisers, a total that could push him over $20 million for the
first six months of the year, a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is an incredibly important state,'' Bush said. ``I
intend to take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to collecting money, Bush hopes to collect a lot of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to begin to introduce Governor Bush to
California,'' said Gerry Parsky, his California campaign manager.
``It's a huge state with a lot of diverse interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 California primary (which, thanks to efforts last
week by Bush backers, is a winner-take-all event) will be a battle
to lure voters aligned with a party in turmoil. GOP gubernatorial
nominee Dan Lungren, then the state's attorney general, was
trounced by Democrat Gray Davis by 20 points in November, ending 16
years of Republican governors in Reagan country.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP also lost legislative seats in a bad year blamed, in
part, on ex-Gov. Pete Wilson, who dried up the party's appeal to
moderates and Hispanics by backing ballot initiatives that cut off
welfare benefits for illegal immigrants and ended affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies part of the reason some Republicans see Bush, a
Spanish-speaking governor who shuns immigrant bashing (though fuzzy
on affirmative action and bilingual education), as the savior,
according to Peters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anybody else who supposedly can bring these
different people together. If they don't do that, you might as well
chalk up another loss for Republicans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky says the mission for Bush, in the wake of the GOP wipeout
in California last year, is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters of California viewed the Republican candidates as
extreme and as not inclusive and as not willing to reach out to
people and be concerned,'' he said, convinced that Bush has the
message to erase that image.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants to persuade Californians that he understands
what Parsky calls ``the new economy,'' lingo for the high-tech
industry. Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for the
Democratic nomination, was back in California last week trying to
tap into that sector. Gore has made 57 trips to California since
taking office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On one of those trips earlier this year, he was greeted by a
newspaper ad from high-tech leaders urging Bush to run for
president. Bush will cash in on that sentiment Thursday with a
fund-raising breakfast in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not the only GOP contender courting Californians. Five
showed up at the state GOP convention. Arizona Sen. John McCain,
who last week peeled off eight South Carolina lawmakers who had
urged Bush to run, currently is contacting GOP leaders, including
some who have signed on with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, already running ads on cable TV, will probably be
the only other Republican candidate with the money it takes to make
contact with California voters. If New Hampshire and Iowa are
retail states where voters expect hand-to-hand, eye-to-eye contact,
California is a wholesale state where politics, for many, is played
out on TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be watching,'' Tony Hammond, Forbes' California campaign
manager, said when asked if the billionaire publisher will begin an
ad blitz soon.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes last week previewed his angle of attack on Bush,
challenging Bush's claim to be a tax-cutter. The Texas governor
frequently tells audiences that he presided over the two largest
tax cuts in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is trotting out the list of 75 taxes Bush wanted to
increase as part of his 1997 property tax cut plan. The package,
which did not win legislative approval, included property tax cuts
which would have outweighed the increases.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush winds up with the nomination, he then must find a way to
carry a state that has strayed from the GOP side in presidential
races. The elder George Bush narrowly carried California in 1988,
but was trounced in California by Bill Clinton in 1992, picking up
only 33 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton throttled challenger Bob Dole in California by
51 percent to 38 percent, including a whopping 71 percent to 28
percent among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   With that defeat, coupled with the loss of the 1998
gubernatorial race, the California GOP has been suffering through
infighting. The conservatives prevailed, electing Santa Clara
businessman McGraw as chairman at a contentious February
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know that I have very strong convictions,'' McGraw
said in his victory speech. ``That does not mean and will not mean
in this party any intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, McGraw raised some concerns that he might not
offer the inclusive voice for which the party is looking.
</P>
<P>
   He told a Catholic newspaper that ``killing our babies (is the)
issue of the century. Compared to that, cutting taxes or any other
issue pales in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw now insists that is a personal message, not one he
wants the party to pitch. He understands what's at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very diverse state. Whomever the nominee is is going
to have to relate to very broad and diverse communities in
California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a community we want to revitalize here in
California,'' he said of Hispanics, targeting Bush as the man to do
it. ``He speaks Spanish. That's huge, huge.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dr. Leandro Pasos, 68, was struggling to make a
living when, about a year ago, an unusual advertisement in a
Seattle newspaper caught his eye. Doctors with active licenses, the
ad said, could earn up to $10,000 a month doing ``fully automated
online medical reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was placed by Performance Drugs Inc., a fledging company
that had set up shop on the Internet to market Viagra, the
diamond-shaped blue pill that offers millions of men the hope of
better sex through chemistry. The company had lined up pharmacies
in Miami and Las Vegas to ship the pills to patients. But it needed
doctors to write the prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   As an orthopedic surgeon, Pasos specialized in ailments of the
bones and joints, not impotence. Still, he signed up with
Performance Drugs. For a salary of $5,000 a month, he agreed to
review questionnaires submitted electronically by prospective
Viagra patients, authorizing prescriptions as he saw fit. As he
later explained to investigators, ``I needed a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Pasos join the ranks of a growing breed of physicians:
cyberdoctors. His patients were strangers to him; his examinations
took place in the facelessness of cyberspace. That got Pasos into
trouble with the Washington Medical Quality Assurance Commission,
which in May cited him for unprofessional conduct for prescribing
drugs to people he had not physically examined, and fined him $500.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pasos declined to be interviewed and his lawyer said no
patients had been harmed, the officials who put an end to his
career in online prescribing like to think his case will serve as a
warning. Yet their efforts have barely been noticed in the
flourishing electronic drug market, a new brand of commerce that is
raising questions of medical ethics and law.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, pharmacies are shipping pills across state lines
without the requisite licenses. Doctors are writing prescriptions
for people they have never met, a practice the American Medical
Association says is unethical, but not illegal. And nobody _ not
Congress, not the American Medical Association, not various federal
and state agencies _ knows quite how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strictly the Wild West of drug dealing via the
Internet,'' said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., who is pressing Congress to
hold hearings on the problem. Buyers, he warned, should beware:
``We don't know where these drugs are manufactured. We don't know
if the people taking them have conditions that should preclude
them. We know nothing and neither does the public. No one is
watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind prescriptions is that certain drugs are
dangerous enough to warrant authorization from a doctor. Typically,
once the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug for sale, it
is prescribed by doctors, who are licensed by state medical boards,
and dispensed by pharmacies licensed by state pharmaceutical
boards. But on the Internet, said William Hubbard, associate
commissioner for policy at the FDA, ``you might as well just put
drugs on the shelf down at the drugstore and say, `Take your
pick.'''
</P>
<P>
   Online prescribing is closely tied to another recent phenomenon:
the emergence of three new ``lifestyle drugs,'' medicines meant to
enhance quality of life, as opposed to curing disease. In addition
to Viagra, they are Propecia, the first pill to treat baldness, and
Xenical, a new diet pill. Yet other drugs are readily available
with a cyberdoctor's consultation. Among them are Celebrex, for
arthritis; Valtrex, for herpes; Claritin, for allergies, and Zyban,
an anti-smoking pill.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is a burgeoning black market on the
Internet, driven primarily by foreign companies selling everything
from infertility pills to antidepressants without even the pretense
of a doctor's orders. But beyond having Customs inspectors stop
those foreign shipments at the border, there is little the
authorities can do. So they are focusing on companies like
Performance Drugs, though whether they can rein them in is a matter
of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the politicians are going to be able to do
anything to us,'' said Bill Reeves, who runs Viapro.com, a
Phoenix-based Web site that sells Viagra. He reiterated a quote he
once heard: ``It's kind of like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about anyone with a credit card can buy medicine from sites
like Viapro.com. For a fee that typically ranges from $35 to $85,
patients receive an online medical consultation, which consists of
filling out a health history questionnaire. If the doctor approves,
the pills arrive in the mail, shipped either by a pharmacy or the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much business these sites do. But Reeves and
others say they have no shortage of customers, drawn by low prices,
convenience and, in the case of Viagra, the promise of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, is there any shortage of doctors. ``I probably
have 5,000 names of doctors who want to participate,'' said Bill
Stallknecht, co-owner of ThePillbox.com, based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Patients learn who their doctors are when the medication arrives
in the mail. State licensing investigators learn the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pasos, the few doctors who have been disciplined
include an Illinois psychiatrist who runs a holistic health center
and a Colorado doctor who supervises a cosmetic surgery clinic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pasos had practiced medicine for more than 40 years when he
spotted the Performance Drugs ad. He was working just two hours a
week, documents from the Washington Medical Quality Assurance
Commission show, treating patients for lower-back pain at a
Seattle-area clinic.
</P>
<P>
   He sent in his resume, showed up for an interview and was hired
on June 16, 1998. His one-page contract made the work sound simple.
``Our automated review system,'' said the job description,
``enables the physician to review several patient charts at a
glance.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was short-lived. That summer, an investigator
for the Louisiana medical licensing authority bought Viagra by mail
from Performance Drugs, and tipped off the Washington Medical
Quality Assurance Commission when the pills came with Pasos' name
on the label.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, an investigator for the Kansas Board of Healing
Arts bought Viagra over the Internet from Performance Drugs. This
bottle, too, carried Pasos' name. The board obtained a court
injunction against the doctor, accusing him of practicing medicine
without a license in Kansas, and called its counterpart in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Pasos' career in Internet prescribing came to an end on Sept.
17, said his lawyer, Robert Beckerman. That was the day after the
commission wrote a letter to the doctor, asking him to meet with
its investigators. Not long afterward, Performance Drugs went out
of business, although its orders are now being handled by a new
company, Lifestyle USA, which operates out of the same office in a
building on the edge of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators met Pasos on Oct. 8, in Beckerman's office.
``I have never signed a prescription for Viagra, ever,'' Pasos
insisted, according to a transcript of the session. Technically,
that was correct. According to Pasos' contract, there was no need
to, because the dispensing pharmacy kept a copy of the doctor's
medical license on file. ``Orders are assumed approved,'' the
contract said, ``unless otherwise notified by the physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pasos said he used discretion in considering the
medical questionnaires. Patients with heart conditions were
rejected for Viagra because it might be dangerous. As to how he
knew patients were telling the truth, he replied: ``I have to
assume you are telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   If the world of the cyberdoctor is perilous, so too is that of
the Internet pharmacist. Bill Stallknecht has managed to survive
it, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Stallknecht, 52, is a devoted Libertarian, and his political
philosophy informs his views about conducting medicine in
cyberspace. He is also a pharmacist, and has owned the Pill Box
Pharmacy, a group of five drugstores in the San Antonio area, since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he took his business online. The idea at first
was simply to advertise. The pharmacy specializes in compounding,
creating special formulations of drugs not readily available. Among
its products, in that pre-Viagra era, was an injection therapy for
erectile dysfunction, a remedy Stallknecht promoted on his Web
site. By the time Viagra was approved, in March 1998, he was
swamped with requests for the drug. By last August, he was filling
100 to 200 electronic orders for Viagra a day. Around that time, he
said, he also established another Web site, Medicalcenter.net, to
recruit doctors willing to prescribe Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   He views with disdain the paternalism of the medical
establishment, which he says has an interest in trying to put
people like him out of business. ``Have you heard any patients
being unhappy?'' Stallknecht asks. ``All the power bases say, `We
don't want them cutting into our sacred cow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, ThePillbox.com sells four prescription drugs: Viagra,
Propecia, Xenical and Claritin. Each, Stallknecht maintains, is
safe enough to prescribe without a physical examination, a view the
FDA does not share.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugstores also operate online. CVS Corp., for instance,
recently purchased Soma.com, an online pharmacy that does not use
cyberdoctors. It verifies prescriptions with patients' doctors by
telephone, and is licensed in every state it ships drugs to.
ThePillbox.com, in contrast, is licensed only in Texas.

CRIME ISSUE PAYS IN CRUCIAL GOVERNOR'S RACE IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ One week before gubernatorial elections in
Mexico's most populous state, several opinion polls indicate that
Arturo Montiel, the candidate of Mexico's governing party, has a
modest lead over his rivals in a race considered the final testing
ground before a presidential vote next year.
</P>
<P>
   The July 4 elections in the state of Mexico are being closely
watched because the state, which nearly surrounds Mexico City, has
11 million inhabitants and the country's most important
manufacturing center. And the central campaign issue _ crime and
how to combat it _ is one that is likely to define the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Gimenez, the pollster for the Mexico City magazine
Milenio, said that the three main parties are competing fiercely
because the state is the last major electoral test before the 2000
presidential elections. ``This is about momentum,'' he said. ``It's
the last election before the balloting next year in which the
parties can change the electoral status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Montiel, who resigned as party president to become the candidate
of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, was backed by 43 percent of potential voters in a poll
published on Friday in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma. The
candidate in second place, with 34 percent, was Jose Luis Duran,
who took a leave as the mayor of Naucalpan, a large Mexico City
suburb, to become the candidate of the center-right National Action
Party, the Reforma poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Higinio Martinez, the candidate of the center-left Party of the
Democratic Revolution, was in third place with 23 percent,
according to the Reforma poll.
</P>
<P>
   But Gimenez said he would publish a survey on Sunday showing
that the governing party and National Action candidates were tied,
with each backed by 39 percent of voters. The Democratic Revolution
candidate was backed by 22 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Campos, director of a Consulta, S.A., a polling firm that
will conduct a survey of voters leaving polling places on the day
of the vote for the Televisa television network, said he has
studied dozens of recent surveys in the state. He estimated that
Montiel had a steady lead of about six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mexico is one of the country's most diverse,
including a ring of vast, impoverished settlements like
Nezahualcoyotl, a bedroom suburb of Mexico City with a population
of nearly two million maids, bodyguards and other service workers.
It also holds extensive rural areas where farmers tend sheep and
cultivate corn and wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party has always controlled the state government,
but the two opposition parties have made rapid recent gains.
</P>
<P>
   All three candidates have sought to capitalize on public
distress over crime and police corruption, which are rampant
nationwide and which no party has battled successfully. Montiel, in
particular, has portrayed himself as a strongman who will crack
down on crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel M. Lund, director of Market and Opinion Research
International, a polling firm , said the governing party's main
strategy is to hand out gifts, including government benefits, to
persuade voters to back Montiel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody comes around and gives a family a bag of groceries or
milk, in the context of a commitment to vote,''Lund said. ``The PRI
also uses its control over state housing, street paving,
agricultural subsidies and scholarships, to leverage votes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll, Lund said, 38 percent of those surveyed said
they had accepted gifts or economic support in exchange for their
vote. Of the 34 percent who said they intended to vote for the
governing party, half said they would do so because of the economic
support, Lund said. The other half said they would vote for the
party even without the economic support, he said.

COLOMBIA ADJUSTS ECONOMIC FIGURES TO INCLUDE ITS DRUG CROPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Taking a step that is generating heated
criticism in Washington, the Colombian government has begun to
include income earned from growing illegal drugs in the way it
calculates the size of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The move is controversial but necessary, Colombian officials
say, to take account of the increasingly uncontrollable reality of
the drug trade, which by obviously imprecise assessments could
amount to between one one-quarter and one-third of Colombia's legal
exports, or as much as $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   By including revenues from narcotics in gross domestic product,
Colombian government economists say they hope to obtain a more
accurate measure of all economic activity in the country. Excluding
drug crops, they maintain, leads to distortions that hamper the
government's ability to effectively combat drug production and
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a purely technical exercise, not a political
measure,'' said Tomas Gonzalez Estrada, the chief economic adviser
to President Andres Pastrana, who has stepped up the war against
drugs here since taking office last August.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Washington, particularly congressional Republicans
who have criticized other Pastrana policies, have attacked the
decision as a capitulation to drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's antidrug chief,
earlier this month called the move ``a political error.'' In a
telephone interview from Washington, Robert Weiner, a spokesman for
the National Office of Drug Control Policy, said, ``They say it in
no way means an acceptance of or the legalization of drugs, but
they have not fully explained that position or gotten that message
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials here, though, respond that they are merely complying
with guidelines set by the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank for potential borrowers, and that other countries, such as
Bolivia, use the same system. Instructions prepared by the IMF,
World Bank and other international lenders clearly state that
``transactions involving the sale or purchase of illegal goods and
services must be recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian economy is suffering its worst recession in
decades, and the government is in talks with the IMF, without whose
bill of good health it would be difficult for Colombia to borrow
money from international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   The official recalculation could add as much as 1 percent to the
value of the deteriorating Colombian economy, which has gross
national product of nearly $80 billion a year. But Gonzalez
emphasized that ``we are not doing this to improve the performance
of the Colombian economy,'' but rather to ``have more effective
tools'' to design strategies such as crop substitution.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the new accounting system does not include the
much larger sums of money earned from the processing or trafficking
of cocaine, marijuana and heroin, only the growing of the raw
materials. Rene Verswyvel Villamizar, director of the National
Statistical Administrative Department, said that cultivation ``is
as far as we can go with certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the new statistics, drug crops added about 854
billion pesos to the Colombian economy in 1994, or just over $1
billion, calculated at the average exchange rate for that year. In
1995, the only other year for which figures are available, the
estimate slipped because of market conditions in the United States
to $762 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Recalculated figures for later years, which officials said may
be ready by the end of 1999, are likely to be significantly higher.
Official U.S. estimates indicate that the amount of land devoted to
cultivation of drug crops rose by more than one-quarter percent
last year, despite eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that Colombia exports about 772
tons of cocaine a year, growing and processing roughly half the
world supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are realists,'' Verswyvel said. ``We have to recognize that
narcotics and guerrillas exist, because they are a reality that we
cannot hide. We have to measure these things as they are, not as we
would like them to be.''

FROM WORLD'S RADIO ASTRONOMERS, A SIMPLE PLEA: SHHH!
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Scientists studying the heavens have long been bothered
by the more mundane activities of other earthlings. They have fled
to remote mountaintops to escape the light of the cities. They have
adjusted their radio instruments to cope with the growing avalanche
of television towers, cell phones, pagers, microwave ovens,
garage-door openers and the many other ground-based gadgets that
emit radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   But radio astronomers around the world say they cannot escape
the overhead ``pollution'' beamed down nonstop from the growing
fleet of communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   At observatories like Nancay Radioastronomy Station in France
and the famed Jodrell Bank in England, where pulsars were
discovered, astronomers complain that the enormously powerful
signals emitted by the low-orbit satellites are drowning out the
faint whispers coming from the universe. And these manmade
constellations, they complain, are increasingly invading the
frequencies assigned to radio astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites are a boon to communications companies and
customers, allowing people to make calls from mobile telephones,
send faxes or transmit data from anywhere in the world. A fleet of
66 such American satellites went into full operation late last
year. More will be launched by Europeans this year to provide
high-speed Internet linkups and many others are planned.
</P>
<P>
   To radio astronomers, all satellite systems are a nuisance, but
they say that the fast moving communications satellites, whizzing
around at just 420 miles above the earth and blanketing the planet
with their coverage, are threatening the survival of their field.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Paris this week, science ministers discussed the
creation of ``radio quiet zones'' where radio astronomers could
work. The new zones of several hundred square miles would be like
protected ``parks'' in different parts of the world where satellite
emissions or other broadcasts would be restricted or banned at
fixed times.
</P>
<P>
   Such quiet zones would be designated in remote parts of the
world with few customers so that satellite operators could turn off
their emissions and radio astronomers could set up their
instruments there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio telescopes are extremely sensitive and search for the
most subtle radio signals,'' said Michael Michalowski, a physicist
who attended the meeting. ``What's going on now is like a neighbor
turning on a boom box while you are listening for the sound of an
insect.''
</P>
<P>
   Among suitable candidates, which according to satellite records,
are still reasonably ``radio quiet,'' are regions of Australia,
China and South Africa. Harvey Butcher, director of the Netherlands
Foundation for Research in Astronomy, said it was vital to restrict
radio signals in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   China, which has plenty of open land, has already shown some
interest in having such a facility as part of its efforts to
improve its science activities, said Michalowski, who is secretary
of the Global Science Forum of the industrialized nations.
Australia, which is both active in radio astronomy and has the open
land, might also participate.

   ``It would probably require an international treaty to keep the
satellites quiet or get them to switch off,'' Michalowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists believe that, inevitably, the only place
where astronomical antennas can be free of interference would be
the far side of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The science ministers from the 29-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, meeting in Paris this week,
set up a task force to draw up stricter rules for co-existence
between radio astronomy and the telecommunications industry.
Astronomers in Europe and North America have long begged for
government help because they have little clout with the powerful
communications conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will bring together not only astronomers and
satellite operators but also government agencies that invest in
astronomy as well as the International Telecommunications Union,
the U.N. body that carves up the radio spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from studying the feasibility of creating ``quiet zones,''
the group will look at other options. One is changing regulations
for radio frequency bands, a complex process that might take at
least a decade. Another is to persuade operators to make future
satellites less invasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must insure a dialogue of all the stakeholders,'' said Dr.
Neal Lane, the White House adviser on science who attended the
meeting. ``We're confident we can reach an accommodation if
everybody gave a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some agreements already exist. Motorola Inc., which operates the
66 satellites of the new Iridium system that relay phone and paging
calls around the globe, has worked out accords for ``quiet time''
with American and European observatories. Iridium will reduce its
signals and cut back its interference during certain hours at
night. The agreements took nearly five years of often difficult
negotiations and pressure from European governments, which withheld
Iridium's operating licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now trying to stay below power levels during nonpeak
hours, usually from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.'' said Robert Edwards, a
spokesman for Motorola. ``Radio astronomers are in a band close to
ours, but we believe we can co-exist.'' Astronomers see the
agreements as a partial victory, but say that there is not enough
time-sharing and that they will fight to obtain legal limits on
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, radio astronomers fear problems ahead. They are
designing increasingly sensitive instruments to map stars and
galaxies as part of their quest to fathom the origin and the fate
of the universe. For example, the Very Large Baseline Array
includes dish antennas extending from the Pacific Ocean to the
Caribbean Sea, allowing astronomers to observe extremely fine
detail.
</P>
<P>
   One project under discussion is the so-called Square Kilometer
Radio Telescope, which would enable scientists to observe the birth
of galaxies. It would involve placing dishes over hundreds of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at the Westerbork Observatory in the Netherlands
said this project would be 100 times more sensitive than current
instruments and far more susceptible to human interference. Eight
institutes from six countries are already collaborating on the
design. It is this project that prompted the study to create
protected ``quiet zones.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the new task force set up this week, Lane said, ``the
dialogue will be spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building more and more sensitive instruments for
astronomers,'' he said, ``and maybe all we'll hear is your and my
family talking to each other.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every politician is a relentless self-salesman
every day in this city, reglossing the product even as it tarnishes
in the cutthroat marketplace of candidacy. Which is why Rep. Peter
King had a certain merry smile last week when he returned to the
House floor fresh from a high-profile radio interview about his
latest entry in the political hopper: a novel, not a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through here only once,'' King said, eyeing the buzzing
scene for fresh opportunity. ``These guys who focus-group
everything are missing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, some would say slyly, the Republican from Nassau
County, N.Y., has become a leading contrarian in the House
marketplace, notably withstanding the fury of Rep. Tom DeLay, the
Republican whip, to rise as one of only four Republicans who voted
against all four impeachment articles brought against President
Clinton by the GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, King, as an Irish-American contrarian of sorts,
became the chief Republican point man at the side of Clinton in
shepherding Northern Irish nationalist politicians to full
partnership in the new Irish peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel with this stuff you can't get hurt,'' King said
of American politics, describing DeLay as plenty tough but hardly
as lethal as the Irish political assassins he came to know, and now
to novelize, from his visits to the Troubles as a young politician.
``I mean, no one is shooting real bullets in this business on our
side of the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this observation rests King's novel _ ``Terrible
Beauty'' (Roberts Rinehart), a narrative of the violent years of
politics in Belfast, Northern Ireland _ as well as still another
contrarian initiative.
</P>
<P>
   This is his self-promotion as a possible added candidate in the
Senate race shaping up in New York between Hillary Rodham Clinton
and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The many doubters of
King's chances in such a contest have nevertheless heard him
discussing it lately in book-show interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great: two championship fights, center stage,''
King said enthusiastically at the idea of challenging the first
lady after a primary run at Giuliani, whom he first encountered
over three decades ago when both were young lawyers in Richard
Nixon's Wall Street law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy was a Democrat back then, and very liberal to the point
of admiring Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael,'' King said, grinning
as he imagined what he might make of those ``black power''
agitators among conservative voters in the Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of what shows today _ Rudy's dark side _ was clear
then, too. He'd suddenly erupt at lunch with the guys over
something casual someone said about baseball or something. It was
`You're a liar!' and making the guy back down.''
</P>
<P>
   King thinks he knows how to get under the skin of Giuliani well
enough to win. Then he would challenge Mrs. Clinton as ``too
liberal for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd run slightly right of center for the working middle-class
vote,'' he said. ``You know, people who don't sit around and
complain about their psychological hangups or the fact that they
may have had a father who drank,'' added the 55-year-old
conservative, dedicated to stamping out from politics all talk of
``reform'' and ``victimization.''
</P>
<P>
   He will decide about a Senate bid by mid-August, King said,
fully mindful that he would have to raise several million dollars
as ante to compete next year in the primary. ``I'd pretty much have
to turn into a cash register.''
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty for him right now, King acknowledges, is that,
precisely as he hoped, the Senate talk, with all his anecdotes of
Rudy the young radical, is galvanizing his book-flacking interviews
on radio and television. ``About a third of my National Public
Radio interview was about the Senate race,'' the congressman said
gratefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confluence of two great endeavors,'' King declared, laughing
at the varied ways a politician can feed the beast of
self-promotion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The book promotion has crimped King's treasured evening meals at
The Dubliner, a pub near the Capitol. But he is uncomplaining about
being saluted at the Irish Embassy on Monday night as a novelist
and statesman. He says the fact that he worked the Belfast crowds
with Clinton and came to admire the president as a stand-up
politician on the Irish issue was not a factor in his vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I hated the guy, I thought these charges were not
impeachable,'' the congressman said. ``The fact that I had seen him
up close making tough decisions helped me keep my perspective.
We're talking about a person who is not all bad or all good _ a
real human being.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment was not the first time King resisted the
Republican marching drum. At St. Francis College in New York, he
wrote a thesis defending the record of Mayor Jimmy Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably did everything he was accused of,'' he said of the
corruption charges at Walker's City Hall. ``But nothing was ever
actually proven. There was no malice in the guy, and he kept the
city's spirits moving during the Depression,'' said King, who grew
up as the son of a police detective in New York City before joining
the Irish-American diaspora to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``How lucky it is to be here in Congress,'' said King, happily
flogging book and candidacy, exulting all the while in the daily
demands of political self-salesmanship.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A very humid air mass will stifle the Deep South, Middle
Atlantic and Ohio Valley states on Sunday, providing ample moisture
to fuel clusters of showers and thunderstorms. Though thunderstorms
are possible anywhere within this region, there will be several
favored areas for storms to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms with locally heavy rains will flare across parts
of the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians as a slow-moving
jet-stream disturbance lifts increasingly humid air near the
surface. Thunderstorms will also rumble across parts of Virginia
and the eastern Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, clusters of thunderstorms, some with heavy rain,
will develop from the southern Appalachians to Mississippi, where
very humid Gulf air is forced to rise on the southern flank of the
Ohio Valley disturbance. Meanwhile, clusters of heavy thunderstorms
will erupt near the sultry Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida as the
leading edge of developing sea breezes wedges under and lifts humid
air over land.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain and
a few with severe weather, will erupt from the central Plains to
the upper Mississippi Valley as a jet-stream disturbance emerging
from the Rockies lifts humid air streaming north from the Gulf of
Mexico. Later Sunday, isolated severe storms are also possible from
southeast Wyoming and eastern Colorado to the high plains of west
Texas and eastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy fog will dull parts of southeast New England and Long
Island, N.Y., on Sunday morning before yielding to sunny, warm and
humid weather.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hit or Miss
</P>
<P>
   The nature of showers and thunderstorms in the summer is hit or
miss. Whether forecasters use words such as ``isolated'' or
``scattered,'' the message is clear: Some areas will receive rain
and some will not. The general lack of expansive areas of rain in
summer is a consequence of a dearth of expansive low-pressure
systems, which owe their wet girth to the large north-south
temperature contrasts of late autumn, winter and early spring. In
summer, the heating power of the sun lessens these contrasts,
setting the stage for a random bubbling up of hit-or-miss showers.

 &HT;    Ex-Hawk continues basketball camp for hearing impaired
 &HT;    By Carlos Frias
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask Mike Glenn what it means to be a hero, and he can
answer with one name, ``Mildred Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   As an athletic teen-ager, Nelson made a 5-year-old Glenn want to
grow up to be pro basketball player. That she was deaf only
inspired him more. Glenn, a former NBA player and current Hawks
telecaster, recalls working with his father, Charles, girls
basketball coach for 18 years at the Georgia School for the Deaf in
Cave Spring. With the city's population less than 2,000 at the
time, everyone in town had some link to the school.
</P>
<P>
   When his father's players weren't pinching his cheeks, Glenn
would watch his father develop the team into one of the nation's
top squads of deaf players, and Nelson into one of the top female
deaf players ever.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson soon made Glenn her favorite. She taught him to dribble
and shoot, which became his strengths in the NBA, including four
years with the Hawks. But first, she taught him to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was 6, Glenn was fluent in American Sign Language and
able to cheer for his favorite player by raising his arms and
shaking his hands, the sign language equivalent of clapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my first hero,'' he said smiling, remembering her
shooting prowess and brilliant smile. ``She kinda started teaching
me, and I'd sit down during the games and clap for her. I, like
everybody else, was clapping and like, `Give the ball to Mildred.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the hook that got me into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, one can ask any of the 81 children who attended last
week's 20th annual Mike Glenn Basketball Camp for the Hearing
Impaired and many can point to Glenn as their hero.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 43, still puts on the weeklong, nonprofit camp he started
while he was with the Knicks in 1980 and has continued in Atlanta
for the past 18 years. It has become one of the foremost camps for
youths of high school age with hearing disabilities, and the only
free one. Sponsors provide everything.
</P>
<P>
   This year's camp finished Friday with 12 of the top boys and
girls playing against Atlanta all-star teams of nondeaf children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (deaf) kids, when they got to other camps, they felt
left out, and I wanted to let them feel included,'' he said. ``It
greatly improves a kid's self-esteem, and it overall helps bridge
the gap that has existed so long.''
</P>
<P>
   When he visited the Millnech School for the Deaf in New York in
1980, many of the kids in the stands expected Glenn, a player for
the Knicks at the time, just to smile and wave. Then, he started
signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started signing, and the place was just a silent hush; their
eyes were wide open, their mouths were hanging down,'' he
remembers. ``They just embraced me after that.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer, with his own money, he put on the first camp at
Millnech. It started as a six-hour day camp with 35 players _ and a
team of coaches that consisted of Glenn and former teammates Marvin
Webster, Joe Meriweather and Micheal Ray Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was repaying a debt of gratitude, and this camp is
an extension of what is comfortable for me, of what is happiness
for me,'' Glenn said. ``It's so connected to me, that it's almost
inseparable.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, professionals like Hawks guard Steve Smith and
Vancouver Grizzlies forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim have visited the
camp. A handful of volunteer coaches, who use a week's worth of
their vacation time in the summer, have run the camp since its
inception 18 years ago and work to keep the sponsorships and a
group of 80 to 100 kids coming each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to it every year; it's like a family reunion,''
said Reggie Johnson, 38, Glenn's oldest friend from Cave Spring,
who helped start the camp. ``We've worked hard, real hard, but it's
all been so rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   The real reward goes to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up around hearing people, I felt I had to prove
myself all the time,'' Nathaniel LaRue, of the Katzenbach (N.J.)
School for the Deaf, said through an interpreter. ``Here, we're all
equal, so you have to prove yourself athletically, but you don't
have to prove yourself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Glenn introduced ``reverse mainstreaming,'' in
which eight to 10 nondeaf players are invited. They learn quickly
that many of their deaf teammates are talented ball players who act
just like other teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the deaf an opportunity to experience challenges with
kids from different states and with some hearing kids,'' said
Willie Brown, a Georgia State graduate and the program's greatest
success as the first deaf basketball player with a Division I
scholarship. ``At the same time, the hearing kid gets to see a deaf
kid compete at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn looks forward to the day when a second-generation camper
comes through the program and plays alongside his son, Michael
Justin, 6, who once knew more signs than spoken words. Maybe, Glenn
hopes, his son already has a hero, like the one his father did
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud when I see him sign; he's so comfortable, and I
see he's learned some of those lessons,'' Glenn said. ``I like the
mission that this camp has accomplished.

 &HT;    NBA draft casualties join earlier
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NBA and superagent David Falk have been
adversaries at times, allies at others. Underclassmen bolting
college to the NBA is one issue they agree on: Something must be
done to prevent the mass defection of underdeveloped talent to a
man's league.
</P>
<P>
   The way Falk sees it, much of the problem can be solved by
executing laws already in effect. Nearly half the states in the
nation have some sort of law regulating what agents can do with
college or high school kids, Falk says. In North Carolina, it's a
felony for an agent to have contact with a student-athlete without
first giving written notification to the applicable college
athletics director or high school principal, the Charlotte Observer
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws almost never are enforced. And so, athletes that
still have college eligibility are receiving and heeding misguided
advice, according to Falk. ``Economic suicide'' is what Falk calls
the players who skip to the NBA too soon. Falk represents many
players who left school early, including Duke's Elton Brand. But he
insists that he never recommends they leave before their
eligibility is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are getting such poor advice,'' Falk says. ``We
all watched (high school player) Rashard Lewis sit at the draft
last year and cry as he slid into the second round.... I doubt
anyone advised him he'd go in the second round. Or Al Harrington,
who went 25th to Indiana. Had he gone to school for one year he
probably would have been top 10 this year. That decision might cost
him $5 million to $10 million'' over his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, we need more disasters,'' he says, ``because no one
wants to acknowledge that advising players is a specialized
business. You need disasters to warn players this is a very serious
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has seen its product decline in recent years because of
the influx of players coming into the league who have not been
refined in the game. Flash is up, scoring down. And commissioner
David Stern has put it on his agenda to somehow put an age
requirement on potential draftees. That would all but eliminate the
high school player but not prevent athletes from playing one season
before bolting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right to set an age limit in the
collective-bargaining agreement,'' Stern said. ``I believe we can
work together to come up with something that is legally correct and
will withstand legal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island sophomore star Lamar Odom, who declared himself
eligible for Wednesday's draft and hired an agent, does not seem to
have much legal ground in his attempt to return to the school.
Odom, 19, fired lawyer Jeff Klein and decided he did not want to go
pro yet, but he relinquished his amateur status when he hired
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not filed a formal appeal, Odom wants the NCAA
to allow him to retain his two years of eligibility. Meanwhile, NBA
Players Association executive director Billy Hunter contended that
Odom should be allowed to return to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfortunate if this young man was compelled to
begin his NBA career before he believes he is ready,'' Hunter said.
``If, indeed, Lamar has determined that it is in his best interest
to continue to mature as an individual and as an athlete in a
college environment, we sincerely hope he will have that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft had 38 early-entry players, going into the weekend.
Most NBA personnel officials say they think that fewer than half of
them will get drafted. The Philadelphia Daily News did a study that
pointed out almost none of the undrafted players go back to
college. And in the last five years, only 81 of 148 hopefuls were
drafted, and just 51 of the 81 who were drafted are still in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of numbers will continue to be that way with the
way things are going,'' Vancouver president Stu Jackson said.
``It's a cycle that we have to do something about.

IN FRAY OVER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, 3 LOS ANGELES COMMISSIONERS
RESIGN  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The struggle between the nation's cable television
operators and Internet service providers over high-speed access to
cyberspace has roiled city politics in Los Angeles, where three
commissioners have resigned during debate on policy over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has become another battleground for control over
``broadband'' Internet access through cable modems that can offer
service up to 100 times faster than a standard telephone line as
cities have been forced to deal with the issue in the face of
conflicting messages from the federal government. Cable companies,
led by AT&AMP;T through its acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc.,
are increasingly offering high-speed Internet access, through
service providers with which they are allied; rivals like America
Online say the cable companies should be forced to allow consumers
a choice of providers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has split City Hall and brought about a rare public
controversy. Mayor Richard Riordan gave his support to the cable
companies, while a majority of his appointees on the Board of
Information Technology Commissioners favored a policy requiring
so-called open access for competitors. Rather than cast a vote
against the mayor, the three commissioners on the five-member board
resigned last week, leaving the panel without a quorum. Now, as
city leaders struggle with the question of corporate market share
versus consumer interest, the way to create that policy has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, you don't see such clear disagreements between the
mayor and the commissions that are resolved with such public
resignations,'' said Tracy Westen, a member of the commission
during the Bradley administration who is creating an Internet
platform called the Democracy Network to sponsor exchanges between
political candidates and voters. ``Typically they either go along
or negotiate it out or resign more quietly, but this has sort of
gained a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been no less controversial for other cities around
the nation trying to figure out how, or whether, to step into the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has required that cable companies let competitors use
their broadband Internet access, a position upheld this month in a
U.S. District Court ruling. In San Francisco this week, city
officials rejected a plan allowing cable companies to exclude
competitors, and ordered a policy to allow competition. But William
Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
declared on June 16 that the issue should be regulated by federal
authorities and not left to the tens of thousands of local
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict which has also brought an aggressive lobbying
campaign often unseen at the local level. In seeking approval of
its franchise transfer to AT&AMP;T, Tele-Communications paid lobbying
companies more than $130,000 to represent it, according to city
records; American Online and AT&AMP;T have retained two firms each.
City staff members trying to draft policy on the issue have
received hundreds of documents.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a ``full-employment act for lobbyists,''
said Mark Ridley-Thomas, a City Councilman whose technology
committee has taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, the mayor and his senior staff
members concluded that the city should not intervene right now,
said Kelly Martin, the mayor's chief of staff. The mayor's office
believes that the access should be regulated by the federal
government, she said, and is concerned that requiring access could
inhibit investment in the technology. A city report recommended a
policy that allowed cable operators to exclude Internet companies
from providing direct broadband service for the moment, but
included ``re-opener'' clauses allowing the city to review the
situation if the market became monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Information Technology Commissioners was expected
to vote on June 21 on a non-binding recommendation to the City
Council on the report.
</P>
<P>
   One commissioner who resigned, Robert Duggan, said he thought
open access of some form was important and resented the pressure he
said he felt to support the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ```If you can't support it, you should go away quietly,''' he
said he was told. `` `You work for the mayor, he's appointed you,
and you're going to embarrass him if you can't come out for the
position. So if you can't support him, why don't you just
resign?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin said no pressure was exerted on the commissioners,
either from the mayor's Office or through third parties, to change
their position or resign.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said politics often involved maneuvering and
dealing that the public never saw, but that the resignation of
three commissioners put this dispute on another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it causes the usual behind-the-scenes machinations to
be put on Front Street,'' he said.

 &HT;    Callaway led golf's charge out of the woods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While newcomers to golf probably will not believe it,
there really was a time when woods were wood. It was a period of
great ugliness in the game. Imagine, a club face with all the
explosiveness of an end table, a mis-hit ball that barely went
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Feel fortunate you weren't a part of such hackdom.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange native Ely Callaway changed all that, of course. His
company, Callaway Golf, wasn't the first to manufacture a metal
wood, but it definitely began the high-tech, oversized driver
explosion _ from $22 million in sales in 1990 to $842 million in
1997 _ and remains king of the market today.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bertha to Great Big Bertha to Biggest Big Bertha. Golf was
never the same after this charming but feisty man, now 80 years
old, began what became the oversized titanium driver revolution. It
has grown to include fairway woods and irons, but the love affair
with the longest club started with Big Bertha in 1991. Named after
a World War I cannon, the club, despite its expense, became the
``gotta-have-it'' item for millions of worldwide amateurs and pros.
Although Callaway's share of the market has been reduced by the
avalanche of competitors who followed him into the market, the Big
Bertha driver has become the golfer's friendliest item since the
beverage cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's graduated from being the least popular club in the bag to
being the most popular for most golfers,'' Callaway said in a
recent telephone interview. ``We do feel very proud of that, and
we're very glad that it has happened, because it fundamentally
changed an attitude toward a golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who believes that loyalty and character are nearly as
vital as one's heart and lungs, Callaway left Burlington Industries
after nearly 30 years in the textile business in a dispute about a
chairmanship he thought should have been his.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship he establishes with both employees and those
who endorse his clubs is as special as the feel of high-tech metal
meeting balata. At the Carlsbad, Calif., manufacturing and testing
facility, everyone eats in the same dining room, whether it's
Callaway, Big Bertha design guru Dick Helmstetter or the workers
who pull the molten, metal molds from the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   The man's energy and optimism are inspiring. But what would you
expect from a fellow who turned a small-market company called
Hickory Stick, which made specialty wedges and putters, into the
golf's all-time equipment story? Larry Dorman, who was hired to
write a book on Callaway when Dorman was golf writer for the New
York Times, was so intrigued by the man that he left journalism to
serve as Callaway's vice president of advertising, press and public
relations. Smitten by Dorman's personality, professional skills and
contacts, Callaway made him an offer he couldn't refuse, tripling
his newspaper salary.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger, who won a PGA Championship in 1993, then fought
for his life against cancer, won't forget that Callaway paid him in
full during the entire year he was unable to play while undergoing
chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When Callaway took on
troublesome John Daly in 1997, who was dropped by Wilson after his
alcohol-related problems, it absorbed several hundred thousand
dollars of Daly's gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Azinger attended Callaway's 75th birthday party,
despite being ``as bald-headed as a cue ball, with the bandana and
a coat and tie.'' Callaway also made a large donation to the
American Cancer Society in Azinger's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves me and I love him,'' Azinger said. ``I think the
world of the guy. I feel a tremendous amount of loyalty to Callaway
Golf because of `Mr. C.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Callaway hasn't lived in Georgia regularly since
graduating from Emory University in 1940, he returns to the area
frequently and has made a major impact on Atlanta _ and not just
from area tee boxes. In 1993, he gave Emory Callaway stock worth
more than $5.8 million that was used to renovate the university's
physics building, since renamed The Loula Walker and Ely Reeves
Callaway Sr. Memorial Center, in honor of his parents. Among his
other regular contributions to Emory is a percentage of sales from
the Bobby Jones commemorative clubs in the form of a Robert T.
Jones Jr. Scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father taught me that it's better to give than
receive,'' Callaway said. ``And if you've got it and can be
helpful, that's nice. I think it's a whole lot to enjoy giving
while you're alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is a distant cousin of Jones; they share a common
great-grandparent. He likes to imagine what might have transpired
had a Great Big Bertha been available for the legendary player from
East Lake Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have made him perfect,'' Callaway says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   His delightful accent always will connect him to the South, even
if the miles and the workload since reclaiming his CEO position
last year do not allow it. He was back at Callaway Gardens in Pine
Mountain this spring for a dedication of the Callaway Brothers
Azalea Bowl at the resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still connected there, but the connections are becoming
fewer by the month, because time is passing, and people move on and
sometimes even die,'' Callaway said. ``But I have many cousins
there on the side of Cason and Fuller Callaway (the brothers who
founded the Callaway Gardens resort). I hope they still admit I'm
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A former chairman of the National United Negro College Fund
Corporate Campaign, Callaway on one occasion in 1970 would not
allow impending surgery to interrupt his plans. Just before a major
fund-raising luncheon in Atlanta, he was stricken with an illness.
Vernon Jordan, then the executive director of the UNCF, said ``In
excruciating pain, he was rushed to the emergency room of a local
hospital. During the preparation for surgery, Ely arranged to tape
his speech to the luncheon.... We raised the largest amount in the
history of the UNCF that year _ $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   A 3-handicap player in his 40s _ Azinger still calls him ``a
beautiful swinger of the golf club'' _ Callaway basically has
sacrificed his own game while lowering America's handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play much because I don't have time,'' he says.
``Generally, I spend my time hitting the ball (on the test range),
evaluating new clubs instead of trying to get ball in the cup,
which is too difficult.... I spend my time trying to put myself in
the place of the average hacker and see how they will react to our
new woods and irons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bertha was a steel-headed driver (War Bird model) before
going titanium, but popular from the start, even at $250. The
company's unique, bore-through design difference was Helmstetter's
S2H2 (Short Straight Hollow Hosel). When titanium became the rage
and the Great Big Bertha opened at $500, some critics thought it
marketing suicide, but rival Taylor Made immediately introduced its
equally pricey weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the equipment market has stagnated the last couple of
years, with Callaway sales dropping slightly in 1998, net sales for
the first quarter of 1999 were $185.7 million _ up 5 percent. Of
that dollar amount, $81.6 million came from titanium metal woods. A
Callaway golfball is due out in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never started out in a business with the ultimate
long-term goals in mind,'' Callaway says. ``I take one step at a
time and let things evolve. We hadn't the faintest idea that when
we got into the golf-club business by buying that little company
that we would become a large-scale, worldwide golf company. We
didn't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, chances are remote of standing on the first tee with your
weekly foursome and not seeing at least one Big Bertha driver
emerge from under a head cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job now is to come out with a new driver that's going to
be much more rewarding in some way than the current Great Big
Bertha Hawk Eye is,'' Callaway said. ``We intend to do that, and
we're going to do it. I can't tell you when, but if we use our
brains properly and work hard enough, we'll come up with another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubters, anyone?

 &HT;    Club maker fights to protect name
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year ago, the fight was with the United States Golf
Association, which threatened the unthinkable _ a ban on oversized,
titanium drivers. It took full-page advertisements in publications
all over the world for Ely Callaway to state his case.
</P>
<P>
   Now, things basically are back to normal for the energetic
octogenarian from LaGrange who heads Callaway Golf. He has returned
to arm-wrestling with his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   If Callaway, 80, isn't suing rival Orlimar for what he thinks is
patent infringement and unfair advertising, he is raising his blood
pressure about other things he thinks are deceptive to the American
public. In other words, if a golf fan sees a Callaway cap on a
player, it means that he is playing Callaway clubs _ and in just
about all cases, at least 10 clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to think that good ethics is good business,''
Callaway said in a recent phone interview, ``and we hear some of
our competitors don't feel that way at all. They say, `Oh, well,
it's only business.'... We think when most people watch from the
gallery or on TV and they see a Callaway bag with Colin
Montgomerie, many of the people assume Colin Montgomerie is playing
Callaway clubs; and that one of the reasons he's playing well and
winning is because the clubs are Callaway. That's what it says when
we put our name on the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway, who sued Orlimar Golf during the winter, claiming that
its new irons copied their own patented design process, fumed when
Orlimar advertised Ted Tryba as one of its own after he shot a 61
at the Nissan Open. Tryba wore an Orlimar cap without playing any
of the company's clubs, Callaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway ended up embarrassed recently when staff member Paul
Stankowski was caught playing last month with a Callaway bag and
his old Ping irons inside. All Stankowski had to do, Callaway said,
was inform the company that he wanted to switch back to his old
irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would understand,'' he said. ``We just would have told him
not to use the bag the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger, another Callaway staff member, this year acted on
an option in his contract and requested to return to his old
MacGregor blade irons, because he was having difficulty with the
amount of offset in the Callaway X-12 irons. The company sent him a
new bag, which just said ``Callaway Big Bertha Metal Woods'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by Callaway against Orlimar remains in the
courts, with Callaway recently having filed an amended complaint.
Orlimar president and CEO Jesse Ortiz said, ``We have demonstrated
that Orlimar TriMetal technology is superior, and Callaway's
lawsuit cannot change that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the USGA, the people there testing clubs for abnormal
``spring-like effect'' have quieted down but haven't gone away.
Callaway continues to wonder about their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the frame of mind we were this time a year
ago,'' Callaway said, ``and that is that extra distance off the tee
is good for golf. Their feeling is that extra distance off the tee
is bad for golf.... By good for golf, we mean good for millions of
golfers who play and who indeed know that, even with a lot of extra
distance that they can get today, they're no threat to the game.

   SYDNEY-PROFILE-COX _ SYDNEY, Australia _ Sydney 2000 backers
like kangaroos, but they'd rather you come to their country looking
for something a little more sophisticated. Discussing Sydney's
image while dining at Nick's, a harborside restaurant in the
Darling Harbour area of downtown Sydney, the worries seem
overblown: A monorail (bearing an advertisement of an Olympic
sponsor) and water ferries traverse the harbor ahead. Within
walking distance are shops, restaurants and the massive hall where
wrestling, judo and a host of other Olympic sports will be played.
This has the look, the feel and the amenities of one of THE
gathering spots during the Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15,
2000. And unlike Atlanta in 1996, Sydney's downtown gathering spot
already exists. ``That is one of the nice things: We've got this
great gathering spot that is already in place, waiting for the
Olympics,'' said Peter Christopher, a newspaper executive guiding a
visitor through the city. Although there are worries about the
Olympic bribery scandal affecting the organizers' ability to raise
the rest of the money to host the 2000 Olympics, venue construction
and other preparations are in good enough shape that supporters are
able to worry about things like image. (Reetz, Cox News Service).

NASCAR season literally go up in smoke. A year ago, Spencer, 42, of
Berwick, Pa., was ninth in the points standings heading into Sears
Point Raceway, the first of two road-course events on the Winston
Cup circuit. When the Winston Cup series makes its annual stop in
the San Francisco area on Sunday, however, Spencer will find
himself 29th in points, trailing leader Dale Jarrett by a whopping
1,056. Spencer's main problem has been blown engines, and his
sponsor, Winston cigarettes, says it won't be back next season.
However, Jimmy Spencer says last week's top five finish has

INTERIOR REGULATIONS BECOME MIRED IN A DEBATE ON ETHICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After Mobil Oil settled a lawsuit last year
charging that it had underpaid the government for drilling rights,
one of the public interest groups that filed the suit shared its
award with two federal employees who had long complained about oil
company royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Interior Department has been trying to force the
industry to pay higher royalty fees to the government, but
congressional critics are now using questions about the unusual
rewards to the federal officials to delay any new regulations. The
Justice Department is also investigating the propriety of the
payments of $350,000 each to the two federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations from the payments have produced a peculiarly
Washingtonian tale of ethics, lobbying and the intensity of policy
debates when vast amounts of money are on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The latest events were set in motion last August, when the
interest group, Project on Government Oversight, received nearly
$1.2 million for its part in bringing a successful lawsuit against
Mobil for paying about $40 million less than it owed the U.S.
Treasury for drilling on federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the group, based in Washington, decided in November
to share the money with the two officials, one of them at Interior
and the other at the Energy Department, because they had been
campaigning and complaining for years that the oil companies were
not paying their fair share.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has since drafted regulations that would
force the oil companies to pay more in royalties, regulations that
are expected to cost the oil companies several billion dollars over
the next decade. But members of Congress who oppose the regulations
say that the rules are tainted because the two officials who
received the payments may have had a role in preparing the
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the
payments, one made to an official still employed by the Interior
Department, Robert Berman, and the other to Robert A. Speir, who
recently retired from the Energy Department. The Justice
Department's Public Integrity section is looking into whether the
payments violated any of the laws that prohibit payments to
government employees because they might constitute a bribe, illegal
gratuity or improper outside income.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Brian, the executive director of the public interest
group, which goes by the acronym POGO, said in an interview that
the decision to share the award from the lawsuit was an effort to
reward two employees who had acted for years as whistle-blowers and
had been ignored by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have been saying the system is filled with problems
since 1986,'' Ms. Brian said. ``We felt it was the fair thing to do
to reward them. What's really going on here is that the oil
industry has been caught underpaying the government and they're
trying to do anything to divert attention from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brian's organization has been responsible over the years for
disclosing embarrassing cost overruns and government purchases,
particularly in the military, including things like a $400 hammer
and $76 screws.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and a staunch ally of the oil
industry, said in an interview that the payments should not have
been made under any circumstances. ``It really puts the agency
people up for sale,'' he said. ``If we're going to give out rewards
to public officials for policies someone outside the government
likes, the oil companies have plenty of money.''
</P>
<P>
   POGO, Berman and Speir have been battling with their Republican
adversaries in Congress over what role they played in drafting the
regulations being proposed. The Interior Department issued a
statement saying Berman and Speir had only ``inconsequential''
roles in the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican staff aides on the Energy Committee say they have
memorandums and computer messages from the two officials showing
that they played some role in drafting the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all casts a cloud over the Interior regulations,'' said
Young, who is helping to block the rules from taking effect. ``How
can they implement the regulations when this matter is under
investigation by the department?''
</P>
<P>
   The payments were first disclosed by Platt's Oilgram News, a
trade daily that covers the energy industry. But the complaints
about their propriety have been propagated widely by Poe Leggette,
a Washington lawyer and lobbyist and former Interior Department
official who has represented several major oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some sort of delay is warranted until the Justice
Department completes its investigation,'' Leggette said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Mobil and several similar actions were
brought under the Federal False Claims Act, a Civil War-era statute
that was given new life in 1986 when it was revised by Congress.
Under the law, private citizens may bring lawsuits against anyone
they think has defrauded the government. If the lawsuits are
successful, the outside party may collect anywhere from 10 percent
to 30 percent of the award as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Evan Caminker of the law school at the University of
California at Los Angeles, an authority on these kinds of lawsuits,
said that courts had generally held that public officials may be
part of a group that brings such lawsuits but not in any matter on
which they were involved as a government assignment.

SPORTS COLUMN: CRENSHAW'S APPROACH SHOT IS GENTLE BUT TOUGH
ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ He's known as Gentle Ben, and he is. That's why
some people are wondering if Ben Crenshaw is too nice to be the
Ryder Cup captain. He disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too nice,'' he said. ``If I have something in my mind,
I stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a quarter of a century on the PGA Tour, Ben Crenshaw had
winning in his mind, and he stuck to it with his tenacious Texan
toughness. Stuck to it to win 19 tournaments, including two
Masters, and over $7 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Now the something stuck in his mind is regaining the Ryder Cup
from the European pros in the Sept. 24-26 matches at the Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., and he's definitely tough enough to be
the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very competitive, very traditional,'' Crenshaw said. ``I
believe in the Ryder Cup and what it stands for. But I've got to be
myself. If I go completely out of myself and rant and rave, that
won't be me. My job is to get these guys team-oriented for the
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 pros on the U.S. team, the top 10 finishers in the
Ryder Cup standing will be automatic choices. The current top 10
are David Duval, Tiger Woods, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III, Mark
O'Meara, Hal Sutton, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert and
Steve Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw will complete the team with two captain's choices from
a group that is likely to include John Huston, Steve Pate, Fred
Couples, Lee Janzen, Justin Leonard and Tom Lehman, if not Maggert
and Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of tournaments for guys to increase their
Ryder Cup points,'' Crenshaw said. ``With the guys already sure to
make it, I want them to play practice rounds together at
tournaments, chip and putt together, eat together, feel like
teammates, because they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The team won't be completed until Aug. 16, after the PGA
Championship at Medinah outside Chicago. Two weeks later, the day
after the World Golf Championship NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio,
the team will arrive at the Country Club for a practice round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing the course at Valderrama was a problem when we
didn't win in Spain two years ago,'' Crenshaw said. ``And the young
guys on the team have never played the Country Club. The only ones
who have are the older guys who played there in the 1988 United
States Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, who missed the 36-hole cut at the Buick Classic, was
sitting on the bench at his Westchester Country Club locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Country Club is a placement course, especially on your
approach shots,'' he said. ``The greens are small. But with that
one practice round, when they get there the Tuesday before the
matches, they'll know where they are. They won't waste that Tuesday
getting to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at a nearby locker, Tom Kite, the 1997 captain,
couldn't help but overhear Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That practice round will be important,'' Kite said. ``Two
years ago I asked all our guys to stop at Valderrama for a practice
round on the way to the British Open, but the only guys who did
were Tiger, Mark O'Meara and Davis Love. I also had a private jet
coming down there from Scotland and six guys were supposed to be on
it, but only one guy got off _ Payne Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, it turned out, wasn't on that 1997 team, but as the
reigning U.S. Open champion, he's a lock this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne will be a tremendous asset to our team,'' Crenshaw said.
``He'll help keep the other guys loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite said: ``You need somebody with a sense of humor to relax
everybody. Somebody like Payne, Peter Jacobsen, Paul Azinger. In
1993 at the Belfry, Paul brought a crazy little game called, `Pass
the Pig,' a dice game with the dice shaped like a pig. Playing that
game, guys relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The American team retained the cup, 15-13, in England that year,
but lost it to the Europeans at Oak Hill outside Rochester in 1995.
During the loss to the Europeans at Valderrama, long rain delays on
both Friday and Saturday prevented the American team from hanging
out together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No dead time at night,'' Kite said. ``The players were so
tired when they got back to the hotel after playing 36 holes, they
just crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the American hopes of regaining the cup that the
Europeans had snatched at Oak Hill when Nick Faldo holed an
8-footer on the 18th green to defeat Curtis Strange, 1-up, in the
decisive singles.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw knows how it feels to win and lose the Ryder Cup.
He helped hold the cup in 1981 and 1983, but he was on that losing
team at Oak Hill and also on the losing 1987 team at Muirfield
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Muirfield Village, the Europeans beat us in the short game,
getting it up and down, making a big putt,'' the captain said. ``At
Oak Hill, I had an inability to hole putts. I don't feel like I did
my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crenshaw doesn't want to feel that way at the Country Club.

THE ROTATING ROTATION  
 HUNDLEY TRIES TO REGROUP  
 BAD START I, BAD START II  
 ORIOLES GLAD BELLE IS MAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to follow the bouncing baseball as it has caromed around the
Boston Red Sox starting rotation:
</P>
<P>
   Juan Pena is summoned from the minor leagues to take the spot of
Bret Saberhagen, who goes on the disabled list with a strained
right shoulder. Brian Rose is called up to take Pena's place when
he is put on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen returns and bumps Pat Rapp to the bullpen. Rapp
quickly returns to the rotation when Mark Portugal leaves the club
and considers retirement. Portugal comes back and replaces
Saberhagen, who moves to the disabled list a second time with a cut
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Ho Cho, yet another rookie, is promoted from the minors to
replace Tim Wakefield, who becomes the closer when Tom Gordon goes
on the disabled list. Saberhagen returns but bumps no one to the
bullpen because Manager Jimy Williams decides to keep all six
pitchers in the rotation for one cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The rookies Pena, Rose and Cho have started a total of 12 games.
Their collective record is 8-0; the Red Sox have won 11 of their 12
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley Tries to Regroup
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers are suffering the most disappointing
first half in the majors, and no one feels sorry for them. In fact,
more people in baseball are probably delighted with their stunning
failure than with any other development. That's because they let
everyone know last winter how they were going to ride Rupert
Murdoch's money to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers are collapsing under the weight of their own
boasts, and one of the reasons is the inability of Todd Hundley to
recapture the catching and hitting ability he possessed with the
New York Mets before his elbow operation. Desperate to get
themselves moving forward, the Dodgers decided to take a step
backward with Hundley. They benched him for a week and a half _ he
sat out eight consecutive games _ while he worked on his throwing
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody keeps screaming that he's not healthy,'' Rick
Dempsey, a Dodgers coach and former catcher, said. ``I'm screaming
that he is healthy. There are no problems with his arm from a
physical standpoint. He's gotten into so many bad habits since he
came back from the operation it's hard to pinpoint any one of them.
The bottom line is he's not throwing any runners out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley had thrown out only seven of 60 runners who tried to
steal, a dreadful 12 percent success ratio. He was hitting .230.
``I think his offense was bothering his defense more than vice
versa,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   At manager Davey Johnson's request, Dempsey conducted an
in-season spring training camp for Hundley, overseeing daily 3 p.m.
workouts. His aim was to shorten Hundley's stride and throwing
motion when he tried to throw out base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers are as much to blame because they don't give him an
opportunity to throw out runners,'' Dempsey said. ``He rushed, and
it turned into something ugly. Ten days to two weeks may not be
enough time, but we have to get him back in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, whose outfield experiment with the Mets last season
contributed to a change in his throwing style, threw, threw and
threw some more. He worked with live batters and base runners,
shortening his stride and his motion and speeding up his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot,'' Dempsey said. ``We broke him down so we
could build him back up. He's laying on the ground gasping, saying
his legs just can't take it. A catcher needs his legs for throwing
so we have him on a running program to build up his endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey liked the improvement he said Hundley made during their
training camp. ``I know it's all going to work out,'' the coach
said. ``We absolutely need him. I'll work with him as long as he
needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Start I, Bad Start II
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve of Oakland, the American League rookie of the year
last season, struggled at bat for the first two months of this
season. Every time he looked at the scoreboard and his batting
average was posted, it began with a 1. But a two-hit game June 9 at
San Diego lifted him above .200 (31-154, .201) for the first time
since opening day, and, collecting 22 hits in 61 at-bats (.361) in
that game and the next 15 games, he reached a season-high .242
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera of San Diego, whom the Yankees sent west for Hideki
Irabu, was slightly above .200 in the early days of the season,
then quickly fell below and did not get back over that mark until
June 18 (34-168, .202). Unlike Grieve, Rivera has not taken off. He
slipped back to .198 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles Glad Belle Is Mad
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Belle played for the Cleveland Indians, his
teammates felt that the angrier he was, the better he hit, so they
supposedly set out to do things that made him angry. His current
team now has reason to believe in the Indians' method.
</P>
<P>
   When Baltimore manager Ray Miller sat Belle down for a game
after he did not run out a grounder, Belle was hitting .244 and had
socked 10 home runs and driven in 35 runs in 58 games. Since
getting back into the lineup the next game, Angry Albert, entering
Saturday's game, was hitting .370 with five home runs and 10 RBIs
in 13 games.

 WASHINGTON: tell us.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Congress is cautious, and the reason can be summarized in
one word: cost.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, national spending on prescription drugs grew
by an average of 11 percent a year, which is more than double the 5
percent rate for health care spending overall. The increase
reflects the development of new, more expensive, more effective
drug therapies and greater use of prescription drugs, driven in
part by more aggressive marketing aimed directly at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and health maintenance organizations report that drugs
are their fastest-growing cost.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal-state program for poor families, does
cover prescription drugs, and even though it gets substantial
discounts from manufacturers, Medicaid now spends more on drugs
than on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Concannon, the commissioner of human services in Maine,
said the state's Medicaid program spent $140 million a year on
prescription drugs, compared with $40 million on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen deMontmollin, vice president of AvMed Health Plan, a
large nonprofit HMO in Florida, said drug spending for his members
rose 33 percent last year, to $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last week, Republican senators like
William Roth Jr. of Delaware, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John
Chafee of Rhode Island expressed support for Medicare coverage of
drugs, but said it should be provided first to the neediest
beneficiaries. Moderate Democratic senators like John Breaux of
Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
expressed the view of the Republican majority. He cautioned against
``any rich new benefit'' and said, ``A targeted approach, focusing
on low-income seniors, is the best solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux was chairman of a 17-member commission that was supposed
to advise Congress and the president on the future of Medicare. The
panel did not agree on much, but did provide authoritative
bipartisan backing for the view that Medicare is antiquated because
it does not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux proposed drug coverage for 3 million low-income
beneficiaries, and he said it would cost the government $60 billion
over 10 years. The White House rejected the proposal as
``inadequate and inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Reps. Henry Waxman and Pete Stark of California, agree with
Clinton that drug coverage should be available to all
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a premium of $45.50 a month.
Under current law, with no change in benefits, the monthly premium
is expected to double in a decade, to $101 in 2009. Any premium for
prescription drug coverage would be added to that.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the poorest
people would not have to pay the full premium for drug coverage
under Clinton's plan. ``Some people will get help with the premium
at the lower end of the scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer
group, said, ``It makes sense for seniors to pay a significant part
of the cost through a premium.'' But, he said, it is ``absolutely
essential'' for the government to pay the premiums for Medicare
beneficiaries with incomes as much as 35 percent above the poverty
level (up to $14,931 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   ``Administration officials told me they were willing to pay the
full premium on the drug benefit for people with incomes up to 120
percent of the poverty level,'' Pollack said. ``I urged them to do
better than that, to go to 135 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-income beneficiaries are already eligible for federal
assistance in paying their basic Medicare premiums. But in studies
going back to 1991, Pollack has repeatedly documented the failure
of the federal government and the states to locate the people
eligible for such subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials have told the White House that if Medicare
begins to cover prescription drugs, many more low-income people
would have an incentive to step forward and claim the federal
subsidies to which they are entitled.

SCOUTING FOR PLUS FACTORS AMONG COSTA RICA'S NEW ARRIVALS FROM
CUBA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Cuba)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desperate to find talent in any corner of the earth, more than a
dozen teams, including the Yankees and the Mets, had scouts in
Costa Rica the past few days scrutinizing the latest catch from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Six players _ two pitchers, two catchers, two outfielders _
defected in the last year and now seek their personal pot of
baseball gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no talent to rave about,'' one scout said after
watching the catchers and the outfielders work out last Thursday,
``but that doesn't mean the guys won't get a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a shrinking lode of good amateur players in North
America, teams have fanned out all over the world pursuing nuggets
they hope will grow to be major-league gems.
</P>
<P>
   In their frenzied quest, however, they are not always as
discriminating as they were when talent in this country was
abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Quiroz is a Venezuelan catcher who at the age of 16
last year worked out in Florida for interested clubs. ``He's
well-developed for his age, he's a well-below-average runner, has
below-average arm strength, shows power in batting practice,'' an
official of one team said at the time after watching Quiroz. ``But
the way the business operates, he will probably command a decent
bonus. In that kind of atmosphere you create a competition where
somebody is going to want to beat somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays did just that, signing Quiroz last
September for a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have executed more than their share of expensive
signings of foreign players: Hideki Irabu, Orlando Hernandez,
Jackson Melian, Ricardo Aramboles and Alfonso Soriano, for example.
The latest was Willi Mo Pena, an outfielder from the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets initially signed Pena for the 1999 season last July,
giving him a $6,000 bonus. But the commissioner's office
subsequently declared him a free agent after it was learned that
the Mets signed him illegally. It seems that the scout who signed
the 16-year-old Pena signed his father's name to the contract,
without knowing that his father could not write and signed his name
with three X's.
</P>
<P>
   With Don Nomura, who represents Irabu, as his agent, Pena, now
all of 17 years old, proceeded to sign with the Yankees last April
for just a bit more than the bonus the Mets gave him: the Yankees
awarded Pena a $2.4 million signing bonus and a total package of
$3.7 million for five years. But that wasn't all. They also put him
on the major-league 40-man roster, a status seldom accorded to a
player signing his first contract.
</P>
<P>
   Under a major-league contract, Pena's salary is covered by the
maximum 20 percent cut rule, and the sizable bonus becomes part of
the salary. His contractual status also affects the number of years
the Yankees can have him under reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sign Pena to a major-league contract was made by
George Steinbrenner, who sided with his minor league office in
Tampa over his major-league office in New York. One of the reasons
the major-league office was opposed to the signing was that the
contract's $740,000 average annual value raised the team's payroll
for luxury tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pena, Brayan, is among the Cuban contingent in Costa
Rica. The profile sent to major-league clubs by the agent for the
players, Gus Dominguez of Beverly Hills, Calif., said the
17-year-old catcher was ``considered by most knowledgeable sources
to be the best prospect in Cuban baseball outside of National Team
(`A') and considered by many to be the best overall prospect in
Cuban baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The scout who attended the workouts said that Brayan Pena, who
defected in Venezuela before a tournament in April, did not
demonstrate a ``plus'' tool, using scouting terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a plus arm, he's not a plus runner and he
didn't show plus power,'' the scout said. Furthermore, he said,
scouts were disappointed because Pena was ``a little bit
overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive player of the group, the scout added after a
Friday game, was a pitcher, Miguel Perez, a 23-year-old
right-hander. But, he said, Perez is ``not in the class of Livan
and El Duque,'' referring to the half-brothers Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The players cannot negotiate or sign with anyone until they gain
residency status in Costa Rica. Dominguez, their agent, said they
have temporary residency and are awaiting notification on their
request for permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the scout said, the players have ``average type of
ability,'' then quickly added, ``That doesn't mean they're not
going to get a lot of money.''

JOE REDINGTON, IDITAROD'S FOUNDER, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Okla., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Redington, who died Thursday at the age of 82 at his
homestead in Knik, Alaska, near Anchorage, did not get to mush
until he was in his late 30s, but when he did, he realized
something that no one else had thought of: If you organize a
dog-sled race of 1,100 miles, even if you don't have any sort of
grubstake at all, interesting things can happen.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, things got very interesting over the next 26 years
as the Iditarod race from Anchorage to Nome, which Redington helped
to conceive and promote, grew to be such a compelling contest of
grit and gumption and such a major event for Alaska that this week
Gov. Tony Knowles ordered flags flown at half-staff for three days
in Redington's honor.
</P>
<P>
   From the 160-acre spread in Knik, where sled-dogs share the
landscape with dead refrigerators and car parts, Jo Wood, a family
spokeswoman, said that Redington, who started life as a Dust Bowl
pilgrim from Oklahoma, would be buried in a dog sled. She said that
Redington died after fighting cancer of the esophagus for 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   Redington was born on Feb. 1, 1917, on the Chisholm Trail in
Oklahoma. Fleeing the dust storms of the Depression, he and his
family settled in eastern Pennsylvania in the '30s. During World
War II he spent four years in the Army, including a stint on
Okinawa. Afterward he came back and worked as a salesman, trying to
sell Jeeps to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 he decided to head for Alaska with his family, where he
discovered sled dogs and racing.
</P>
<P>
   By 1973, Redington, who had done some welding, some car repair,
and some mining and fishing, was lamenting that the sleds and dogs
he had come to love were threatened by snowmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Six years earlier, he and Dorothy Page, a local historian,
organized a 50-mile sled race, and for some time after that,
Redington kept talking about a big sled race from Anchorage to the
ghost town of Iditarod and back, a distance of about 1,000 miles.
The race would cover part of the trail taken by relays of dog sleds
carrying diphtheria serum to Nome to fight a 1925 epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The talk led newspapers and neighbors to call him the Don
Quixote of Alaska. Then he announced the race and a prize of
$50,000, which he did not have. All but two of his race committee
members walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We don't want anything to do with it, we're out of
it,''' he once said in an interview, retelling the story with all
the pleasure of the vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism then spread throughout Alaska about whether Redington
could come up with the money and whether enough mushers would race
through below-zero days and nights for prize money that might prove
only theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   A short, thin man long on spunk, Redington countered with
optimism. As he used to say, ``If you don't have a plan, that's one
less thing that can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that a race from point A to point B would be more
dramatic than a round trip over a shorter span, he altered the
course so that mushers would not turn back at Iditarod but instead
would drive their teams all the way to Nome. It was an itinerary
that many thought would prove impossible. In fact it took 20 days
for the first of 22 mushers to cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   This gave Redington the time to visit banks, some of which
eventually lent him all but $3,000 of the prize money, and
Redington was able to talk the third-place finisher into taking an
IOU for half his purse to make up this deficit.
</P>
<P>
   As sleds and camping equipment improved and became lighter,
speed increased, and the record dropped steadily with subsequent
runnings. In 1986, Susan Butcher, the second woman to triumph in
the Iditarod and a mushing superstar with three consecutive
victories, arrived in Nome in 11 days 15 hours and six minutes for
her first victory. By 1995 the winning time had dropped to below 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Redington, who raced in 19 Iditarods, led for portions of
several races and finished fifth four times, most recently in 1988,
when he was 71. In his last race in 1997, at 80, Redington finished
back in the pack though registering a still respectable time of 13
days and four hours.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the annual race, held in March, had long been a great
success, drawing competitors and tourists and signaling Alaskans
that they had endured another winter. Enthusiasts who partied at
the race's last start in Anchorage and those who flew to Nome for
the celebrations at the finish compared the event to the Boston
Marathon, the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500. One man in
Nome called it ``the Mardi Gras of the Arctic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stan Hooley, the executive director of the race, noted that the
race, which operates on a budget of $1.5 million, ``couldn't get
any bigger.'' The Iditarod is currently a $3.8 million business
that attracts national companies as paying sponsors as well as
1,500 volunteers who clear and patrol the trail.
</P>
<P>
   There were snags along the road to success, including periods of
indebtedness and the complaints from animal lovers, which reached
their peak in the early '90s, contending that money was being made
from the sufferings of sled dogs. Indeed, more than a dozen dogs
died during the early races; last year, five animals perished.
</P>
<P>
   But the race authorities have steadily demanded better
veterinary care and imposed tougher penalties on mushers whose dogs
die. In the years of the race, no driver has been lost, though snow
blindness, illness, broken bones and frostbite have not been
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   After 1997, Redington stayed involved in the Iditarod in other
ways. He produced and sold Iditarod cards, which coupled
photographs of the mushers and their dogs with statistics. In 1993
he started to take tenderfoot mushers on month-long excursions up
the Iditarod trail at $15,000 a head. At the time of his death, he
was still raising and trading dogs and dog teams.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOING IN THE WIND TO SYDNEY IS A TEEN-AGER'S GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y. _ This is Amanda Clark's downwind summer,
probably her last chance to improve without pressure, to find out
without penalty how far she can push before she flips. She is 17
years old, your basic amateur. She buys her own shoes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no college scholarships in her sport. No agents call.
On money raised from friends and neighbors, her mother and father
will take turns accompanying her to Finland, England, the
Netherlands, Canada, as Amanda works her way through the fleet
toward next April's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   In this time of ferocious tennis parents and personal Little
League coaches and sneaker-company summer camps, Amanda Clark's
``Sailing to Sydney'' campaign seems quaint, although it is being
conducted on a Web site as well as on yacht-club lawns.
</P>
<P>
   On a particular breezy weekend morning, she admits being torn
between writing a few more of the thank-you notes to the 338 people
who have contributed $37,283 or taking a spin on the bay. Her face
changes, actually brightens, when she talks about sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wind,'' she said, sitting in the living room, her eyes
flicking toward a curtain moving in an open window. ``I liked it
right away. From the start, I felt free when I was sailing. I could
go wherever I wanted. I never got tired. I could go fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was genes. Her grandfather, Albertus ``Toots'' Clark,
sailed on Vanderbilt yachts and became a professional captain.
Maybe it was upbringing. Her father, Dennis Clark, a painting
contractor, put his three children on his boat as soon as they were
heavy enough to be ballast.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just knew right away where to sit in a boat to not be in
the way, to not get hit on the head,'' said Clark, one of the few
locals here to join the 113-year-old Shelter Island Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was never afraid,'' said her mother, Ellen Clark, who runs
a recruitment company for pharmaceutical scientists. ``When Amanda
was 7, she went out by herself. She just has a way on the water.''
</P>
<P>
   In the youth sailboats called Optimists, Amanda quickly
established herself as competitive, tireless, willing to ``sail her
hours'' on her own after school, on weekends and in cold weather,
and to bounce back from mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 12, the family made the first major decision to
support her passion. She joined the sail maker Dev Colie's Jersey
Shore Optimist team. Denny Clark and Amanda made the 6 a.m. ferry
so she could be at Point Pleasant by 9. He would drive back to
work, and then he or Ellen would make another round trip late in
the day to pick her up. They remember the car rides fondly, a
chance to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda was good enough soon enough to need even longer rides, to
regattas in Florida, then California, Hawaii, Ireland, South
Africa, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weighed it so many times,'' said Ellen. ``Is this worth it?
We have two other children, Greg and Rebecca, both older. And we
saw other parents spending thousands of dollars, pushing kids who
really didn't want to sail, who'd be out there crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda laughed. ``I'd be out there crying, too. `What am I doing
wrong?' Sometimes even `What am I doing here?' But that never
lasted long.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Clarks say they saw youngsters with more
innate talent than Amanda _ a better sense of race tactics, for
example, an ability to read the wind shift faster _ but few who
seemed as determined, as ready to move on from a defeat, to learn
from it, to just work harder. They became absorbed in the extended
family of sailing families.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Amanda was the top woman at the Optimist Nationals. A
year later, she was ranked third on the U.S. sailing team in the
Europe class. Her competitors now were older, more experienced
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, her old friends stopped calling to ask: Wanna hang
out?
</P>
<P>
   How could they understand the esoteric nature of her concerns?
Should she give up the hiking pads that are strapped around thighs
to give support and protection while the sailor hangs out over the
rail? As a child, she had considered them the epitome of
sophisticated sailing and longed for the day she would wear them.
But now, she is wondering if bruises are an acceptable price to pay
for the better fluidity of movement without them, the enhanced
connection to the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna hang out?
</P>
<P>
   While she can't remember exactly when she discovered that the
tiller was really gripping her, she recalls a revelatory moment
last June, in an Optimist with a coach, Courtnay Becker-Dey. Then,
she said: ``Everything clicked. The boat just felt so good. I
wasn't fighting the helm, the shape of the sail was right, nothing
twisted, no big wrinkles, and I felt the power of the boat and I
felt in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going downwind, I knew my limits and I sailed that line,
just how far I could push the boat without flipping over. I had it.
I knew it was time to move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is her moving-on summer, a chance to improve, no pressure
for rankings. With a Danish coach, Ken Andreasen, she will work on
upwind sailing, on thinking not only about what she is doing while
powering the boat but what is going on in the race. ``If I can hang
with the girls upwind _ I'm smaller than most of them _ I can use
my downwind skills to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   A high school senior, she will start looking at colleges in the
fall _ somewhere close to water _ and start lifting again. She is 5
feet 3 inches tall, and would like to add 10 pounds of muscle. ``I
haven't had time to get to 140,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The curtain is moving more insistently now and Amanda makes a
decision. She will write two dozen thank-you notes, and then get
into the wind.

SO YOU WANT TO BE A WORLD SOCCER STAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the United States entered the first Women's World
Cup in 1991, midfielder Julie Foudy had to convince her father that
the trip to China was worthwhile. When the victorious Americans
returned home, about the only people to greet them at the airport
were baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the Women's World Cup is being played in the
United States, and an unprecedented buzz has been created around
the national team, which has been sought out by news media outlets
from ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' and ``Hard Copy'' to
Sports Illustrated and Mademoiselle.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Mia Hamm held a soccer ball in one hand and
signed a child's jersey with the other, while shouldering a
cellular phone to her ear and answering questions on a Chicago
sports-talk radio show. Earlier that day, several hundred children
ringed the practice field in suburban Chicago to watch the American
women train. When the national soccer team began in 1985, it was
lucky to get several hundred spectators at a game.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the Americans drew 78,972 for the World Cup
opener against Denmark at Giants Stadium. It was the largest
audience ever to see a women's sporting event in this country. A
second sellout followed on Thursday, when the United States
defeated Nigeria, 7-1, before 65,080, at Soldier Field in Chicago.
A crowd of 50,000 is expected for Sunday's final round-robin match
against North Korea in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Individual female athletes like Billie Jean King and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee have become household names, but never has a women's
team sport been played on such a grand stage, on its own, free from
having to share attention with other events under the Olympic
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are seeing a cultural shift in the sporting
landscape,'' said Donna de Varona, the chairwoman of the Women's
World Cup who is also an Olympic swimming champion and a longtime
booster of women's sports. ``There is room to embrace another sport
in the great stadiums of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the sport is gender-blind in this country, women don't
suffer by comparison, as they do in Italy or Brazil. Soccer has
been the No. 1 weekend attraction in this country for a long time.
We just had to give them the big event. Families are looking for
clean, wholesome, affordable fun and role models their kids can
identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   While television ratings have been unexceptional, organizers
expect them to grow as the tournament builds. They also hope to
sell out the 92,000-seat Rose Bowl if the Americans reach the final
on July 10. It should not be difficult for suburban America to
identify with players who are college-educated, smart, funny,
athletic, successful and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman played host to Brandi Chastain, a defender, on one of
his recent shows, and the players responded by sending him a team
picture in which they appeared to be wearing nothing but ``Late
Show'' T-shirts. ``This may come out wrong,'' he said on the air,
``but the U.S. women's team is Babe City.''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent girls squeal for the players with a high-pitched
shriek rarely heard among mammals outside the dolphin family.
``It's the Spice Girls meet Tigerbeat,'' Chastain said.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of America, the players were virtually unknown until
two weeks ago. Now, moviegoers recognize them standing in line and
point them out to friends. For the American players, wearing soccer
gear to the mall is a no-no, the equivalent of a deer wearing a
bull's-eye in the woods. At the team hotels, youngsters ride the
elevators and call the players' rooms for autographs. The players
have begun checking in under assumed names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle Akers used `Pig Farmer,' but had to change it,'' said
Aaron Heifetz, the team spokesman, ``which should not be seen as a
sign of disrespect for the pork industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has fielded inquiries about the team from every
magazine from The New Yorker to Muscle and Fitness. ``Christie
Pearce is a seamstress, and she made her own prom dress, so I keep
waiting on a call from American Quilt to do a profile,'' Heifetz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this has been welcomed. Professional autograph
collectors have descended on the Women's World Cup, stalking
players at the team hotel. ``Heavy breathers,'' defender Kate
Sobrero calls them. Akers, the first American star who is playing
in her third World Cup, said that youngsters now follow her into
bathrooms in public places, seeking autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this attention better than no attention?'' Akers said.
``That's a good question. I wonder how Michael Jordan would answer
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, most of the time, the players cheerily accept the
distractions. For most of their careers, they couldn't have been
any more anonymous if they had been in the witness-protection
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have one without the other,'' Foudy said. ``You
can't want to promote your sport and gain notoriety and be
financially successful without having those kinds of obligations
and distractions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even with the new visibility and the success of having won a
world championship and an Olympic gold medal, however, the American
women are still reminded frequently about the disparity between the
men's game and the women's.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday at Giants Stadium, the female referee insisted
that the American players remove all their jewelry, including
wedding rings. It was an officious request, considering that male
players wear more jewelry than QVC models. Carla Overbeck, the
American captain, refused to remove her wedding band, saying
``These don't come off,'' and the referee relented.
</P>
<P>
   The American women would each receive a bonus of $12,500 for
winning the World Cup, compared to the $380,000 that the American
men would have received had they won the 1998 World Cup in France.
The women, who went on strike over a salary dispute in 1995, have
chosen not to make an issue of the bonus disparity, feeling they
can eventually ease the incongruity by winning the 1999 World Cup
and generating a viable professional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we're worth, but we have gone way beyond
what is expected of players to promote our sport,'' Chastain said.
``I think it's going to come around. I'm trusting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said she found it liberating to pose nude _ wearing
only cleats and holding a strategically placed soccer ball _ for
Gear magazine. It showed, she said, that female athletes are
``powerful, strong, athletic and we shouldn't be ashamed.'' It is
quite a bit more than fans are likely to see of her teammates, who
should continue appearing, fully clothed, at stadiums from coast to
coast in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is catching on in mainstream America,'' said Tony
DiCicco, coach of the women's national team. ``It's a look at
women's athletics in the future. Seldom has a women's team sport
had this type of global event. If we continue to win, I think
America will develop an Olympic aura, like we're trying to win a
gold medal, and I think everyone will be watching the team.''

RANGERS   TRADE SUNDSTROM, CLOUTIER TO DRAFT CZECH WING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a draft day filled with a furious flurry of deals,
the Rangers moved up twice in the picking order, the Islanders
played a pat but full hand among the top 10 and the Devils took a
late selection.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers paid quite a price to get what they wanted. In
order to select Pavel Brendl with the fourth pick overall in what
is thought to be a strong draft, the Rangers traded Niklas
Sundstrom, a regular forward for four seasons, and Dan Cloutier, a
goalie who was thought to be one of their best future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Those two players went, along with a first-round draft choice in
2000 and a third-round pick in 2000, to Tampa Bay. Sundstrom and
Cloutier were two of the few first-round draft choices who worked
out well for the Rangers in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, the Rangers traded center Marc Savard to Tampa Bay
so that they could choose another center with the ninth selection.
They took Jamie Lundmark, from the Moose Jaw Warriors of the
Western Canadian junior league.
</P>
<P>
   Brendl, a 6-foot, 204-pound right wing, is from the Czech
Republic but played last season with the Calgary Hitmen of the
Western League, one of three major-junior circuits in Canada. In 68
games, he scored 73 goals and 61 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's Central Scouting Bureau report rated Brendl ``a
powerful skater with a wide stride'' who has ``deceptive speed that
often results in breakaway opportunities.'' Although just 18 years
old, Brendl predicted he could play next season in New York,
possibly alongside center Petr Nedved, already a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I will,'' he said. ``I'm sure I can. I'm not scared
that I can't score in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendl tried out last season with Las Vegas of the International
Hockey League, a minor professional circuit. One of his teammates
there, briefly, was Nedved, then a holdout with Pittsburgh, later
traded to New York from the Penguins. Nedved, Brendl said, urged
Brendl to play in juniors in Canada to get the experience, as
Nedved had done at the same age.
</P>
<P>
   The scouting report also called Brendl ``extremely accurate with
shooting and passing and almost always hits his target. Shows great
ability to find the open man in traffic. Has good lateral movement
when handling the puck and exhibits exceptional balance and
strength when fending off checking opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a series of trades that re-arranged the order
of the first few picks of the first round. Vancouver, originally
scheduled to pick third, ended up with both the second and third
choices and chose Daniel and Henrik Sedin, twin brothers from
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion team in Atlanta, scheduled to take the second pick
overall, moved up to first, replacing Tampa Bay, and took Patrik
Stefan, a native of the Czech Republic who played for Long Beach of
the IHL last season. Stefan, a 6-foot-1-inch, 205-pound center,
played only 33 games because of post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, with three picks in the top 10, took center Tim
Connolly with the fifth pick overall, left wing Taylor Pyatt with
the eighth choice and defenseman Branislav Mezei with the 10th
choice. The Rangers, who were supposed to choose 11th in the first
round with their original pick, traded Savard to Calgary and
switched picks with the Flames, who were to choose ninth. With the
ninth overall choice, the Rangers took Lundmark and got another
player from Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   With their first pick, the 27th overall, the Devils chose Ari
Ahonen, a goalie from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' draft history in recent seasons has been spotty.
Last season's top pick was Manny Malhotra, who made the roster and
showed promise as a third- and fourth-line center.
</P>
<P>
   For various reasons, others have had less success. The 1997 top
pick was Stefan Cherneski, the 1996 pick was Jeff Brown and the
1995 pick (in the second round) was Christian Dube. The top choices
of 1994 and 1993 were Cloutier and Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier was the backup goalie and Sundstrom, after a
disappointing season, was mentioned in trade talks, along Todd
Harvey, in a proposed deal with the Islanders for Zigmund Palffy
that fell through. The top pick in 1992 was Peter Ferraro, now with
Boston. The top pick in 1991, Alexsei Kovalev, was traded to
Pittsburgh last season for Nedved.

<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Boris Becker's Wimbledon swan song is
showing signs of becoming an aria. The 31-year-old German, a decade
removed from the last of his three Wimbledon championships,
continued to turn back the clock and take control of Center Court
like a playground bully. It's not just his adoring fans, a legion
of flag-waving, face-painted zealots; his opponents seem caught up
in the spell as well.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Becker, the oldest warrior left on the men's side,
used his intimidation tactics to achieve the desired effect against
the youngest man in the draw, Australia's 18-year-old Lleyton
Hewitt, the ponytailed prospect from Down Under who predicted ``it
would be a buzz'' to share Becker's turf.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hewitt spent the day being buzzed by his idol's serve
while nervously missing his own targets. Hewitt's backhand passing
shots were of little threat to Becker as he stood sentry at the net
from start to finish and ultimately soldiered into the Round of 16,
a 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). He next plays second-seeded Patrick Rafter,
who defeated Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hewitt, Becker treated him like an unwelcome house
guest on the Center Court. ``I think Boris sort of walks around
like he basically owns that court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker called his progress here somewhat flabbergasting but
infinitely rewarding. ``I have no explanation for it; I'm just
going out there trying to play great tennis, and it all happened,''
said Becker, who reneged on his 1997 retirement from Grand Slam
play because he decided that he remains, after all, ``one of the
five, six players who really know how to play'' on grass. ``Things
are looking very good for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Things stopped looking good for the 1996 champion, Richard
Krajicek, who was ambushed on Court Two, the Graveyard Court, by
the 196th-ranked Swiss qualifier Lorenzo Manta, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5),
4-6, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I was surprised at how well he played,'' said
Krajicek. ``I expected him to get a little nervous but he kept
playing better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Dutchman, Krajicek, was joined on the sidelines
by 14th-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany, a 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-3), 7-6
(7-2) loser to Wayne Arthurs, a 163d-ranked Australian qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Jelena Dokic, the 16-year-old Australian qualifier who bounced
top-seeded Martina Hingis from the first round, moved into the
Round of 16 with a 6-7 (7-9), 6-3, 6-4 comeback against Anne
Kremer. Dokic will play ninth-seeded Mary Pierce in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   In the only upset on the women's side, Alexandra Stevenson, the
18-year-old powerhouse from San Diego who decided to turn
professional here, landed in the Round of 16 Saturday after
upsetting 11th-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis of France, 6-3, 6-3.
Stevenson pelted the Frenchwoman with 12 aces, saved all six break
points she faced, and advanced to her first fourth round of a Grand
Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's opponent is an American better known for her
all-court doubles expertise, Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pa. Raymond
upset Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, a two-time Wimbledon finalist, in
the second round, and Saturday she knocked out Conchita Martinez,
the Spaniard who won her only Slam title here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's coup lasted just 58 minutes, and afterwards she
explained that she was making good on a little game dreamed up by
her buddy, Serena Williams, back when both of them were among the
unseeded rank-and-file. Seeded players, explained Stevenson, were
viewed like sitting ducks in a shooting gallery: ``You wind up your
ducks and you take them out, you shoot them. It's fun to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, too, said Stevenson, is breaking free of the junior ranks,
an emancipation that has, in her case, included the rejection of a
scholarship offer from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a junior, it's the scarlet letter: you can't go
anywhere,'' said Stevenson, a 6-footer who prefers bigger arenas
and bigger opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected 1999 Wimbledon force, Jim Courier, still has
his head cold but has shaken off a more serious condition, the
dehydration that briefly rendered him a hospital patient.
</P>
<P>
   Courier, whose four-hour, 24-minute third round epic against
Sjeng Schalken left him also suffering from heat exhaustion on
Friday evening, received intravenous treatment after the match at
Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon village. The 61st-ranked Courier was
released after a few hours of observation and Saturday pronounced
himself recovered and ready for Week Two, his first Week Two at
Wimbledon in six years.
</P>
<P>
   But Courier insisted that the trip to the hospital was
necessitated by a misjudgment by the tournament medical staff.
Courier said the All England Club's resident physician, Dr. Tudor
Miles, who had seen him earlier in the week to treat a bad cold,
hadn't felt his post-match cramping required on-site intravenous
correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit sad that a tournament of this stature has a
sub-par medical performance; I just think it's antiquated,'' said
the 28-year-old Courier, who saved two match points and began
cramping the instant he picked up his gear bag to leave the court
after claiming the 97-minute fifth set 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   Courier said the most painful aspect of the victory was having
to fold himself into a car to get to the hospital instead of taking
treatment here: ``Getting into a car and sitting down when you're
cramping is the worst thing you can do,'' he said, ``it's like
you're in labor if you're a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on site at the practice courts Saturday, Courier bumped
into sixth-seeded Tim Henman, his opponent in Monday's Round of 16
and his victim in their last two encounters. Henman, under severe
pressure to deliver the host nation its first championship since
Fred Perry in 1936, joked that he'd been hoping for a much longer
hospital stay for the American.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi reached the Round of 16 without dropping a set,
beating Spain's 63rd-ranked Alberto Martin Saturday, 6-2, 6-0, 2-6,
6-3.

COMMENTARY: BOOKSELLER QUITS BATTLE WITH INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMBERTVILLE , N.J. _ Lambertville has dozens of antiques stores
now, nearly as many upscale bistros offering the latest variation
on frothy milk and coffee, and a handful of pretty good
restaurants, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it has no bookstore, except for the antique kind, not since
Janet Holbrook added up the years and the dollars and found that
while the rewards of being a small bookseller are great, the
profits in the age of the Internet are evanescent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the store, Rivergate Books, on Lambert Street down by the
Delaware River, is closed. A thanks-for-10-wonderful-years note in
Mrs. Holbrook's rounded schoolteacher hand is taped to the window.
The rooms of shelves are bare except for a few titles _ George
Soros' ``Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Scott Lasser's first
effort, ``Battle Creek'' _ awaiting the bulk buyer to haul what the
store could not move, even in its final going-out-of-business sale.
</P>
<P>
   Obituaries of small, family-owned bookstores seem to be
everywhere these days, and giant discounters like Barnes &AMP; Noble
and Borders usually get the blame. But Lambertville, a town of
about 5,000 in Hunterdon County, is 20 miles by back roads from the
nearest mall and superstore.
</P>
<P>
   And Rivergate Books seemed to be insulated from the lure of 20
percent off, thanks to its personal service, the roster of monthly
book-club meetings it sponsored, the children's hours it provided,
the storytellers it brought in and the art shows of children's
illustrators it spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, defied distance and back roads and even
personal ties, Mrs. Holbrook found, as it brought a new competitor
into the very heart of her store.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Barnes &AMP; Noble came in, a few people were curious and
went to look and bought some books,'' said Mrs. Holbrook, who is a
retired high school English teacher. ``But they came back and said
they wanted to be able to find things more easily and have clerks
that had an idea of what their grandchildren might like to read,
and we held our own.''
</P>
<P>
   They also came for the book readings by writers Mrs. Holbrook
found, for the cookies and cider and a chance to get a book signed
by the author _ evenings that Rivergate was famous for. And it was
during one of those evenings that Mrs. Holbrook found that her
universe had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that Gerald Stern, who won the National Book Award
for Poetry, was a Lambertville man, and I asked him if he would
come and do a reading,'' Mrs. Holbrook said. ``He gave a wonderful
presentation, and we had a good turnout, but we sold very few
books, and then I overheard one of the women who were presenting a
book for his signature say that she had bought hers through
Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I thought we were bringing something special to the
town,'' Mrs. Holbrook said, finishing her story. ``But if people
are going to bring in books that they got from the Internet, then
we don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mrs. Holbrook suggested only paperbacks for her
reading groups, and offered a 20 percent discount to members,
people started buying their copies over the Internet, or borrowing
them from the library, said Aletta Goodwin, a member of the
Thursday afternoon group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her store was always so serene and beautiful, and she was
doing so much for the town,'' Mrs. Goodwin said. ``I think she
should have had a great send-off by bopping us all over the head
and throwing us out into the street for being ungrateful
wretches.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rivergate Books is closed, and its space will probably be
taken over by another antiques store of the kind that already
brackets it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet parts of Mrs. Holbrook's legacy will live, whatever the
competition from outside. The Thursday afternoon group that was
started at the store now meets at a women's club in town, and will
carry on there. The Tuesday evening group will move to the library,
where the children's story hours that took root at Rivergate now
flourish. Storytellers like Rebecca Kelly and Jane King have made
careers of the starts they got at Rivergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started telling `Fish Tales' at Rivergate during the Shad
Festival,'' Ms. Kelly said, ``and I'm going to keep on telling
them, only at the library. Nothing is going to stop that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EWING WAITS FOR HIS FLOAT IN THE PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first Knick to walk away from the celebrating San
Antonio Spurs was the man who had not had an opportunity to stop
them. Patrick Ewing came through the tunnel late Friday night at
Madison Square Garden, a 7-footer many years in the habit of gazing
upward to avoid eye contact in moments like these. Ewing turned
right, strode stiffly down the hall and into the locker room, where
he waited for the others to come and shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   Then the door opened and Ewing was at his dressing stall, where
he has been for 14 years without once experiencing what Tim Duncan
now had in year two. Sweat glistened on Ewing's forehead, as he
spoke of the pride he had in his team and the pain in not being
able to assist it when it desperately needed his size even more
than his experience and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked if the New York Knicks could have beaten the Spurs
with him in the paint to battle Duncan and David Robinson, instead
of losing, 78-77, in game 5, and the championship series in five
games. Ewing couldn't say. No one could really say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have been a better team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fate had cut him out of the final act of the wildest Knicks'
script, in what had been a most bizarre Knicks season that began
three months late and only after it looked as if there would be no
season at all.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that the collective bargaining session that
spared these 1999 playoffs occurred without Ewing, the union
president who was adamant about not acquiescing to Commissioner
David Stern. The meeting proceeded with Ewing, in effect, benched
by Billy Hunter to help save the season that concluded with Ewing
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced into something and we took a stand,'' Hunter,
the union director, said in the Knicks' locker room, after Ewing
had finished. ``One thing has nothing to do with another.
Providence is providence. The Knicks didn't get the ring because
Patrick wasn't part of it. I believe he's destined, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how next year's playoff balls will bounce? It could be
that Ewing will have to wonder someday if he sabotaged himself, if
this whole drama was just another variation on the heartbreaking
theme of John Starks, game 7 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's ties to the agent David Falk helped create a more
militant union that delayed the inevitable and, in the process,
kept Ewing out of shape for the jump-started season. With his coach
feeling jittery about his job, Ewing played too many minutes too
soon, with an unsurprising, if not altogether predictable, result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, my injuries will heal and I'll be back stronger,''
Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks do make it back to the finals, if they should win,
then history will be revised accordingly. The Achilles' injury that
hampered Ewing's season before finally ending it will ultimately be
remembered as a painful but necessary development. His disability
forced Jeff Van Gundy, however reluctantly, to redirect his team's
focus and style. It allowed other talent and an edgy collective
character to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery Latrell Sprewell carried the Knicks with a playoff
career-high 35 points on Friday night. The calm and cool Allan
Houston had a playoff career-high 34 points in game 3, the one
Knick victory. When Marcus Camby finally played, he brought
interior athleticism unseen around these parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young nucleus,'' Dave Checketts, the Garden president,
called the players acquired by Ernie Grunfeld, the former general
manager. ``I told Patrick, `Your best chance is going to be next
season.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of a championship series slipping away,
controversies arise that are not worth the paper they are printed
on. Larry Johnson's silly remarks about ``rebellious slaves,'' for
one, would have been laughed off had they come from the mouth of
Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The only relevant Knick issue is what's next? Sprewell and
Houston do play the same position and both have enhanced market
value. Do the Knicks explore a major trade if a Gary Payton is
dangled before them?
</P>
<P>
   Standing pat is its own predicament, if a healthy Ewing expects
to lumber back down into the post and have the offense resume
running through him. The first question Checketts should ask Van
Gundy when they sit down to break bread (presumably not at the
restaurant Checketts took Grunfeld to) is if he can objectively
deal with that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was hired to please Ewing, but he has cashed in now on
the talent of Houston, Sprewell and Camby. Next year belongs more
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to next year,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   He soon took a long walk down the hall, past the mobbed Spurs'
locker room, to the bowels of the Garden. He leaned against a wall,
biting his lower lip, waiting for the black Navigator in which he
would eventually drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the television people came by to chat. Isiah Thomas gave
him a hug. There was a commotion from around the bend and Ewing
craned his neck to see. It was Duncan, the most valuable player of
the NBA finals, on his way to the interview room, news media
entourage in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The championship rings have always gone to the other stars. To
Bird. Magic. Isiah. Olajuwon. Jordan. Now, to Robinson, Ewing's
contemporary, and Duncan, this reserved dynamo from St. Croix. The
long wait continues. Is it, as Hunter said, Ewing's destiny to win?
Or is he fated to watch these parades pass by?

JAMES BOSKEY, ADVOCATE   OF CHILDREN'S RIGHTS, DIES AT 57  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., La., Mich., Md., Britain)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Bernard Boskey, a children's rights advocate
and an expert on alternatives to the courts for resolving disputes,
died on June 14 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He was 57 and
lived in North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Seton Hall
University. Boskey was a professor of family law at Seton Hall's
Newark law campus.
</P>
<P>
   His skill in settling disputes out of court, like mediating
divorce cases, led him to create The Alternative Newsletter for
lawyers and mediators, a dispute resolution guide, now in its 10th
year of publication.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote extensively on subjects that included workers'
compensation and the rights of children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He edited the ``Manual on Child Abuse and Neglect,'' published
by the New Jersey State Bar Association in 1980. He was a founder
of the association's Children's Rights Committee and he helped
shape state legislation intended to protect the children of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Boskey was born in Alexandria, La.. He graduated in 1964 from
Princeton University, where he studied sociology and anthropology.
He received law degrees from the University of Michigan in 1967 and
the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Seton Hall faculty as an assistant professor in
1971. He advanced to full professor in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 29 years, Adele Ludin Boskey, and
their daughter, Elizabeth Boskey of Baltimore.

TOMMY IVAN, EXECUTIVE FOR TWO HOCKEY CHAMPIONS, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Mass., Canada)   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas (Tommy) Ivan, the diminutive and dapper coach and general
manager who helped turn around two franchises in the National
Hockey League's six-team era, died Saturday at the age of 88.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan, who had been suffering from a kidney ailment, died at Lake
Forest Hospital in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas Nathaniel Ivan never played in the NHL during a
hockey career that lasted more than 60 years, he made it into the
sport's Hall of Fame because of his success coaching the Detroit
Red Wings and running the front office of the Chicago Blackhawks.
He was a Blackhawks vice president at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 5 feet 5 inches, he exuded strength. His effusive
nature was enhanced by his good looks and his 1930s-chic style _
his white hair combed back, his suit adorned with a contrasting
breast-pocket handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan said that he realized his future lay with his brain, and
not with his brawn, in the 1930s _ after he was high-sticked in the
face during a game in Brantford, Ontario, when he was a 26-year-old
minor leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of coaching amateur and minor league hockey,
he joined the Red Wings as their head coach in 1947. That began an
association with the NHL that would last more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan quickly broadened the Red Wings' farm system, which he also
ran. Under his direction Detroit, which had not captured the
Stanley Cup since 1937, brought up rookies like Gordie Howe, Ted
Lindsay and goalie Terry Sawchuk, who went on to legendary careers.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivan's seven seasons, the Red Wings finished first six times
and won the Stanley Cup three times.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Fischler, the author of more than 70 books on hockey,
recalled Ivan's formula for success with young players:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy used to say that you should make them practice hard
early in the morning. `If you get them up early enough,' he
explained, `they'll go to bed early enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   But despite his success with the Red Wings, Ivan wanted to run
his own show, and he knew that would not happen with Jack Adams
entrenched as Detroit's general manager. But the Red Wings and the
Blackhawks were both owned by the Norris family. In 1956, at the
height of his success with the Red Wings, Ivan left for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks were a woebegone franchise that had not won the
Stanley Cup in 20 years and were supposedly saddled with the
Muldoon Curse: Pete Muldoon, their first coach back in 1927, had
put a hex on them after he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivan had the keen eye for talent he had demonstrated in
Detroit, and soon players named Bobby Hull and Glenn Hall and Stan
Mikita were starring in cavernous Chicago Stadium. Ivan gave up
coaching to focus on his duties as general manager, and he oversaw
a Stanley Cup championship in 1961. The Blackhawks reached the cup
finals four more times in the next 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But while savoring the Blackhawks' success, Ivan also made his
biggest blunder. He put together a package of players that included
Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield and shipped them to the
Boston Bruins for Gilles Marotte, Pit Martin and a minor league
goalie named Jack Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito then helped spearhead a Bruins resurgence that led them
to dominate the NHL. But Ivan soon returned the Blackhawks to
prominence in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 he was elected to the Hall of Fame. In 1977 he gave up
his role as general manager, remaining as a Blackhawks vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four children, eight grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.

FOR SPREWELL AND DUNCAN, THERE IS LIFE AFTER JORDAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the end of this five-month sprint, Latrell
Sprewell had nowhere to go. Trapped underneath the basket with 2
seconds left, his man-to-man shootout with Tim Duncan would go down
to the buzzer. He took one dribble away from trouble only to find
more waiting for him on the left baseline, the awesome twin towers
from San Antonio closing in on the Knicks' swingman the way the
Spurs were closing in on a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get a layup,'' Sprewell said after his
last-second shot fell short in Game 5 of the finals late Friday
night. ``Charlie threw an excellent pass. I was just so far under
the basket. With their size coming down on me, I didn't have the
layup like we planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching the ball underneath the basket and trying to score is
an unbelievably tough task. On one hand, you're close enough to the
rim to touch it. On the other, you have no room to move.
</P>
<P>
   It's like playing a lockout-ruptured season without Michael
Jordan; you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. So you do
what you can to get off a shot and pray that it falls, knowing you
tried.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find solace in that, maybe you can remember the
scoring war you waged with the game's preeminent player, your 14
straight points to his 12 straight in the second half, your 35 over
all to Duncan's 31, a duel reminiscent of Dominique Wilkens and
Larry Bird in the 1988 Eastern Conference finals; how far the two
of you have come in a short amount of time, and how much the league
needed you both in these lean, post-Michael times.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Spurs won 20, lost 62 and wondered if David
Robinson would ever play basketball again. Eighteen months ago,
Sprewell was suspended from the game and Patrick Ewing's career was
in question after a freak wrist injury sidelined him for most of
the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   As franchises about to hit their nadirs in the 90s, the Knicks
and the Spurs were two of the most unlikely finalists at Madison
Square Garden. They were anchored by Sprewell and Duncan, two
players with nothing in common but their desire to take over a
game.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, an ending may have amounted to a beginning.
Suddenly, Life After Michael appears manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree was just awesome,'' said Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.
``He got on one of those rolls where it didn't matter if you were
playing up on him or not, he was making it. You just knew the way
he and Tim were playing, it was going down to the wire. I coached
Spree for two years, and when he gets on one of those kind of
rolls, you know it's going to be scary. He gets into a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   For two seasons Popovich has also coached Duncan, a player who
keeps growing with each possession.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the lockout ended in January, the disenchanted fan
had even more reason to loathe this game. Jordan's retirement on a
gray-slate day in Chicago not only created a domino effect for the
Bulls franchise, but it ushered in an era of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing success aside, David Stern's hope for the millennium
did not look promising. Too many miles on the legs of Stockton &AMP;
Malone, Sir Charles, Reggie and Patrick forced the commissioner to
entrust the game's future to a sketchy, counterculture crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson lighting up anyone he wanted for 30 points or
more. Jason Williams and Chris Webber laughing and scowling in
Sacramento. When Rasheed Wallace and Isaiah Rider went farther in
the post-season than Kobe and Shaq, change was afoot.
</P>
<P>
   There was Sprewell, the most unlikely star of all in this
post-Jordan morality play. What use could the league possibly have
for him after choking his coach 18 months ago and setting off every
racial and political hot button in sport?
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the NBA and its troubled souls became partners
in redemption. To bring people back, the league was prepared to
live with more tattoos, baggage and `tude.
</P>
<P>
   Perception not always equaling reality, did we mention that
Duncan has a pierced tongue to go along with a tattoo? If he could
blend his Generation X trinkets with an old-school game, the
thinking went, anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, he gave the league a breathtaking look at its future
on Friday night at the Garden. Drop-stepping inside, throwing up
jump hooks from 15 feet out, Duncan was the consummate big man,
conserving his aggression and strength for the right moments and
helping one of the game's true ambassadors, teammate David
Robinson, win his first championship.
</P>
<P>
   In victory, the protagonists got their rings. In defeat, the
antagonist became almost a sympathetic character, a guy whom you
could not help but feel for as he tried to launch a shot over the
outstretched arms of the 7-foot sapling in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Sprewell, vying for Michael's title on the last night
of the season. The gentle giant from the Virgin Islands, governing
his passions in a very Caribbean way as he fought for position and
rose for his shots. The tenacious swingman, exiled from the game a
year ago, clutching his fist and punching the air, each made basket
eliciting an emotional release.
</P>
<P>
   They were nothing like each other and nothing like Jordan. As
the league's golden era ends and a new one begins, perhaps that is
how it is supposed to be. &QL;

SPREWELL'S SEASON OF HITS AND MISSES ENDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the season after his exile, the private Latrell
Sprewell had rationed his deeper thoughts and guarded the personal
details of his life, the way the shell of an oyster hides a pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Pry, as you might, Sprewell resisted.
</P>
<P>
   But as the prime-time hour Friday night turned into early
Saturday morning, Sprewell finally let everyone in as he turned
Madison Square Garden into his own therapy session. He let it all
out, and he did not have to say a word.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he has a mean streak. It was on display as he sneered and
huffed like a bull when he dunked over the San Antonio Spurs'
helpless Jaren Jackson during the Knicks' third-quarter comeback in
Game 5 of the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he longs for acceptance. After a horrific 3-for-12 start,
Sprewell fed on the crescendo of the crowd's raucous support as if
it were an intravenous tube pumping replenishment into his veins as
he charged into his 43d minute.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, he had been inhuman: spinning and popping
contorted jumpers, driving through a minefield for 7-footers, and
dunking with his limbs extended in a wild flex. But finally,
perhaps inevitably for the Miracle Knicks, he missed his 27th shot
attempt of the night at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he does feel remorse. As the Spurs scattered across the
Garden floor to celebrate their first National Basketball
Association title after edging the Knicks, 78-77, Sprewell stood
alone on the floor with one agonizing thought after scoring 35
points. ``All I wanted were those last 2,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell only wanted to win. This was an element of his
personality that seemed suspect in his earliest days as a Knick _
back when he seemed indifferent to outcomes _ but it turned out to
be his driving quality in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to win so badly,'' Marcus Camby, Sprewell's
friend and teammate, said. ``You saw him leave his heart on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as you get to understand someone a little better _ wouldn't
you know it? _ there is no guarantee that he will be back next
season. There are varying theories as to what will become of a
Knick team in 1999-2000 that leaped into the arms of destiny this
season and persevered under the most adverse of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   While Jeff Van Gundy has been assured of his return, Dave
Checketts, the Garden president, reiterated Friday night that there
will be many conversations in the next two weeks with his coach and
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stick to my guns and say that I look forward to
spending a lot of time with Jeff and all of the players,''
Checketts said. ``I'm pretty certain things will work themselves
out in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means, no one knows. There is an argument to be made
for the Knicks to search for a premier point guard. If that plan
exists, does Sprewell or Allan Houston go? It would seem like a
shame. It took a while, but they proved they can play on the same
floor together this year.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston sizzled to 34 points in Game 3 of the finals,
Sprewell applauded him and said, ``All I want to do is keep feeding
him the ball when he's that hot.'' In Game 5, Houston took only one
shot in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about what Allan didn't do,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's
more about what Latrell was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At different moments, Sprewell and Houston were the only stars
the Knicks needed. If this team is anyone's team, maybe it's theirs
now. But as the injured Patrick Ewing stood in the locker room
after the game, he cast doubt on that premise. What was missing
against the Spurs? He was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have been a better team,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks had been 100 percent, if Ewing had been on the
floor, maybe they would not have run as much. Maybe Sprewell and
Houston would not have had the same chance to emerge as characters
of Garden lore for their playoff performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banged up, injured, we still had our shot to go out there and
win the series,'' Camby said. ``Healthy, it still remains to be
seen. We'll probably never get to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, Sprewell and Houston have wondered what the Knicks will
be like when Ewing returns to health. Subtly and slowly, Van Gundy
did diminish Ewing's role this season when the uptempo Knicks
bolted off the bench. Van Gundy is loyal to a fault where Ewing is
concerned, but there were more times when Ewing was used as a
trailer on the fast break and came through with the kind of spot-up
jumpers that develop when an aggressive team can drive and kick the
ball out.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, Ewing's role changed out of necessity. His sore
Achilles' did not bode well for the pounding around in the paint,
which perhaps left him more willing to go along with the faster
flow. If robust and healthy, will Ewing want to revert to the
post-up style he thrives in? If so, Sprewell and Camby could find
themselves agitated on the bench again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, I'll have to do whatever I have to do,'' said
Sprewell, who has one year remaining on his contract. ``I can do
either, start or play the other.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this, and he probably means it. But as recently as the
second round of the playoffs, Sprewell nearly jumped out of his
skin as he sat on the bench deep into the third quarter of a game
in Atlanta. Afterward, he bemoaned his sedentary life on the bench.
Even on Friday afternoon, when Sprewell was asked how Van Gundy had
handled his addition to the team, he gave a mixed review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been much like the year for the entire team,'' he
said. ``It's been up and down. But we all came together as a unit
in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everyone came to know Sprewell a little better as he
exposed his every emotion to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd has been great to me,'' Sprewell said. ``That's one
of the reasons why I want to be here next year.''  &QL;

ENTER THE KIDDIE CORPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ill., R.I., Ga., Calif., Ohio, Wash. , N.Mex.,
Canada)   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your class for the 1999 National Basketball Association draft
(if they had stayed in school): Kevin Garnett, Shareef Abdur-Rahim,
Vince Carter, Stephon Marbury, Ron Mercer, Paul Pierce and Jason
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy, yes. But not a bad start on the top 10. The reality is
that the league's early entry process is here to stay and college
underclassmen and high school seniors who have talent want to get
paid for it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a polished Tim Duncan emerging as the best player in
the game _ and serving as a blueprint for anyone willing to put in
four years of college _ it's confounding why more teen-aged phenoms
don't think twice about immediately going to work for the rest of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one of the greatest senior classes in college
history, we bring you the official '99 draft _ another kiddie corps
event to be held Wednesday at the MCI Center in Washington. It's
not awful from an overall talent standpoint. But you can count the
amount of impact players on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Chicago Bulls begin rebuilding in earnest. With
the No. 1 pick, General Manager Jerry Krause appears to be leaning
toward the bruising Duke forward Elton Brand, who quieted skeptics
during workouts when he measured a full 6-feet-8-inches tall and
showed an arm extension the length of most 7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be Scottie Pippen or Toni Kukoc, Krause is enamored
with reach and athleticism. He may still try to trade the pick if
he can get two choices in the top 10, with an eye toward taking
Wally Sczerzbiak, the Miami of Ohio forward, with one of those
selections.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the biggest question mark in the draft, Lamar
Odom. He is easily the most talented player, a 6-10 guard who can
pass, run the floor and hit the 3-pointer with aplomb. But the
Rhode Island freshman only worked out for one team, Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, flirting with the idea of returning to school, is said to
be as confused as the teams thinking about taking a gamble on him.
He did not even take the league's mandated physical in Chicago,
which has many teams concerned.
</P>
<P>
   His odyssey of the past two weeks has many league officials
directing their frustration at the National Collegiate Athletic
Association for not allowing Odom to return to Rhode Island once he
began wavering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a travesty that the NCAA did not aggressively try
to keep him in school,'' said Pete Babcock, the Atlanta general
manager. ``When Lamar Odom says, `I think I made a mistake,' and
they come back with, `You broke a rule by signing with an agent,
too bad,' it's just not right. They should suspend him for the
first game or dole out some penalty, but at least let him return to
school if he wants to. Instead, they just ignored him and turned
their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brand and Odom, Maryland's Steve Francis, UCLA's Baron
Davis and Szcerzbiak may round out the top five. Charlotte has the
No. 3 pick, the Los Angeles Clippers select fourth and Toronto is
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Corey Maggette, whom the Bulls were contemplating picking
No. 1 a month ago, did not impress scouts during his pre-draft camp
workouts and will most likely go in the second five.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe players like Duncan and Keith Van Horn, another four-year
senior, do have some influence. Twelve players withdrew their names
from the draft last week, leaving 27 underclassmen, high school and
foreign players eligible. Among the more notable names to pull out
were Weber State forward Harold Arceneaux and New Mexico guard
Lamont Long.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of Garnett, Kobe Bryant and Tracy
McGrady, this year's high school wunderkind is Picayune (Miss.)
senior Jonathan Bender, a 6-10 rail who broke Michael Jordan's
scoring record in the McDonald's High School All-American Game.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a supply of talented players at one position in the
top 20, it's at point guard. Beyond Francis and Davis, Utah's Andre
Miller, Duke's William Avery and Arizona's Jason Terry may not be
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Think the point-starved Knicks, with the No. 15 pick, are
salivating over one of these players ending up in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the multitude of underclassmen, many of whom may not pan
out, the draft has other problems. For one, the league's decision
to push the signing period to Aug. 1 from July 1 has some major
potential hangups.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a drafted player is included in a trade that
involved another player not yet under contract, the drafted player
may have to wait a month before he is moved to the team he will
begin his career with.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these kids are putting these hats on, and they have to
wait for a month to explain to somebody that they're with another
team,'' said one Western Conference team official, on condition of
anonymity. ``If we had another team pick for us with the idea we
were going to do a deal on Aug. 1, we sure would not want our new
player potentially getting hurt in a July summer league with the
team he's not even going to play on. It presents a lot of
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, teams are able to begin negotiating with free agents
and their draft picks. But they cannot sign deals until Aug. 1. The
month-long gap was installed mainly to give team and league
officials a clearer understanding of their salary-cap room before
they signed their players.
</P>
<P>
   But, like picking the first 10 players in a crapshoot of a
draft, it could lead to more confusion than clarity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STAYING A LAKER
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement released Friday from the offices of his
agent, Shaquille O'Neal, that good-natured and
committed-to-the-team center, said he decided to remain with the
Lakers rather than opting out of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille has decided to remain with the Lakers,'' said the
statement, released by the agent Leonard Armato. ``He will not
exercise his option to terminate his contract with the team and
will leave the remaining four-year term of the agreement in tact.
He is excited about the Lakers prospects for the future and is
looking forward to playing for new coach Phil Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, it was a sign that O'Neal is genuinely concerned
about living up to the expectations the city and the franchise have
for him. With so many players bailing out on their underachieving
teams instead of becoming a solution to the problem _ Shaq's former
teammate, Anfernee Hardaway, is a prime example _ O'Neal should be
commended.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? It's hardly news. The chance of O'Neal leaving the
Lakers was severely hurt when the new agreement between the players
and owners was signed in January _ an agreement that made it
impossible for another team to pay O'Neal more than the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say O'Neal is just about money; it's up for debate how
much covert lobbying he and his agent did to make sure Jackson was
given serious consideration for the coaching job. But if he left
Los Angeles for anywhere but the Knicks, his marketing power base
would have been severely crippled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISTER MANNERS
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the endless stream of press conferences, interviews and
finals madness last week was the message of a humble veteran
shooting guard whose team did not even make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In receiving the league's sportsmanship award, Hersey Hawkins
related the story of a Seattle game that got ugly this past season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played New Jersey at home, and they pounded us, beat us
real bad,'' he said. ``Everybody was upset, a lot of words being
exchanged out there on the floor among teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, we were going to get something to eat. My
oldest son says to me, `Dad, I like the way you play the game.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned back, I said, `What do you mean you like the way I
play?' He said, `When you get mad, you don't curse and you don't
yell at the other players.' And that right there told me how
important it is to conduct yourself in a good manner when you are
out there on the basketball floor. It really let me know that they
are watching everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a post-season in which Damon Stoudamire complains about
minutes, everyone complains about calls and Larry Johnson cannot be
quiet for his own good, it's a message worth remembering. &QL;

HEMINGWAY OBSERVATIONS GIVE CHARACTER, SENSE OF PLACE TO KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kansas City was a strange and wonderful place,'' Ernest
Hemingway once wrote but never published.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place where ``the food is good,'' where the people
spoke ``the purest American'' and where, frankly, some years later
he found it dull.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the city's memorable images included the warmth of
wintertime lunch wagons, the varied inventory of downtown
pawnshops, and the clouds of smoke and steam that rose from the
rail yards outside the new and impressive Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway put these Kansas City observations on paper about
1932, when he was already one of the most celebrated of American
writers. They are being published below for the first time, on the
verge of the 100th anniversary of Hemingway's birth, July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Amounting to just a few paragraphs, these fragments don't
compare in scope with the unfinished Hemingway book, True at First
Light, that is being published in July.
</P>
<P>
   But they do something rarely seen in Hemingway's novels, essays
and short stories: They give character and a sense of place to
Kansas City, where Hemingway spent 6 1/2 months at The Kansas City
Star and to which he returned from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide a small but valuable piece of evidence that
can help a reader solve a longstanding puzzle: Just what exactly
did Hemingway mean when, in one notable short story, he compared
Kansas City to Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the literary world at large has not been awaiting
this fresh Hemingway. They will find little to chew on in these
passages. But for those with an interest in how Hemingway and
Kansas City go together, these nuggets, however small, will be a
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway long appreciated the writing advice and the
shoe-leather experience he got cranking out police and
emergency-room items at The Star in 1917-18. To a Kansas City
reporter in 1940, he declared the newspaper's stylebook admonitions
_ ``Use short sentences'' and ``Eliminate every superfluous word,''
for example _ to be ``the best rules I ever learned for the
business of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet of all the places associated with Hemingway, Kansas City
ranked relatively low on his inspiration scale. It essentially was
a layover in the 18-year-old Hemingway's exuberant journey from
boyhood to the writing fame he so urgently sought.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City appears in the short stories, novels,
nonfiction books and journalism Hemingway wrote in the 40-odd years
after leaving here, it's more often as a name than as a place _
neither the place he saw nor the place he might have created in his
imagination. Hemingway never preserved Kansas City's character in
print as he did with, say, Paris or Pamplona or the woods of upper
Michigan. Hemingway probably had some Kansas City stories on paper
as early as 1922, but they would have met the same fate as the rest
of his manuscripts in progress at the time: The valise his wife,
Hadley, had packed them in was stolen in a Paris train station.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, one of Hemingway's characters admitted, without
obvious derision or hometown pride, to hailing from Kansas City.
For instance, despite his emasculating war wound, the journalist
Jake Barnes, who is the central character of The Sun Also Rises,
might have even made it kind of cool to be from Kansas City, given
that novel's breezy and boozy hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Kansas City was _ to borrow a phrase long
associated with the importance of the unstated in Hemingway's
writing _ ``the thing left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Green archival document boxes line part of one wall in the
triangular Hemingway Room at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.
The library holds the largest collection of Hemingway manuscripts,
letters and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   In one box is a folder relating to the short story ``God Rest
You Merry, Gentlemen.'' Along with ``A Pursuit Race,'' the story is
one of two (out of 50-some published in his lifetime) that
Hemingway set directly in Kansas City, not counting one
paragraph-long vignette.
</P>
<P>
   In ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' a journalist-narrator
recounts a tale he heard while visiting two doctors: A young man
arrives at the hospital on Christmas Day and begs the doctors to
castrate him because of his constant sinning. The doctors send the
boy off, but overnight he is brought back in, bleeding profusely
from the amputation he performed on himself with a razor.
</P>
<P>
   The archive folder contains two typescripts of the finished
story, which first appeared in print in 1933, and some manuscript
pages written in Hemingway's generally neat and readable hand. It's
on those latter sheets of paper that this new Kansas City material
appears. One can see how they relate to the opening lines of ``God
Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' in which Hemingway, as he often did at
the beginning of a story, sets a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the story, as published, begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days the distances were all very different, the dirt
blew off the hills that now have been cut down, and Kansas City was
very like Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one believes
this; but it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator goes on to describe a snowy afternoon walk from
``Woolf Brothers' saloon'' to the hospital, ``which was on a high
hill that overlooked the smoke, the buildings and the streets of
the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway had spent three weeks in the Turkish seaport of
Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1922, four years after his Kansas
City stint and 10 years before he finished ``God Rest You Merry,
Gentlemen.'' He was covering Europe for The Toronto Star in the
early 1920s and got to ``Constan'' in time to witness the Greek
army's retreat during the Greco-Turkish flareup.
</P>
<P>
   How true was Hemingway's comparison of Kansas City and
Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To read some of these manuscript fragments is to wonder and to
raise such questions as: What's the difference between literal
truth and a writer's truth? (``A writer of fiction is really ... a
congenital liar who invents from his own knowledge or that of other
men,'' Hemingway writes in the soon-to-be-published True at First
Light.)
</P>
<P>
   One caveat about what follows: Unpublished fragments show a
writer at work, and sometimes it's not pretty. Awkward sentence

to pencil to paper. Sometimes a writer's impulse is to just get it
down and save the polish for later. Good writers frequently note
that the real writing is in revision.

HEMINGWAY OBSERVATIONS GIVE CHARACTER, SENSE OF PLACE TO KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kansas City was a strange and wonderful place,'' Ernest
Hemingway once wrote but never published.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place where ``the food is good,'' where the people
spoke ``the purest American'' and where, frankly, some years later
he found it dull.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the city's memorable images included the warmth of
wintertime lunch wagons, the varied inventory of downtown
pawnshops, and the clouds of smoke and steam that rose from the
rail yards outside the new and impressive Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway put these Kansas City observations on paper about
1932, when he was already one of the most celebrated of American
writers. They are being published below for the first time, on the
verge of the 100th anniversary of Hemingway's birth, July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Amounting to just a few paragraphs, these fragments don't
compare in scope with the unfinished Hemingway book, True at First
Light, that is being published in July.
</P>
<P>
   But they do something rarely seen in Hemingway's novels, essays
and short stories: They give character and a sense of place to
Kansas City, where Hemingway spent 6 1/2 months at The Kansas City
Star and to which he returned from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide a small but valuable piece of evidence that
can help a reader solve a longstanding puzzle: Just what exactly
did Hemingway mean when, in one notable short story, he compared
Kansas City to Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the literary world at large has not been awaiting
this fresh Hemingway. They will find little to chew on in these
passages. But for those with an interest in how Hemingway and
Kansas City go together, these nuggets, however small, will be a
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway long appreciated the writing advice and the
shoe-leather experience he got cranking out police and
emergency-room items at The Star in 1917-18. To a Kansas City
reporter in 1940, he declared the newspaper's stylebook admonitions
_ ``Use short sentences'' and ``Eliminate every superfluous word,''
for example _ to be ``the best rules I ever learned for the
business of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet of all the places associated with Hemingway, Kansas City
ranked relatively low on his inspiration scale. It essentially was
a layover in the 18-year-old Hemingway's exuberant journey from
boyhood to the writing fame he so urgently sought.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City appears in the short stories, novels,
nonfiction books and journalism Hemingway wrote in the 40-odd years
after leaving here, it's more often as a name than as a place _
neither the place he saw nor the place he might have created in his
imagination. Hemingway never preserved Kansas City's character in
print as he did with, say, Paris or Pamplona or the woods of upper
Michigan. Hemingway probably had some Kansas City stories on paper
as early as 1922, but they would have met the same fate as the rest
of his manuscripts in progress at the time: The valise his wife,
Hadley, had packed them in was stolen in a Paris train station.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, one of Hemingway's characters admitted, without
obvious derision or hometown pride, to hailing from Kansas City.
For instance, despite his emasculating war wound, the journalist
Jake Barnes, who is the central character of The Sun Also Rises,
might have even made it kind of cool to be from Kansas City, given
that novel's breezy and boozy hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Kansas City was _ to borrow a phrase long
associated with the importance of the unstated in Hemingway's
writing _ ``the thing left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Green archival document boxes line part of one wall in the
triangular Hemingway Room at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.
The library holds the largest collection of Hemingway manuscripts,
letters and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   In one box is a folder relating to the short story ``God Rest
You Merry, Gentlemen.'' Along with ``A Pursuit Race,'' the story is
one of two (out of 50-some published in his lifetime) that
Hemingway set directly in Kansas City, not counting one
paragraph-long vignette.
</P>
<P>
   In ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' a journalist-narrator
recounts a tale he heard while visiting two doctors: A young man
arrives at the hospital on Christmas Day and begs the doctors to
castrate him because of his constant sinning. The doctors send the
boy off, but overnight he is brought back in, bleeding profusely
from the amputation he performed on himself with a razor.
</P>
<P>
   The archive folder contains two typescripts of the finished
story, which first appeared in print in 1933, and some manuscript
pages written in Hemingway's generally neat and readable hand. It's
on those latter sheets of paper that this new Kansas City material
appears. One can see how they relate to the opening lines of ``God
Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' in which Hemingway, as he often did at
the beginning of a story, sets a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the story, as published, begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days the distances were all very different, the dirt
blew off the hills that now have been cut down, and Kansas City was
very like Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one believes
this; but it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator goes on to describe a snowy afternoon walk from
``Woolf Brothers' saloon'' to the hospital, ``which was on a high
hill that overlooked the smoke, the buildings and the streets of
the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway had spent three weeks in the Turkish seaport of
Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1922, four years after his Kansas
City stint and 10 years before he finished ``God Rest You Merry,
Gentlemen.'' He was covering Europe for The Toronto Star in the
early 1920s and got to ``Constan'' in time to witness the Greek
army's retreat during the Greco-Turkish flareup.
</P>
<P>
   How true was Hemingway's comparison of Kansas City and
Constantinople?
</P>
<P>
   To read some of these manuscript fragments is to wonder and to
raise such questions as: What's the difference between literal
truth and a writer's truth? (``A writer of fiction is really ... a
congenital liar who invents from his own knowledge or that of other
men,'' Hemingway writes in the soon-to-be-published True at First
Light.)
</P>
<P>
   One caveat about what follows: Unpublished fragments show a
writer at work, and sometimes it's not pretty. Awkward sentence
constructions occur as images make their way from brain to finger
to pencil to paper. Sometimes a writer's impulse is to just get it
down and save the polish for later. Good writers frequently note
that the real writing is in revision.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway was a famous, perhaps compulsive reviser. Early drafts
were never meant to see print. Hemingway's widow, Mary, recognized
their value to students, scholars and readers when she gave the JFK
Library the thousands of pages of writing and scraps that make up
the heart of the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Item No. 426 in the archives represents a false start to the
story:
</P>
<P>
   All of the distances are changed in Kansas City now and many
streets have died to nourish the new skyscrapers and it no longer
seems as much like Constantinople since they have cut down the
hills, although the organization is the same. MORE

INSPIRED BY A PAST CHALLENGER, A DISNEY BUILDS A YACHT FOR THE
TRANSPACIFIC RACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., R.I., Hawaii)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would seem that Roy E. Disney, a yachtsman as well as Walt
Disney Company executive, would have more in-house choices than
Pinocchio had shoes to figure out what to call his racing boats.
But the 69-year-old Disney ended up choosing Pyewacket, a name
belonging to the fanciful Siamese cat in the 1958 movie ``Bell,
Book and Candle,'' which wasn't a Disney film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the 1958 movie where Kim Novak played a witch,'' Disney
said in a recent telephone interview. ``I saw the play on Broadway
too, because my father traveled to New York all the time and took
me with him. The name Pyewacket was just one of those things in the
back of my brain.'' Disney is the nephew of the late Walt Disney,
and a son of Walt's brother, Roy O. Disney.
</P>
<P>
   His second of three yachts named Pyewacket, a 70-foot sloop
designed by Bill Lee of Santa Cruz, Calif., broke a 20-year-old
record in the 1997 Transpacific Yacht Race. The 1999 rendition of
the biennial Pacific Ocean crossing, its 40th, is scheduled to
begin Tuesday in a series of staggered starts. Disney has built a
new boat for the competition, a 73-foot version of Pyewacket, which
is scheduled to set sail Saturday from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But duplicating his last boat's performance _ 7 days 15 hours 24
minutes _ might require as much wishful thinking as hard sailing.
Any one of the five big boats in Division I could win, according to
Lee, who created the regatta's most famous sailboat, the 67-foot
Merlin. Built in 1977 in an old chicken coop in Santa Cruz, the
sailboat held the Pacific record for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1977 race, crew members were still using sextants for
navigation instead of satellite-based positioning devices. A noon
position report was each race boat's only link to shore. Lee, who
was sailing on Merlin, said his boat was in a close match with
Drifter, a similar design, for first to finish. Merlin won by 17
minutes after a 2,225-mile crossing to Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really knew if we were in the lead,'' Lee said. ``On
the last day, a Coast Guard plane circled us. We could see clouds
over the island of Hawaii. Then the plane turned abaft of our beam
to go and find the other boat. That's the first we knew we had
won.''
</P>
<P>
   A change in the rules in the 1989 race allowed for taller masts
_ from about 73 feet before to 85 feet _ and for deeper keels, from
about 9 before to 11 feet now. The change made for faster boats in
a competition that is sailed mostly downwind.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike trans-Atlantic races, where upwind conditions, rough seas
and squalls are common, the Transpacific Yacht Race tends to offer
a pleasant fusion of sunshine, rolling seas and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact that when you start off California, the conditions
can be rough and windy,'' said Robbie Haines, a 1984 Olympic
sailing gold medalist who is Disney's project manager. ``But as you
cross the Pacific, the air gets warmer and warmer, the wind comes
up, and you're sailing in perfect weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest race boats are known as sleds, turbo-sleds, or
maxi-sleds, depending on their vintage. Their wide, flat bottoms
surf easily downwind, usually under huge spinnakers.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from most big Pacific contenders, Pyewacket was
built at Eric Goetz Custom Sailboats, a yard in Bristol, R.I.,
known for its America's Cup contenders. Like Zephyrus, also 73
feet, Pyewacket was developed by Reichel-Pugh, a design firm in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is concerned about Zephyrus, a two-year-old boat. The old
Pyewacket was about 30 miles behind Zephyrus in 1997 when the
leader broke its mast. Pyewacket went on to break the record as
Zephyrus fell back. Disney had not been on board Pyewacket that
year because of a broken leg from a car accident. But his son, Roy
P. Disney, accepted line honors for him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to build a new boat for 1999 came after seeing the
way Zephyrus performed before its dismasting. ``It scared us all
witless,'' Disney said. ``I looked at that thing two years ago, and
said, `I think I see the future.'''
</P>
<P>
   The three other big-boat competitors, Magnitude, Pegasus and
Front Runner, are all designed by Alan Andrews of Long Beach,
Calif. They are lighter and smaller by a few feet than Pyewacket
and Zephyrus. But any one of them can beat their larger siblings if
the wind stays light.  &QL;

 POLL REFLECTS PROGRESS IN RACIAL EQUALITY IN kANSAS CITY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN and MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability;
it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be
co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself
becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Martin Luther King Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Notes From a Birmingham Jail
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City did not rest these last 10 years, and human progress
_ at least in terms of racial equality _ rolled forward, however
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   A poll jointly conducted by The Kansas City Star and The Kansas
City Call reflects that. Conducted earlier this year, the poll
gauged area attitudes on race and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with an identical one The Star did in 1989, the new
poll showed that, in many ways, black Kansas Citians today are more
optimistic than they were a decade ago, sometimes significantly so.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, more area African-Americans are:
</P>
<P>
   - Upbeat about their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   - Convinced that race relations are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   - Confident that racism is not a significant problem in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Given the last decade's high-profile racial issues, increased
diversity training in the workplace and economic growth in the
black community, few experts were surprised by the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have black people in positions of leadership like never
before,'' said former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver. ``Blacks are seeing
all of this. It not only made them feel good, it gave hope that
things can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cleaver and others say the good news should be tempered, and
poll results show that.
</P>
<P>
   While black residents see racism declining, they still feel its
heavy presence. Six out of 10 black residents still see racism as a
significant problem; half or more expect to encounter bigotry when
they visit the Country Club Plaza, Johnson County or the Northland;
and four out of 10 still believe that race relations have either
stagnated or are getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that black people still encounter
discrimination on a daily basis, and to an extent that whites never
have and cannot understand,'' said Norman Yetman, a professor of
sociology at the University of Kansas. ``Sure, we've come a long,
long way in the fight against racism. But we've got a long, long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, black residents are likely to encounter a more subtle
racism than in the past, said Darryck Dean, associate executive
director of Kansas City Harmony, a nonprofit organization that
works to improve race relations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dean said, racism may come in the form of a
seemingly helpful store employee who actually is keeping a watchful
eye on a black customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our language has changed, what is politically correct has
changed, and people are forced to jump on the bandwagon,'' Dean
said. ``But there is still discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League, said he
still had three main concerns about race relations in the 1990s:
prevalence of police brutality against the black population; an
undercurrent message in the affirmative-action debate that suggests
black Americans are incapable of succeeding without government
help; and those who turn the welfare debate into an issue of black
inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such worries, experts and residents _ black and white _
are encouraged by the racial advances of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of progress,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Real household income for black Americans (adjusted for
inflation) increased by about 9 percent between 1989 and 1997, the
last year for which U.S. Census Bureau figures were available. In
the same period, incomes for white Americans increased about 6
percent. Still, the per capita income for blacks in 1997 was
$12,351, compared with $20,425 for whites.
</P>
<P>
   In May, unemployment among black Americans fell to 7.5 percent,
the lowest level on record, although still above the overall rate
of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in a Newsweek poll published this month, blacks were more
optimistic than whites about prospects for their jobs, family
income and educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Price said it also was hard to ignore the successes of
African-Americans in finding their way into corporate boardrooms
and executive offices in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation moves forward in fits and starts,'' he said. ``We
do not move in a straight line....Sometimes, progress is
maddeningly slow. And we've got a long ways to go before we reach
equity. But we are moving inexorably forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Some figures from Kansas City mirror the national progress.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for black residents of the metropolitan
area fell from 13.3 percent in 1993 to 8.6 percent in 1997. That's
the most recent year for which figures are available, but
economists say the rate is almost certainly lower now.
</P>
<P>
   Market research commissioned by The Star shows black Kansas
Citians today, compared with 10 years ago, are more likely to own a
home, have a college education, own color televisions and microwave
ovens, invest in mutual funds and travel for business or pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   A real-life example:
</P>
<P>
   When Beverly Saunders, now 60, graduated from high school, she
dreamed of working at a big downtown Kansas City bank. She had
typing and shorthand skills, and she had been a good student. She
also was black.
</P>
<P>
   Bank after bank turned her away, saying she wouldn't fit into
their offices and pointing her instead toward mail rooms or
companies that offered more physical labor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, her daughter got an office job with
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the job I dreamed about,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Such progress has roots that reach back to about 1970, said
William Worley, a historian at the University of Missouri-Kansas
City. That's when area housing restrictions for minorities began
eroding, and job opportunities and general social acceptance began
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts pointed to many other factors that spurred better
opportunities for black Kansas Citians in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list is a flourishing economy. Nationally, it's the
longest expansion ever during peacetime, and the local economy,
with its low unemployment, reflects that strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the economy is good, there is a lot less overt hostility
between the races,'' Cleaver said. ``When times are good, it's a
lot easier to talk about controversial and touchy subjects.''

COMPUTER ILLS CAUSE IMMIGRANTS' FORMS TO BE PROCESSED BY HAND
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Vt.)  (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After falling further behind than ever in reducing
the snarled backlog of citizenship cases, local immigration
officials have forsaken their problematic computer system and begun
processing 120,000 mislaid naturalization applications the
old-fashioned way _ by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The files, stranded in a kind of digital purgatory for up to
three years, represent the delayed dreams of that many legal
immigrants in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly two million similarly hopeful applicants nationwide,
they have waited in vain through three computer experiments, five
naturalization directors and many earnest promises for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to fix its chronically
ineffectual system for deciding who will become a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   And as they have waited, often at the cost of a hoped-for family
reunification as well as other benefits of citizenship, the
naturalization backlog has caused a new set of problems in other
immigrant services.
</P>
<P>
   In concentrating staffing and money on plowing through the
pileup of naturalization cases, the agency now finds itself with a
ballooning backlog of unprocessed applications for permanent
residency, work permits and the temporary protected status that was
offered to Hondurans late last year after Hurricane Mitch
devastated their country.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 1.8 million people are waiting for their
citizenship applications to be acted upon, about the same number as
were waiting at this time last year. To get permanent-resident
status, the immigration service said, an applicant must now wait an
average of 33 months, up from a year ago when the delay was only 21
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep making these so-called improvements and things just
keep getting worse,'' said Mark Hetfield, a lawyer at the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society in Washington, a private organization that
assists and resettles immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason,'' he added, ``the INS is cursed in that it
can never get a new data system up and running. Every time they
move toward automation, they have problems that other agencies and
businesses don't experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials do not use loaded words like ``cursed'' to
describe their technological travails. But their frustration with
the last few years' worth of computer trial and error is now openly
voiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they fix one problem, another pops up,'' said Mary
Ann Gantner, the deputy director of the New York district of the
immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   That has been particularly true for her district and for the
Vermont Service Center, a support arm of the agency that is
supposed to enter applications into a computer system so
appointments can be made to take fingerprints and interview
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, both offices have been bombarded regularly
with letters and calls from thousands of immigrants seeking
information about citizenship applications sent in 1996 and early
1997, but not acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was absolutely sure how many of these waylaid files
there were, in part because the computer system lost track of most
of the files as they were being transferred from one new program to
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gantner said she had determined that 120,000 old New York
naturalization cases from those years were ``still stuck'' in a
form of computer limbo, and so she had 40,000 of them brought as
paper files from Vermont to New York City for hand processing.
</P>
<P>
   She had to make a special plea to headquarters officials in
Washington. ``We said, send us those and we will do what we used to
do and do well,'' Ms. Gantner recalled. Her staff has now plowed
through 19,000 in the last two months and scheduled the applicants
for interviews this month and next.
</P>
<P>
   The 80,000 files that remained in the Vermont service center are
being handled manually by immigration officers there. ``We're
touching each one of them to make sure everything is correct,''
said Paul Novak, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   He has hired 30 new employees just to deal with the old cases,
bringing the staff to 48, and he said they have already processed
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they found that many applicants had never been
given an appointment for fingerprinting and so had to be scheduled
for a criminal record check. Others had waited so long for an
interview that the validity of their background check had expired
and fingerprints needed to be retaken.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Vermont cases are a full 40 percent of the New
York citizenship processing backlog, which stood at 307,000 cases
at the end of May. Only the Los Angeles district has a bigger
caseload of pending naturalization applications, with 369,000 cases
waiting for action at the end of April, the last month for which
the agency could provide statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The New York district temporarily lost more files to computer
error than other districts because it raced through more different
systems in a shorter period than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each juncture where the pipes have to meet on the system,
some cases would just not go through,'' said Mary Ann Wyrsch, the
deputy commissioner of the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else in the country, she added, is so much of the
catch-up work on citizenship being done without computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a while to realize we couldn't deal with this in a
systems way,'' Ms. Wyrsch said. ``It is terribly
resource-intensive, but now New York's productivity has gone very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But judging progress is difficult because the agency's
statistics about New York are the products of the same file-losing
computer systems that helped create the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont service center, which handles applications from the
entire Northeast and Puerto Rico, had a citizenship backlog last
year of about 300,000 cases and has a backlog today of between
350,000 to 400,000 cases, said Novak, the center director.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not clear whether the situation is better or worse
because many pending cases may not have been counted last year.
``As we clear up glitches with systems, we're better able to
identify the entire caseload,'' said Novak.

 POLL REFLECTS PROGRESS IN RACIAL EQUALITY IN kANSAS CITY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN and MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (touchy subjects)
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed to Cleaver, Kansas City's first black mayor, as a
reason for local progress. Cleaver was elected mayor with support
from white and black voters alike. And when he got into office, he
worked hard to improve race relations through such efforts as a
1996 task force, which involved people from throughout the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Cleaver had a significant impact,'' said the Rev. Kirk
Perucca, executive director of Project Equality. ``He's helped this
city deal with race issues in a much more direct and continual
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cleaver fought to use public money to improve
blighted areas that house mostly minorities. From the $22 million
renovation of the 18th and Vine Historic District to the $3 million
Brush Creek Community Center on Cleveland Avenue, black residents
saw officials working to improve inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   And there were other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Perucca credited work, throughout the '90s, of many neighborhood
groups and nonprofit organizations to improve race relations. When
a group such as Project Equality goes out to a business with 200
employees and teaches the importance of a diverse work force, many
employees take the concept home with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a ripple effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   C.C. Herbison, assistant professor of African and
African-American studies at the University of Kansas, noted that
pop culture now embraces black culture. Best-selling authors Toni
Morrison and Terry McMillan write about the experiences of black
women. Oprah Winfrey is an entertainment industry force. Michael
Jordan is, well, Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a society that is now more willing to accept
greatness, regardless of race, and that is a positive sign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe the Star//Call poll reflects those real
changes and that the results are encouraging:
</P>
<P>
   - Half the black respondents said their quality of life was good
or excellent, compared with only a third in 1989. That response
held true even for those making less than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   - The percentage of black respondents who think race relations
are getting better jumped from 6 percent in 1989 to 24 percent. A
third said race relations were somewhat better, the same as 10
years ago. Only 12 percent see relations getting worse, compared
with 20 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   - While fewer blacks see racism as a significant problem now,
more whites do _ 51 percent, compared with 41 percent in 1989. But
experts see good news even in that number.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Smith, a longtime civil-rights activist and adjunct
professor at UMKC, says whites who don't socialize often with
blacks are less likely to believe life for African-Americans is
improving. They see media stories about racial issues and are left
thinking that the outlook is negative.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says whites also do not think about the role race plays as
much as blacks do. As the '90s fostered more discussion on the
issue, whites may have opened their eyes to the problem, while
blacks saw positives in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Harmony's Dean said, the general public is more aware
of racial issues, and that means things should be getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like the Clarence Thomas issue and affirmative action
are keeping race relations on people's plates,'' he said. ``Whether
you agree or disagree, the issue is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say the good news for blacks isn't good enough,
especially compared with whites' poll responses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while half the blacks said their quality of life
was good or excellent, three-quarters of the whites did.
</P>
<P>
   And while the numbers of blacks who socialize with whites jumped
from 56 to 70 percent in the last 10 years, in many cases they may
be seeing the same whites _ only 55 percent of whites socialize
with blacks, compared with 54 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hershberger, executive director of Kansas City Harmony,
said the discussions on race relations she had heard had not all
been positive. Yes, there's improvement, she has heard. Still, too
many problems exist to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Young, executive director of the Black Chamber of Commerce
of Greater Kansas City, says African-Americans' lives have improved
little and Kansas City still is divided by race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things really aren't any better,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cleaver, the man at the center of much that happened here
in the last decade, wonders whether the progress charted by the
poll will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is not inevitable, and time is neutral,'' Cleaver
cautioned. ``I think the year 2009 will see Kansas City as a more
enlightened place. But we are existing in a hair-trigger society,
and anything _ a downturn in the economy, a race-related
catastrophe _ can set us off.''

 NEW YORK: caseload,'' said Novak. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Each new bureaucratic misfire touches the lives of millions of
immigrants nationwide who look to naturalization as the key to
unlock the benefits of life in the United States. The longer they
wait for their citizenship applications to be processed, the longer
they must also wait to vote, to qualify for some health-care
benefits, and to sponsor a spouse, children or parents to join them
legally.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenship backlog is not a new story. The waiting time for
getting action on a citizenship application took a leap about three
years ago, when anti-immigration sentiment in Congress led to a
broad cutback in federal benefits for noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   A large movement by immigrants to naturalize then collided with
the government's semiautomated processing system. Both were left
reeling. The injuries were then compounded by congressional demands
for better accountability in the background checks, which slowed
processing even more.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates on immigrant issues said blaming the backlog on
technological hiccups understates the problems of a system that is
also capricious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about backlog, because that suggests that
applications are processed in the order they are received,'' said
Dolly Hassan, the supervising lawyer for the Liberty Center for
Immigrants in Richmond Hill, Queens. ``But when I look at my
logbook I see that it's not like that at all. It's like a genie is
just pulling cases as they fly up in the air and doing them or not
doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hassan's client logbook shows more than 100 applications
filed in 1996 still awaiting a response from the immigration
agency. It shows 24 citizenship requests filed over a two-day
period in July 1997, but not one of the applicants called for a
naturalization interview. Yet people who applied in November 1997
have all been interviewed, approved and sworn in as new citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials acknowledged that computer startup
glitches did not wholly explain the troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A high attrition rate among naturalization employees in the New
York district has meant lost and sometimes forgotten files. Ms.
Gantner said that last year more officers departed than stayed and
many of those left behind an unfinished stack of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wyrsch maintained that the immigration service was close to
gaining the upper hand in its battles with modern technology. It
expects about 700,000 new citizenship applications to be filed this
year, and the agency has projected that it can reduce the waiting
time to 12 months by September.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is losing ground on other areas of service to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 877,000 immigrants who have applied for
permanent-resident status and are still waiting for an answer _ a
jump of nearly 90,000 in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers in New York City also said they had seen a
mounting backlog in a six-month-old program to help Honduran
immigrants get temporary work permits.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Greene-Perez, a lawyer with the Central American Refugee
Center in Hempstead, in Nassau County, said she had filed
applications on behalf of about 200 people in the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   Most have not received a receipt from the Vermont center for the
$175 fee they paid. Many have not received appointments to have
their fingerprints taken. And none have completed the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken much longer than it should have, just to get a
receipt,'' Ms. Greene-Perez said. ``The real frustration is that
some of their names are not even in the computer, although they had
a handwritten receipt for fingerprint fee.''

EDITORIAL: CHIMPANZEES WITH CULTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After examining the results of 151 years of chimpanzee research,
a team of primatologists recently concluded that certain behavioral
variations among groups of chimpanzees could only be called
cultural. That is, they have the ability to pass on the results of
observation and learning _ something that was believed to be a
solely human attribute.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of sleep investigators, led by Dr. Charles Czeisler
at Harvard University, has published its finding that human
circadian rhythm _ the internal clock that regulates sleep and
waking _ does not, as was once believed, differ widely from the
circadian rhythms of other animals.
</P>
<P>
   They, in other words, are more like us than we care to believe,
and we are more like them than we like to let on. If this is not
the grand theme of modern life science, it is certainly one of its
sub-themes. By using investigative techniques that are uniquely
human, we seem to be gaining a clearer focus on the ways in which
humans are not unique.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned to live with the notion of the curvature of
space. It may be harder to learn to live with the curvature of
history, to grasp that our almost deific sense of difference from
the animal creation is a latent prejudice that obscures as much as
it explains.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the cultural chimpanzees is, for some people,
particularly troubling because it blurs a boundary that seemed
especially clear-cut, almost sacred. Whenever it is suggested that
evolution has played a critical part in shaping the details of
human behavior, controversy erupts. We like to believe instead that
culture _ the arena of our freedom _ is the main determinant of
human behavior. The faith that cultural variation is unique to
humans has perhaps softened the theory of evolution for some
because it seemed to suggest that humans were liberated in a
behavioral, if not a biological, sense from evolution's rigor.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no loss in learning that chimpanzees may indeed
enjoy cultural variation or in learning that humans do indeed feel
the influence, like all other animals, of living on a planet that
rotates once every 24 hours. The mystery of our kinship with the
rest of earth's species is far greater than the mystery of our
difference.

   BUSH _ Gov. George W. Bush airlifts his presidential dream to

Hispanic community he has targeted and a cash-rich high-tech
community that seems up for grabs. But for Bush, and all GOP
contenders, the California peril lies in a fractured state party
that is reeling from defeats. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

a body. But gone are the corpses, the most compelling evidence of a
heinous crime. The story of the Izbica (Is-BEE-tsa) massacre, in
which more than 140 people are said to have been executed, is one
of seven counts in the war crimes indictment against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. Here in Kosovo that justice will be
terribly difficult to attain even where there has not been
intentional evidence tampering. There is ample opportunity for
evidence to be ruined simply by the passage of time and intrusion
of innocent people to crime scenes that have no guard, no fences or

   SYDNEY-PROFILE-COX _ SYDNEY, Australia _ Sydney 2000 backers
like kangaroos, but they'd rather you come to their country looking
for something a little more sophisticated. Discussing Sydney's
image while dining at Nick's, a harborside restaurant in the
Darling Harbour area of downtown Sydney, the worries seem
overblown: A monorail (bearing an advertisement of an Olympic
sponsor) and water ferries traverse the harbor ahead. Within
walking distance are shops, restaurants and the massive hall where
wrestling, judo and a host of other Olympic sports will be played.
This has the look, the feel and the amenities of one of THE
gathering spots during the Sydney Olympics, which start Sept. 15,
2000. And unlike Atlanta in 1996, Sydney's downtown gathering spot
already exists. ``That is one of the nice things: We've got this
great gathering spot that is already in place, waiting for the
Olympics,'' said Peter Christopher, a newspaper executive guiding a
visitor through the city. Although there are worries about the
Olympic bribery scandal affecting the organizers' ability to raise
the rest of the money to host the 2000 Olympics, venue construction
and other preparations are in good enough shape that supporters are
able to worry about things like image. (Reetz, Cox News Service)

   MEXICO-DROUGHT _ ZACATECAS, Mexico _ A late spring storm was
enough to bring out thirsty rattlesnakes in Mexico's high central
plains, but it didn't impress farmer Apolonio Hernandez. With a
face as parched and wrinkled as the land he tries to farm,
Hernandez sat impassively under a mesquite tree while clouds
spattered the ground several miles away. Once again, Central and
Northern Mexico is suffering from drought that's jeopardizing
everything from vegetables for export to beans for domestic
consumption. It's the kind of periodic episode in this central
Mexican state that puts people out out of business, communities in
crisis and sends desperate people searching for work in Mexico's
cities or in the United States. Even with rainfall, the governor
says, Mexico's water problems won't subside without a major
overhaul of agricultural policy. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). 30.

   It is election season abroad. In the past few weeks, voters in
eight nations have chosen parliaments or presidents. In several
cases _ Israel, Nepal, Slovakia, South Africa _ citizens
enthusiastically participated in a democratic choice of new
leaders. In other places like Indonesia and Nigeria, elections
marked a step toward democracy but were not completely fair. In
Togo and Malawi, they were openly fraudulent. As the world is
increasingly discovering, not all elections are equal, and some
merely create the illusion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of communism, virtually any leader who wanted
foreign aid or diplomatic recognition such as membership in
regional organizations first had to hold an election that the
international community could call legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy activists realized years ago that while elections are
crucial, they are only a beginning and do not always guarantee the
development of democratic institutions and habits. Now, however,
the world is beginning to recognize that elections often do not
even accomplish the narrow mission they are there to perform _
allowing citizens to toss out rulers who govern badly.
</P>
<P>
   It seems paradoxical, but just because people can vote for their
leaders does not mean they can hold those leaders accountable.
Indonesians, for example, made their first post-Suharto elections
this month a celebration of their new choice between real
candidates. But the leader of the party that apparently won,
Megawati Sukarnoputri, may not become president. The president is
due to be chosen in November by a 700-member assembly. Voters
picked most of the members, but others will be appointed by the
military and other groups. This gives an unfair boost to the
incumbent, B.J. Habibie, Suharto's chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
   In countries with few democratic institutions, rulers have
near-dictatorial powers and can easily find ways to rig voting. For
Malawi's election on June 15, President Bakili Muluzi replaced a
respected election commissioner with his hacks, who obstructed
voter registration in areas thought to be pro-opposition. Rulers
can also block opponents' access to television, intimidate
opposition activists and raid the state treasury to pay for
campaigns or gifts for voters. Especially in small nations, many
elections receive little outside attention until just before
election day, when international observers arrive. That leads
incumbents to engage in pre- or post-election day fraud rather than
ballot stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-Saharan Africa _ aside from South Africa _ illustrates the
limits of the world's new emphasis on elections. From 1991 to 1993,
Africa did have a handful of truly democratic elections. But
democracy activists cannot think of a single case in the last six
years in which an incumbent ran and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, many autocratic leaders do not need to rig
elections. In Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic enjoys about the same
public support he did before the war, 20 percent. But that might be
enough to win re-election, as he has used the common strategy of
dividing his opponents by offering them political posts.
Particularly where politics is based on region or ethnicity, voters
often support a candidate from their own group no matter what his
record.
</P>
<P>
   Elections, while easily manipulated, are the only system that
offers any hope of holding leaders accountable. It is progress,
moreover, that the manipulators can find themselves outcasts. But
international election observers are still too narrowly focused on
election day itself. Members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations were so eager to admit Cambodia that they seized on a clean
voting day and ignored major campaign fraud in parliamentary
elections last July.
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning international observers need independent reports on
campaign fraud before they can make judgments about events they do
not witness. That is why the rise of local independent monitoring
groups needs to be encouraged. In the last few years, millions of
people have voted for the first time, peacefully and joyfully. In
too many cases, they have not been freely choosing their leaders.
They are doubly victimized when the world persists in calling these
rigged events democracy.

 TALK-SHOW HOST PONDERS A SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As one of talk radio's original angry white males,
Bob Grant of WOR-AM has enjoyed considerable notoriety and won high
ratings by making inflammatory comments about the people who upset
him. They tend to be poor, politically liberal or black.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, Grant has been tormenting someone on
the other end of the political and economic spectrum: Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey, a virtual paragon of establishment affluence
and Republican moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has feuded with the governor since 1994, when she
chastised him for making racially offensive comments. Now he is
flirting with a run as an independent candidate next year for the
U.S. Senate seat that Whitman is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts discount Grant's very public ruminations
as a stunt to boost ratings and make Whitman squirm. But because
Whitman has never won more than 49 percent of the vote in any
statewide election, it is widely acknowledged that an independent
candidacy by a well-known conservative like Grant, who lives in
Monmouth County, N.J., could hurt the governor in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman herself conceded that point earlier this month, when she
said she feared Grant would draw crucial conservative votes from
her. The tone of the governor's statement was generally
conciliatory, but she did utter the R-word _ race _ to describe
what she said was one of the few issues on which she and Grant
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   At WOR's studios in Manhattan, the governor's unexpected
comments about race sent a buzz through the halls, and as
technicians scurried to edit a tape of them in time for that
afternoon's show, Grant appeared triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the band ready,'' Grant said. ``John Philip Sousa.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bernstein, the program director, clapped his hands and
exclaimed, ``You're gonna get a lot of mileage out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   While verbal jousting with Whitman does make good radio drama,
Grant insists that his possible candidacy is actually a matter of
patriotic duty. After nearly 30 years as the self-appointed voice
of the Little Guy, Grant, 70, says the republic desperately needs a
populist antidote to what he calls professional office-seekers who
he says control American government.
</P>
<P>
   And Grant, a man who earns a handsome salary but still brings
coffee to work each day in a thermos, says he is just the man to
remind Capitol Hill about the concerns of his neighbors and
listeners who pay mortgages in Manalapan and get stranded in
traffic outside the Holland Tunnel to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Grant said, he would try to replace the income-tax
system with a national sales tax. He would tighten immigration
laws, slash welfare and reduce what he describes as the labyrinth
of intrusive government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Grant also insists he will contribute to the nation's political
discourse by talking plainly and honestly about race, an ambitious
claim given the furor he has ignited when discussing racial issues
and black public figures in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Grant was fired by WABC in 1996 for making disparaging remarks
about Ron Brown, the commerce secretary who died in a plane crash.
At various points in his career he has called Haitian refugees
``unwashed scum'' and black South Africans ``screaming savages,''
referred to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with an unprintable
slur, and labeled former New York City Mayor David Dinkins ``a
men's room attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant now says he regrets his reference to King, but has no
apologies for his other statements. He points to the furor they
inspired as evidence of how, he says, the media and left-wing
special-interest groups have tried to stifle his speech.
</P>
<P>
   His public battle with Whitman began in 1994, when she said she
was offended by Grant's racial comments. The governor then appeared
on his show, chastised Grant and vowed that she would never return.
</P>
<P>
   Now that race is again New Jersey's most loaded issue, with the
governor having been criticized for failing to respond quickly
enough to complaints of racial bias by the state police, Grant says
he is eager to show voters how Whitman has repeatedly pandered to
minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of her biggest supporters, but she betrayed me back
then because she was caving to the black ministers,'' Grant said.
``She is still caving in to them today, and I think the voters are
going to make her pay for that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all Grant's zeal about the issues however, he still seems
uncertain about embracing the rigors of a campaign, or stepping
away from the microphone after nearly 30 years on the air.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Whitman made her comments about Grant, for instance,
he said surprisingly little to capitalize on a potent political
opportunity. The program, broadcast during afternoon drive time,
started with a brass band's rendition of ``Hail to the Chief'' and
an emcee introducing ``the next senator from the great state of New
Jersey, Bob Grant.'' Next came sound bites from Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   When the red light flashed and Grant went on the air, he mused
about the governor's comments briefly. Within five minutes though,
he was warning listeners that Democrats in Congress ``aren't
interested in gun control, they're interested in gun
con-FIS-CATION!''
</P>
<P>
   In the WOR control room, the show's producer, Roy Fredriks, was
baffled by the abrupt change of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he beating up on Clinton for?'' Fredriks asked the
engineer. ``We can get a whole show out of Whitman.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant's callers were not as easily distracted from the Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Cary from the Bronx said he thought it was high time someone
like Grant went to Washington to fight for the common man. Steve in
the Car called on his cellular phone to warn Grant that the
governor would relentlessly try to portray him as a bigot if he
continued his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that your people are going to combat that,'' Cary
said, ``by showing that you've called so many people savages over
the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant seemed buoyed by his listeners' loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do attack me,'' he said of his potential opponents,
``it will ensure my victory because people will rally to my side,''
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Off the air, where Grant's demeanor is far more genial than his
on-air persona, he said he was inspired to run by the unlikely
victory of Jesse Ventura, the professional wrestler who last year
was elected governor of Minnesota. Grant also dismisses suggestions
that his candidacy is a publicity stunt designed to reverse a
slight drop in his ratings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what happened in Minnesota, I only need 35 to
37 percent of the vote to win,'' he said. ``That's a real
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, Grant would have to either give up his show
or provide his opponents equal time on the air if he officially
declares his candidacy. Until he does, such bold predictions will
do little to sway people who suspect that Grant is simply enjoying
the chance to cause grief for Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were someone else, I'd probably think that, too,'' he
said. ``But this has nothing to do with Christie Whitman. At my
age, this is probably my last chance to do something like this. So
if I'm ever going to make a difference, now is the time.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: GEORGE W. BUSH CRAMS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When meeting with his policy experts, many of them
alumni of his father's presidency, George W. Bush is said to
project an air of confidence if not entitlement. ``I am going to be
the next president,'' he declares, according to one adviser. ``I
need your help, not to become president, but to be a good
president.'' By all accounts, the Texas governor who studied at
Yale and Harvard is not only running hard for the White House. He
is also cramming for it like someone facing the ultimate final
exam.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the faculty of George Bush University is just getting
to know its prized student. But one thing is already clear. Though
there are many Bush veterans, they are of a different cast from
those who advised his father: more conservative in foreign policy
and more moderate domestically than Republican leaders in Congress,
a fact that has begun to alarm many on the right.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy team assembled by Bush is headed by
Condoleezza Rice, the departing provost of Stanford University and
a specialist on the Soviet Union on President Bush's national
security staff. In what almost seems like a generational revolt by
the governor, the team conspicuously lacks the main players
surrounding President Bush, like former Secretaries of State James
Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger, and Brent Scowcroft, the Bush
national security aide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when you talk to the governor's people about foreign policy,
there is a tone of restoration that comes through, as if they aim
to get back to the values of strength and firmness of the
Republican White Houses of old. The governor's foreign policy
people say Bush will be more skeptical than his father toward the
United Nations and other multinational organizations and more
willing to embrace explicitly the idea of American global
supremacy. He is said to favor a tougher stance toward rogue states
like North Korea and Iraq, and to see China and Russia more as
rivals than partners, another contrast with his father.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, most Bush aides hasten to say, that the governor is
repudiating the teachings of his father. Rather, they say, times
have changed and the glow of friendship and cooperation in the
aftermath of the cold war is gone. But those looking for a
generational grudge match might find it in Bush's particular
disdain for Strobe Talbott, President Clinton's deputy secretary of
state, who is the administration's apostle of establishing a
working relationship with Russia and Boris Yeltsin. ``Strobe
Talbott has been wrong for 30 years,'' an adviser quoted the young
Bush as saying. ``I knew him at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   President Bush seemed to love nothing more than meeting with
heads of state. Gov. Bush has hardly met any, at least by himself.
On domestic affairs, he is said to have strong views, and they are
distinctly more moderate than the ones heard in Congress these
days. Lawrence Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve Board member who
is his chief economic adviser, and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of
Indianapolis reflect that attitude. On tax cuts, Lindsey talks of
cutting the marginal rates, but emphasizes the importance of tax
cuts for the lower end of the economic spectrum. Asked by The
Weekly Standard whether he embraced the traditional conservative
position of lowering or eliminating the capital gains tax, Lindsey
said: ``Maybe it's the populist in me, but capital should be
taxed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Republican leadership has almost nothing good
to say about the role of government in public life. But at his
inaugural speech as governor last January, Bush said: ``government
can't solve all our problems. Economic growth can't solve all our
problems. In fact, we're now putting too much hope in economics,
just as we once put too much hope in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors more government spending for schools and, to help
people get off welfare, for day care. Contrast that with the recent
speech by Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, citing day care as a
factor in the decline of American values.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with Congress is so great that Bush had to
reassure Republicans in Washington last week that he would not, as
some fear, run against them in the election. Those words could be
put to the test if Congress proceeds with punitive budget cuts in
coming weeks. At the photo session Bush did not appear with the two
Texans most associated with hard-line conservatism, DeLay and Dick
Armey, the House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush moves to flesh out what he means by ``compassionate
conservatism,'' a phrase that both the left and the right find
condescending, his views may rankle people in some unlikely
quarters _ the believers in global interdependence who surrounded
his father and the believers in less government at all costs who
now dominate the party in Congress. It could turn out to be a much
more interesting campaign than even the Republicans have bargained
for.

the violent years of politics in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Some
recent book interviews have focused on King's possible entry into

looting in Mitrovica. The most pressing need in Kosovar cities like
Mitrovica is for an international police force to tackle the crime
and handle the raised tension -- looting, burning and harassment --
that has flourished with the exit of the Serbian police and

KOSOVO-DESTRUCTION-2, 6-26 -- Safet Popaj, 60, leads his family
through the burned ruins of their house in Bela Crkva in southwest
Kosovo. Albanian villagers here say 64 people, many of them the
young men who were the town's future, were massacred by Serbs. In
addition to the house, Popaj says he lost about 11,000 pounds of
wheat, 6,600 pounds of corn and all seven of his cows. ``We have
had enough killing here,'' says Popaj. ``But, you know, economic
casualties -- that's 100 percent of us.'' (Tyler Hicks/New York

6-26 --Kosovo Albanians walk through a ruined section of Pec. Most
of the damage was inflicted by the Yugoslavs, but there is also
damage from the NATO air campaign. In March, with the onset of
NATO's bombing campaign, the Serbs took their campaign of
destruction to cities like Pec and Djakovica in the west and
Mitrovica in the north, acting apparently out of pure revenge, and
a desire to drive the Albanians away for good. (Tyler Hicks/New

regulators. He views with disdain the paternalism of the medical
establishment, which he says has an interest in trying to put

MRS.CLINTON-BANKRUPTCY-LAW, 6-26 -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has
been battling proposed bankruptcy legislation, is concerned about
the impact on women and children. Mrs. Clinton says that those who
can repay their debts should, and she says ``the credit industry
should be held accountable for making credit too easily available
to people who cannot pay their bills.'' She also views the
legislation as making it harder for women to receive alimony and
child support if their former husbands file for bankruptcy. (Paul

Mitrovica is for an international police force to tackle the crime
and handle the raised tension -- looting, burning and harassment --
that has flourished with the exit of the Serbian police and
military forces and many Serbian civilians and the return of over
300,000 Albanian refugees. (Tyler Hicks/New York Times Photo)

addition to the house, Popaj says he lost about 11,000 pounds of
wheat, 6,600 pounds of corn and all seven of his cows. ``We have

<P>
   As a result, in the last three years, it has opened fewer than
20 stores. In fact, industry sources say the studio closed down its
real estate operation late last year in a sign that it had ditched
pursuing new sites.
</P>
<P>
   Warner executives have declined to comment on the outlook for
the stores and whether any closures may be coming. But the studio
has indicated it has turned its back on traditional
brick-and-mortar outlets at shopping malls. It launched the
wbstore.com Web site earlier this year and named retail veteran
David Clark, who had spent a dozen years as a Target executive, to
the new post of vice president of e-commerce last month.

   As for Disney, several analysts believe the entertainment giant
faces problems of its own, though not as severe. They note that
other studios, notably DreamWorks and Paramount, threaten its core
business of animated films, which are the lifeblood of the chain of
stores. There are also concerns that sales have flattened at the
Disney Stores and by licensees.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman Selz, who recently lowered
his profit forecast due to weakening merchandise results, said
Disney needs to improve its selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question is the need to freshen the classic
characters and give them new visibility,'' Halpern. ``You have to
make sure you've got compelling product.''

WARNERS CAPS GROWTH OF CHAIN WHILE DISNEY KEEPS ON GOING

<P>
   BURBANK _ That's all, folks.
</P>
<P>
   After opening 180 Warner Bros. Studio Stores in less than eight
years, Warner executives disclosed this week they have pulled the
plug on rolling out any more of the pricey retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The final Studio Store opened at Citrus Park Town Center Mall in
a Tampa, Fla., suburb on March 5, the same day that archrival
Disney Stores debuted an outlet in the same location. Since then,
Disney has opened more than a dozen stores and will roll out 20
more this year to give it 733, including outlets in high-profile
shopping districts on North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and Oxford
Street in London.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Warner's decision shows customers may have lost
enthusiasm for expensive Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck merchandise in
elaborately designed stores, particularly without fresh characters
and concepts. Officials have admitted the stores' first-quarter
revenues declined 1 percent from the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Warner has probably noticed is that in retail, you have
to keep reinventing yourself and you're only going to be as hot as
your new items are,'' said retail consultant Frederick Marx of
Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``The easy money has already been made.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Bros., owned by media giant Time Warner Inc., insists
that stopping the expansion has been part of its strategy all
along. ``We're following our business plan,'' said spokeswoman
Barbara Brogliatti. ``We've built the stores out to where we wanted
to. Now we're growing them vertically.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultant Mark Kissel said Warner could be making a
shrewd move by limiting the number of stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be somewhat `understored' so you're perceived as
being rare,'' Kissel explained. ``I'm always an advocate of not
overbuilding your base because limiting supply creates demand. But
they may have decided that they're not doing that well and the
trend is flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The stores are taking advantage of the popularity of ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' by selling offbeat goods like
boxer shorts, martini glasses and pillows. They also offer items
from the upcoming ``Wild Wild West'' and from TV shows such as
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Friends'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming majority of stock is based on Warner Bros.
perennials like Bugs, Daffy, Tweety and the Tasmanian Devil.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, much of each Disney Store's walk-in area is
dominated by characters from ``Tarzan,'' particularly Tantor the
elephant and Terk the gorilla. The studio's 37th animated film,
which opened nationwide on Friday, is expected to be a significant
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep on giving people something new,'' Marx said.
``They don't have a `Lion King' and the items aren't going to blow
out of the store unless they're really hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney took the first step into the world of retail in 1987 with
a prototype Disney Store at the Glendale Galleria. The idea was to
take advantage of the public affection for Disney cartoon
characters by offering a dizzying array of merchandise at upscale
shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Disney had opened 80 stores, prompting Warner
Bros. to start its owns chain. Between 1991 and 1996, Warner sped
along like the Road Runner to establish itself as a serious retail
presence and went from one store at the Beverly Center in West
Hollywood to more than 160 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the chains reflected the much-admired concept of
corporate synergy by using merchandise to boost awareness and sales
of films, TV shows and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Studio Stores popped up in many of the same shopping
centers as Disney Stores such as the Glendale Galleria and Topanga
Plaza in Woodland Hills. Other Warner stores opened in prominent
high-traffic malls such as South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Del Amo
Fashion Plaza in Torrance and Santa Monica Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Warner stores exploded when they came on the scene,'' Marx
recalled. ``But these are not inexpensive stores _ they're really
works of art _ and people have moved on to other stuff like
bookstores and the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warner stores may have peaked in late 1996 when the film
studio scored a moderate hit with ``Space Jam'' in late 1996. The
outlets offered a wide variety of Space Jam apparel and souvenirs
such as a $44 embroidered sweat shirt with Michael Jordan and Bugs
Bunny likenesses.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last significant source of new animated
merchandise for the stores, because the studio's next ventures into
animation, ``Quest for Camelot'' and ``The King and I'' flopped.
Momentum also took a hit in 1997 when ``Batman &AMP; Robin,'' the
fourth version of Warner's key live-action franchise, performed
well under expectations.

REAL ESTATE: DEVELOPMENT COMES TO LOGGING TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOQUALMIE, Wash._ Once dependent on the logging industry, this
blue-collar city in the Cascade Mountain foothills 30 miles east of
Seattle is moving toward a higher-end image as the timberland owner
begins developing a huge and expensive new housing complex.
</P>
<P>
   Crews are now grading large tracts on 1,343 acres that follow
the hillsides and plateaus in the Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co.'s
Snoqualmie Ridge development, which will eventually have 2,000
housing units, a 100-acre industrial park and a 10-acre shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   The 160 ridge-top residences built so far command views of the
town in the valley below, the nearby 4,124-foot Mount Si and a sea
of mountain peaks to the east.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 units _ detached houses, town houses and two-family
houses _ will go up this year, priced from $220,000 to more than $1
million for some along the Jack Nicklaus PGA golf course, where
initiation fees are $45,000 for residents and $55,000 for
nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   Both pay monthly dues of $300. Last month, the Optiva Corp.,
which makes electric toothbrushes, opened the first industrial
plant in the complex and is now in operation with 500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have fought to make sure that Snoqualmie Ridge
will not be an exclusive enclave of perhaps 5,000 people closed to
the city's 1,500 residents. ``We want to be one community, not two
divided,'' says Mayor Randy Fletcher, who works 40 hours a week as
a machinist and won his post a year-and-a-half ago by campaigning
on a platform of controlled growth.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who rides a Harley-Davidson, has at times knocked on
the doors of new residents ``to welcome them to our town one
household at a time.'' Ten years ago residents bitterly opposed the
Weyerhaeuser project out of fears that urban sprawl and traffic
would destroy the rural valley with its farms and horse pastures,
as has happened to neighboring communities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But City Administrator Kim Wilde believes the success of the
project will assure a better future for the 101-year-old
Snoqualmie. The city estimates that in five years it will start
receiving $3 million a year in revenues from the development. Just
a few years ago the town was so poor that its waste water treatment
system was failing and, Wilde said, ``the streets were practically
dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Snoqualmie annexed the ridge property in 1990 as a vehicle for
growth because the Snoqualmie River regularly floods the town. New
King County zoning laws restrict construction in a flood plain and
it has been years since new homes were built within city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The historic, two-block-long downtown on Railroad Avenue is
lined on one side with a grocery, hardware, barber and beauty
shops, a pharmacy, an ice cream store and a bowling alley. Across
the street is a railroad yard brimming with rusting antique train
cars, a depot built in 1890, a rose garden and Smokey Joe's Tavern.
The town and a scenic railroad cater to the 1.5-million tourists
who visit the 268-foot high Snoqualmie Falls a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The Weyerhaeuser Corp. of Federal Way, Wash., has been a
presence in the valley since 1917 when it built its first of a
series of sawmills and was the valley's largest employer. But with
the demise of large old-growth timber, its only operations here are
a lumber-drying kiln and a wood-planing plant. The company employs
215 people locally, including those working in 120,000 acres of
timberlands in its Snoqualmie Tree Forest. Snoqualmie Ridge is the
third planned community that the company is developing in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council negotiated long and hard with Weyerhaeuser
before approving the project. ``People do not recognize the courage
it took for the City Council to stand up to a developer of this
magnitude,'' said Wilde. ``The city by no means rolled over and
played dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The most hotly contested issue was Weyerhaeuser's plan to
construct hundreds of expensive homes overlooking the scenic
Snoqualmie Falls. The company backed off, so the wilderness view
from the falls will be unobstructed. Only a corner of the 12th tee
of the golf course is visible.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has invested $150 million in Snoqualmie
Ridge, mostly in streets, utilities infrastructure, landscaping and
planning. Nine builders are constructing the residences, including
Weyerhaeuser's Quadrant Homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy was to position our development close to
Interstate 90 because Puget Sound is a very large market of
potential buyers and people can get to work in Seattle within 30
minutes,'' says Edwin Vetter, general manager of the Snoqualmie
Ridge project.
</P>
<P>
   To keep traffic of 5,000 new residents from overrunning the
downtown, Weyerhaeuser spent $30-million to build a 3.5-mile
parkway off I-90 through the development. The road then swings down
the ridge and ends a few blocks north of the downtown. The company
will turn the parkway over to the city.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``shortfall'' agreement, Weyerhaeuser is picking up the tab
for expenses created by the development until Snoqualmie has a cash
flow from tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now paying the salaries of 17 new city employees,
such as police officers, firemen, parks and administrative staff to
deal with an influx of residents. The city is also pursuing grants
and so far has garnered $10 million for major street, sidewalk,
storm sewer and parks improvements, and money to elevate 40
chronically flooded homes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the grants, $2 million came from the Federal Emergency
Management Administration to elevate homes in the flood plain so
they would not be inundated in the next flood. An additional
$500,000 came from the State Transportation Improvement Board to
improve streets.
</P>
<P>
   Vetter said his company had constructed a storm-drainage system
and a new wastewater treatment plant to replace the failing system,
and had expanded the water supply to serve the entire town. In
addition, the developer dedicated land for three schools and 40
percent of the development's acreage, or 538 acres, will remain in
open space or parks, including the 222-acre golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The big plum for the city is the new tax base. ``We anticipate
having a revenue surplus from the project around 2005,'' said
Wilde. Funds will go toward a new community center on the ridge,
where Weyerhaeuser has reserved a site and will donate $750,000
toward overall costs of $5 million. And a new city hall and park
are planned downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers at Snoqualmie Ridge are a mix of empty-nesters, young
couples and large families who mostly are relocating from elsewhere
in the Puget Sound area. They work at companies such as Boeing and
Microsoft, said Scott Estes, a salesman at a model built by William
Buchan Homes.
</P>
<P>
   Detached homes sell for $220,000 for 1,400 square feet with
three bedrooms, $430,000 for 3,200 square feet with three bedrooms,
$619,000 for 3,600 square feet with four bedrooms. If situated on a
golf course fairway, they start at $700,000 for custom-built homes
with 4,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Two-family houses, each unit with three bedrooms, will range
from 1,683 square feet to 1,841 square feet per unit and cost from
$254,000 to $320,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the impact downtown has been positive. At the Coast to
Coast hardware store, Robert Squibb, a salesman said, ``People say
they'd rather give us the business than go elsewhere. We've sold a
lot of lawn mowers, wheelbarrows and barbecues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser would like to expand into 800 acres adjoining
Snoqualmie Ridge and a local subsidiary of the Puget Sound Energy
electric utility, Puget Western, is proposing a development of 300
homes with a shopping center near the falls. Both proposals are
delicate issues for city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stop all growth,'' said Mayor Fletcher, ``but we can
get up front and steer.''

PRESS AIDE FOR EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE IS APPOINTED BY FIRST LADY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the verge of starting a summer of nearly nonstop
travel across New York state, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced
Saturday that she had hired a press secretary for her Senate
exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is her first high-profile campaign appointment and a clear
sign that Mrs. Clinton is shifting her attention from being first
lady to laying the foundation for a prospective Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton selected Howard Wolfson, who is now the chief of
staff to Rep. Nita M. Lowey, the Westchester Democrat who had
planned to run for the Senate seat if Mrs. Clinton did not. Wolfson
also served as communications director for Charles Schumer's
successful Senate campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson's appointment was announced three days after Mrs.
Clinton returned to Washington from a trip to Europe with President
Clinton. The announcement Saturday morning, combined with other
signs of activity in Mrs. Clinton's camp, suggests that her
political efforts are shifting into a new and more intensive phase.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's associates said Saturday that she is on the verge
of signing a lease for a campaign headquarters near Madison Square
Garden in midtown Manhattan. She and Clinton have been looking at
videotapes and pictures of houses where they might live, including
one in North Salem.
</P>
<P>
   And next Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton will travel to the upstate home
of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic senator who is retiring
at the end of 2000, to begin a three-day swing through upstate New
York. It is during that trip that she is expected to formally
announce the creation of her exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides said Saturday that they hope the
appointment of Wolfson, who has extensive experience in both New
York and Washington politics, will bring some order to what has
been the rather haphazard public face of Mrs. Clinton's putative
campaign. Until now, a number of Mrs. Clinton's associates and
friends have been speaking on behalf of the first lady's political
plans, some with knowledge, and some without.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, 32, was among a number of candidates Mrs. Clinton
considered for the position of press secretary. She had met
earlier, and was close to appointing, Dick Riley, a former press
secretary to former New York City Mayor Edward Koch, to the
position. However, when Ms. Lowey announced that she was not
running for the Senate seat in early June, Mrs. Clinton's senior
political adviser, Harold M. Ickes, arranged a meeting between
Wolfson and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson brings a number of potential advantages to Mrs. Clinton.
For one thing, he grew up in New York _ he was born in Middletown,
and grew up in Yonkers and Mount Vernon _ which is particularly
significant because one of Mrs. Clinton's potential Republican
opponents, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, has been trying to
discredit her as a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson also worked in a senior position in the last successful
statewide Democratic campaign, when Schumer was elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``His winning experience, both with Nita Lowey and Chuck
Schumer, and his knowledge of New York will be invaluable as I
consider a run for the Senate,'' the first lady said in a
statement.

CLINTON PLANS TO CUT LONG-TERM COST OF MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to clarify poverty level in 2nd-to-last graf of 1st take.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will try to reconcile two
seemingly contradictory goals this week when he unveils a plan to
cut the long-term cost of Medicare while expanding the program to
cover prescription drugs, administration officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would make structural changes in Medicare to encourage
competition and efficiency in the care of the elderly and the
disabled. It would also require major new infusions of cash from
the federal treasury, said officials who are putting final details
of the plan in place.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Clinton would insist that the government
offer drug coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. Drug
coverage should be ``universal, voluntary and heavily subsidized,''
a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Republicans and some Democrats in Congress want to
start gradually, by covering medicines for the lower-income
beneficiaries who most need assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens to his proposal, Clinton will reshape
the debate simply by demanding that coverage of prescription drugs
be made available to all Americans over the age of 64 and to those
of any age who are severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying that the benefit has to be universal is a major
contribution to the debate,'' said Martin Corry, director of
federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Though often lost in the hubbub over new benefits, the original
reason for trying to redesign Medicare was to avert a financial
crisis. Administration officials said the president's plan would
keep Medicare solvent in these ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would steer Medicare patients to
certain hospitals that promise to give the government a deep
discount on complicated, expensive procedures like heart bypass
surgery and hip replacement operations. Many studies have found a
higher quality of care at hospitals that perform a large number of
such procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare would use competitive bidding to buy a wide range of
goods and services, including hospital beds, wheelchairs and other
medical equipment. The government would also try to negotiate
prices far below those set in existing fee schedules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare would get a huge infusion of cash from the treasury:
$700 billion, representing 15 percent of federal budget surpluses
anticipated over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable transformation seems to have occurred in the last
year. The question now is not whether Medicare should cover
prescription drugs, but how.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements over that question, including the sheer complexity
of designing a benefit affordable to both elderly people and to the
treasury, could easily stymie efforts to provide drug coverage in
this Congress. But the issue will become more urgent as 76 million
baby boomers qualify for Medicare over the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said:
``The desired outcome is to cover prescription drugs for everybody.
That's the approach we're contemplating. Large numbers of middle-
and upper-income Medicare beneficiaries have little or no drug
coverage, but high out-of-pocket drug costs. If you target the
solution to low-income people, you're not taking care of the
problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries have paid for Medicare throughout their working
careers,'' Jennings said. ``If you say that certain people on
Medicare can have drug coverage and others don't, you will
undermine the broad support that exists for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will depict drug coverage as one element in a
comprehensive plan to shore up Medicare, White House officials
said. But health policy experts and politicians doubt that Medicare
can be ``fixed'' by the passage of one bill, however comprehensive.
In the next two decades, they predict, Congress will continually
tinker with the program, searching for ways to enhance benefits
while trimming payments to hospitals, doctors and other health care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every type of health care provider is pleading with
Congress to restore Medicare money cut just two years ago by the
Balanced Budget Act. Thus, beneficiaries, eager for drug coverage,
and health care providers have competing claims to the same pot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were ready to portray the
coming debate over Medicare as a struggle between needy
beneficiaries and a greedy health care industry. So far, they said,
the 1997 cuts appear to have done more harm to the financial
condition of the industry than to the health of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes, home care agencies and health maintenance
organizations have been complaining bitterly about the cuts. But
Corry of the AARP said, ``There has not been a spontaneous outcry
among beneficiaries, or an upsurge in complaints about denial of
access to home care, nursing homes or hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton describes affordable prescription drugs as ``the
greatest growing need of seniors.'' And he notes that drugs have
become an integral, indispensable part of modern medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people use one-third of all prescription drugs sold in
the United States. On average, each Medicare beneficiary has more
than 18 prescriptions filled each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House says that 15.5 million Medicare
beneficiaries have no insurance for prescription drugs, and 6
million of those beneficiaries have incomes more than twice the
official poverty level. The poverty level this year is $8,240 for
an individual and $11,060 for a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every member of Congress has heard pleas from
constituents unable to afford medicines they need. ``The public in
America is getting gouged,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.
``That's what our constituents tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is cautious, and the reason can be summarized in
one word: cost.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 to 1997, national spending on prescription drugs grew
by an average of 11 percent a year, which is more than double the 5
percent rate for health care spending overall. The increase
reflects the development of new, more expensive, more effective
drug therapies and greater use of prescription drugs, driven in
part by more aggressive marketing aimed directly at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and health maintenance organizations report that drugs
are their fastest-growing cost.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal-state program for poor families, does
cover prescription drugs, and even though it gets substantial
discounts from manufacturers, Medicaid now spends more on drugs
than on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Concannon, the commissioner of human services in Maine,
said the state's Medicaid program spent $140 million a year on
prescription drugs, compared with $40 million on doctors' services.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen deMontmollin, vice president of AvMed Health Plan, a
large nonprofit HMO in Florida, said drug spending for his members
rose 33 percent last year, to $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last week, Republican senators like
William Roth Jr. of Delaware, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John
Chafee of Rhode Island expressed support for Medicare coverage of
drugs, but said it should be provided first to the neediest
beneficiaries. Moderate Democratic senators like John Breaux of
Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
expressed the view of the Republican majority. He cautioned against
``any rich new benefit'' and said, ``A targeted approach, focusing
on low-income seniors, is the best solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux was chairman of a 17-member commission that was supposed
to advise Congress and the president on the future of Medicare. The
panel did not agree on much, but did provide authoritative
bipartisan backing for the view that Medicare is antiquated because
it does not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux proposed drug coverage for 3 million low-income
beneficiaries, and he said it would cost the government $60 billion
over 10 years. The White House rejected the proposal as
``inadequate and inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Reps. Henry Waxman and Pete Stark of California, agree with
Clinton that drug coverage should be available to all
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a premium of $45.50 a month.
Under current law, with no change in benefits, the monthly premium
is expected to double in a decade, to $101 in 2009. Any premium for
prescription drug coverage would be added to that.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the poorest
people would not have to pay the full premium for drug coverage
under Clinton's plan. ``Some people will get help with the premium
at the lower end of the scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer
group, said, ``It makes sense for seniors to pay a significant part
of the cost through a premium.'' But, he said, it is ``absolutely
essential'' for the government to pay the premiums for Medicare
beneficiaries with incomes as much as 35 percent above the poverty
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administration officials told me they were willing to pay the
full premium on the drug benefit for people with incomes up to 120
percent of the poverty level,'' Pollack said. ``I urged them to do
better than that, to go to 135 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-income beneficiaries are already eligible for federal
assistance in paying their basic Medicare premiums. But in studies
going back to 1991, Pollack has repeatedly documented the failure
of the federal government and the states to locate the people
eligible for such subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials have told the White House that if Medicare
begins to cover prescription drugs, many more low-income people
would have an incentive to step forward and claim the federal
subsidies to which they are entitled.

LONG ISLAND HOUSING BOOM CAUSES NEW THREAT TO EASTERN BLUEBIRD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OYSTER BAY COVE, N.Y. _ The Eastern bluebird, which returned to
nesting grounds in western Long Island five years ago after a
50-year absence, remains a determined if tenuous resident in a
sprawling meadow nature preserve here, fighting off sparrow hawks
and Wall Street bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Naturalists warn that the continuing survival of the
rusty-breasted songbird along the North Shore is threatened by a
recent wave of housing development, paid for with hefty Wall Street
profits, on the remaining fragments of old Gold Coast estates.
</P>
<P>
   The new construction has displaced feathered and furry refugees
who have fled to the 197-acre Tiffany Creek Preserve here and to
other North Shore wildlife sanctuaries. Forced from their old
hunting grounds, sparrow hawks and other predators have taken up
new posts atop the slant-roofed birdhouses designed by
ornithologists to attract the bluebird, the state bird of New York
and long a favorite of poets and songwriters as a symbol of
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bluebirds came first, and then the ospreys,'' said Allan
Lindberg, a wildlife biologist and supervisor of the North Shore
Greenspace Preserves for the Nassau County Department of Recreation
and Parks. The network includes Tiffany Creek, just south of Oyster
Bay; the nearby Muttontown Preserve, and three salt marsh
sanctuaries in Mill Neck, Bayville and Glen Cove.
</P>
<P>
   The bluebird has become somewhat of a wildlife barometer for
naturalists. The latest reading indicates that the songbird is
showing signs of pressure, said Lindberg, whose efforts are
regarded on Long Island as the most successful in attracting the
birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their population no longer appears to be growing as much as it
was, but it appears stable, and it's not declining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has kept an official count of the Eastern bluebird
population, Lindberg and other naturalists estimated that at least
two dozen pairs have been seen in western Suffolk and Nassau
Counties this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Recently at Tiffany Creek Preserve, a swift sparrow hawk, which
is a little larger than a blue jay, stood atop one of the 12
slant-roofed bluebird houses built during past winters by
carpenters in a Nassau parks department workshop and placed by
Lindberg on posts in a vast meadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hawk is no doubt using it as a promontory to survey his
hunting ground,'' forcing bluebirds to seek safer nesting spots
elsewhere, Lindberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that bluebirds naturally face a lot of competition for
nesting space from the more aggressive tree swallow. Three other
bluebird houses on the grassy knoll were occupied by swallows,
including several fledglings that huddled together atop one of the
weathered wooden houses, testing their wings. Fortunately for them,
there were no young sparrow hawks testing their hunting skills.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th house, tucked away in the northwest corner of the
meadow, not far from three giant red oaks, was a family of
bluebirds, apparently trying to raise a second brood. They laid
their first set of eggs in late April, and now they feed their
young with insects they gather in the meadow.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern bluebird ranges east of the Rockies, wintering in
the South and breeding in the North. The heaviest concentration of
Eastern bluebirds in New York is in the Hudson River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our final goal is to get the fledglings to stay and build
their nests the old-fashioned way in old crab apple trees and other
tree cavities,'' Lindberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten miles northeast of Tiffany Creek, at the Caumsett State Park
on Lloyd Neck, just over the line in Suffolk County, naturalists
installed nearly 50 birdhouses over the last three decades, and
these failed to attract any bluebirds until this year, said Herman
Wenz, a retiree of the Grumman Corp., who has tended them with his
son, Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a hundred birdhouses are maintained on the 2,400 acres of
preserves operated by the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge
Complex, which spans Nassau and Suffolk Counties, much of it along
the South Shore, said Robert Parris, the deputy project leader.
``The suburbs continue to encroach on us, but we've had a lot of
support from local and natural resource groups,'' Parris said. He
said he has seen as many as eight pairs of Eastern bluebirds along
his nature trails this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under a little less pressure here than they are on the
North Shore, and we've had our best year yet for bluebirds ever
since we put the boxes in eight years ago,'' Parris said, referring
to the birdhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one pair feeding fledglings in a house not far from my
office window,'' he said. ``I keep seeing this streak of blue going
back and forth.''

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ David Blinken stood high above the water
line in Napeague Bay, on the poling platform rising above the
outboard engine of his 20-foot flats skiff. Balancing himself with
a 20-foot-long black pole, he braced his thick legs as a mild swell
rolled the boat, causing the platform _ a panel of white fiberglass
hardly larger than your typical bathmat _ to tilt. It was a stunt
worthy of a circus, and I imagined that Blinken was a 1,000-pound
baby elephant, dressed in a pink tutu. Blinken's excited voice
quickly dispelled the fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, fish ahead,'' he barked. ``Gimme a throw, 50 feet, at two
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   I cast from the bow, futilely trying to spot the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go right,'' Blinken called, judging the length and direction
of my cast. ``A little more line. Go right. OK, drop it. Drop it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly, a brown and green concoction with a tiny dumbbell tied
in at the front for eyes, hit the water with a plop. The coaching
resumed, in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip hard,'' Blinken repeated. ``Slow. Twitch it, stop. Short
strip, let it drop, he's on it, come on _ eat it, eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, the big striped bass decided to pass on the
morsel. I tried to imagine what it must be like to refrain from
grabbing, say, a deviled egg drifting past my own nose, and
realized that there really is a reason why so many people watch
television shows like ``The X Files.'' If you're going to
sight-fish on the saltwater flats, make room in your life for a
little mystery. And prepare to accept rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those stones?'' Blinken said, as he leaned into his
push-pole and slid us along in about 20 inches of water, along a
stretch of beach between Napeague and Gardiners Bay. ``They were
ground up and dumped there by glaciers.''
</P>
<P>
   The cobbled bottom below the boat was more like the floor of a
trout stream than a tidal flat. The colors were autumnal, with
patches of pine-green kelp and red slipgut scattered among amber
and brown stones polished to the consistency of dinner rolls. If
the appeal of blue water stems from our age-old fascination with
the unseen _ Gee, I wonder what's down there? _ the beauty of the
flats lies in things observed.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing the flats _ the ``skinny water'' in anglers' language _
is a time-honored art among bonefish and tarpon anglers in southern
Florida and the Caribbean. But it is a relatively new practice in
the Northeast. Blinken, 38, whose operation is called North Flats
Guiding, is one of a handful of guides who have successfully
adapted the gear and techniques developed in the south to the quest
for stripers and blues in the labyrinth of bays, estuaries and
flats of the east end of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   A flat is any significant expanse of shallow water from a few
inches to 2 feet deep, with an even bottom. To many people, a flat
appears to be an utterly useless place, since you can't swim,
Jet-Ski or surf in it. But for the flyfisher there's nothing
socially unacceptable about being on the bay side of the Hamptons'
sandy beaches, because the flats are essentially critical, wetland
environments where life is manufactured from two of its main
ingredients: light and water. The fertility of a flat makes it an
ideal nursery for small fish and crustaceans, and that in turn
makes a flat the ideal stomping ground for big, predatory gamefish
when the tide, light, wind direction and water temperature invite
marauding.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., at peak heat on an already hot day, Blinken poled
along a place he calls Dead-Tree Flat. We were, as he likes to say,
``looking for shadows'' _ the ghostly gray forms of striped bass
searching for pods of the baitfish called sand eels, or crabs.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to spot fish before they spot you is a critical and
challenging component in sight fishing, for a couple of reasons.
For one, the medium of water dramatically shrinks anything in it,
to the extent that even in only 2 feet of water, a 36-inch fish
looks hardly larger than a loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   For another, unlike a loaf of bread, a fish is packaged to blend
into rather than stand out from its surroundings. And, as any
veteran angler will tell you, the notion that water is transparent
is myth. Water can be as opaque as a slab of obsidian, or as
translucent as air. It all depends on the angle and availability of
the light.
</P>
<P>
   I stripped the fly fast, getting it in front of the bass, and
upon command I let it drop. We saw the inside of the bass' great
mouth, dazzling white and large enough to inhale a softball. In a
moment I was tight on the fish, and it shattered the stillness on
the flat with its first, angry thrashing.

REAL ESTATE: EFFECTIVE RENT INDEX ATTEMPTS TO COMPARE COSTS OF
CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass., N.J.) (rk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1980s Julien J. Studley, the chairman of the
brokerage firm that bears his name, noticed an unusual development:
even though demand for office space was weak and landlords were
clamoring for tenants, the asking rents for properties kept rising.
``For two years the market fell, but rents seemed to keep
increasing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the seeming paradox was easily explained. Although the
asking rent figures were bumping up, building owners were giving
larger and larger concessions packages _ periods of free rent and
contributions to the cost of interior construction _ to attract
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the effective rent that tenants were paying
was declining _ as it should in a soft market.
</P>
<P>
   But some owners, Studley said, had an interest in maintaining
the fiction that the market was still strong and rents increasing
so that they could complete financing arrangements that let them
pull most or all of their investment out of a property. ``A lot of
lenders who did not look closely enough at these deals ended up
taking back the buildings'' when owners could not cover their debt
payments, Studley said.
</P>
<P>
   Something of a reverse happens in rising markets. Landlords
typically prefer to shrink the concessions package, rather then
scare tenants off with big increases in asking rent, although the
effective rents reflect the shift in the supply-demand equation.
</P>
<P>
   But while the asking rent figure does not tell the whole story,
Studley said, it is the only easily available number in a highly
fragmented and competitive business. Real estate has no equivalent
of a stock market, where prices are determined continuously in an
open market and are widely disseminated to all that are interested.
</P>
<P>
   So, Studley said, he decided to compile what he called an
effective rent index, one that would reflect concessions packages
as well as expenses that tenants incur, such as the cost of
electricity. The idea was to give a clearer year-to-year comparison
of what was happening to rents and to provide an easy comparison
between the central business districts in a dozen major cities.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that midtown Manhattan is the most expensive
market in the country for tenants, but that high costs hold down
landlords' income. Rents for tenants in downtown Manhattan and New
Jersey are close, but again higher costs in New York mean landlords
there keep a lower portion of their rents than do building owners
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although others may challenge his results and methodology, the
Studley effective rent report represents an interesting attempt to
cut through the complexity and clutter that make it hard to get a
clear picture of what is happening in important commercial real
estate markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only information that's available is asking rents,''
Studley said. ``Now you can take the asking rent and apply a
discount, but the discount changes, so that is unreliable as well.
In some market conditions, the taking rent exceeds the asking
rent.'' That means that the demand for space in certain locations
is so great that tenants bid the rent above what the landlord
originally asked.
</P>
<P>
   Although Studley's firm usually represents tenants, he said it
is important to understand what a landlord actually has in his
pocket after paying operating expenses, taxes on a property,
concessions and commissions, but before debt service. Because
financial structures are complex and vary from property to
property, they would make year-to-year and city-to-city comparisons
difficult and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Also excluded is the so-called loss factor, the difference
between the amount of space a tenant is paying for under the lease
and the amount he can actually use. This is part of the twilight
zone of real estate, in which steel and concrete buildings change
in size as they are remeasured. ``Buildings in New York grow larger
as they age _ like people,'' Studley observed.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this figuring leads to two separate indexes, the
tenant effective rent and the landlord effective rent. The tenant
effective rent is the estimate by the Studley firm of what a tenant
actually pays after concessions are amortized over the length of
the lease.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord effective rent is the estimate of what a building
owner has after paying the costs, although some costs, like
electrical power, are passed on to the tenant. ``We are developing
a figure for a free and clear cash flow,'' said Mark Stewart, a
managing director at the Studley company who compiles the report.
</P>
<P>
   Because owning property is largely a fixed-cost operation,
seemingly modest increases in rental income, which is customarily
stated in dollars per square foot per year, can produce big changes
in the owner's income. ``If you have a $32 a square foot, operating
expenses, taxes and so forth will typically consume $26 a foot,
leaving the owner with $6 a foot in income,'' Studley said. ``But
if the rent increases to $38 a foot, he doubles his income.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Studley company's figures, the landlord
effective rent in downtown Manhattan increased from a slender $8.69
a square foot to $13.76 a square foot from the end of 1997 to the
end of 1998. This increase was caused both because the tenant
effective rents increased somewhat _ from $25.51 a square foot to
$31.32 a square foot _ and because concessions decreased, from $77
a square foot in 1997 to $60 a square foot the following year. The
concessions are a one-time expense to the landlord and are
amortized over an assumed 10-year lease in making the calculations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, operating costs and taxes were rising, so that
landlords' cash flow rose $5.07 a square foot, even though the
tenants' effective rent had increased $5.81 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The story in midtown was somewhat different. The concessions
package remained constant at $55 a square foot while the tenant
effective rent increased from $43.47 a square foot to $47.16.
Although that represented an increase of $3.69 a square foot,
landlords got only an increase of $3.33 a square foot, once again
as a result of higher operating expenses and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river in New Jersey, concessions stayed the same, at
$20 a square foot, while tenant effective rents increased $1.18 a
square foot, from $28.59 a square foot to $29.77. But landlords got
only an increase of 91 cents a square foot because of higher
operating and electricity costs.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of any concessions package is a period of free rent,
which was originally thought of as the time a tenant could not use
the space while its offices were being constructed. In periods of
slack demand, landlords will extend this period from a few months
to years as an incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Studley said this type of concession has special appeal for
tenants, particularly in tough economic times. ``Tenants look at
transactions on a discounted cash flow basis,'' he said. ``The
dollars up front are the most important to them. Owners are more
willing to take up-front costs than tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   The effective rent report also allows for easy comparisons of
different markets. It will probably come as no surprise that
midtown Manhattan is the most expensive market for tenants, with a
rental rate of $47.16 a square foot after adjustment for the free
rent period and construction allowance, followed by San Francisco
at $42.10 a square foot and Boston at $39.89.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Manhattan is in the middle of the pack for tenants at
$31.32 a square foot, with downtown Los Angeles the cheapest at
$19.54. The New Jersey office market is only slightly cheaper than
downtown Manhattan, at $29.77 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   But high costs in New York reduce the landlords' effective rent
in midtown to $25.97 a square foot, well below the $29.12 a foot
building owners collect in San Francisco. Similarly, lower costs
mean that landlords in New Jersey get $17.68 a square foot compared
to $13.76 in downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the high cost of New York is real estate taxes, which
are usually passed through to tenants and which stood at $9.30 a
square foot in midtown Manhattan, compared to $8.08 in Chicago and
$6.35 in downtown Manhattan. Downtown Los Angeles levies just $1.96
a square foot in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the other suburban areas of New York, the report found that
tenant effective rents increased 9 percent year to year in
Westchester County to an average of $24.48 a square foot, and 7.5
percent, to $26.62 a square foot, in Long Island. But tenant
effective rents actually dropped 4.7 percent to $30.93 a square
foot in Fairfield County, Connecticut, following a strong market in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   One other area where Manhattan leads the nation is in the cost
of electricity, which is calculated at $2.20 a square foot both
midtown and downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Studley warned that the price of electricity is not the same in
all buildings because some landlords tack on a markup to improve
their own effective rents. ``In most cases, tenants are better off
with their own meter,'' he said.

NEW YORK 5-ALARM FIRE LEAVES FAMILIES HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A five-alarm fire that began Saturday morning in the
storage yard of a plastics factory in the Astoria section of Queens
destroyed at least eight nearby apartments and may leave as many as
32 families temporarily homeless.
</P>
<P>
   No residents were injured, but at least three of the 225
firefighters battling the blaze were sent to local hospitals, one
to be treated for burns, two others for dehydration, according to
William Feehan, first deputy commissioner of the New York Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were on the scene by 11:08 a.m., within five
minutes of the first alarm, Feehan said, but more than two hours
and 52 engines later, there were still flames shooting from beneath
the fallen tin roof of a shed in the storage yard of the company,
Pop Display.
</P>
<P>
   Among the manufacturing materials stored in the factory were
drums of motor oil and hydraulic fuel, cases of styrene plastics
and propane cylinders, which caused several explosions as they
caught fire, Feehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Shane, 52, who has lived in the apartment building next to
the factory for 28 years, said: ``It felt like something blowing
up. I didn't think anything of it. Then a couple of minutes later I
heard another boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shane, who was watching television at the time, said her
brother-in-law alerted her to the fire by telephone, and she and
several other residents of the four-story building fled as the
first engines were arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters evacuated other families as flames reached all
eight apartments facing the factory yard, as well as the building's
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelia Snedeker, a resident, said she had fed the stray cats
in the factory yard Saturday morning around 9:30 as usual, then
returned to her apartment to eat breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just smelled smoke,'' she said. ``They knocked on the door _
the police. I saw the smoke. I heard a lot of explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of area residents swarmed on the sidewalks surrounding
the burned buildings as the black smoke in the sky blocked the sun.
Maria Cardenas, 38, a mother of two, was at the supermarket with
her 4-year-old son, Jesse, then returned around 11:30 a.m. to see
her apartment building in flames, with many of its windows
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `My son, where is my son?''' Mrs. Cardenas
said in Spanish, referring to her older boy, Johnny, 15. She found
him with neighbors about five minutes later. ``I feel desperate. I
don't have an apartment. My things are destroyed. I don't know what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross arrived by 12:30 p.m., and offered shelter to
displaced residents.
</P>
<P>
   Feehan said investigators had not established the cause of the
fire.

A FEW MORE RUSSIANS ARRIVE IN KOSOVO

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A detachment of Russian troops flew into
the airport here Saturday, defusing a potentially explosive rift
with NATO peacekeeping forces and offering reassurance to Serbs
losing faith in NATO's ability to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The 39 paratroopers and technical specialists who arrived in the
capital city of Kosovo province were the first of an expected 3,600
Russian troops expected to arrive over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They will be grafted on to the 22,000 soldiers of the NATO-led
KFOR peacekeeping force patrolling the streets of a province still
simmering with tension, as returning Albanians take sometimes
deadly revenge on Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Kosovo's Serb minority, meanwhile, continued to flee
in steady numbers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO hopes the Russians, who have a historic kinship with Serbs,
will help stem the flight of Serbs who feel threatened by the
majority ethnic Albanians. The Albanian refugees have returned with
stunning swiftness after being driven from their homes to refugee
camps in Albania, Macedonia, and the Yugoslav republic of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and French transports were the vanguard of a dozen
flights _ half of them Russian and half NATO _ expected over the
next 10 days. They will bring crews and equipment to make the
airport fully operational for military and humanitarian flights.
</P>
<P>
   The precise role of Russian troops in the KFOR mission remained
the subject of tortuous negotiations between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   British Lieutenant General Sir Michael Jackson, commander of the
peacekeeping force, joined Russian Colonel General Viktor Zavarzin
at a press conference, and both stressed that they were now
cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   As they spoke, British and Russian troops mingled on the tarmac.
On the terminal building, a Russian flag and the flag of Russian
airborne forces flew side by side, with a British flag off to one
side.
</P>
<P>
   The military leaders stood side-by-side and said reopening the
airport was a crucial step in international efforts to rebuild
Kosovo, which suffered widespread devastation both from the Serb
campaign against the province's ethnic Albanian majority and from
NATO's air campaign to halt the Serb action.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said any diplomatic rifts that developed over the
incident had been healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased to get every soldier I can at the moment,''
Jackson said, referring to NATO's attempt to keep control of the
situation in Kosovo by accelerating deployment of an eventual
55,000 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Ilyushin-76 troop transport and an almost
simultaneous French flight were the first aircraft to arrive at
Pristina's Slatina Airport since a dispute between Russia and NATO
over control of the strategic facility threatened the Kosovo peace
mission.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked the end of a standoff that began June 12 when 200
Russian soldiers from Bosnia occupied the airport, catching NATO by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of thousands of peacekeepers, a climate of
lawlessness continued in the province. On Friday, 14 Serb civilians
were reportedly killed in the space of 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   One flash point between Serbs and ethnic Albanians was the
northern town of Mitrovica, where the leader of the ethnic Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army arrived Saturday to defuse mounting
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci told ethnic Albanians in the town, where a bridge
over the River Ibar has become a dividing line of barbed wire,
tanks, and shouting between the communities, that Serbs should be
allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should realise that everyone who wants to live in Kosovo
should live in Kosovo,'' he told a crowd of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   With the flood of returning refugees cresting in recent days,
the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said it would
begin a full-scale operation Monday to provide transportation and
aid to returning families.
</P>
<P>
   Many families are returning to burned-out homes and chilling
evidence of the murderous campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' carried
out by Serb forces. Thousands have ignored pleas by UN officials
and even President Clinton, during his tour of a refugee camp in
Macedonia this week, that they wait in the camps until land mines,
littered throughout the countryside, could be identified and
clearing begun.
</P>
<P>
   More than 330,000 have returned in the two weeks since NATO's
11-week air war against Yugoslavia ended. About 800,000 Kosovo
Albanians had fled Serb terror to Macedonia, Albania, and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern town of Lipljan, British soldiers arrested a
member of the Serbian Interior Ministry whom they accused of
involvement in as many as 56 deaths in Kosovo, a British forces
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   British Lieutenant Colonel Robin Hodges did not identify the
suspect.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves are prepared to be patient with 21-year-old
fifth starter Odalis Perez, and losses in his last three starts
don't change that. Perez lost the series opener to the Mets after
throwing a season-high nine strikeouts before allowing three runs
in the sixth inning to fall to 4-5 with a 5.42 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning up here in a very difficult situation,'' manager
Bobby Cox. ``He's holding his own. As bad as it may seem, it's not
that bad. Winning is everything with this team right now, but I
like him. I think we can bring him along.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Braves have been able to develop their
fifth starter in the minorleagues, pitchers like Terrell Wade and
Jason Schmidt, but in this case, with Denny Neagle traded away and
Kevin Millwood in the No. 4 spot, the Braves are prepared to train
Perez on the job and deal with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put him in there and left him in there,'' Cox said.
``He's more than holding his own.''
</P>
<P>
   In his loss in Houston, Perez was hurt by seven walks. In
Arizona, he got beat on eight hits, including two home runs. On
Friday night he hung a couple of 0-2 pitches at bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with him is he has three above-average pitches, he
falls in love with one and not the other one,'' Cox said. ``It gets
him in trouble once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Leo Mazzone said after Perez gave up a home run
to Benny Agbayani he came off the field saying he'd taken too much
off his changeup, which is just what Mazzone had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the maturation process,'' Mazzone said.
``He's very sincere in wanting to be successful. He's hard on
himself, sometimes too hard on himself.... I've got a lot of
confidence in him. He's got some quality pitches. For the fifth
hole, he's great, no drop-off in stuff.... If he ends up the year
at .500 that's pretty darn good. A lot of staffs don't have a
(third starter) at .500.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier struggles
</P>
<P>
   Justin Speier has watched his ERA soar from 2.86 to 5.65 in his
last three outings after giving up six runs in a 22-1 loss to the
Orioles and five runs against the Mets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cox attributed it to rustiness for Speier, who hadn't pitched in
six days and showed it by walking a season-high four batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I pound the strike zone,'' Speier said. ``Last night,
I didn't get ahead. If you don't get ahead and throw mediocre
pitches, you're going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox also knows it's a tough situation to come in and hold it
when the team is losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to gear up, knowing the manager is mopping up with
you,'' Cox said. ``It's hard. He's got a great attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier said he doesn't mind being the last reliever out of the
bullpen and the stretches between outings it entails.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no big deal,'' Speier said. ``I'm just happy to be a
part of this team, getting a chance to pitch at the big-league
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The MRI exam scheduled for Randall Simon's left knee was
postponed until after the Braves' upcoming road trip to Montreal
and New York. Simon has felt some stiffness in his knee after
sliding on it or landing hard on it in games, but otherwise has
been able to play since he first injured it sliding home in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we're worried about because it's not going
to keep me out for a month,'' Simon said. ``They just want to be
sure what we're dealing with. Right now everything is fine.''...
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss was still out of the lineup on Saturday night because
of his sore quadriceps. ``He's still feeling it,'' Cox said. Weiss
may have to look ahead to the Mets series at Shea Stadium July 2-4,
because the Expos play on artificial turf....
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Saturday the Braves do anticipate Javy Lopez will be
ready to play when he comes off the disabled list July 6. Trainers
are having a special brace made for him to wear on his right knee.

 &HT;    Right fit for Atlanta
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a few occasions since being named the architect of a
hockey team last year, Don Waddell has joked that the NHL
guarantees little more than a place in the standings for an $80
million franchise fee. The construction was up to the general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the NHL executive with the most bloodshot set of eyes
continued attacking his project with the same aggression he wants
from his players. One day after spinning eight trades following the
expansion draft, the Thrashers were part of a 12-hour, four-team
trade that enabled the team to move up from second to the first
overall pick and select Czech center Patrik Stefan.
</P>
<P>
   In Stefan, the Thrashers not only landed the centerpiece of
their future but an 18-year-old who already has played two seasons
with a pro team (Long Beach of the IHL) and can step right into the
team's lineup _ a rarity for an NHL draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very big day for our franchise,'' Waddell said.
``We've made it no secret how we feel about Patrik and what kind of
player he is. But to be able to bring in a player who can play
immediately is a big positive for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The duration of the Thrashers' euphoria is linked directly to
how long Stefan remains lucid. Most questions directed at him in
recent months have centered on the two or three concussions he had
this season that limited him to 35 games (of an 82-game season)
with Long Beach. Waddell maintained he made this pick without
seeing Stefan's most recent medical records. But he does not
believe he is taking any gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten the needed information verbally (from Stefan's
agent) that we were comfortable with to make this decision,''
Waddell said. ``I have not seen the medical information. But I'm
very confident everything is fine. ... We're 100 percent sure. It's
not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell believes that if Rich Winter, Stefan's agent, had made
the medical records public, ``We might not have gotten him. Tampa
might not have made the trade and would've taken him first. But it
also seems rather obvious that (Winter) didn't want Patrik to go to
Tampa (which has a surplus of centers). Maybe that's why he did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan reassured all _ again _ about his health, saying,
``Everybody talks about my health, my concussions. But I feel very,
very well. That is all behind me now. I just want to think about
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed doubtful that future was in Atlanta. But the dominoes
began to fall around midnight Friday when Vancouver general manager
Brian Burke (holding the third overall pick) phoned Waddell and
said he had acquired Chicago's first pick (fourth overall) for
defenseman Bryan McCabe and a No. 1 in 2000 or 2001. Burke was
trying to angle to draft Swedish twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin and
he wanted assurances that they would fall that far. Waddell
couldn't guarantee anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were talks until about 3 in the morning,'' Waddell said.
``When I unplugged my phone at 3, I didn't think it would happen.
There were too many `ifs' because everything was contingent on
Vancouver getting Tampa's pick to trade to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks resumed at 6 a.m. ``I thought it might get done, but then
between 8 and 11 I thought it was dead again.'' At about 11:30,
Burke closed a deal with Tampa, landing the Lightning's first pick
for the fourth pick and two third-rounders. The Canucks then dealt
that No. 1 to the Thrashers, who gave Vancouver a third-rounder in
2000 to move up one spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished it on the floor about 10 minutes before we went on
the air,'' said Burke, alluding to the draft broadcast at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Burke got what he wanted most: both Sedins. The Thrashers got
Stefan. And new Tampa president Rick Dudley continued to make a
flurry of trades, dealing the fourth pick to the New York Rangers
for goalie Dan Cloutier, forward Niklas Sundstrom and first- and
third-rounders next year.
</P>
<P>
   Given Dudley's uncertainty about Stefan, there's a chance the
Thrashers might have been able to swing a late trade with the
Lightning. But that wasn't necessary. And nobody was happier about
the result than Stefan, who had 35 points (11 goals) in 33 games
with Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything until they said it on the stage,'' he
said. ``I was surprised. But it's great. Atlanta is an expansion
team but it can be a great team and I can be a part of this future.

YANKS BEAT BALTIMNOR E, 7-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The humidity here Saturday made breathing feel as if
you were leaning nose-first into the spray of a boiling tea kettle,
and the Yankees' players reminded themselves to drink water and
retreat to their air conditioned clubhouse whenever possible. About
90 minutes before Saturday's game, however, David Cone flopped onto
the dugout bench, legs splayed in front of him, as if he were
happily relaxing at poolside.
</P>
<P>
   Cone loves the heat, preferring it since he had surgery to
repair an aneurysm below his right armpit three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He can sweat in the heat, keep his pitching arm loose in the
heat and, best of all, win in the heat. He stifled the Orioles for
eight innings Saturday, as the Yankees won, 7-4, their fifth
consecutive victory and the Orioles' fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The steamy conditions did take their toll on the Yankees
(44-28). Derek Jeter got a cramp in his left hamstring while
running to first base in the eighth inning. Jeter, who was removed
for a pinch-runner, said he had not felt the injury before that
play, but it should be noted that Jeter is strategically deceptive
while discussing his injuries. Teammates said Jeter's hamstring was
bothering him earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the exact nature of the injury, and whenever Jeter
first felt the cramping, Manager Joe Torre indicated that he
thought Jeter would play on Sunday, when the Yankees try to
complete a sweep of this six-game trip. At the very least, Torre is
confident Jeter's injury is not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had never won in Camden Yards, going 0-4 with a 5.40 earned
run average in six previous starts, probably owing to the park's
dollhouse dimensions and the power of the Baltimore lineup in
recent years. But for once, the conditions here suited Cone, the
88-degree temperature, the thick air.
</P>
<P>
   The humidity, said first baseman Tino Martinez, made it ``hard
to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, the left fielder who homered for the second
consecutive day, estimated he drank 10 bottles of water before the
game, ``almost to the point where I felt bloated.'' Between
innings, Spencer removed his spikes on the bench, ``to let my feet
breathe.'' The players, taking a direct hit from the sun while on
the field, would stretch, bend over and do whatever they could to
cope with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cone made his adjustment. He often throws fastballs early in the
game and early in counts, establishing this pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday Cone pitched backward: rather than simply fire
fastballs _ the fastball is a high-effort pitch _ Cone threw his
split-fingered fastball, slider and curve early in counts in the
first few innings, and he threw them for strikes. The first time
through the Baltimore lineup, Cone required three or fewer pitches
with eight of the nine hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Cone usually averages about 17 pitches an inning, and by
controlling his off-speed pitches against the Orioles he was able
to get through the first three innings with 37 pitches, or 12.3 an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   To Hideki Irabu, watching from the Yankees' bench, this was a
very subtle and smart way to conserve energy on the hot and humid
day. The Orioles had one hit in the first five innings, a bloop
single over short that Jeter lost in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``On as hot a day as it was, to be as effective as he was _
that's as good as he's been all year,'' Torre said of Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Jason Johnson was able to shut out the Yankees
through four innings, but Spencer slugged his home run leading off
the fifth inning. Scott Brosius doubled, and scored when Chuck
Knoblauch doubled, and after Martinez's two-run, two-base hit
highlighted a four-run burst in the eighth, the Yankees were in
command, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cone wanted to finish the game, and he threw only 89 pitches in
the first seven innings, striking out six _ five of those on
two-strike sliders so good that the Orioles' hitters, like Brady
Anderson, Mike Bordick and B.J. Surhoff, could only watch.
</P>
<P>
   But the sun began to feel particularly hot in the eighth inning,
several Yankees said, and Torre could see players on both teams
sagging.
</P>
<P>
   Cone gave up a one-out double to Bordick and a two-out walk to
Albert Belle, and Torre jogged to the mound to ask Cone if he was
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one hitter left,'' Cone told him. Torre jogged back
to the dugout and Cone pitched to Harold Baines, who grounded out
sharply to Martinez to end the inning. Cone (8-3) allowed only five
hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera closed out a belated Baltimore uprising in the
eighth, and when the Yankees' position players returned to the
clubhouse, they sprawled on the couches in the players' lounge,
exhausted. ``I can tell you this, I'm going to sleep well,'' said
Joe Girardi, who, as Cone's catcher, had two reasons to dream
peacefully Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   CAL RIPKEN, Baltimore's third baseman, had two hits, including
his 10th homer of the year. Ripken needs 64 hits to reach 3,000 in
his career, and 6 home runs for 400. ... MARIANO RIVERA faced one
hitter in the bottom of the ninth inning, striking out B.J. SURHOFF
for his 20th save in 21 chances. Rivera has made 29 appearances
this year, and retired the first hitter he faced in 28 of those.

NEW HAVEN FESTIVAL GROWS INTO A `MINI-WORLD'S FAIR'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Inspired by the success of the Special
Olympics World Games here in 1995, Anne Tyler Calabresi had a
vision she believed could help start a cultural and economic
renaissance in this troubled Ivy League city.
</P>
<P>
   She thought the heart of the downtown, with its 350-year-old
green, and the cozy, historic courtyards of Yale University, would
be the perfect place for an international festival that could
``showcase the city's vast cultural treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't another city this size that can boast having an
Ivy League university and internationally renowned art museums and
theaters and a world-class symphony orchestra,'' said Mrs.
Calabresi, who in 1992 founded an academic and social enrichment
program for inner-city children. ``I wanted to create an event to
bring people together who know about the depth of the arts in New
Haven, and at the same time showcase the city's museums, theaters,
restaurants and both visual and performing artists, for people who
have no idea what is here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Calabresi, whose husband, Guido Calabresi, is a federal
judge and former dean of Yale Law School, said she had no idea the
International Festival of Arts and Ideas would grow so quickly to
become one of the largest in the country. The festival, now in its
fourth year, is in the midst of a 16-day run that ends July 3.
</P>
<P>
   With symposiums covering social issues like ``Can Our Schools Be
Better'' and ``War and Peace,'' and performances by internationally
renowned entertainers, festival organizers say they are striving to
take the event to a level rarely achieved in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they want to make the festival _ modeled after
European festivals that combine the arts, science and in-depth
discussions of ideas _ a tourist attraction that will draw people
to New Haven throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival provides this extraordinary vehicle that we
believe can bring people to New Haven during the event, but also
sparks an awareness of the city so they will want to come other
times as well,'' said Paul Collard, the festival's director.
</P>
<P>
   Collard said more than 150,000 people are expected to spend
about $2.5 million in the city during the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intangible impact this festival is having on New Haven
cannot be overstated,'' said City Planner Karyn Gilvarg, ``both in
psychological and real economic terms. We know it is providing a
tremendous showcase for our museums, restaurants and other
businesses that we could not have dreamed possible a few years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival blends mostly free science and art exhibits and
musical performances for adults and children, as well as plays
performed by the Royal Shakespeare Theater Co.
</P>
<P>
   Collard, who organized festivals in England, moved from London
two years ago with his wife and four children to direct the
festival here. He said its growth has been extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has a budget of $2.4 million, contributed by
sponsors like Fleet Bank, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation,
Sikorsky Aircraft, Southern New England Telephone and the Bayer
Corp. This year, advertising supplements were distributed in
newspapers throughout Connecticut and in New York and
Massachusetts, Collard said. Marketing research has shown that the
supplements help draw people to the city not only during the
festival but throughout the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year or two, the goal was to reach people in the
immediate New Haven area,'' he said, ``but now we want to begin
drawing people from around Connecticut and throughout the East
Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Phillips, passing through Connecticut on her way home to
Baltimore from a Cape Cod vacation, stopped at the festival with
her three children. She said it was unlike anything she had ever
seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a mini-World's Fair,'' Ms. Phillips said.
``I've seen festivals like this in Europe, but never before in this
country.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quiet and composed Sean Elliott wanted to bask in the
moment. He wanted to be consumed by the grandeur that surrounded
winning the first National Basketball Association championship in
the San Antonio Spurs' 26-year history. He wanted to savor the
jubilation, the sense of accomplishment, the squirting of the
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the NBA is as much about the future as it is
about the present. When Pat Riley coached the Los Angeles Lakers in
the 1980s, he predicted in the midst of their title celebration
that his club would become the first team to repeat as champion in
nearly 20 years. When Michael Jordan won his fifth title with the
Chicago Bulls in 1997, he strutted along the makeshift platform at
midcourt, holding up six fingers to signify that he would be back
to claim one more crown.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that the questions being asked of the
Spurs early Saturday morning, after they defeated the Knicks by
78-77 to win the finals, four games to one, had nearly as much to
do with next season as with the one San Antonio just finished
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to talk about that right now,'' Elliott said
when asked about the Spurs' chances of repeating.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting next to him was a more outspoken teammate, the
rambunctious Mario Elie, and he did not mind fast-forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to catch Magic Johnson,'' said Elie, who won titles
with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995 before joining the Spurs
this season. ``I'm trying to catch Larry Bird and Michael Jordan.
With this team, we can go right back next year if we keep the same
unit. If we stay healthy, man, I don't see why we can't do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was a time when winning one NBA championship was
enough, the mark of greatness nowadays is the ability to do it
again. Since 1988, when Riley's Lakers became the first team since
Bill Russell's 1969 Boston Celtics to win back-to-back titles, no
champion has done less.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Pistons won their first title in 1989, then repeated
the next year. Jordan led the Bulls to three straight championships
before retiring in 1993. And then Houston held the crown for two
years until Jordan returned to reclaim it from 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
   With such tough acts to follow, the difference between the Spurs
being remembered as a solid club that capitalized on an abnormal
lockout-shortened season or something special hinges on their
ability to seize a second title immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won one championship, but you really can't measure a lot
on that,'' said Will Perdue, the Spurs reserve who played on
Chicago's first three title teams. ``Good teams win championships.
Great teams continue to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the aforementioned champions, the Spurs have what seem to
be the ingredients for winning consecutive titles: two superstars
and a solid cast of role players. Tim Duncan, who averaged 27.5
points and 14 rebounds in earning the finals' most valuable player
award, is now widely regarded as the league's top player. And
33-year-old David Robinson, Duncan's 7-foot ``twin tower,'' should
have two or three excellent seasons left in him, particularly with
Duncan's presence reducing his nightly demands.
</P>
<P>
   While the series with the Knicks highlighted the inadequacies of
San Antonio's supporting cast, as long as Duncan and Robinson are
aboard, the Spurs should have enough to contend for the Western
Conference championship. Duncan will definitely wear the Spurs'
black and silver next season, but his long-term future with the
franchise is in question.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Holt, the Spurs' chairman, hopes to put the public
financing of a new arena on city ballots by next January. If the
vote fails, there is every indication that the team will move to
another city, perhaps Baltimore, San Diego, New Orleans or Anaheim,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said that he hopes to stay with the Spurs for the rest of
his career, but that he will not sign a contract extension with the
club until its future location is determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love San Antonio,'' Duncan said. ``It's a great place. I
would love to be there the rest of my career. However it works out,
it works out. I think everybody with the Spurs knows what it's all
about. We just have to get it done. I think we will get it done.
We've given them a good reason to keep us there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the championship trophy in tote, the Spurs' love affair
with San Antonio seems likely to continue. The phrase ``Go Spurs
Go'' was plastered all over town during the finals, and about
250,000 fans are expected to attend a flotilla parade to honor the
team along the city's Riverwalk Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some things may change in the West next season: The Spurs may
make minor changes to Duncan and Robinson's complementary cast, and
the Lakers should be better with Phil Jackson as their coach. But
Duncan sees no reason why Sunday night's celebration on the water
cannot be the first of many such coronations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be ready to go next year,'' Duncan said. ``There will be
a lot tougher teams in the West that are going to challenge us for
it, but we'll be right back up there.''

IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS REVIEWING HOW SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER PASSED
OUT OF THEIR CUSTODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JO ANN ZUIGA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The release of a suspected serial killer from
Immigration and Naturalization Service custody earlier this month
illustrates how the latest technology has not quite caught up to
criminals, federal and state officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Resendez-Ramirez slipped through the cracks after he was
taken into custody on June 1 by Border Patrol agents although his
fingerprints were on file both with the National Crime Information
Center and the Texas Crime Information Center, officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Texas said they were unsure what procedural
changes would be made to prevent a similar occurrence in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   They said Friday that Resendez-Ramirez's arrest as an illegal
immigrant on June 2 at Sunland Park, N.M., was processed the same
as about 1.5 million others made each year by the Border Patrol
along the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time he was apprehended, we had no idea that he was
wanted by the FBI. He was operating under another alias,'' said INS
spokesman Tomas Zuniga at the agency's regional office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He was processed at the Santa Teresa INS border station, where
his photo and fingerprints were taken under the INS system known as
IDENT.
</P>
<P>
   A computerized fingerprint identification system, IDENT allows
agents to track how many other times the detainee tried previous
illegal crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a detainee gives a false name, the fingerprint will tie
him or her to any previous attempted crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We processed him as we do about 1.5 million apprehensions a
year. We don't ask IDENT for additional checks unless we have a
query or a reason to believe we should put a run on someone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   IDENT is not cross-referenced to any other state or federal
fingerprinting system without additional checking.
</P>
<P>
   However, if at that point, Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprints had
been run through NCIC or TCIC, officials would have been alerted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both NCIC and TCIC had his fingerprints on file and warrants
out for his arrest at that time,'' said Texas Department of Public
Safety spokeswoman Tela Mange.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the arrest occurred before the FBI had set up its
multiagency task force, Operation Train Stop, on June 8 and gained
nationwide publicity, FBI officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   So instead Resendez-Ramirez was released a little after midnight
June 2. He was placed in an INS van and driven halfway across an
international bridge and released back into Mexico, Zuniga said.
</P>
<P>
   A query by INS to NCIC or TCIC can take 45 minutes to an hour
and requires additional costs for manpower and time, Zuniga said.
``But when a human life is at risk, that time means nothing,'' he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program by the FBI with DPS that uses a Livescan
computer to fingerprint people rather than ink and paper could help
prevent such slips in the future, DPS spokeswoman Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   On that system, a search of databases is done automatically. But
now they're on separate systems and agencies have to scan in the
fingerprints, upload and then wait for a match as the computer goes
through millions of fingerprints, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has a history of slipping into the United
States illegally since 1976, has served state prison time in New
Mexico and Florida and had been deported previously at least four
times.

NBA CHECKS ITS ODOM-ETER READING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone lines are burning as every NBA team worries about
whether to make a deal in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that the one player most teams
thought was the most talented, Rhode Island's Lamar Odom,
reportedly still wants to go back to college and blew off more
workouts last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, Vancouver and Charlotte are all fielding offers for the
top three picks, so here's some of the latest:
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are supposedly offering Glen Rice to Vancouver so
they can draft Baron Davis before the Charlotte Hornets take him at
No.3.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if the Grizzlies could be gullible enough to believe Rice
would re-sign with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets have a small dilemma. Davis has not warmed to them,
and is represented by Arn Tellem, who helped get Kobe Bryant to the
Lakers after Charlotte drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Hornets, agents don't call the shots
anymore. They'll be happy to take Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is also getting plenty of calls with Philadelphia
(Theo Ratliff), Miami (P.J. Brown) and Indiana (Dale Davis)
interested in acquiring a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   But the Grizzlies might be leaning toward keeping their pick.
They are the only team Odom worked out for and also are intrigued
with adding Elton Brand, now that he actually measured 6-foot-8\ at
a pre-draft camp.
</P>
<P>
   The trade rumors are especially rampant in Chicago. The Bulls
have the No.1 pick, but Toronto is hammering away at Chicago GM
Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that a deal could be coming, Maryland point guard
Steve Francis worked out for the Raptors last week, reneging on his
promise to only work out for the top three teams in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has offered its two first-round selections (Nos.5 and
12), but the Bulls want the No.5 and Tracy McGrady or Doug
Christie.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have also ignored Charlotte's offer of David Wesley
and Anthony Mason, which seems awfully low. Not to mention the
added benefit of getting to deal with Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is trying to shop guard Nick Anderson for any of the top
five picks, but no one really wants his $24.5 million over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Revised top 10: Barring the barrage of trades, here's another
look at the top-10 picks.
</P>
<P>
   1. Chicago: Francis; 2. Vancouver: Brand; 3. Charlotte: Davis;
4. Clippers: Wally Szczerbiak; 5. Toronto: Odom; 6. Minnesota:
Richard Hamilton; 7. Washington: Andre Miller; 8. Cleveland: Jason
Terry; 9. Phoenix, Jonathan Bender; 10. Golden State: William
Avery.
</P>
<P>
   Back in L.A.: It might sound farfetched, but word out of Detroit
is that the Lakers are showing interest in acquiring problem-child
Bison Dele, who used to be known as Brian Williams when he played
for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Whither the Worm? Dennis Rodman's agent has sent letters to
warm-weather NBA teams saying he is interested in playing next
season.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami coach Pat Riley has his own theory about Rodman's next
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will end up in L.A. with his `father' there,''
Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, Riley and Jackson are less than cordial, meaning
Lakers-Heat games should at least be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Cowens in Cleveland: The Cavaliers might name Dave Cowens as
their coach this week. He has had two interviews and met team owner
Gordon Gund last week.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the boss? What do Danny Ainge and Crespi High have in
common? Last week, plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge was at Mater Dei High last weekend to watch his son,
Austin, play for Highland of Gilbert, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   With Ainge watching in the stands as he waited for his son's
game to begin, coach Gary McKnight yanked his Mater Dei team off
the court before the end of the first half. McKnight was upset at
the officiating during the Monarchs contest.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight then decided to bring his team back and resume the
game, just before Crespi and Highland players were ready to begin
playing an impromptu pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge was among the angry Highland parents in the stands.
According to sources, Ainge was so upset he followed the coach into
Mater Dei's locker room and yelled at McKnight. &QL;

BARON LANDSCAPE IS FERTILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baron Davis may be another guy who has the answer, but evidence
suggests the corresponding question was multiple choice.
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   So put your hands on the remote control, feel the spirit moving
you into the embrace of TNT, and wait for Baron to be picked in
Wednesday's NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   You won't have to wait long.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sisters and brothers and hoop-junkie cousins to be named
later, we have seen the ex-UCLA star within the last three days and
he remains an exclamation point guard. He's the truth, but his
pre-draft story is becoming stranger than fiction.
</P>
<P>
   What's the skinny on Baron's change of direction, his lateral
agility? Without equivocation, we can tell you his, ahem, crossover
is still murder.
</P>
<P>
   And the infamous left knee he injured 15 months ago seems to be
just fine, too.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, preacher. We'd better return to that crossover reference.
</P>
<P>
   OK, this crossover has nothing to do with Baron's ability to
break ankles and take names. No, we're here to determine if Davis
expected to shake hands with the commish before the fifth pick is
called has had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Let's rewind to May.
</P>
<P>
   As if by rote, Davis responded to preferred-draft-destination
inquiries by saying he'd like to stay home and play in L.A. a Laker
jersey would be great, but helping to lift the Clippers, was a
challenge he'd also love to accept.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wednesday's San Francisco Chronicle published a Davis
quote that urged the Warriors to trade up ahead of the Clippers and
draft him.
</P>
<P>
   We believe Davis said it, but realize the draft countdown
includes more unfulfilled posturing than a skirmish between bantam
computer nerds.
</P>
<P>
   And we are not extending the quoted ``out of context'' option,
leaving us with this response:
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Arn Tellem, has been unavailable for comment. Davis
was
</P>
<P>
   available for comment Thursday, but wasn't asked to do so
because we weren't aware of the Chronicle story. (Editor's note:
``Duh.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now let's present the puzzle. Davis turned his ankle during
Tuesday's Warrior workout, but insisted on keeping Thursday
afternoon's encore workout date with the Clippers. If he doesn't
want the Clips to draft him, why would he show up?
</P>
<P>
   Team Davis has refused to visit the point-guard hungry Charlotte
Hornets, who hold the draft's third pick and would like an
audition.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he's planning to make a quick trip to North
Carolina, Davis said, ``I'm not sure,'' which must be UCLA-speak
for ``Gee, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem, according to word around the NBA campfire, may be using
whatever juice he can squeeze to keep his client out of Charlotte,
where the marketing opportunities (sneaker deal, baby) are limited.
If successful, such leveraging could further validate an agent's
superiority to the slotted-contract attention of a mere attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant also is represented by Tellem, and their noisy
dissatisfaction with Charlotte's selection of young Kobe in the
1996 draft led to a quick deal with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Hornets have bestowed their head-coaching
responsibilies upon Paul Silas, who worked with Tellem in the
Clippers' San Diego days.
</P>
<P>
   Would Charlotte draft Davis without a workout? Vancouver drafted
Mike Bibby last year, even though agent David Falk limited Bibby's
visits to one (Clippers). Could Charlotte be scared off by Baron's
knee? Possibly, but remember that Hornets GM Bob Bass is the guy
who drafted Sean Elliott in San Antonio when Elliott's surgically
repaired knee was an issue in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hop over to our own bottom line. Will the Clippers draft
Davis if he's still on the board at four? They may not wait that
long. They could offer free-agent power forward Lorenzen Wright
(sign-and-trade bait) and that fourth pick for Vancouver's spot at
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Our below-the-bottom line is that the 199 NBA Draft will be as
tough to predict as your sister's meat loaf.
</P>
<P>
   MORE BARON LANDSCAPE
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no Baron Davis chatter is complete without a trip
down Laker Street.
</P>
<P>
   Davis worked out for L.A.'s other team a few days ago, and is
said to be coveted by Jerry West, the team's VP of basketball ops.
</P>
<P>
   We can dig it, but NBA misinformation does grow on trees in
June. Anyway, for Davis to become a Laker, West as the popular
script has it would chat with Phil Jackson and decide if shipping
Glen Rice to Miami is the thing to do. If they agree, the Heat, in
turn, would send P.J. Brown to power forward-challenged Vancouver,
and the Grizzles would surrender their second pick to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Another Tellem client to work out for the Lakers is 6-foot-11
Jonathan Bender, the lean-and-gifted Mississippi high school kid
who's projected to disappear from the draft board shortly before
the 10th pick is made.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH TRIP FOR `RIP'
</P>
<P>
   NBA smarties love the way Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton can get to
the basket, but the UConn shooting guard had a tough time making it
to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The trip included a nice drive from Seattle to the Canadian
border, where Rip remembered the one thing he'd forgotten to pack a
passport. But he eventually made it in time for his Grizzles
workout. Don't get happy. His return flight was canceled, so the
star of the 1999 NCAA Tournament had an eight-hour wait at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the travel miseries, Hamilton who worked out for the
Clippers on Thursday morning is having fun as a traveling salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying myself, but you can't half-step during this
process,'' he said. ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show
what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would Rip prefer to work for?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' said Hamilton, who seems to be a good fit for
Minnesota at No. 6. ``I just want a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Immediately after a player is drafted, an NBA
operative hands him a baseball cap with appropriate logo.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The NBA fiction department includes a recent report that the
Clippers aren't exactly thrilled with the progress of Michael
Olowokandi, last year's No. 1 overall pick. But Coach Chris Ford
said the 7-foot center, who had minor surgery on his left knee the
week after the regular-season ended, has been sort of thrilling
during recent on-court workouts. Chicago talent capo Jerry Krause
thinks enough of the Kandi Man to make the Clippers another offer
they easily refused. ... The list of early entry draft prospects
returning to college does not include Georgia Tech shooting guard
Dion Glover. Glover, who missed his sophomore season with a knee
injury, still can't work out, but could be selected just past the
midway point of round one.

WILL IT BE INDIAN WELLS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because Toronto left-hander David Wells signed a two-year,
$16 million contract extension this past week doesn't mean he is
off the trade market.
</P>
<P>
   With Indians owner Dick Jacobs trying to sell the team, Wells
would be a good fit for someone determined to go out a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the extension makes him even more tradeable than he
was before,'' said agent Greg Clifton, who negotiated the
extension. ``Now teams are dealing with a known quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians like Wells, who was routed 11-4 by Tampa Bay on
Friday, because they need a left-hander, he's playoff-tested and it
would be great theater to watch him pitch in Yankee Stadium in
October. The downside? He won't come cheaply, and he's capable of
demanding a trade at the end of the season. &QL; 
CAN YOU THROW?
</P>
<P>
   Having recorded saves in three straight games last weekend, Red
Sox interim closer Tim Wakefield said he was ready to face
Baltimore the next game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox never got to him, but this raised a question. How
many consecutive days can a knuckleballer pitch in relief? ``The
rest of the season,'' teammate Mike Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, uncertain about the future of closer Tom Gordon,
thought Wakefield, 6 for 6 in save opportunities, got stronger each
time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as throwing one inning and 13-15 pitches,'' pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan said, ``I think he can do it five, six, seven
days in a row.'' &QL; 
FLYING OR GROUNDED?
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles won 11 of 13 after the Albert Belle/Ray Miller
dugout blowout, but the biggest test of their credibility might be
coming this weekend when they dropped the first two games to the
Yankees. They had drawn within four games of .500 before dropping
back-to-back 2-1 games to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's play had been crucial in the turnaround. He had four
home runs during the two-week roll, but the really big gun has been
B.J. Surhoff, whose 21-game hitting streak finally ended Tuesday.
Surhoff had five homers since June 9, when the Orioles started to
play better. But if the Birds go south again, he could be sent to
the Braves before the July 31 trade deadline. &QL; 
NOT ON THE RESUME
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Manto was expected to be outrighted Friday when the Indians
activated third baseman Travis Fryman. Manto has been sent down 11
times by the Indians over the years.... Twins right-hander Rob
Radlosky was demoted Thursday after giving up seven homers in 81/3
innings _ an average of one every 22 pitches. He was 0-1 with a
12.46 ERA, and opponents were hitting .375 against him. Minnesota
wasn't sure who was headed out. One-time Dodger Gary Rath stayed
despite an 0-1 record and an 11.57 ERA. &QL; 
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devils Rays had their largest crowds since opening
day when the Yankees came to town. Sadly, most of them were Yankees
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take fans for whatever reason,'' said Rays manager Larry
Rothschild. ``I don't really care. Someday, we've got to get beyond
that, for whatever reason, and get fans out here to watch us
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just a bad team. It's the location of the
ballpark in St. Petersburg. There is an eight-mile bridge between
Tampa and St. Pete which has eliminated the sizable Orlando market.
Fans don't want to cross Tampa and that bridge at rush hour. &QL; 
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO...
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars won the NHL Stanley Cup, which may put some
pressure on the AL West-leading Texas Rangers. Tom Hicks owns both
teams and Jim Lites is president over both. But the Stanley Cup
also reinforces the Rangers' belief that Hicks will do what it
takes to get them over the top, having signed big-name free agents
Ed Belfour and Brett Hull to reinforce the Stars lineup. ``There's
a feeling that if it comes down to making moves at the right time,
Mr. Hicks will do it,'' Rusty Greer said. ``But I don't think
there's any more pressure that could be added by any outside person
than what the 25 guys in this clubhouse put on themselves.'' &QL;

STOTTLEMYRE PLAYS CATCH-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona right-hander Todd Stottlemyre played catch Tuesday, his
first time throwing a ball in five weeks since discovering he had
tears in his right rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are reluctant to set a return date, but are
hopeful he can be back in a month. Despite leading the West,
Arizona will need Stottlemyre, who was 4-1 with a 3.59 ERA before
going on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rewarded with a huge contract last winter and there's
nothing more disappointing than being on the shelf,'' said
Stottlemyre, who signed a four-year, $32 million contract. ``That's
part of what's eaten at me the last five weeks. It's a big part of
what motivated me to get back. I feel a great need to have to do my
part.'' &QL; 
LOOKING FOR HELP
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are pushing the Braves in the East and Atlanta is
expected to go after another hitter before the July 31 trading
deadline, probably an outfielder/leadoff hitter such as Milwaukee's
Marquis Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, who played in Atlanta from 1995-96, the last two times
the Braves were in the World Series, would be a comfortable fit,
though he would have to shift from center to left. The Brewers want
to dump his $5 million salary and the Braves desperately need a
leadoff hitter so Walt Weiss can move back to No.8. &QL; 
RICH MAN, POOR MAN
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers have two big-time pitchers playing for a
pittance, but only one is earning his money. Hideo Nomo, 5-1 with a
3.68 ERA in his first nine starts, is making $250,000. Former Angel
Jim Abbott, trying to make the transition from hard thrower to
soft-tossing finesse pitcher, is making $400,000 and is 1-6 with a
6.82 ERA after 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult,'' Abbott said. ``There's a mind-set you
have to change, especially when there comes a certain point in the
game when you want to rear back and throw the ball as hard as you
can. When you can't do that, you have to be smarter and pitch with
less emotion, maybe take your foot off the accelerator a little
bit.'' &QL; 
BAD TASTE
</P>
<P>
   If you think giving up chewing tobacco is easier than
cigarettes, think again. Phillies right-hander Curt Schilling, who
said he had quit for life last March 18 when a lesion was
discovered on his lower lip, is dipping again.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who won his 10th game Thursday, was told at that time
by doctors that if he did not quit using smokeless tobacco he was a
prime candidate for mouth cancer. Doctors also said the lesion is
gone and a total reversal of the condition could occur if he quit
for good. &QL; 
NEXT TO GO
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials confirmed this past week that 1997 World
Series MVP Livan Hernandez could be made available in a trade and
that teams have called to express interest. Hernandez, 3-7 with a
4.66 ERA after losing Thursday to the Mets, doesn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   He is making $800,000 this season, the last of a four-year
contract. Since Hernandez won't have enough service time to be
eligible for arbitration, he can be signed for about the same
amount next year _ so teams would get a bargain on a 24-year-old
pitcher who could produce at least 200 innings a year. &QL; 
TIME FOR BEN
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres put an end to catcher Ben Davis' 23-game
hitting streak Wednesday. And in the process, they made his
big-league dream come true. Davis, 22, was promoted from Triple-A
Las Vegas on Tuesday when Jim Leyritz went on the DL after getting
hit Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The second overall pick in the 1995 draft behind the Angels'
Darin Erstad, Davis made his major-league debut last year during a
September call-up but had just one at-bat. He went 0 for 4 against
the Dodgers on Thursday but already is considered a superb handler
of pitchers. &QL;

11 PLAYERS ARE WITHIN 3 STROKES OF THE LEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ It was hot on the golf course. It was crowded
on the leader board. And when the third round of the Buick Classic
concluded Saturday, the outcome of the final round was difficult to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven players ended the day within three shots of the lead,
setting up a final round at Westchester Country Club that could
rank among the tournament's historical best. Some of the contenders
have never won on the PGA Tour, like Jim Carter, who shared the
lead with Duffy Waldorf. Others have won majors, like Lee Janzen
and Justin Leonard, who were tied for third place, two strokes off
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, a lot of players will arrive at the
first tee Sunday feeling nervous and excited.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a five-under-par 66, and keeping himself in position to
win his first tour event, Carter was at eight under par for the
tournament (205), tied with Waldorf, who shot a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Five players were tied for third place at six under par.
</P>
<P>
   --Janzen, a two-time United States Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   --Leonard, who won the 1997 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Flesch, last year's tour rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Chris Perry, who started Saturday tied for first.
</P>
<P>
   --David Sutherland, another player looking for his first victory
on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising to see Janzen and Leonard rise to the
top, as they are two players who have been in this position many
times and won. But it would also be dangerous to overlook the
determination of Carter, a 38-year-old tour veteran who feels he is
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to learn how to handle it,'' Carter said, speaking
of entering the final round with the lead. ``The more you can get
there, the more comfortable you get. It's nice to be the
third-round leader, but that is not what we are shooting for.
Obviously, it's going to be a great thrill when I break through. I
think it's going to happen sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, Corey Pavin (tied for 17th) shot a 65, five
players shot 66, and there were birdies to be had if you could
drive the ball in the fairway. Waldorf shot a 68, and he made
birdies on four of his last six holes. Waldorf's last tour victory
came in 1995, so while he has not waited as long as Carter, he is
also eager to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean that I still have game enough to compete out
here,'' said Waldorf, who is 36. ``That's kind of the doubt you
have as you get a little bit up there in years and you see young
guys coming on and hitting it longer than you, making more putts
and chipping great. You wonder if you are ever going to get that
game back where you know you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who shot a 66 Saturday, does not have those worries,
but he is still looking for his first victory this year, and he is
also looking for Ryder Cup points. Currently 15th in the Ryder Cup
standings, Leonard needs a good summer to insure that he will be on
the United States team that will face Europe in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on the wrong side of that bubble,'' Leonard said of his
Ryder Cup position. ``That is my motivation. That is a big reason
why I am here this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a little frustrating for me, because I have
had so many 12th- through 25th-place finishes. But what I take away
is that my game is not very far off. A shot or two here or there is
nothing to drive myself crazy about.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who shot a 69, was relieved to have last weekend behind
him, when he finished tied for 46th at the U.S. Open and failed to
defend his championship. Like Leonard, Janzen is making a summer
push for the Ryder Cup team, and he is 21st in the points standing.
Janzen won the Buick Classic in 1994, and this would be an
opportune time to win it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win would put me in great position, move me up the points
list quite a bit,'' Janzen said. ``It can be stressful. I remember
in 1995, I was pressing very hard to make the team, and I got too
disappointed each time I didn't finish in the top 10 of a
tournament. If I don't worry too much, I seem to play better. It
has taken me 10 years to realize that, and it may take me another
10 to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of possibilities for this tournament.
Somebody out of the pack playing early could shoot a good score. I
would expect, though, that somebody on the leader board now will
win the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert, who started the day tied for first place, stumbled
to a 77, including a 42 on the back nine, and finished the day tied
for 38th place.

MANDELLA SWEATS THE DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Apparently nobody told Richard Mandella not to sweat
the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that explains the trainer's late-'90s domination of
California's heavyweight horse races, million-dollar events like
today's Hollywood Gold Cup, in which his Malek and Puerto Madero
will make up half of a field that includes 1998 Kentucky Derby
winner Real Quiet and ex-claimer and likely pacesetter Budroyale.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella's obsession with details _ call it a healthy respect
for Murphy's Law _ was on display at the Gold Cup post-position
draw ceremony Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He showed off his self-deprecating wit in discussing his
decision to put blinkers on the slumping Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't think of anything else to do,'' Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a fresh worry enveloped him. He looked like a vacationer
who suddenly realized he had left the stove on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I put it (`blinkers') on the entry card,'' Mandella
said. ``You think I'm joking. I'm serious. Will somebody from the
racing office please check?!''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella always frets about what might go wrong, and that might
be why things have gone so right in these million-dollar races,
earning the 48-year-old San Gabriel Valley resident a Hall of Fame
nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard and Dwight Sutherland's 5-year-old Puerto Madero (ridden
by Kent Desormeaux) and Chilean-owned 6-year-old Malek (Alex Solis)
will try to give Mandella his third Gold Cup victory, following
Siphon in '96 and Gentlemen in '97. That would lift Mandella into a
tie with Buster Millerick, whose Native Diver won three in the
'60s, for second on the Gold Cup trainers' list behind eight-time
winner Charlie Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
   A victory today would also be Mandella's seventh in the Gold
Cup, the Santa Anita Handicap and Del Mar's Pacific Classic,
California's major races for older thoroughbreds. He won a stunning
six in a row, including Dare and Go's '96 Pacific Classic upset of
Cigar, Gentlemen's '97 Pacific Classic, Siphon's '97 Big 'Cap and
Malek's '98 Big 'Cap.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella's hold on these races includes 1-2-3 finishes in the
'97 Big 'Cap (Siphon-Sandpit-Gentlemen) and Gold Cup
(Gentlemen-Siphon-Sandpit). Before that Cup, in which he trained
five of the six entrants, Mandella's paranoia overflowed. He said
that if he lost he'd have to crawl out of Hollywood Park under the
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chilean-breds Malek and Puerto Madero enter today's
1\-miler with question marks, their trainer has expressed optimism
this week, particularly after Old Trieste (foot abscess) dropped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero looked like the nation's top handicap horse when
he beat Behrens and Silver Charm in the Donn Handicap in Florida in
January. But he was fifth every step in the Big 'Cap, won by
since-injured Free House, and an indifferent third in the
Californian, won by Old Trieste.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of his races he tends to make a game of it and see how
far back off the pace he can be,'' Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the blinkers, which tend to make a horse keener early in a
race.
</P>
<P>
   A first or second would vault Puerto Madero over Behrens to the
top of the points table after seven of 11 races in the ``NTRA
Champions on Fox'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I've got Puerto Madero back on track,'' Mandella said.
``Hoping is a big part of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Malek has banked $1.1million in 1999 despite going winless in
three races _ a second to Silver Charm in the San Pasqual, a second
to Free House in the San Antonio and a second behind local longshot
Almutawakel but ahead of Victory Gallop in the $5million Dubai
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Malek hasn't won since the '98 Big 'Cap _ a four-horse race, as
is today's. He hasn't started since the grueling Dubai trip. But he
won following a seven-month layoff earlier in a career broken up by
back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two horses are good enough to win this race if they're on
their best day,'' Mandella said. ``We'll just have to find out if
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Three Ring, who dominated the Florida fillies' division
before running last in the Kentucky Derby, was killed when she
flipped and struck her head and fractured her skull in the Belmont
Park paddock before Saturday's Mother Goose. The race was won by
Dreams Gallore and Robby Albarado. ``It was a terrible accident and
everyone suffers from it,'' Albarado said of Three Ring's death....
Santa Anita Derby winner General Challenge ($3.20) and David Flores
swung outside and outkicked Desert Hero to win the Affirmed
Handicap at Hollywood Park in a race-record 1:404/5. It was General
Challenge's first start since running 11th in the Kentucky
Derby.... Manistique ($3) and Chris McCarron overpowered the Vanity
Handicap. She's 8 for 10 _ 8 for 8 in California. Gourmet Girl ran
last.... Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Reraise (tendon) is out of
today's Triple Bend.... Laffit Pincay outpointed 11 riders to win
the four-race NTRA's All-Star Jockey Challenge at Lone Star Park
near Dallas. Pincay, 52, posted one victory in that Friday
competition and another Saturday at Hollywood to move within 75 of
Bill Shoemaker's record 8,833.... The first of four Friday-night
cards drew a good crowd of 18,194 to Hollywood.... The Bob
Baffert-trained 2-year-old filly Chilukki aired in the Churchill
Downs Debutante under Willie Martinez. She's 3 for 3 and Del
Mar-bound.

THREE RING FRACTURES SKULL IN PADDOCK AND IS DESTROYED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ In a shattering accident in the paddock at
Belmont Park Saturday, Three Ring, one of the country's most
accomplished fillies, was euthanized after she reared while being
saddled, flipped and fractured her skull.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened in front of about 100 owners, trainers and
jockeys and hundreds of racing fans watching from the steps of the
amphitheater that surrounds the saddling ring behind the clubhouse.
Three Ring, a 3-year-old who ran in the Kentucky Derby last month,
was being equipped with blinkers when she reared and pitched over
backward, striking her head against the wooden pole on the wall
separating her from the filly in the next stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hit her head on the ground initially,'' said Dr. Anthony
Verderosa, the attending veterinarian, ``and while struggling to
get up, hit her head on the pole. The impact fractured her skull.
It was not something that she could survive.''
</P>
<P>
   An oilskin shield was quickly raised to block the scene from
view, and Verderosa gave the filly an injection to end her agony.
But the gruesome scene stunned the onlookers, as well as the rest
of the 8,846 spectators at Belmont, who then watched the 3-5
favorite Dreams Gallore win the Mother Goose Stakes by 7{ lengths.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened just three weeks after a record Belmont
throng of 85,818 saw Charismatic, winner of the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness, break down at the finish line of the Belmont Stakes
with a fractured foreleg. Three Ring, after running last in the
Derby with a slipped saddle, won the Acorn Stakes last month and
was aiming for the Mother Goose, the middle race in New York's
Triple Tiara for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   She was bought in Ocala, Fla., for $70,000 last year by Barry K.
Schwartz, the chief executive officer for Calvin Klein and a
trustee of the New York Racing Association. She won three of her
five starts last year at 2 and ran third behind the top fillies
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   She came back strongly this year, ran second in the Forward Gal
at Gulfstream Park in January and then dominated the Davona Dale
and the Bonnie Miss by a combined total of 20 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring's trainer, Eddie Plesa Jr., was supervising the
saddling of Three Ring 15 minutes before the Mother Goose when the
filly suddenly reared. She fell back down, struck her head on the
ground, thrashed and tried to get up again but hit her head against
the pole. As she lay bleeding on the ground, Verderosa determined
that she was beyond help.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Plesa shook his head and said, ``No, no.'' Schwartz
was too distraught to comment, and later left the trustees' room in
tears.

A RUN OF LUCK HELPS GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a season-best fourth consecutive victory this
afternoon against the Tampa Bay Mutiny at Raymond James Stadium,
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid has slept well this week.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid was still living off the excitement of last week's 2-1
victory over D.C. United, a win that came in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there was a little controversy around the last
goal, I'm just happy that we won it,'' admitted Schmid. ``A win
like that certainly helps our team from a confidence standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thought that came to Schmid after United's Brian
Kamler notched the game 1-1 in the 83rd minute was, ``not again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus did that same thing to us a few weeks ago,'' said
Schmid. ``We're up 1-0 late, they tie the game and win it in a
shootout. You just start wondering when the luck is going to even
out.''
</P>
<P>
   With six seconds left, it did. Galaxy defender Greg Vanney was
hacked from behind just a few yards outside the penalty area,
setting up a Mauricio Cienfuegos free kick. It looked as though
time would run out, but the referee stopped the clock because
United defenders were standing over the ball.
</P>
<P>
   On the re-start, Cienfuegos bent a right-footed shot over the
wall into the left netting for a 2-1 victory. That gave the Galaxy
back-to-back victories over last year's MLS finalists, Chicago and
D.C., stretching its winning streak to three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, in the time that I have been with this team we have
been on the other end of this type of game before,'' Schmid said.
``I thought they probably had more of the game than we did, but we
scored that goal in the first half and got one late. Sometimes you
just don't ask why, you just walk away and say thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (8-6, 18 points, fourth place) has piled up nine
consecutive points to pull within five of Western Conference-leader
Colorado (9-3, 22 points), and Schmid hopes to add more before the
July 17 All-Star Game in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer to where we want to be,'' Schmid said.
``We just have to continue to win and get the maximum points out of
these next three games. Nine points would be brilliant, but seven
would be good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid feels it's only a matter of time before this team reaches
its potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team we're defending well,'' Schmid said, ``but we need
to get a little tighter on defense in the middle part of the field
to create more turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also looking for a better understanding between Roy
(Myers), Carlos (Hermosillo) and Cobi (Jones), but when you think
of it, last week's game was the first time all three of them played
together. With each game, that understanding is going to get
better, and with it, so will this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Galaxy faces a Tampa team (6-7, 12 points) that has
lost two straight and three of its last four. The Mutiny beat the
Galaxy for the first time at the Rose Bowl on May 15, coming away
with a 1-0 shootout victory.

to reinvent this desert gambling town as a sophisticated
international resort destination, his election is a source of
potentially disastrous publicity. What power brokers failed to
count on was how Goodman reinvented himself. By SHAUN MCKINNON.

A GIANT LEAP FOR HUNDLEY, PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carlos Perez pitched like it was another year,
the reliable bullpen faltered and the once-embattled Todd Hundley,
who took a 10-day respite from catching, provided the biggest
moment of the Dodgers' season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' 7-6 win against the Giants at 3Com Park, which came
complements of Hundley's second home run, a three-run shot in the
ninth, was an absolute variation from what's taken place so far.
</P>
<P>
   It's also what the Dodgers have expected throughout this season,
outside of reliever Alan Mills' three runs allowed in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   At best, it can catapult them into an area of where they should
be _ which isn't 34-38 and in fourth place, even after their second
straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens next, after they blew a 4-2 lead in the bottom
of the eighth, Hundley's second homer provided the excitement and
drama that's been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a baseball game there, baby,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``That was one heckuva ball game. If you don't like
that, you don't like baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with Perez, whose ERA was 13.86 in three June starts.
He pitched 62/3 innings and left with a 3-2 lead thanks to
Hundley's two-run homer into the upper deck in the third and
Perez's surprise two-out bunt single to drive in Devon White in the
fourth. A solo homer in the eighth by Adrian Beltre made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   But that was wiped away after a three-run homer by Ellis Burks
off Mills in the bottom of the eighth after leadoff walks to Barry
Bonds (by Pedro Borbon) and Jeff Kent (by Mills). The Giants added
a sacrifice fly for a 6-4 lead and brought in closer Robb Nen.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen doubled and Eric Young singled. Hundley turned on an
0-1 pitch for another upper-deck shot. Before Nen could record an
out, the Dodgers had the lead back and Hundley had a season-high
five RBI.
</P>
<P>
   And Mills (2-1) won despite giving up three runs on three hits.
Jeff Shaw notched his 18th save and Nen's record fell to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one they took from us,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker
said. ``Maybe we can get it back later this season. I don't like
it. It hurts your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nen's fourth blown save in 22 chances came on the return of what
could be a glorious comeback story for Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start since June 13, Hundley has caused Johnson to
reconsider his catching situation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, whose 10 homers are all from the left side, also
homered in the ninth inning of Friday's 4-2 win. But nearly as
important was that, even though the Giants stole three bases
Saturday, two of Hundley's throws were on line and quick despite
the runners getting big jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what he went through, and again I take full
responsibility... it wasn't fair,'' Johnson said. ``It was my
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's newfangled plan called for Hundley to catch Perez,
Chan Ho Park and Kevin Brown. Angel Pena will catch for Ismael
Valdes and Darren Dreifort because they have more trouble holding
runners close.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's power surge could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll do a modification of that,'' Johnson said. ``He's
going to be in there (today with Park).''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was asked if the homers were redemption, vindication or
encouragement for what he's experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the above,'' Hundley said. ``The bottom line is
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one thing the Dodgers haven't done is sustain momentum
from one day to another. Big wins are followed by dismal,
uninspired losses. Bad losses are followed by wins.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the pattern for a team that hasn't won more than two
straight since a five-game winning streak April 27 through May 1.
But the Dodgers have already won a series for just the second time
in eight opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great win, it came against a great closer,'' Young
said. ``It was good for our catcher to get the hit and Perez did an
outstanding job. It's something we have to keep feeling. We have to
come to the park (today) and remember this and keep feeling like
this.''

RANCHERS DUMP LIVESTOCK AS ARIZONA HOPES FOR RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five rain gauges on the Parsons ranch are measuring dust,
not water. They haven't collected more than a trace of moisture on
the rangeland near Picacho Peak since mid-July last year.
</P>
<P>
   The family has lived in Arizona since 1968, Joe Parsons said,
``and it's the first time we haven't had winter rains.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials don't want to alarm anyone, but it's hard to avoid the
``D'' word.
</P>
<P>
   Drought.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter was one of the driest on record for Arizona, the
third worst since 1895. Reservoir levels are as low as they've been
in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's rainfall is only half of normal this year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,400 wildfires have broken out across the state so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cattle on the Arizona range is down by more than
20 percent compared with 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull declared a drought emergency last week so
ranchers can qualify for tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And the worst may be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a cool spell in early June, this summer is expected to
be hotter and drier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as bad as I've seen in my lifetime, and I've lived in
Arizona since 1940,'' said Joe Lane, associate director of the
state Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Arizona is in severe drought, according to the most
common measure, the Palmer Drought Severity Index. The only
exceptions are the northeast, with moderate drought, and the
southwest, where conditions are about normal.
</P>
<P>
   Rain patterns in Arizona are fickle. No one knows whether the
state could be gripped by a drought as severe as the one in Mexico,
which has lasted five years in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is the desert. Extremes of heat and dryness are
no surprise in much of the state.
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Michael Austin, director of the state Division of
Emergency Management, ``the drought we're experiencing now is
fairly typical and occurs fairly frequently in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hardship, but it's not as bad as it could be,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of drinking water aren't likely to run low, except in a
few rural communities that have perpetual water problems.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worries right now are cattle and fires.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers are selling off part of their herds because range
conditions are so bad. The state is lining up extra firefighting
muscle to keep forest blazes from getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Blame La Nina, a weather pattern caused by unusually cool water
off western South America.
</P>
<P>
   It brings dry winters to the Southwest; just the opposite of the
drenching winter rains caused by the better-known El Nino, a
warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   What no one knows is whether the dry weather will continue,
delaying or reducing the summer monsoon season. In fact, there are
plenty of unknowns about Arizona's late summer period of violent
thunderstorms and high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really understand what makes the monsoon work, why
it's different from one year to the next,'' said Randy Cerveny, a
climatology professor at Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from conditions on the Mexican coast, where the
storms build up before moving into Arizona, the Valley monsoon will
be delayed until at least mid-July, two weeks later than the usual
start. &QL; 
Range-land blues
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers are feeling the dry weather more than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked shingles of dry mud stretch across the empty pond on the
Parsons ranch, next to Picacho Peak between Phoenix and Tucson. The
pond, known as a stock tank in the cattle business, is fed by
runoff from the rugged nearby peaks; and in a normal year, it would
be 8 to 10 feet deep in water.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Parsons pointed to the mesquite trees that ring the stock
tank. They should be heavy with mesquite beans, full of moisture
and protein for cattle, but bean pods are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The family is running 200 head of cattle, a third less than
usual. To feed the herd, the family had to plant its irrigated
fields in forage instead of a cash crop like cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The dry weather is boosting volume at the family's auction
business in nearby Marana, which is handling 20-25 percent more
animals than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of cattle are selling that really shouldn't be,'' Parsons
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers are sending calves to auction now, at half the weight
the animals would have in another four months. They're forced to
cut into their producing herd, cows that give birth to the calves
they sell.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout would be even worse, but many ranchers haven't
rebuilt their herds since a drought in 1996. The number of beef
cows in Arizona dropped from 279,000 in 1992 to 218,000 last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are poor or very poor on a third of the state's range
and pasture land.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us recognize that if it doesn't rain in July and
August, we are in real trouble,'' said Lane, of the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lack of rain has had relatively little effect on
Arizona's field crops and fruit, which are fed by irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   Yuma, with some of the state's most productive farmland,
averages less than 3 inches of rain a year, while its citrus trees
drink 90 inches. Cotton requires 65 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is actually bad news in Yuma because it generally damages
some crops, said Ken Evans, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's been worried this month to see the humidity plummet
below 3 percent at times, the lowest level he can measure on his
farm outside Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feels good for people,'' he said, ``but it's horrible for
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's had to irrigate more than usual, raising his costs. &QL; 
Danger in the woods
</P>
<P>
   Ray Larsen looked out the window at the fire station by
Christopher Creek and saw a scene that should come in September,
not June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow and brown leaves on the trees,'' he lamented. ``There's
even a little bit of reddish tint on them because they're so dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaves and pine needles on the forest floor here, about 90
minutes northeast of Phoenix, hold so little moisture that ``when
you walk in the woods right now, it's like walking on Rice
Krispies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As fire chief for the Christopher-Kohl's Fire District, Larsen
is worried about getting enough water to battle a big blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the ponds, where firefighters install temporary pumps
or dip water with helicopters, are dried up this year.
</P>
<P>
   An ``April Fool's'' snowfall and unexpected rain in early June
dampened the threat of wildfires for a while this year, but the
break was brief. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   The fire danger in Arizona's forests is now high to extreme in
most of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires have already burned more than 37,000 acres this year.
The worst came in mid-June when a fire charred 4,000 acres and
destroyed 17 homes on the mountainous Fort Apache Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   When the forest is dry and the humidity is low, a passing car
can start a blaze with sparks from a dragging chain or a faulty
exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Special fire-prevention teams, with rotating members from state
and federal agencies, are set up whenever a part of the country has
extreme potential for wildfires. Arizona got a team this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The state Land Department, which handles wild-land fires on 22
million acres of private and state land, has tapped a special
account to move key people and equipment closer to the expected hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   It pays to line up planes ahead of time. When Texas and Florida
suffered severe fires last year, aircraft was tied up across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left this state in the lurch,'' said Michael Anable, head
of the Land Department. ``Luckily we didn't have a bad fire
year.'' &QL; 
Why cities have water
</P>
<P>
   Although forests and range lands are parched, Arizona's major
cities aren't likely to go thirsty this year.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there aren't some water problems. The Valley
has received an inch and a half of rain this year, barely
half-normal.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the mountains have had little snow, which melts and
fills a series of reservoirs. Last winter was the eighth-driest for
water runoff in a century of records.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt River Project's reservoir system, which supplies much
of the Valley's water, is 30 percent below normal for this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry about getting air instead of water out of your
faucets, said Dallas Reigle, senior hydrologist at the SRP.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to heavy snow in the Rockies, there's extra water in the
Colorado River system this year. Good news, because part of the
Valley's water comes from the Colorado River by way of the Central
Arizona Project Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's the beauty of the water supply for the Phoenix
area. The way the storm patterns shift, if the Rockies aren't
getting much snow, then the mountains of Arizona are blanketed, and
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for a drought in Arizona and on the Colorado at the
same time is minute,'' said Darrell Jordan, assistant director of
the state Department of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the scant supply in reservoirs, the SRP is buying
an additional 75,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water, the
equivalent of Saguaro Lake.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to pump 300,000 acre-feet from wells, supplying
about a third of the total for the year, although state law
discourages using groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   But although the SRP doesn't expect to run short, Reigle still
has a message: ``I don't think we do enough in this state to
conserve water; it is a desert, and we need to be more mindful.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucson has traditionally paid more attention to conservation
than the Valley has. And with good reason. That city relies almost
entirely on wells, drawing on an ever-sinking water table. Tucson
voters passed an initiative that virtually prohibits use of
Colorado River water, which had caused problems in older plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect that above-normal temperatures will boost
water use, Tucson has twin worries: that demand will outstrip the
capacity of its pumps and that city reservoirs will get too low for
adequate pressure and firefighting needs.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tucson is stepping up an audit program that sends out
specialists to hunt down leaks and give conservation tips to
homewners. This year, businesses and all city offices are included
in the program, with a special educational program for city
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, Hull has called together a drought task force to keep
tabs on the dry weather and come up with options for dealing with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have different assessments of how bad it is and how bad
it's going to be,'' said Francie Noyes, Hull's spokeswoman. ``Our
approach is: Let's do the planning; let's be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dry summer of 1996, the state paid to truck water to
communities that were running short.
</P>
<P>
   There's a predictable list of places that hit shortages of
drinking water even in a good year.
</P>
<P>
   They include Strawberry and Pine, where the water table is
relatively shallow. But so far, the wells in those places haven't
run dry.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal level, Arizona's congressional delegation helped
save San Carlos Lake, which was in danger of being sucked dry to
meet commitments to deliver water. An appropriation of $1.5 million
is buying Colorado River water for those obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The lake will shrink, with some fish kill likely.
</P>
<P>
   What the lake and the state need most, though, is the drought
relief that comes from Mother Nature.  &QL;

NICE IS NOT ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Central Casting? I.M. Hype here. I think it's time we talked.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, I have some serious reservations about the
athletes you've designated for sport's starring roles.
</P>
<P>
   From which pool, exactly, are you culling your talent? And don't
tell me the one in St. Croix that was ravaged by Hurricane Hugo
years ago. Look at some of the names in neon lights and tell me you
haven't gone off the deep end:
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, Mia Hamm, Terrell Davis, Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, Cynthia Cooper, Paul Kariya, Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, Dot Richardson, Tony Gwynn, Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   To a person, they're decent, humble, sincere . . . and miserably
miscast as performers in leading roles. May I speak candidly? If I
serve these athletes up to the public, I'm looking at an increase
in cavities, not consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes can be sugarcoated but not the truth. It's numbing
as Novocain, I know, but in today's society, nice is a four-letter
word.
</P>
<P>
   You want modest? Buy a sarong or a robe.
</P>
<P>
   Today's public is voyeuristic. It clamors for sports stars who
bare all, who flash something besides flawless teeth and skin. It
worships warts.
</P>
<P>
   Take the just-completed NBA Finals. Friday night found hosannas
raining down on Latrell Sprewell, purveyor of the most famous
chokehold this side of the World Wrestling Federation. The Madison
Square Garden crowd could barely bring itself to acknowledge that
it was Duncan, the St. Croix swimmer-turned-San Antonio superstar,
whose team reigned supreme.
</P>
<P>
   But of course. Sprewell is your Garden-variety exhibitionist. He
sprayed in shots from all over the court, using all manners of
contortion, on his way to 35 points in the decisive Game 5. He was
a highlight reel ready to be cued.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was more like an instructional video, his 31 points
coming on bank shots and bit baskets, the beauty of which is
clearly lost on a generation weaned on video games and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so Duncan does have tattoos and a pierced tongue. But
anymore those things hardly register on the outrage scale. What
does: New York's loose-tongued Larry Johnson weighing in on the
Knicks, dubbing them a bunch of ``rebellious slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   That oughta be good for an endorsement or two. As for Duncan,
he'll be lucky to get a milk mustache.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan could hang out this summer in bars with Charles Barkley
and it wouldn't matter. Hipness today is an attitude, not an
acquired trait.
</P>
<P>
   You can break up with an actress before the French Open and
still be a big yawn, as Sampras has discovered. Sampras, who
recently ended a two-year relationship with Kimberly Williams, is
closing in on his 12th Grand Slam title this week at Wimbledon, a
number only slightly less stupendous than his six consecutive
year-end No. 1 rankings.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it should be obvious to you by now that you've got the
wrong American in tennis' male leading role. I mean, everybody says
that spending time with Sampras is about as exciting as watching
the blades grow on his favorite playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the thing: Dull is definitely another four-letter
word in today's society.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, recently separated from actress Brooke Shields, is
the American lapping up the tabloid's share of attention. He is No.
1 in people's hearts. It's his compensation for years of having
been colorful on and off the court while Sampras was consumed with
being consistent on it.
</P>
<P>
   Next to saying not much of anything, the worst thing you can do
if you want to be top dog with the public is be quoted as quipping,
``I'm Howard Hughes,'' as Sampras allowed in a recent interview
with ``Tennis'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   That should pretty well cook his spruce goose, popularity-wise,
no matter how many more times he wins Wimbledon. The public today
doesn't have the patience for an ascetic, no matter how
aesthetically engaging his game.
</P>
<P>
   You saw that with Duval during the recent U.S. Open at
Pinehurst, N.C. As solid a citizen as he is a ball-striker, Duval
was aiming for the only target in golf he hasn't stuck (a victory
in a major).
</P>
<P>
   So where was the fan who yelled ``You're my role model'' during
an early round? Not following the indomitable Duval, that's for
sure. He was in the gallery of John Daly, a recovering alcoholic
who, when lubricated with liquor, has been known to strike women
who are now his former wives.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's only domestic scrape has been with a tea kettle. If he
let off steam sometimes instead of internalizing everything, he'd
probably be as hip as those Tommy Hilfiger clothes he endorses.
</P>
<P>
   And that battle being waged right now in major-league baseball,
do you really expect anybody outside New York or Boston to go
Tarzan over it? Why you insist on making headliners out of players
who aren't home-run hitters is a mystery to me. It's like putting
Rupert Everett in a scene with Tom Hanks and expecting the audience
to notice the range of Hanks' character.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into this final weekend of voting, the Yankees' Derek
Jeter was playing Mark McGwire to Nomar Garciaparra's Sammy Sosa in
the All-Star balloting for the American League's starting
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   And all people could talk about was Jose Canseco's homer binge.
Face it, it's the long ball people dig, not a long range. Jeter
gets on base nearly every game. He just doesn't clear them with
near the frequency of McGwire or Sosa or Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him less interesting. Of course, the public surely
would forgive him his somnolent steadiness on the field if only
he'd live a bacchanal bachelor's life off it.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his public persona is nearer that of Joe DiMaggio than Joe
Namath.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as I see it, is really pretty simple. You've
assembled a great cast for a morality play. The only thing is,
sports today is almost exclusively burlesque. &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 19 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; HEMINGWAY'S CHAIR &LR;  By Michael Palin. St. Martin's Griffin,
$12.95. In his first novel, a former member of Monty Python's
Flying Circus tells the story of a sweet-tempered postal worker
with a Papa obsession who is driven batty when his small-town post
office is privatized. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Weber, praised
the book's ``dry, deftly understated wit,'' ``hearty, well-formed
sentences'' and ``clever, on-the-money dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PACK OF TWO: THE INTRICATE BOND BETWEEN PEOPLE AND DOGS &LR;  By
Caroline Knapp. Delta, $12.95. This affectionate account of the
author's two-year relationship with Lucille, a 45-pound shepherd
mix she rescued from an animal shelter, is both an unabashed love
letter and a commentary on the power of dogs to open the human
heart. It's also full of canine lore, childhood memories and
testimonials from many other dog owners. ``Knapp's dogs come
bounding to life on the page,'' Susan Cheever wrote in the Book
Review in 1998. ``They bark and paw at the covers. They watch us
with bemusement and acceptance. ... She's written a funny,
instructive and completely enjoyable book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROXANNA SLADE &LR;  By Reynolds Price. Scribner, $13. The narrator
of this graceful, old-fashioned novel is a strong-willed Southerner
in her 90s who looks back on her life's gains and losses, as well
as those of our century. Last year our reviewer, Janet Burroway,
called the author ``a chronicler of decency, pluck and joy'' who
has ``given us the weight and worth of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SARATOGA: TURNING POINT OF AMERICA'S REVOLUTIONARY WAR &LR;  By
Richard M. Ketchum. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95. Drawing on a wide
range of sources, including the diaries of officers and soldiers,
the author explains why the colorful British general John Burgoyne
failed in his 1777 invasion of the Colonies from Canada, and why
his surrender was so critical to the war's outcome. ``The strength
of `Saratoga' lies in his vivid descriptions of the rugged
landscape and in his many arresting portraits of participants,''
Pauline Maier wrote here in 1997. The same publisher has reissued
Decisive Day: The Battle for Bunker Hill ($12.95), in which Ketchum
reconstructs the 1775 campaign to control the Charlestown
peninsula, a bloody affair marked by confusion and wrongheadedness
in both the British and American camps. ``It was a furious action
and a chilling spectacle,'' which Ketchum describes ``in handsome
style,'' Bruce Bliven Jr. wrote in these pages in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BLESSING ON THE MOON &LR;  By Joseph Skibell. Berkley, $12. In
this first novel, the spirit of a Jewish man killed in wartime
Poland ascends from a mass grave to roam the countryside, guided by
his murdered rabbi, who has turned into a crow. His journey
``illuminates the horror of history through the energy and wisdom
of fantasy and myth; scene after scene is rich with emotion, humor
and invention,'' Patrick Giles wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAGING THE GENIES: A WORKABLE SOLUTION FOR NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL,
AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS &LR;  By Stansfield Turner. Westview, $14. A
former director of central intelligence offers a detailed plan for
reducing the global stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. His
slender book, which has been updated, ``is more than an
arms-control proposal,'' one critic wrote in 1997. ``It is a
readable primer on nuclear weapons and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GREAT HILL STATIONS OF ASIA &LR;  By Barbara Crossette. Basic
Books, $15. The U.N. bureau chief for The New York Times tours the
mountaintop villages of southern Asia that were built by American
and European colonialists seeking refuge from the scorching
malarial summers. ``The region's history, politics, religion and
economics are brilliantly summarized,'' Alexander Frater said here
last year. ``Yet she also maintains a lively social curiosity.''
The Idea of India, by Sunil Khilnani (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13), is a scholarly analysis focusing on the growth of the modern
Indian state and the evolution of one of the world's most intensely
political societies. ``Khilnani writes with illuminating dexterity,
wit and compassion,'' Judith Brown wrote here in 1998.

   &UR; THE EBONY TOWER &LR;  By John Fowles. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
This collection of four stories and a translation of a medieval
French fable is steeped in the author's continuing fascination with
the power of art to redefine the terms of human freedom. ``If you
haven't been reading Fowles,'' you'll find these tales ``magical
enough,'' Theodore Solotaroff wrote here in 1974. ``If you have ...
you'll have the pleasure of making connections.''

   &UR; THE NOTEBOOKS OF DON RIGOBERTO &LR;  By Mario Vargas Llosa. Penguin,
$12.95. This wickedly promiscuous novel is about the sexual
escapades of a wealthy Peruvian couple and their son _ or is it the
fantasy of a bored insurance executive? ``Vargas Llosa's complex,
gorgeous prose ... sweeps the reader into a rich confusion of art
and fact, fiction and reality,'' Walter Kendrick wrote here last
year.

   &UR; THE HUNGER MOON &LR;  By Suzanne Matson. Ballantine, $12. Three
women of different ages find a way to soothe their loneliness and
suffering when their lives intersect in a Boston suburb. In 1997
our reviewer, Sarah Lyall, admired this first novel's ``crisp,
clean writing'' and ``compassionately drawn characters.''
