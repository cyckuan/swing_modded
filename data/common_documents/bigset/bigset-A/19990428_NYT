LAKERS HASH IT ALL OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A mischievous Forum employee, possibly to his own
professional detriment, decided Tuesday to spell out the common
perception of L.A.'s underachieving professional basketball team.
The electronic scoreboard at midcourt read ``Fakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Lakers, losers of three games in a row, the latter
two by a combined 49 points, can argue. The evidence is damning,
and mounting daily.
</P>
<P>
   But after a 2{-hour team meeting Tuesday, they cling to the
belief, or the hope, that this season is still salvageable, and
that the upcoming playoffs won't simply be another national stage
for their self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Calling their situation a crisis would imply a desperation level
the Lakers don't care to acknowledge. But ignoring a string of six
losses in eight games would make them fools indeed.
</P>
<P>
   So team co-captain Derek Harper called a players-only meeting to
start the day. That was followed by a film session, which was
followed by another group therapy session, with coaches included.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, those who talked said the right things. But
even they admitted that at this point, talk means little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a requirement, if after five games you get your
(butt) torn open, you have to get together to talk about
something,'' Rick Fox said, after initially pleading not to be
interviewed. ``But we've talked and talked a lot this year. I'd
like to think that we would follow up behind some of our talk....
It's enough talk. You're either gonna be on board, commit to
winning being the most important thing, or you're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very evident that the only way we're gonna win a
championship right now is if we all sacrifice our time and effort
to make each other better players, and to help each other and to
lay it out there day in and day out. We obviously haven't done a
good enough job of that, or we'd be doing a better job in the win
column.''
</P>
<P>
   Still heralded as one of the NBA's most talented teams, the
Lakers are 12-13 since acquiring sharpshooter Glen Rice, 6-8 in
April, and are giving up an average of 101.5 points in their last
10 games, second worst in the league during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The whys and hows and the X's and O's of it all are tough to
figure. All the Lakers know is they have four games left to pull
themselves together. The meeting, therefore, was a review of where
they've been, how they've gotten to this point and where they're
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hashed out some things as a team,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``The whole idea was to try to get everybody on the same page,
thinking and doing the right things at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a positive meeting. I think it was an honest meeting.
There was some frustrations that were aired. People expressed their
opinion and we got everybody on the same page in terms of how we
should be playing and what we are capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Early returns were good. Practice was so intense that Travis
Knight and Tyronn Lue had to leave midway to treat minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real test will be Thursday, when the Pacific
Division-champion Portland Trail Blazers come to the Forum, and in
the Lakers' other remaining games with Seattle, Dallas and Portland
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say things in a locker room, it's easy to come
out and have one good practice,'' Rambis said. ``This team is in a
growing and maturing stage. Do we carry it over to (Wednesday's)
practice, do they have the same enthusiasm and intensity that the
emotions brought out in the meeting? And do we carry it over into
the next ballgame, and do we build on that?''
</P>
<P>
   Players scattered quickly after practice in standard
circle-the-wagons mode. Harper waved off reporters, saying ``I've
said all there is to say.'' Shaquille O'Neal stuck around long
enough to say he wasn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   So the elaboration fell to Fox and Kobe Bryant. By some
accounts, it's Bryant who's at the center of the Lakers' turmoil,
due to a perceived rift between him and O'Neal, a perception both
players downplay.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant acknowledges that the Lakers' ill performances only
feed such perceptions, and the losses themselves can pull a team
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, people tend to break off because they tend to
look at themselves and see what each individual can do to benefit
the team,'' he said, ``but then if you keep losing in that fashion,
you tend to break up even more. Then you read what's going on in
the paper, you tend to break up even more. I don't think it was
ever a matter of turmoil. It was a matter of losses giving you the
illusion that there was some type of turmoil.''

YANKEES RESCUE CLEMENS AND NIP RANGERS, 7-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Roger Clemens could have filled a corral with
all the family and friends who came to see the New York Yankee
right-hander pitch here on Tuesday night and attempt to break the
American League record for consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 40 folks on Clemens' pass list watched him
surrender five runs in the first inning and depart before the third
inning with a hamstring injury. But solid relief pitching by Hideki
Irabu and ninth-inning batting heroics by his teammates propelled
the Yankees to a 7-6 victory and kept Clemens from suffering his
first loss in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he still has a chance of breaking the American
League record of 17 consecutive victories, a mark he currently
shares with Dave McNally (Baltimore 1968-69) and Johnny Allen
(Cleveland, 1936-37). Carl Hubbell, the Hall of Fame left-hander
for the New York Giants. holds the major league record of 24
consecutive victories, set in 1936-37.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got Clemens off the hook with a two-run rally in the
ninth off John Wetteland. Chuck Knoblauch walked on four pitcehes
to lead off, Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill followed with singles for
the tying run, and Chili Davis fetched the the tiebreaker home with
a sacrifice fly with the base loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, who got the final out in the eighth, got the
victory, Mariano Rivera, who pitched a scoreless ninth, got the
save, and Clemens, whose injury was still being evaluated after the
game, got the sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' last loss was May 29, 1998; his streak of 17
consecutive winning decisions began last June 3, and in that time,
as on Tuesday night, he was occasionally rescued from a potential
loss by run support. On April 15 he allowed seven runs to Baltimore
and did not get a decision because the Yankees came back to tie the
game before losing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers pounded him on Tuesday night, to the delight of
the Texans who nearly filled the Ballpark at Arlington, where
Clemens is no longer welcome. After Clemens asked Toronto to deal
him in the off season, his agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks,
controlled the trade talks and, for reasons they believed
beneficial to Clemens, effectively scuttled possible swaps with
both the Rangers and the Houston Astros. Clemens landed with the
Yankees, and in donning pinstripes, Clemens scarred his image in
his home state. A twister of boos touched down here when Clemens
was introduced before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is accustomed to hostile crowds, but rarely does his
control fail him in the way it did on Tuesday night. Clemens
typically throws three pitches _ fastball, forkball and a curveball
_ and his accuracy is such that his catchers often can keep their
glove perfectly still in receiving his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Clemens' fastball seemed to flop out of his
hand like a water balloon. He had no command of his breaking ball,
and his forkball hung in the middle of the strike zone. He was ripe
for feasting and e Rangers indulged: of the 53 pitches Clemens
threw in his two innings, the Texas hitters swung and missed only
once.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Meriwether, the home plate umpire, did not give Clemens
anything extra around the edges of the strike zone, and time and
again Clemens would throw a pitch to the fringe, Meriwether would
call a ball, and Clemens would pause for just a moment in silent
protest. With his poor command, Clemens needed the fringes.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Clemens walked Tom Goodwin leading off, and with
Chuck Knoblauch edging closer to second base in case Goodwin tried
to steal, Mark McLemore pulled a ground ball to the right side.
Knoblauch, who otherwise would have been in position to make the
play, missed the ball with a headlong dive: a single.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, 2 for 26 in his career against Clemens, singled
through the middle to drive in the Rangers' first run. But the
parade of Texas hitters was only starting: Juan Gonzalez walked,
Rafael Palmeiro singled, Ivan Rodriguez reached on a fielder's
choice, Todd Zeile smashed a double to the wall in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The fans cooed ``Roger, Roger,'' to the tune of ``Darryl,
Darryl.'' Clemens finally retired Lee Stevens and Royce Clayton to
end the first, but he had allowed five runs and thrown 36 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens retired the Rangers in order in the second, but at some
point, he strained his left hamstring. As Texas prepared to bat in
the third, the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre went to Meriwether
and informed him of Clemens' injury.

FINDING REASONS FOR DISNEY PROFIT DIP AS EASY AS ABC

   BURBANK, Calif. _ Mickey Mouse's magic touch may be
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. shares plunged 7 percent Tuesday after the
entertainment giant announced that its year-to-year profit will
decline and likely lead to companywide cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually blunt assessment, Chairman Michael Eisner said
in a statement, ``Although the Disney franchise has a demonstrated
ability to drive long-term growth, we are definitely not satisfied
with our current performance. As a result, we are taking a number
of steps, including an across-the-board assessment of our cost
structure to address the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The profit decline _ attributed in great part to its acquisition
of ABC _ continues a yearlong malaise that has soured Wall Street
on Disney stock, which had been a star performer for most of
Eisner's 15-year tenure. Since May, amid an unprecedented bull
market, Disney shares have fallen 23 percent to $32.50 from their
record $42.375.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street doesn't love Eisner anymore,'' said Barry Hyman,
an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent analysts Andrew W. Marcus at BT Alex. Brown and Jill
S. Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney downgraded Disney. ``We are
currently looking at cutting our earnings estimates,'' said Linda
Bannister of Edward Jones. ``Right now, everything is under
review.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney reported, as expected, a 30 percent drop in profits to
$269 million, or 13 cents a share, in its second quarter ended
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, purchased three years ago as part of the $19 billion buyout
of Capital Cities/ABC, is part of the problem with profits held
down by higher costs and lagging ratings at the No. 3-rated
network.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner did not indicate whether any layoffs are coming among the
110,000 Disney employees. ``We intend to make our businesses more
efficient, increase our cash flow and position ourselves to better
capitalize on the long-term growth potential of our brands,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said a redefinition of Disney's business plan rather than
job cuts is likely. ``Laying people off is a superficial
solution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said Eisner might be considering forcing affiliate TV
stations to pick up programming costs or a step as drastic as
merging ABC with another network. He also recommended starting to
close Disney Stores, which now number more than 700. ``Something
has to be done intrinsically at ABC because they are fighting an
uphill battle with no clear answer yet,'' he said. ``To really
solve the problem, there's got to be a change at the core level.
It's going to be a tough road because there's not a quick-term
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister said looking at costs is a sensible strategy. ``That's
exactly what they need to do,'' she said. ``Disney has to be able
to grow earnings and they haven't seen earnings growth. Taking a
hard look at costs isn't a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating income for broadcasting actually came in better than
some analysts expected, rising 9 percent to $261 million due to
ESPN's performance and improved national advertising, but low ABC
ratings, high programming costs and ongoing softness in local ad
revenues held down profits.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income in the creative-content segment plunged to $163
million from $339 million last year, boosted by the re-release of
``The Little Mermaid'' and ``Peter Pan.'' Theme parks and resorts
continued to be the star performer with a 13 percent rise in
operating income to $305 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said results should improve in the next two quarters
but warned that the current fiscal year's final results will lag
last year's totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become the same story, quarter after quarter,'' Hyman
said. ``There's really not much you can do on the network level.
And the concept of the Disney Store is fading out so they have to
ask themselves if they want to go the way of Planet Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner is credited with transforming Disney from a stodgy theme
park-film company with $2 billion in annual revenues to a global
entertainment colossus with $24 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   He has weathered criticism over his compensation, which amounted
to more than half a billion dollars last year due almost entirely
to his exercise of stock options, and other issues mainly because
the stock price quadrupled over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street still has confidence in theme parks and motion
pictures, an area in which Disney has scaled back investment
moderately in recent years. Analysts also have been impressed with
Eisner's strategy of getting Disney established as an Internet
portal.

HEAT CRUISE PAST NETS, 95-76 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Alonzo Mourning was in Florida nursing
an injured right eye and still, it was not fair.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets, with a front line of itinerant professional
basketball players, were no match for a Miami Heat team filled with
fury after losing a 20-point lead and the game to the hated New
York Knicks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While the absences of Mourning, who was injured in Monday's game
in Cleveland, and the Nets' Keith Van Horn would seem to cancel
each other out, that simply was not so. Not with the Nets already
having been severely depleted; Jayson Williams, Jim McIlvaine, Rony
Seikaly, Scott Burrell and Eric Murdock all are out for the season
and so is Van Horn, who broke his left thumb in Sunday's victory
over Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the Nets muddled through Tuesday night's
game at the Continental Arena while the still well-stocked Heat
roared. It added up to Miami (31-14) going ahead by 18 points in
the first quarter and rolling to an easy 95-76 victory before a
crowd of 15,883.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 945th of Coach Pat Riley's career, placing
him second behind Lenny Wilkens (1,148), one game ahead of Bill
Fitch. Riley, however, played down the milestone, calling it just a
number, and instead drew more satisfaction from the fact that
Miami's number for clinching home court throughout the Eastern
Conference playoffs over Orlando (30-17) and Indiana (29-17) was
down to two.
</P>
<P>
   Without having Van Horn and his 21-point average to worry about,
Miami went with a simple strategy of hounding Stephon Marbury.
Trapping him on pick-and-rolls, the Heat took Marbury out of the
game and forced the other Nets to take charge. They couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to feel our heat, show them that they couldn't
take it to us,'' said Tim Hardaway, who helped hold Marbury to 10
points, 6 assists, 5 turnovers and 4-of-14 shooting. ``This team
feels good things are coming. The only thing that messed us up was
Sunday's game. We're still thinking about that and we don't want to
let it happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity for such a comeback was there, since the Heat
led by as many as 22 points in the second quarter and by 26 in the
third, but with the Heat staying focused and the Nets featuring
Mark Hendrickson (who started in place of Van Horn), Jamie Feick
(who is a shade shorter than 6 feet 8 inches), David Vaughn and
William Cunningham on the front line, there was little chance of
that happening.
</P>
<P>
   Those four were not in the National Basketball Association
before the Nets signed them to 10-day contracts in late March.
Cunningham, who played for the Nets under two 10-day contracts
earlier this season, was at home in Alabama as recently as Monday
before getting a call from the Nets after Van Horn went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were at full force tonight, there is no way that
happens,'' said Kendall Gill, who scored only 8 points. ``We were
caught off guard and that's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mourning had not been hit in the eye in Cleveland, there is
no telling how large the deficit would have been. A candidate for
the league's most valuable player award, Mourning had been
absolutely unstoppable in his three games against the Nets,
averaging 27 points, 15 rebounds, 6 blocked shots and several
thunderous dunks. He is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles had 17 points and 6 steals for the Nets, who visit
Detroit on Wednesday, and Chris Carr led them with 18 points, 16 in
the fourth quarter against the Miami reserves. By that time, it was
fair.

base before the end of the current homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn started at DH for the fifth game in a row Tuesday since
returning from disabled list April 22. He used Tuesday to take a
step towards returning to first by lessening the rigidity of the
tape job on his sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day it's getting better, Vaughn said. ``The way we've
been taping the whole time, it's been a tight job. And I think the
muscle's stronger than we felt it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn participated in batting practice and fielding drills
before Tuesday's game without any tape on the ankle. For the game,
the ankle was taped but not as tight.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins put a pinch runner in for Vaughn in the
seventh inning of Monday's game. Vaughn's spot in the lineup came
up in the ninth inning with the game tied, but the Angels had Tim
Unroe up instead. Unroe struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he doesn't like coming out of a game, but he
understands the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to do it,'' Vaughn said. ``We talked about that. I
know the game. It would be kind of selfish if I tried to stay in
the game. But if I was healthy, it'd be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be the 12th man on a 12-man pitching staff, but Scott
Schoeneweis is showing he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis' outing Monday was key in the Angels' 4-3, 11-inning
victory over Toronto. He threw three scoreless innings -- the
eighth, ninth and 10th innings -- allowed only two hits (both
singles) and didn't allow a Blue Jays baserunner to reach second
base.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, 25, was cut in spring training, then brought back
to the club when Rich DeLucia was released. Still, he only made the
team because Collins and his staff decided to go with 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it all along, and I know it's cliche, but I'm just
glad to be here,'' said Schoeneweis, who has a degree in history
from Duke University. ``You can't trade the experience of being
here for anything. Whatever role I have in the big leagues is fine
with me. Just being here is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis has been a starter all his life but is making the
adjustment to life in the bullpen just fine. In seven games, he is
0-0 with a 4.76 ERA. But throw out his first game -- in which he
had the major-league-debut jitters (5 runs in one-third of an
inning) -- and Schoeneweis has allowed one earned run in 11
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He followed starter Chuck Finley around during spring training
-- ``I probably annoyed the hell out of him,'' he said -- but now
spends his time picking the brains of the relievers and bullpen
coach Joe Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference in every respect,'' Schoeneweis said
of going from starter to reliever. ``From how you prepare for games
to working out and conditioning. Everything's different but when it
comes down to it, pitching is pitching. If you make your pitches
and execute your game, you'll have success.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins admitted the club wondered about how Schoeneweis would
make the adjustment from starter to reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only question,'' Collins said. ``He's got a good
arm, good stuff. He throws hard and he throws strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has indicated that he might not be able to keep 12
pitchers much longer. With the starters going deeper into games,
there is not enough work to go around for all the relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis might be the one to go, despite his success. But he
says he is grateful for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a big risk to put me in this situation,'' he said.
``I appreciate them having the confidence in me to do that. But I'd
rather be a reliever in the big leagues than a starter at triple-A,
and that's what it comes down to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Blue Jays play the third game of their four-game
series tonight beginning at 7:35. Tim Belcher (1-1, 8.53 ERA) will
start for Anaheim against Toronto's David Wells (3-1, 3.42).

KARIYA'S SEASON ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Don't bet against Craig Hartsburg in a poker game.
The Anaheim coach certainly had his best poker face on Tuesday
morning when he responded to a question about the status of Ruslan
Salei's shoulder by quietly saying ``the biggest blow to us is that
Paul Kariya won't play, he broke his foot in the last game.''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter was so caught off guard that Hartsburg was asked
``who? and he matter of factly responded ``Paul Kariya.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya was injured early in the third period of Sunday's Game 3
when he blocked a shot by Detroit defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a problem, but I didn't know it was that bad,''
said Kariya, who continued to play after being hit on the side of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim captain was hoping to play as late as Monday, even
after he found out the foot was broken, but by Tuesday morning
Kariya and the Ducks knew better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth the risk,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays showed that Kariya suffered a ``W shaped fracture of the
foot -- ``it's not a little break, it's substantial,'' said
Hartsburg, who did add that no surgery is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya said he expects the healing process will take at least
4-6 weeks, but the winger can't be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   He bruised a foot blocking a shot late in the 1995-96 season,
started favoring one leg and suffered an abdominal injury that
forced him to miss training camp and the first 11 games of the
'96-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who played in all 82 regular season games this season
after recovering from a bout of post-concussion syndrome, was upset
at the turn of events but not despondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel sorry for myself, I didn't last year,'' he said.
``Everything happens for a reason, I just don't know what that
reason is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who has worked very hard to become a complete two-way
player, said the injury wouldn't change his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do it again,'' he said. ``If anything I wish I could
have turned my foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a fluke thing, I was just in the wrong position.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg certainly didn't want to lose one of his two offensive
stars, but he praised Kariya's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say he shouldn't be doing that (blocking shots),''
he said. ``But that's a loser's mentality. Paul paid the price for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game, but it's bad luck for Paul,'' said
Ducks center Steve Rucchin. ``It's pretty unfortunate, considering
what has happended to him in the past, but he had a terrific year,
he has a lot to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Detroit defenseman Chris Chelios, who has had numerous battles
with Kariya over the years, had a unique answer when asked if he
was sorry to see Kariya hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a trick question, I'm not going to answer it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lidstrom was at least gave Kariya credit for his
willingness to play an all-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see (Steve) Yzerman do it (blocking shots) all the time,''
he said. ``It shows that they are into the game and want to play as
good on defense as they do on offense.''

CALIFORNIA EPA TO PROBE STATE-ROCKETDYNE RELATIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A division of the state Environmental
Protection Agency will investigate questions about the relationship
between Rocketdyne and state health officials over operation at the
Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the Simi Hills northwest of Los
Angeles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are allegations disclosed in the Daily News that state
Department of Health Services officials suppressed a cancer study
of residents and cooperated with Rocketdyne company officials to
try to get rid of an independent citizens oversight group directing
health investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The state EPA's toxic substances control division will conduct
``an independent review outside the DHS,'' said Anita Gore,
spokewoman for Grantland Johnson, secretary of the state's Health
and Human Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, including Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino, have
pressured Gov. Gray Davis and Johnson for the investigation and
called for three top DHS administrators who oversaw health
investigations at Rocketdyne to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Tuesday to the head of the state EPA, which oversees
the Division of Toxic Substances Control, Johnson said his agency
is ``very concerned that a thorough and independent review of
Assembly member Kuehl's concerns be performed, and that these
concerns be responded to quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehl's office was pleased but the co-chairman of the oversight
committee said he was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DTSC is as captured by Rocketdyne as is the DHS,'' said
Daniel Hirsch, co-chairman of the oversight committee, accusing the
regulatory agencies of having too close a relationship with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is needed is a thorough housecleaning of both agencies,''
said Hirsch, who also is president of the anti-nuclear group
Committee to Bridge the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   After the Daily News in 1989 reported that radiation and other
pollution had been released at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, a
massive federal cleanup was begun. In 1991, lawmakers _ concerned
that the DHS was not properly overseeing studies of possible health
effects _ formed a citizens oversight panel that included
scientific experts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said that over the years, they believe a too-close
relationship between Rocketdyne and the DHS has continued. In the
meantime, criticism has been raised about the DHS' handling of
other health matters, including suppressing a survey it
commissioned on the state's smoking ban and failing to track
children known to have lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the chairman of the state's Joint Legislative Audit
Committee said his group would be taking a broader look at the DHS.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehl and others charge that the DHS suppressed a 1997 cancer
survey taken of residents around the field laboratory. The document
was found earlier this month through a request made under the
state's public records act.
</P>
<P>
   Another document discovered was a proposal from Rocketdyne to
oust the current citizens oversight panel with a group of the
company's handpicked replacements. The DHS followed up with a
time-line indication when and how the committee could be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne and DHS officials have strenuously denied that they
have an inappropriate relationship, and insisted they are innocent
of wrongdoing.

BROWN MAKES IT A SCARY VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown charged Fernando
Vina's bunt, fielded it and slipped while throwing it to first.
</P>
<P>
   Almost before Vina reached first base, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson and trainer Charlie Strasser were at the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the heck out of me,'' Johnson said. ``He twisted his
back a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vina was out by a step, Brown faced two more batters and the
Dodgers started a nine-game road trip with a 3-2 win against the
Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi, upset about being moved from
fourth to fifth in the lineup, was the catalyst offensively. He
singled, stole a base and scored on a sacrifice fly in the second
inning, then hit a two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (2-1) pitched 62/3 innings for the win and Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his fifth save. Brewers left-hander Rafael
Roque (0-2) gave up five hits in six innings and took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was not going to throw me a fastball,'' said
Mondesi, who hit a changeup. ``It was 3-2, he was going to throw
something for a strike because he didn't want to put a couple guys
on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Brown said he was fine, downplaying any type of
injury. It's the same tack he took after tweaking his hip, being
hit in the left foot by a grounder and being hit in the right foot
by a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Johnson had better get used to it. It's the
third straight time and fourth this season that a Brown start has
included a visit by the medical staff. There seems to be no
avoiding Brown's reckless mode of fielding.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's making a kick save to stop a grounder or hustling
off the mound to field a bunt, Brown will do anything to make a
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I let guys bunt and get base hits?'' Brown said. ``I'm
not going to change. You have to react. You don't have time to say,
`Well, should I or (should I not) do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to ask Brown to change. His value is in his
pitching ability, and it's also in his competitive fire that forces
him to play at full speed on each pitch.
</P>
<P>
   On this occasion, it cost him a chance to pitch deeper into the
game, but the price is meager.
</P>
<P>
   After fielding Vina's bunt, he walked Marquis Grissom on four
straight pitches to bring Johnson back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lets you know how he's feeling,'' Dodgers catcher Todd
Hundley said. ``They asked him if he wanted to come out and he
said, `No, I'm fine. Leave me alone. Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitched to one more batter, getting Jeff Cirillo to fly
out before lefty Pedro Borbon came in to face left-handed batting
Jeremy Burnitz. There was no chance Brown would remain in the game.
In the first inning, it was Burnitz who put the Dodgers in a 2-0
hole with his sixth homer of the season. But in his next two
at-bats Burnitz struck out and grounded out to second, and clearly,
Brown wanted to face him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back out and said, `Can you get me one more out?' and
he said, `I'll get it,' '' Johnson said. ``It was awful cold on the
field, and from the way he threw the ball, with the torque, you
could tell he stretched something. If he wasn't so adamant, I would
have taken him out before.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing easy about Brown's fifth start with the
Dodgers. He had one perfect inning, walked four and struck out
seven.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the last six innings, the Brewers' leadoff man
reached base, and in each of those innings the leadoff runner got
into scoring position with less than two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want me to stay out there and hurt myself, and I
told them I'd be all right,'' Brown said. ``I wish I could have
made it easier on myself and everyone else. The key was not giving
in _ and when guys were in scoring position, to find a way to
battle out of it. I'm not looking to come out of any game unless
you're hurt.''

DRIVE TO HONOR VALENS GETS BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign by his family and supporters to get
Ritchie Valens inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has
received a boost from a local congressman and the head of the
Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of U.S. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills,
Hilary B. Rosen, president and chief executive officer of the
Washington, D.C.-based association, said Tuesday she will make it a
priority to recommend the rock 'n' roll legend from Pacoima as a
nominee next year to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ritchie Valens deserves to be nominated and I'm going to work
with the congressman on that,'' said Rosen, a board member of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Valens' aunt, Ernestine Reyes of suburban Pacoima, who has been
working since 1995 to get Valens inducted into the Hall of Fame,
said she was hopeful that Rosen's support would bring Valens the
recognition he deserves. Even today, Reyes continues to receive
about 20 pieces of fan mail a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't express how much he deserves to be in the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame,'' said Reyes. ``He did so much in the short time
that he lived and I pray to God that he'll get up there soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Valens' record company and family have gathered thousands of
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes will be gathering petition signatures during the fifth
annual Ritchie Valens festival, called ``The Legend Lives On,'' on
May 7-8 at Ritchie Valens Recreation Center in Pacoima. The
postcard petitions are part the campaign launched several years ago
by Valens' former Los Angeles record company, Del-Fi Records Inc.,
to get him nominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything in my power to raise this issue with my
fellow board members and to encourage Mr. Valens' induction,''
wrote Rosen in a response to Berman's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Berman's spokesman, Tom Waldman, said Berman is confident that
Rosen's support will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Recording Industry Association is very well-respected. Her
support certainly gets us further than ever before,'' said Waldman.
</P>
<P>
   Valens, who died at the age of 17 in an Iowa plane crash on Feb.
3, 1959, was nominated for the first time last September, though he
had been eligible for the Hall of Fame since 1983. Eligibility
begins 25 years after an artist's record is released.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, who last spring began actively campaigning on Valens'
behalf by lobbying the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominating
committee, sent letters to Rosen and her fellow board members last
February, seeking their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of Valens' friends and contemporaries, including Little
Richard, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis, have
already been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yet he
is overlooked year after year ...,'' wrote Berman, whose
congressional district includes Pacoima, where Valens grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation presents all eligible
artists to a nominating committee, then selects the nominees
through a series of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees are then placed on a ballot sent to an
international voting body of more than 800 members from the music
industry, including artists, producers, journalists and other music
industry executives. Between five to seven artists are selected
annually.

DOZING ANGELS HAVE NIGHTMARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels' performance against the Toronto Blue Jays
on Tuesday night should have been rated ``R.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Revolting.
</P>
<P>
   Regretful.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Angels, their 10-1 loss before 17,899 at Edison
Field counted for only one loss in the standings. Time will tell if
there is any residual effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made only two physical errors. But the mental errors,
those that are not counted on the scoreboard, were numerous. It all
started with Angels starting pitcher Omar Olivares, whose mind
seemed to drift in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and Shawn Green on first base in the first inning,
Olivares failed to pay much attention to Green, who stole second
base easily.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Carlos Delgado, Olivares drifted off again. Green
and Delgado got such good jumps on an Olivares pitch that catcher
Matt Walbeck didn't even bother to make a throw, as Green and
Delgado stole third and second, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fernandez followed with a two-run single, then caught
Olivares napping again. As Olivares stared in at the catcher,
Fernandez took off for second. Olivares turned and threw to second,
but neither shortstop Andy Sheets nor second baseman Randy Velarde
was at the bag, and the ball sailed into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez took third and Olivares was charged with the error.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Blue Jays had four runs, four hits and four stolen
bases in the inning. And it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (2-2) was gone by the time the Angels played like
clowns again _ in the fifth inning. After a double, Green stole
third on pitcher Mike Magnante. It was Green's third steal of the
game, despite just one steal all season going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado followed with a grounder to first baseman Darin Erstad,
who caught Green too far off the bag at third and began a rundown.
Third baseman Troy Glaus got the ball and ran Green toward the
plate. Problem was, he never caught up and never threw the ball,
allowing Green to score.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and the Angels got a second chance to get the rundown play
right later in the inning, with Glaus catching and tagging Delgado
as he ran toward the plate. However, it allowed the two other
runners to move up a base to second and third, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the sixth inning when Velarde dropped a throw on a
relay from the outfield, allowing Jose Cruz, who had doubled in two
runs, to move to third on the error.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for many of the fans, who booed, including one
fan who went down to the dugout and berated the Angels players as
they came off the field at the end of the inning. The fan was
cheered as he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen (1-1) threw seven scoreless
innings, allowing only three hits. The Angels' only run of the game
came on Sheets' home run in the eighth inning.

   He spoke of a time when the same handful of deferential Mexican
farm workers repeatedly used his place as their first stop-off
point on their way north.
</P>
<P>
   They cleaned Cureton's barn. He gave them a cup of well water, a
sandwich and a place to sleep in the hayloft.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than a hundred footpaths littered with toilet paper,
water bottles, plastic bags and dirty diapers cross the Rocker M,
10 miles east of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   They've been beaten into the desert floor by the endless stream
of illegal immigrants _ as many as 10,000 a month _ who take on
this arid obstacle course of rattlesnakes and thickets of prickly
pear, mesquite, agave, ocotillo and cholla spines that tear the
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine all the drugs and groups of people coming by
here at night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cureton still runs into the occasional solo Mexican. But most of
the time, he said, the visitor is carrying a backpack full of
marijuana. Cureton quickly heads the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Cureton's 14-year-old son, Randy, shook his head disgustedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is like the drug capital of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the front lines of the illegal immigration crisis,
residents like Cureton say they're caught between the illegals and
federal government, forced to endure property damage from both
sides and helpless to stop a slow-motion ``invasion'' that's
recently and ominously speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have decided to be helpless no longer. About 30
landowners have formed the Concerned Citizens of Cochise County to
lobby government officials to control the flow of illegal
immigrants through this, the most heavily crossed area in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, one member of the organization personally
detained a group of 27 illegals on his ranch and called the U.S.
Border Patrol. The organization last week asked Gov. Jane Hull to
send the Arizona Army National Guard to the Douglas area.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by an emotional meeting Saturday in Bisbee
among 200 Cochise County residents, U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
and U.S. Attorney Jose de Jesus Rivera. The citizens were warned
about taking the law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cureton said he wouldn't dare do that. But he said the ranch
north of the Rocker M had two pickup trucks stolen in recent weeks.
He also said his other neighbors have had vehicles stolen and their
homes burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Still, Cureton said that on most days he's bothered more by the
federal government than by the illegals.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol tears down gates and runs roughshod across the
30-section ranch, Cureton said, at times shining floodlights in his
bedroom window late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Once he got so mad that he ran a Border Patrol vehicle off the
road, Cureton said; the agents inside came at him with weapons
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   But many other area ranchers say they welcome any help they can
get _ even from Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Thelma Vance, retirees who live three miles east of
Douglas, say their property is a maze of trails left by interlopers
tromping through by the hundreds each night. Mexico is one mile
south, through whitethorn, greasewood and catclaw. The house is
defended by barbed wire, an inner cyclone fence and wrought iron
around the patio.
</P>
<P>
   On just one evening in February, a Border Patrol tower recorded
800 people going by the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not an invasion, what is?'' Thelma Vance asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sympathize with them trying to come here and make a better
life for themselves,'' she said, ``but their country has to take
care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vance said it's time for U.S. leaders to tell their
southern neighbor, ``Either you do something about it, or we're
going to _ which might even mean an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people who have influence on our
representatives, and don't want to insult Mexico and tackle real
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solution? Either 5,000 Border Patrol officers, or put the
military here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers and other border residents complain about cut fences,
trash, thievery and vandalism. Beyond all that, they say the stream
of illegals makes them fearful of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Though few ranchers report any assaults or armed robberies by
immigrants, they say the desperation of smugglers _ known as
``coyotes'' or ``polleros'' _ keeps them worried.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Larry Vance Jr. climbs a 30-foot-tall tower in his
back yard and uses infrared binoculars to watch out for
``two-legged coyotes that are illegal to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Vance, who keeps a pistol on the coffee table, is
co-chairman of the concerned citizens group.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Cochise County have taken the law into their own
hands. Roger Barnett, owner of the Crossroads Ranch northeast of
Douglas, said he and some armed pals patrol the 22,000-acre
property on weekends, looking for trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Barnett and two other men came across
footprints. ``We saw the tracks. It looked fresh,'' he said. ``So
we followed 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said he and his friends found about 30 immigrants
covered with blankets and grass. Some ran, but only one managed to
get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We marched 'em to the road and called Border Patrol,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in recent months, Barnett said, trespassers flattened
fences, stole a truck from the ranch yard and emptied an
8,000-gallon water tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leaving trash all over the place,'' he added. ``If
this was any other country besides the United States, they'd have
troops on the line and there'd be bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cureton doesn't want to see that. In fact, he wants to move on
to greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocker M has been up for sale in recent months. Potential
buyers marvel at the bargain-basement price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then they come for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy come down from Wyoming in January talking about
how he couldn't wait to put his deposit down,'' Cureton said. ``But
then he went up on the road by the Mexican border and watched the
train of people going by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never head from him again.'' &QL;

KATZENBERG OUTLINES EISNER SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Their strong relationship at The Walt Disney Co.
ravaged by a contract dispute, Jeffrey Katzenberg has testified
that Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner came to his home and
told him to ``behave yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The showdown came after Katzenberg quit Disney in 1994, despite
warnings he would lose a blockbuster bonus if he didn't stay for
two more years. He later sued the studio for more than $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand why a game was being played with me,''
Katzenberg said Tuesday during the second day of trial, which will
determine whether Disney owes him $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was unhappy with the press that was going on and
somehow thought I controlled it,'' Katzenberg said, under
questioning from his lawyer, Bert Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg sued Disney in 1996, seeking past and future profits
from hits that came under his watch, such as ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``The Color of Money.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was partially settled last year, but the parties still
have to go through the damages phase of trial.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties agree Disney must cut Katzenberg a check, the
amount is still at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Disney lawyer Louis Meisinger appealed to
the private judge handling the case, Paul Breckenridge, asking him
to keep the trial from degrading into a personal battle between two
men.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner will get a chance to respond to Katzenberg's allegations
on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg also testified Tuesday that his last meeting with his
boss before he left Disney was in Eisner's office, where he told
the chief executive officer that a deal memo that spelled out his
bonus was easy enough for his 11-year-old to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up from his desk and literally backed away,''
Katzenberg said, contending that Eisner told him to leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a fraud claim, Katzenberg and the studio are
disputing how the interest on his 2 percent bonus should be paid
and are asking Breckenridge to determine what inflation rate should
be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also claims Katzenberg should not get money for
merchandise that is sold in Disney-owed outlets, such as Disney
Stores and its theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg spoke quietly during his five hours on the witness
stand, and was told by the judge to keep his answers short.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg is scheduled to return to the witness stand today.

OFFICER MUST CHOOSE GUN OR ROLE AS YOUTH MENTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Haynes wants to be a Valley Big Brother, to serve as a
much-needed friend and mentor to a fatherless boy.
</P>
<P>
   His credentials seem in order: a single man with a clean record,
employed for 12 years in a responsible job where he's now a
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley Big Brothers/Big Sisters says no.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Haynes is a Phoenix police sergeant who, like
many officers, typically carries his gun while off duty. And Valley
Big Brothers/Big Sisters says he can't do so while he is with a
Little Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Organization officials say they must be especially cautious in
setting conditions for their children. For Haynes, the decision is
an over-reaction that seems to defeat the goal of finding positive
role models for youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an unreasonable fear about guns here,''
Haynes said. ``I am a police officer, trained in the use of a
pistol, and it strikes me as irrational to disqualify me over this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A Valley Big Brothers/Big Sisters executive said confidentiality
rules forbade her from discussing the Haynes case specifically, but
said the organization's policy about guns is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the child is around our volunteers who own guns they
either must have them locked up or the ammunition must be separate
from the gun,'' said Madeleine Stilwell, director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police don't know how many of their 2,600 sworn officers
carry weapons off duty, but a department spokesman estimated the
number as ``fairly significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Torres said the department will not take sides in this
issue. But he noted that last year off-duty officers intervened in
two armed robberies and used their pistols in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, a suspect was confronted at gunpoint and
apprehended. In the other, a suspect was wounded, then apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is just that sort of situation that gives Valley Big
Brothers/Big Sisters pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a concern that a police officer carrying a gun off
duty might have to step in during a crime _ use a weapon he is
carrying when a child is there,'' Stilwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern always must be for the safety of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres said responding to a crime in progress is not the only
reason an off-duty officer might carry a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers who know they're going to be in a fairly tough area
often go armed,'' he said. ``But also some officers whose duty has
brought them into contact with some questionable characters carry a
weapon as a matter of self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, 35, has dealt with questionable characters during his
years on the force. For about three years he supervised a patrol
squad in one of the most crime-ridden areas of the South Mountain
Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dealt with some extremely violent people as part of my
job,'' Haynes said. ``I recently had a guy who I'd arrested come up
to me when I was off duty, but then he thanked me for arresting him
and starting to get his life turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it could have gone the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said he applied to be a Valley Big Brother last summer,
and was impressed by the thoroughness of the background check the
organization did on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know everything about me, asked some very
personal questions,'' said the unmarried, childless Haynes. ``But I
had no trouble with those questions and am glad they are so
thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on his service record, Haynes said, relates to
a traffic stop in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw a furtive movement from the man I'd stopped,
something dangerous, and there wasn't, but I fired my weapon,''
Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   He wounded the man in the arm. The man recovered and the city
paid a settlement, Haynes said. He received a one-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said that during the fall and winter he progressed
through Valley Big Brothers/Big Sisters security checks and
meetings. Finally came an inspection of his Mesa house, and then
came the issue of carrying a firearm while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked by the organization if he would agree not to carry
a gun while off duty. ``I said I was sorry, but I couldn't agree
that I never would carry a gun off duty when I was with my Little
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Haynes got the word: Unless he would agree not to
carry a gun when not on duty and with a Little Brother, he wouldn't
get a Little Brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a lot to offer to a young person,'' Haynes
said. ``I want to show a young man the importance of honesty,
working hard, being a good student. It is the kind of values my
father gave to me and I want to do that for another young person.''
</P>
<P>
   Stilwell said the organization's directors specifically
discussed the question of off-duty officers carrying guns around
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 20 officers from various agencies who are
volunteers, and this question has not caused a problem in those
cases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has decided to keep with the policy that police
volunteers should not have weapons when with a child. Our concern
is if the police officer used the weapon when a child is there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not easy,'' Stilwell said. ``But if we err, we have to
err on the side of the child.'' &QL;

MASSACHUSETTS UNVEILS NEW BID TO KEEP PATRIOTS OUT OF HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Challenging Connecticut's deal to move the New England
Patriots to Hartford, Massachusetts officials announced on Tuesday
night that they had put together a rival plan that is backed by the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul Cellucci and top state legislators said Massachusetts
would provide $70 million for parking, landscaping and other
improvements for a new stadium next to the old one at Foxboro,
about 30 miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Patriots would pay for the $250 million
stadium, with generous loans from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are second acts in American life,'' said the Senate
president, Thomas F. Birmingham. ``It appeared the Patriots were
irretrievable lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders said the state House and Senate would vote
on the package in time for it to be considered when NFL owners meet
to consider the Patriots' move in late May.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan is quite similar to a previous one that was
acceptable to the Patriots but was deemed too generous by the
speaker of the state House, Thomas Finneran. Under that plan, the
Patriots would have put in $200 million for the stadium and the
state $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's prospects for keeping the Patriots began to slip
publicly on Friday when the NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue,
traveled to Boston to lobby state officials and business executives
to come up with a deal to keep the team. In recent weeks, Patriots
officials have grown concerned about the site Hartford had chosen
for a $375 million stadium for the team, and NFL officials worried
about the drawbacks of moving the team out of of a major television
market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the nation's sixth-largest television market; Hartford
is the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, has made no comment
in recent days as Tagliabue worked with Massachusetts to devise a
plan. But officials here took his silence as a willingness to at
least consider an offer from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Gov. John Rowland, who had endured much
criticism for the lucrative terms he granted the Patriots, has
become annoyed at the precariousness of a deal that he thought was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts, with all due respect, has had five years to
work on this,'' he said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced on Tuesday night, Massachusetts would
require to pay a $1 million user fee a year to cover the costs of
new highway ramps to the stadium and other improvements, which
would help the state would incur to pay for the changes, and
$400,000 annually for use of the satellite parking lots built by
the state. That element was not part of previous packages discussed
by Massachusetts and the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a viable alternative to Connecticut,''
Cellucci said. ``Now this will be a decision for the National
Football League and the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Any move by the Patriots would have to win the approval of
three-quarters of the NFL team owners. Massachusetts officials said
that if Kraft did not jump at their offer, they may present it to
the owners directly. ``He may not be the master of his own fate,''
Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut had begun negotiating with Kraft after the
Massachusetts Legislature had refused to approve the incentives
that he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut plan, which was approved by the Legislature in
December, called for the state to pay the entire cost of the
stadium and guaranteed Kraft a profit on the sale of club seats and
sky boxes. Although the Massachusetts plan would require Kraft to
finance the stadium, the proposal was made more attractive by a
recent change in NFL policy on new stadiums in the largest markets.
Kraft would be able to borrow half of the money from the NFL, and
would be able to repay it with revenue from premium seats that
otherwise would go to the visiting team.

L.A. AREA SCHOOLS STRUGGLE TO QUELL RUMORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News staff writers David R. Baker, Charles F. Bostwick and
Cecilia Chan   contributed to this story.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY and TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At Quartz Hill High School, two students were
arrested Tuesday for threatening to blow up the school, authorities
said. Students said it was a prank and no bomb-making materials
were found.
</P>
<P>
   At Granada Hills High, the principal sent out a letter to the
homes of all 3,500 students to quell rumors that some dire event
would occur ``Friday or Saturday or Monday or Cinco de Mayo or May
6 or May 20.'' And she invited each of the students to write her
back expressing their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In schools throughout the Los Angeles region and all over
America, police and school officials are grappling with a new
phenomenon in the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., high school
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor or fact, fantasy or reality, the fear of campus violence
has taken on a new seriousness in the lives of children, parents
and authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sense of alarm among law enforcement and
school officials and students bombarded with exposure,'' said June
Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety Center in
Westlake Village. ``Everybody is concerned they don't overlook any
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   A tip from a student led deputies to arrest two Quartz Hill High
students, ages 14 and 15, in the Antelope Valley on allegations
that they threatened to bomb the school. Another boy was cited for
possessing an inert grenade, and three other youths were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies found a school map with escape routes; a copy of ``The
Anarchist's Cookbook,'' a book that contains bomb-making
instructions; and a note reading ``DARC, or Death, Anarchy, Revenge
and Chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we confronted them, they said they were just joking
around,'' said Detective Steven Owen of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department. ``We can't take it as a joke, unfortunately,
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lancaster sheriff's Sgt. Darrel Brown, who also is a board
member of the Antelope Valley Union High School District north of
Los Angeles: ``This is all post-Littleton hoax stuff. They were
looking for the reaction from their fellow students. Now they're in
serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the youths' comments were spread by word of mouth
around the campus, alarming many students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids stayed home today,'' Brown said. ``Parents kept kids
home.''
</P>
<P>
   At Granada Hills High, Principal Kathleen Rattay said rumors
were rampant. For example, a lunchtime fire in a trash can Friday
turned into a story that someone had lobbed a bomb into the
receptacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very upsetting to see so many of our students are
fearful,'' she said. ``There has been absolutely nothing to
substantiate any rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoaxes or not, school officials across Southern California said
that in light of the Colorado shooting they have no choice but to
check every threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   A student wearing a gothic outfit and another student who
threatened to ``shoot up the place'' at El Camino Real High School
in suburban Woodland Hills last week prompted increased security at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   School officials confiscated the student's clothes and called
his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents were absolutely shocked and embarrassed by their
youngster's actions,'' said Principal Ron Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of the student's threat to attack the school. ``At
this time we believe it was an idle, irresponsible comment made by
a student to pester another student,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Burbank Unified School District, Marissa Rosoff, the
coordinator of school safety, said there have been no rumors, but
that students seem more forthcoming with their concerns. ``They
have brought forward things they are worried about,'' Rosoff said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Glendale, north of L.A., parents have been calling
schools for information about safety programs, but none has
reported peculiar problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Conejo Valley Unified School District in neighboring
Ventura County, administrators said there have been eight or nine
rumors of threatened violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just very general _ Something bad is going to happen
at one of the schools sometime this week,'' said Richard Simpson,
assistant superintendent of instructional services for the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Each was taken seriously and checked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of phone calls, mostly from parents who are
trying to do one of two things _ give us a heads-up on what they've
heard from their own kid or make sure we heard about it and are
looking into it,'' Simpson said. ``That's the kind of information
we want.''
</P>
<P>
   By asking students at Granada Hills High to write her, the
principal said she hoped it would stem the rumors, ease fears and
help get troubled students into counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Among the students' replies:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I've heard rumors from my friends I want you to check out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm terrified. I cry at night because I worry about these
things. Please help us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You're blowing everything out of proportion. Leave us alone.
We'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lieberman, a Los Angeles Unified School District
psychologist, said rumor control is vital in the aftermath of any
tragedy, although spreading rumors is almost a teen-age hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is a natural part of adolescence, to take certain
stories and stretch it out,'' Lieberman said. ``And for others,
it's a passive-aggressive way of showing they need some
attention.''

country. Paprika doesn't amount to much in the American kitchen.

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ And so we bid a fond adieu to Paul and Teemu, the most
entertaining odd couple this side of ``Dharma and Greg.'' The Magic
Wingdom show starring Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne is officially
on hiatus until the fall, the Mighty Ducks' season pulled from the
playoff lineup by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   A broken right foot kept Kariya off the ice on Tuesday. That
left the Ducks with virtually no leg to stand on against the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. They did well to keep
their balance for the better part of two periods before the Wings
knocked them out of the Western Conference quarterfinals with a 3-0
win at the Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   When the Magic Wingdom show resumes in the fall, the NHL will be
a programming arm of ABC and its cable stepsister, ESPN. This means
you can expect to see quite a lot of the two mightiest Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne and Kariya, like ``Dharma and Greg'' stars Jenna Elfman
and Thomas Gibson, are beholden to the same boss. That would be the
sovereign heads of the vast Disney empire, of which ABC and the
Mighty Ducks are separate _ but synergetic _ nation-states.
</P>
<P>
   The hope throughout the league is the mountain range of hype
that marks the Disney landscape will be a boon for the NHL's
declining television ratings. What would it hurt to have Selanne
and Kariya appear as themselves on ``Sports Night,'' the ABC
sitcom? A little cross-promotion, after all, can go a long way
toward broadening hockey's audience.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is serendipitous, what with the NHL losing its most
recognizable face earlier this month (not that many people seemed
to notice; Wayne Gretzky's final game attracted roughly the same
number of television viewers as the final round of that week's
Senior PGA event).
</P>
<P>
   How to divert eyeballs from the links to the rinks? It won't be
easy, especially now that Gretzky is off to join the celebrity
golfing circuit. To be sure, Gretzky's retirement has created a
black hole as vast as Saskatchewan. The good news is there are a
few stars capable of penetrating The Great One's gravitational
field.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya and Selanne are two of them. Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr
and Detroit's Sergei Fedorov _ who collected six points in the
Ducks series _ are two more. Led by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman,
the powers-that-be wisely seem inclined to assemble a constellation
instead of hanging all their hype on a single star, as the NBA did
with the Lakers' Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be pure folly to force-feed the public one personality when
there's a terrific player for almost every taste. For those
enamored of all skaters North American, there's Kariya, a
contemplative, creative, quick, quiet type.
</P>
<P>
   His sound bytes might not dazzle you, but his game surely will.
The winger, who is of Canadian-Japanese descent, has feet like
Ronaldo, a release like Dan Marino, a work ethic like Michael
Jordan and a decency that calls to mind Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he guards his privacy as carefully as the late Joe
DiMaggio? The smallish (5-foot-11) forward bares all of himself on
the ice. To wit: He broke his foot in Sunday's Game 3 while
blocking a shot, a dirty little job many a star would be loath to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr and Selanne have the same grit and magnetic auras, too.
Each is equal part sniper and showman. Selanne's 47 goals led all
skaters during the regular season. So did Jagr's 127 points.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne used to race cars in his homeland of Finland during the
offseason; the Pittsburgh Penguins' Jagr, who is from the Czech
Republic, has gone shopping in drag in an effort to avoid
detection. Then there's Fedorov, who is from Russia but looks as
though he came straight out of a Calvin Klein ad.
</P>
<P>
   The first player to get his own signature line of hockey skates,
Fedorov is the crown prince on the nearest thing the NHL has to a
dynasty. Lately he has attracted more attention for the company he
keeps off the ice; his gal pal is tennis vixen Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, Jagr and Fedorov represent the NHL's changing face. In
1979-80, when Gretzky entered the league, only six percent of the
players were from outside North America. Now 24 percent hail from
Europe. It's a global game, even if a myopic American sporting
public is the last to recognize it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds was a one-man wrecking crew Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with a no-hitter for 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   He made a spectacular grab of a line drive that knocked him
backward onto the mound.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he and the Astros knocked out the Arizona
Diamondbacks 11-0 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds came within seven outs of a no-hitter before allowing a
single to right field by Luis Gonzalez in the seventh inning. He
and reliever Brian Williams combined on a six-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   One batter earlier, Reynolds indicated something special was
possible when he caught a line drive from Matt Williams, igniting a
standing ovation from the crowd of 19,396.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about it,'' said Reynolds, who retired 20 of
the first 22 batters he faced. ``After making that play, I tried to
nit-pick too much to Gonzo. He's a good hitter, and he's swinging a
hot bat right now. I didn't want to walk another guy, so I made too
good of a pitch and he did his job and got a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a former Astro, lives a couple of blocks from Reynolds
in Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality pitcher. He's a legitimate No. 1 (starter),''
said Gonzalez, who was 0-for-2 before extending his hitting streak
to 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 hours, 54 minutes of beauty, with Reynolds and the
Astros doing no wrong. The Astros provided their ace with plenty of
support with a season high in runs and also shined defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-run margin of defeat matched the Diamondbacks' worst in
their 13-month history.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' first shutout of the season was a costly one.
Shortstop Ricky Gutierrez suffered a fracture on the back of his
left hand when he was hit by a pitch in the fourth inning. He is
expected to miss four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros provided Reynolds with all the support he would need
during a six-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (4-1), who signed a three-year, $21.5 million contract
extension in January, allowed five hits, walked two and struck out
five in eight innings. He ran his scoreless-innings streak to 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough to put something together against,'' Arizona
manager Buck Showalter said. ``You give him a cushion, and it
creates a pretty tough night. He's not a secret in anybody's book
that has to face him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has won 11 of his past 13 decisions since last Aug. 14.
In his four wins this season, Reynolds has allowed 11 earned runs
and 35 hits while striking out 35 in 34 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought he had a chance (at the no-hitter,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``His control was sharp, and he wasn't
throwing anything (hittable) over the plate. He wanted to pitch the
shutout, but he had over 100 pitches (106 total) and was worn
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds credited good location of his fastball, curveball and
split-finger fastball for his success. He rarely was behind in the
count, and he kept the Diamondbacks off-balance with several looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hitter he threw a different sequence of pitches,''
catcher Tony Eusebio said.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for Diamondbacks righthander Armando
Reynoso. Whatever he threw, the Astros hit. Nine Houston batters
had at least one hit, with Eusebio going 3-for-4. Craig Biggio,
Derek Bell, Jeff Bagwell and Ken Caminiti _ the top four spots in
the batting order _ went a combined 7-for-17 with six RBIs and five
runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros came up with a couple of clutch defensive plays
to preserve first Reynolds' no-hit bid, then the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Tony Womack sent a grounder up the middle. Biggio
made a backhand snag and threw from the left side of the infield to
make the play. Then with two runners on in the eighth inning, Bell
threw out Kelly Stinnett, who was attempting to score from second
base on a single by Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros went ahead 7-0 after sending 11 batters to the plate
in the fourth inning against Reynoso and reliever John Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso held the Astros to one hit and one run over the first
three innings with six strikeouts but quickly ran into trouble.
Caminiti led off the fourth with a single up the middle, and
Richard Hidalgo followed with a double that sailed over the head of
Gonzalez and off the scoreboard in left field. Two batters later,
Eusebio sent a sharp line drive past the pitcher into center field
to score Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   After Reynoso (1-1) hit Gutierrez to load the bases, Reynolds
helped his cause with a perfectly executed bunt down the third-base
line that scored Hidalgo. Biggio then send a two-run double to
right field to put the Astros ahead 5-0. Bell chased Reynoso with
an RBI single to center field, and the Astros showed no mercy
against Frascatore, who surrendered an RBI single to Bagwell. The
Astros had six of their 14 hits in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Biggio put the Astros ahead 8-0 with a solo home
run to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso, who hadn't pitched since April 18, lost for the first
time in six starts this season. He allowed seven runs and six hits
in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added three more runs in the seventh inning off
Diamondbacks reliever Brian Anderson, the big blow a two-run double
by Reynolds.

 A GAY CANTERBURY IN BIBLE BELT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Like all things Texan, the new $20 million church about
to break ground in Dallas is big, and the congregation building it
is one of the fastest-growing in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What's not so Texan is that this church is lesbian and gay, and
the architecture _ a great slumping, tilting, bending, iceberg-like
mass _ is cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as ``the first cathedral of the 21st century'' and
architect Philip Johnson's crowning legacy, the Cathedral of Hope
will be a great gathering point for homosexual Christians _ a kind
of gay Canterbury _ planted in what pastor Michael Piazza calls
``the buckle of the Bible Belt.''
</P>
<P>
   For super-architect Johnson, a gay man who at 92 may be building
the last great project of his career, religion is art. ``I would
work for the devil himself if he came around the right way,''
Johnson said in a phone interview from his New York office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we architects all like to do is to make beautiful shapes.
It's very hard to make a beautiful shape out of an office building.
But a church is a challenge and a wonderful thing, because you can
create sacred space.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there is no question that this will be one of his
greatest works ``because of the scale and the purpose. Religion is
the most important thing you can make into architecture. Throughout
history, religion has demanded the greatest work from architects
and sculptors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Europe's great Gothic cathedrals, the new church is
intended not only to house a congregation that has already outgrown
a large new building finished just six years ago, but to serve as a
spiritual center, a ``psychological cathedral for gays and lesbians
around the world,'' according to church literature.
</P>
<P>
   That a gay cathedral would rise in such unfriendly territory _ a
Southern Baptist culture where homosexuality is an abomination and
political and religious leaders have made a holy crusade of
fighting it _ may seem odd.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's only natural, argues assistant pastor Paul
Tucker, who was raised in Alabama as a fundamentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us come from very conservative religious backgrounds,
and they're told horrible things about themselves and made to
believe horrible things about themselves, because of who they
are,'' said Tucker, who calls such thinking ``religious abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any heterosexual would say their sexuality is
not a core of who they are _ it's just a basic, deep part of us _
and yet the heterosexual world has said to gay and lesbian people,
this is not a good part of you, and it can't be a part of your
faith, and it can't be a part of a healthy life,'' Tucker says.
``This has just really caused huge, huge damage to gay and lesbian
people, and that's why having a place like this is so important, to
give people a beacon of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Dallas churches, while opposed _ often vehemently _ to
homosexuality, mostly leave the Cathedral of Hope alone. Religion
is highly valued by Dallas culture, almost trumping hostility to
homosexuality. And the Cathedral of Hope baptizes more new
Christians every month than other Baptist churches in Dallas,
Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although they really have this issue about being gay as a
sin, they also are glad we're going to church,'' Piazza said.
``It's been at the very least an attitude of tolerance. While they
may disagree with us theologically on the issue of homosexuality,
they appreciate the church and what it does and the fact that it is
a church _ that we really are trying to provide a spiritual home
for people who they don't really want.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's success is unarguable. Dr. Lyle Schaller, one of
the world's leading church consultants, estimates that with a
membership of 2,400, the Cathedral of Hope is now one of the
nation's largest Protestant congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rough, but I would put it in the largest one third of
the largest one percent,'' Schaller said. ``In other words, 99.7
percent of other congregations have fewer people at worship.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, with a congregation of 2,400, has already amassed,
largely from its own ranks, more than $7 million of the $20 million
needed to complete its new building. The groundbreaking for the
bell tower _ which will contain an electronic registry of people
who have died of AIDS _ will begin within weeks. The construction
of the building itself is expected to start sometime next spring
and last until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure it will be a remarkable building, an abstract
behemoth of concrete-on-steel construction that will bend upward in
great curved intersecting planes. The concept is an outgrowth of
Johnson's ``Gatehouse'' at his home in New Canaan, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   When people walk into the new church, Johnson said he wants them
to experience ``a sense of awe, the same thing as I get when I go
into Chartres Cathedral in France.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect will come from a combination of light, shapes and
colors, he said, that is as much sculpture as building. Church
literature calls it ``a new kind of architecture freed from the
constraints of the straight line and rigid adherence to the rules
of gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising drive has gone national with events in New York
and Los Angeles and another planned soon for San Francisco, but
most of the money is coming from local residents in contributions
ranging from a few dollars to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience for the cathedral is pretty narrow,'' said
development director Randy Spraybary. ``It's people interested in
art or architecture or our cause, so it's more low-key than you
might expect for a nationwide campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``cause'' itself is anything but low-key, however. Pastor
Piazza, a 44-year-old ex-Methodist minister from Georgia, regularly
battles fundamentalist preachers on television, and the church has
just settled a lawsuit with cable superstation WGN in Chicago to
air a half-hour documentary originally titled ``Holy Homosexuals''
after a book Piazza wrote, but has since changed to ``Cathedral of
Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The paid broadcast began airing nationally April 8, after it was
turned down by WGN as well as ABC television, Discovery Channel,
Black Entertainment Television and Odyssey. The church sued, and
WGN settled by agreeing to air the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza also held a rally recently to accuse Texas Governor
George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, of pandering to religious conservatives by opposing
adoptions by gays and a hate-crimes bill. ``He wants the world to
believe that he is a compassionate conservative,'' Piazza said.
``We want the world to know that his compassion does not extend to
all the citizens of Texas.'' Bush had no comment on the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The church is part of the gay and lesbian Universal Fellowship
of Metropolitan Community Churches, founded in Los Angeles in 1970
by the Rev. Troy Perry, who sought a place for gays excluded from
mainline churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas congregation has grown eight-fold in the last decade,
through an energized worship service that Piazza describes as
``enthusiastically liturgical,'' combining the emotionalism and
fervor of evangelism with the intellectualism of mainstream liberal
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The service opens with lively music from a huge choir and small
orchestra. The pastors wear robes and Piazza speaks from a pink
marble altar shaped as a triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lyle Schaller, one of the world's leading church
consultants, described the Cathedral of Hope as offering ``an
exceptionally high-quality ministry that is very comprehensive and
very relevant. I think they have superb preaching, an
extraordinarily high quality and carefully designed worship, a very
sophisticated counseling ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. George Exoo, the so-called Church Man for his critiques
of Protestant services, gave the Cathedral of Hope his highest
five-star rating in a review for the local magazine ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers who find my admiration shocking should visit the
place,'' Exoo wrote, calling the service ``exceptional for the
incredible emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza ``deftly balances scholarship and contemporary context,''
Exoo said. ``Here the prayer rail of the Assemblies of God and the
communion rail of High Church Christianity meet. . . . Here I found
worship that wrenches tears from dry eyes (my eyes anyway) and
sends the rush of energy up the spine. This spiritual vibration is
one I can never predict, and no amount of planning can force. It's
worship with a capital `W.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The church performs 75 gay and lesbian commitment ceremonies
each year, offers counseling by 22 professional therapists and two
psychiatrists, and plays host to a variety of support groups
including a choir of men with AIDS called Positive Voices.
</P>
<P>
   Marriages are ``a way for us to say our relationships are good
and our relationships are healthy and they can be as blessed as
anybody's,'' said Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Corbin, a church member with AIDS, described why the church
is so important. After being raised near Dallas by a ``very
religious father'' and growing up ``believing that I should never
have been born,'' Corbin said ``I knew I was different. . . . I
didn't know why, I didn't know what to do about it, and many times
I contemplated suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin said something kept telling him ``to hang on, there's
something for you. And when I found this church, I knew immediately
that's what that voice was telling me 25, 30 years ago. That this
was what I was supposed to wait for . . . to live to experience
this wholeness, after feeling so hopeless.''

DUCKS SWEPT ASIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ If the Mighty Ducks were going to be swept, their
coach wanted them to go out fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks made Craig Hartsburg proud as they fought the two-time
Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings to the bitter end in a 3-0
loss before 17,174 at the Pond on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory completed a four game sweep of the Ducks, who were
missing one of their stars completely _ Paul Kariya was out with a
broken foot after blocking a shot in Game 3 _ while one (Teemu
Selanne) was simply missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 37 minutes of non-stop hitting and skating by both
teams the Red Wings scored on their first power play chance of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   With Marty McInnis in the penalty box for slashing, Jason
Marshall's attempt to clear the zone took a bad bounce off the side
boards at the Anaheim blue line. Matt Cullen couldn't control the
puck and Tomas Holmstrom bullied his way to the slot and chipped a
shot past Guy Hebert on the glove side at 16:44.
</P>
<P>
   The noisy crowd got noisier when it appeared the Ducks had tied
the game 33 seconds into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's shot from the right point bounced high in the air
after hitting Detroit goalie Chris Osgood. Moments later the puck
was in the net and the Ducks were celebrating, but it was ruled
that Marty McInnis had tipped the puck in with a stick that was
above the level of the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Ducks' last glimmer of hope. With Anaheim pressing
to tie the game, Brendan Shanahan scored a breakaway goal with 8:09
left in the game. Slightly more than three minutes later Vyacheslav
Koslov put the game on ice.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Kariya and defensemen Ruslan Salei (injured
right shoulder), Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg was forced to
shuffle his lineup. Defenseman Dan Trebil and wingers Johann
Davidsson and Mike Leclerc got their first action of the series and
Tomas Sandstrom replaced Kariya on the No.1 line.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters Leclerc, Davidsson, Antti Aalto and Jeff Nielsen
along with veteran Ted Drury helped set the tone in the opening
minutes with a tenacious forecheck that kept the Red Wings hemmed
in their zone for most of the opening five minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Red Wings 16-14 in the opening period but
failed to convert on their two power play chances. Osgood stopped
Marshall's bid five minutes into the game and barely got a glove on
Kevin Haller's blast from the top of the slot midway through the
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks also had a four-shot flurry late in the period, but
once again Osgood turned them back.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Hebert was sharp as well, getting his left pad
on a shot by Vyacheslav Kozlov with eight minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had some chances early in the second period. Sandstrom
was pulled down by Chris Chelios, but once again Anaheim couldn't
convert on the power play. McInnis made a great move to get wide
open in the right circle while the Ducks had the man advantage,
only to miss the net with his slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holmstrom finally broke through, the Red Wings' Kris
Draper hit the post and Kirk Maltby was denied by Hebert's quick
glove hand directly in front of the net after he intercepted a pass
by Haller.

PADRES HAMMER YOSHII AND BEAT METS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Masato Yoshii needed to come through with a good
start Tuesday night to silence his critics and solidify his shaky
status in the Mets' rotation. But with a chance to reassure his
teammates and Manager Bobby Valentine, Yoshii could not.
</P>
<P>
   He could not control his pitches or the Padre batters who
alternately watched them sail by as balls or knocked them for
timely hits. He walked five, the most walks he has yielded in 33
major league starts. The Mets lost to the Padres, 6-2, their third
straight defeat, and Yoshii's hold on his place in the rotation
became even more tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine said Yoshii would make his next scheduled start.
``This isn't the time to talk about that,'' Valentine said about
shifting Yoshii to the bullpen. But clearly Yoshii is in danger of
being moved aside.
</P>
<P>
   The last two of Yoshii's walks came around to score in the
fifth, a half inning after the Mets had briefly tied the game at
2-2 on Brian McRae's first home run of the year. Yoshii (1-3) had
opened the fifth innocently enough by retiring Reggie Sanders on a
pop-out. But he then walked Tony Gwynn and Wally Joyner on
consecutive 3-1 counts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bobby Bonilla nor John Franco were in the game. So the
crowd of 25,113 at Shea turned its wrath on the good-natured
Yoshii, who had lost his touch again just as the Mets had gotten
back in the game. Out came Bob Apodaca, the Mets pitching coach. To
no avail, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii allowed a single to left to former Met Dave Magadan to
load the bases. And then Greg Myers, who had come on to catch for
the Padres after Jim Leyrtiz had suffered a bone bruise in his left
thumb during a second-inning Yoshii at-bat, rocked a Yoshii
offering over McRae's head in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn and Joyner scored easily. And even though the slow-footed
Magadan was easily nailed at the plate by Rey Ordonez's relay
throw, the Padres were up 4-2 _ and Apodaca was on his way back out
to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   That brought on cheers from the crowd. But as Yoshii walked into
the Mets dugout, all he heard was a nasty chorus of boos. Bonilla
was one of the first to console him. According to Yoshii, Bonilla
said ``There's no way that you're going to get booed more than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Piazza, in just his second game back from the disabled
list (and obviously still trying to regain his timing) heard it
from some of the fans in the bottom of the fifth, when he popped
out on the first pitch he saw from Andy Ashby with runners on first
and third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no question as to whom the fans regarded as the
real villain. But even though Yoshii had come in with a 7.47 ERA
after three starts, Valentine refused to be critical of the
Japanese right-hander.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Remember when the Rockets were chasing San Antonio for the third
seed in the Western Conference, Phoenix was a possible lottery team
and Utah was a lock for the Midwest Division title?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was little more than a week ago. Now, as the clock on the
NBA's microwavable season nears zero, all of the above has changed
and the popcorn is still popping.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs no longer are worried about what is in the rearview
mirror, thanks to a four-game lead over the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix not only has risen to the sixth seed in the West but,
thanks to a swoon by the Los Angeles Lakers, is only two games in
the loss column from catching the Lakers for the fifth seed and a
chance at a first-round matchup with the Rockets. However, LA holds
the tiebreaker over the Suns thanks to a 3-1 edge in the season
series.
</P>
<P>
   And Utah, which has lost four of six, has seen its Midwest
Division lead cut to 1{ games over the Spurs. The Jazz travels to
Texas this weekend to play the Rockets on Friday and San Antonio on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Conclusions made just 10 days ago _ when
the Rockets appeared well on their way to tying San Antonio for the
third seed _ might no longer be valid, and that inevitable
first-round clash with Los Angeles is not so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not mathematically decided yet, so you've always got to
keep your options open,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said Tuesday as
the Rockets took a day off following back-to-back games. ``Our
scouting people are putting all the possible opponents in there.
But it sort of looks like it's going to be LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I looked at the paper this morning, the first thing I
said was, `It could be Phoenix.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking the court April 18 for what proved to be a
demoralizing loss at San Antonio, the Rockets had hopes of claiming
the third seed, which at the time meant opening the postseason
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, those hopes have been dashed after a 2-4
stretch, including losses to two of the league's worst teams _
Dallas and the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nos. 1-5 in the West remain the same, but Phoenix (24-21)
has a 1{-game edge on Sacramento (23-23) in the seventh spot.
Minnesota (22-23), which has dropped four in a row, is tied for the
eighth spot with Seattle (22-23).
</P>
<P>
   At least the Rockets (28-17), who have five games left, can
narrow their choices to the Lakers (27-19) and the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like playing a card game,'' Tomjanovich said. ``You
pick up those cards, and that's the hand you're dealt. Our job is
to make sure we've got all the data so we can do our job as a staff
to prepare the team. We've got guys scouting all those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not matter whom the Rockets face if they play the way
they played Monday in a 22-point win over the Lakers. Conversely,
the opponent will be of little importance if the Rockets perform as
they did Sunday in a 24-point loss at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious thing that is most important to us is defense, but
why we don't do it one day and why it's there the next day is a
mystery,'' Tomjanovich. ``I'm sure if people knew what the reason
for that was, they would have a little jar of stuff that you could
take and bring it every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says the right things, but it's an action, not a
word. You can't talk about it; you have to do it. The thing is, you
can't turn it on and off. That's when you wind up with that boulder
rolling down the mountain and the boulder's too big, you can't hold
it back. We talk about that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That matched the Lakers' sentiments following the sound defeat
to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize you can't keep waiting to turn it on,''
Lakers guard Derek Harper said. ``The longer you wait, the harder
it is and the more you start to realize that it may not be a matter
of turning it on, it may not be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which has lost six of its last eight, will find out
soon with two of its last four games against Portland. Phoenix has
an easier schedule as it takes on Minnesota twice, Sacramento,

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
THE WOODLANDS _ This week, it's the Shell Houston Open.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next week, it will be New Orleans, a town John Daly says he
``used to love for all the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Every week Daly plays on the PGA Tour, it's a visit to another
city that, during the overlapping good and bad times of years past,
presented him with two terrific opportunities: To win a golf
tournament and to attend the most extreme parties he could find.
</P>
<P>
   When Daly returns to places with so many memories, like this
week at the Tournament Players Course at The Woodlands, he faces
the same challenges on the golf course. But what he contends with
during the rest of his life is so much different.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding the nearest open tab, Daly finds the nearest
open slot on the practice range or retreats to his home away from
home to play a little guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it's going to be pretty much forever,'' Daly said
Tuesday before a practice round at the TPC. ``Everybody says it
gets easier after a while, but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly celebrates his 33rd birthday today. It's another milepost
on the long and often-bumpy road to sobriety. The drinking binges
that landed him in rehab programs and at the rock bottom of his
profession have been chronicled time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Daly is trying to forge a different life to go along with
his different lifestyle. He does things that in the bad old days
used to take a back seat to cocktail hour.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy. Daly never is given the opportunity to forget
where he has been and the difficulty in putting his past behind
him. He gets it from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear things _ and a lot of them are not very good
things,'' Daly said. ``Especially from people in the gallery.
They'll say things. But I always ask people what their favorite
food is. If they say steak, I tell them to picture not being able
to eat another steak for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Daly is up against with alcohol. To borrow a line
from a John Hiatt tune, he couldn't stand up after one, until 20
had him down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the first one doesn't get him.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said part of the best therapy for him is talking about his
personal life. That's something he has been cautioned against by
some. But he thinks it is a necessary part of his rehabilitation
from alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to some of the (Alcoholic Anonymous) meetings, and they
always tell me to stop talking to the media about it,'' he said.
``But I don't mind talking about it. Maybe by me talking, it will
help somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know it helps me to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Daly cope these days? What has replaced liquor as
the passion in his life?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found more hobbies,'' he said. ``I practice golf a lot
more than I used to. And I've gotten into playing the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the major thing is I've really gotten involved in my
charity tournament. We do a Make-a-Wish tournament in Memphis. I
spend a lot of time working on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I just try to find as many things as possible to
occupy my time.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that keeps Daly going is he knows a lot of
people are pulling for him. Fans and a lot of members of the media
would like to see Daly put his life and his golf game back
together. He still has problems with both. He constantly battles
his weight and a smoking habit, which is far less impairing but
could be just as damaging in the long run as his past drinking
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He worries just as much about his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fat boys like me, it's always a struggle,'' he said. ``My
weight's up right now, as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But better his weight be a problem than any distilled products.
And Daly has been lucky to have a strong group of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate to have a lot of good people around
me,'' Daly said. ``I've had great support. Even when I'm playing
bad or I feel bad vibes around, people have been great to me and
helped me. And whether I play good or bad, I feel like when I walk
off the golf course I can feel good about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his game, Daly still hits the ball as long as anybody
else. The only question is whether he can find it all the time
after he hits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been kind of the same as the last three years,''
Daly said of his golf game. ``The only thing I've done different is
I've scheduled myself a little better this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually by now, I'm burned out because I've played 12
tournaments or so. But I've tried to schedule a little more time
off this year. I played nine tournaments through the Masters, then
I took the last two weeks off, and I think it's helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's season has been up and down. His best finish was a tie
for 14th at the Phoenix Open. He also tied for 20th at Tucson and
tied for 21st at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. He ranks 103rd on
the money list with just over $146,000.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been no major charges up the leader board. Daly
has missed the cut twice and withdrew from The Players Championship
because of back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been close,'' he said. ``I've had plenty of opportunities
to get into the top 10. It just hasn't happened yet. One day, I'll
have trouble putting; other days, it's something else. I just
haven't been able to put four good rounds together yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes this might be the week he breaks through. Last year,
Daly's best finishes were fourth place at Los Angeles and Honda,
both early-season events.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said the SHO is, for him, one of the tournaments in which
he would love to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majors are what we always strive for,'' Daly said. ``I
really believe there are five of them now because The Players
Championship has gotten so big.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every tournament out here, if you have a chance to win,
it's special. I've always loved coming to Houston. I haven't been
back here in a couple of years, but it's one of the places I've
always enjoyed playing on tour. This one is one of those
tournaments that sticks out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the times Daly has spent here. But also
because he's looking forward to forging new memories.

 CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE FORCES VOTE ON BALKANS  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ A House committee rejected two resolutions Tuesday
by California Republican Tom Campbell that would have called for
the United States to either declare war on Yugoslavia or withdraw
all its forces within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the House International Relations Committee rejected
both resolutions, Campbell will use the mandates of the Vietnam-era
War Powers Act to force a vote on the two measures Wednesday before
the full House, where they are expected to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell himself opposes declaring war on Yugoslavia _ he voted
against his own resolution _ and supports the removal of all U.S.
troops from the Balkan conflict. But he said his foremost concern
is the Constitution, and he was successful in his primary goal of
forcing a reluctant Congress to debate U.S. involvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculing as ``sophistry'' the Clinton administration's
insistence that the military engagement in Kosovo is an ``armed
conflict'' but not a war, Campbell said, ``We are at war, and
that's the truth and we ought to admit it and proceed or pull back
our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The war declaration failed by a 49-to-0 vote, while the panel
rejected the troop withdrawal 30 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties were crafting alternatives to Campbell's
resolutions Tuesday. The GOP plan would require congressional
approval for the use of ground troops, while the Democratic
proposal would authorize the use of force short of a formal
declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   The committee debate Tuesday exposed deep fissures within both
parties on the wisdom and strategy of the NATO air campaign against
Yugoslavia. Yet despite grave doubts on both sides, Congress is
loath to do anything that could be seen as undercutting the U.S.
military or the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., said he was ``sorely tempted''
to vote for the war declaration, and he called on the Clinton
administration to immediately request congressional authorization
for the use of military force in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said the administration and its NATO allies are ``at risk
of repeating in the Balkans the very mistakes we made in Vietnam''
by waging a limited air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said the administration is attempting an ``in-between
approach'' that says ``we have enough of a national interest to
become involved in an armed conflict with (Yugoslav President
Slobodan) Milosevic but not enough of a national interest to do
what is required to prevail in that conflict. This is a
prescription for defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, along with many Democrats, argued that a
declaration of war goes too far and would weaken the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely important not to Americanize this
engagement,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., a former Hungarian
refugee who supports the NATO action. ``Not one ally has declared
war on Yugoslavia,'' Lantos said.
</P>
<P>
   Lantos drew a sharp distinction between the conflict in Kosovo
and World War II, where the United States sought the unconditional
surrender of Germany and Japan. ``We are engaged militarily with
much more limited objectives,'' said Lantos, adding that NATO is at
war with Milosevic and his army, not with the people of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Lantos also argued that President George Bush, who reluctantly
sought and won the approval of Congress to use force in the Persian
Gulf, did not seek or get a declaration of war when he committed a
half-million troops.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republican Jim Leach agreed with Lantos' assessment. A war
declaration would imply ``a much more uncompromising stance to seek
victory at all cost,'' Leach said, and would not only ``Americanize
the conflict further,'' but would signal that the United States
``would stop at nothing less than the conquest of Yugoslavia.''
Such aims, he said, ``are against the interests of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Chabot, R-Ill., said he would support Campbell's war
declaration because he is concerned that NATO is in danger of
becoming ``a police force in Europe,'' and that the United States
rather than Western European is footing most of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If both of Campbell's measures fail in the House, as expected,
he said he will file suit in federal court arguing that the Clinton
administration is violating the Constitution by engaging in war
without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he would be happy to support an alternative like
the Senate resolution passed weeks ago, authorizing U.S. military
engagement in Yugoslavia, or the bipartisan Senate resolution by
Arizona Republican John McCain, to use ``whatever means necessary''
to pursue the war. But the administration refused to offer such a
measure, he said, and he preferred the more constitutionally
clear-cut declaration of war or withdrawal of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1973 War Powers Act, the Senate will be required to
vote on both Campbell resolutions by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman warned of a ``constitutional crisis'' on May 25 __ 60
days after President Clinton notified the country that bombing of
Yugoslavia had begun. ``On that day,'' Gilman said, ``the Clinton
administration will become the first administration since the War
Powers Resolution was enacted in 1973 to be in plain, undeniable
violation of that law, unless Congress has declared war or enacted
statutory authorization for military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted over President Richard Nixon's veto,
prompted by his decision to bomb Cambodia during the Vietnam war.
Its authors sought to ensure that no future president would ever be
able to commit the United States to war without congressional
approval and, by extension, public support.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the act has proved toothless, as presidents
of both parties have ignored it during military actions in Grenada,
Panama, Iraq and Somalia, relying instead on their constitutional
authority as commanders in chief.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was in America's heartland, the birthplace of pro football, in a
mammoth old stadium with the wind swirling, the crowd barking and
defeat lurking in the darkness, that John Elway fulfilled his great
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos became AFC champions that day, though not
winners of the Super Bowl for another 11 years. The inhabitants of
the Dawg Pound in the city of Cleveland were left to gnaw once more
on the bones of remorse. And the golden boy became a man.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a quarterback is not his passing percentage or the
style of his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football is constructed not on beauty but on toughness of
will and intensity so strong that dreams become reality when they
could as easily have become nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a quarterback is what he can do when the situation
is hopeless, his hands are freezing and his uniform is soaked with
grime and sweat and blood.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of a quarterback is to win. Now and forever, John Elway
is truly a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Not just because he finally took his Broncos to the NFL's
equivalent of the peaks of the Rocky Mountains with back-to-back
Super Bowl titles over the past two seasons. But for the way he
brought them back again and again in times when nobody but Elway
ever thought it was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he became a two-time Super Bowl champ, Elway
inspired the kind of legends that Ben Hogan did in golf and Satchel
Paige did in baseball, or the myths that followed Lincoln into
history.
</P>
<P>
   They would tell you of his high school days at Granada Hills in
Los Angeles, when he would stand on the 50-yard line and a teammate
in the end zone would throw a ball up in the air and Elway would
hit it dead center, like shooting a duck from midfield. They told
him to hit his receiver in the numbers once, and he asked, ``Which
one?''
</P>
<P>
   He could write his name with a football, make it sing Dixie or
open a bottle with one at 20 paces. He completed more passes than
the Fifth Fleet on leave. And did it all without a hint of scandal
or controversy or being disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were a defensive end. ``He stands there and laughs at
you,'' the late Lyle Alzado once said. ``It's like a Tom and Jerry
cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a Superman comic book, where he always came to save the day.
Elway led the Broncos to fourth-quarter comebacks 47 times in his
career. But none more dramatic and more significant than that
twilight drive into history and into our consciousness, taking them
98 yards in 15 plays in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I sat in the frigid, drafty press box that day at legendary
Cleveland Stadium, where Groza kicked, where Feller pitched, where
smash-mouth football was played without any concessions to modern
technology, and marveled at the sight of a cocky prodigy blossoming
into a mature, knowing genius. I can summon up the image in my
mind's eye as easily as the memory of the cold northern Ohio gale.
</P>
<P>
   With his speed and strength, he transformed potential losses
into gains. He won the AFC title, and he put the Broncos on the
track that would eventually, more than a decade later, take them
all the way to the top. Twice in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I thought about before that game was that great
quarterbacks come through in great situations,'' Elway said. ``They
make the big plays in the big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this age of instant gratification and wretched excess,
there are those who would tug at the sleeve of Elway's No. 7 jersey
in the hope that he would attempt to do it one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Are we never satisfied? Are we so concerned that if the golden
boy with the million-dollar smile retires, then we must be getting
old as well? Or is it just the case of losing too much too soon,
what with 1999 already taking Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky from
our live TV screens and relegating them to the videotape archives?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the first true indication that the Y2K bug is for real?
</P>
<P>
   The sports heroes of a generation are disappearing like
fireflies at the sign of the first frost, and the face looking back
at us in the mirror suddenly has tiny wrinkles around the eyes.
Who's next to go _ Kobe Bryant, J.D. Drew and Ricky Williams?
</P>
<P>
   It is always easier to leave one year too late than one year too
soon, and in that regard, too, this decision fits Elway. He rarely
did things the easy way.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, he lost three Super Bowls before grabbing those last
two. He loved for it to be late and tight and tense.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe he could have done it all again. But why?
</P>
<P>
   John Elway proved he was a winner a long time ago, before the
rings, before the glory, in the late gloom of another Cleveland
winter, and leaves us with chills that didn't all come from the
wind off Lake Erie.

DOZING ANGELS HAVE NIGHTMARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels' performance against the Toronto Blue Jays
on Tuesday night should have been rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Revolting.
</P>
<P>
   Regretful.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Angels, their 10-1 loss before 17,899 at Edison
Field counted for only one loss in the standings. Time will tell if
there is any residual effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made only two physical errors. But the mental errors,
those that are not counted on the scoreboard, were numerous. And
once they got behind early, the offense seemed to disappear. If not
for a home run by Andy Sheets in the eighth, the Angels would have
been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk, there's no other way to put it,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``(Tonight) we will come back and play better,
because if we don't we will find somebody that will. You don't make
those kinds of mistakes and win ballgames. You don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pick up the intensity a little bit, and it'll be
picked up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels right fielder Tim Salmon just shook his head when asked
about the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No intensity, just nothing,'' Salmon said. ``We couldn't field
it, couldn't hit it, couldn't pitch it. Every aspect of our game
wasn't there tonight. It was pretty embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to come out with intensity. They're a good team. We
got down by four runs (in the first inning), but I don't care.
We've got to keep going out and playing our game. We've been beaten
up, but we haven't given up. But today we fell apart. I hope this
was the first and last time that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started with Angels starting pitcher Omar Olivares, whose
mind seemed to drift in the first inning. With two out and Shawn
Green on first base, Olivares failed to pay much attention to
Green, who stole second base easily.
</P>
<P>
   After walking Carlos Delgado, Olivares drifted off again. Green
and Delgado got such good jumps on an Olivares pitch that catcher
Matt Walbeck didn't even bother to make a throw, as Green and
Delgado stole third and second, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fernandez followed with a two-run single, then caught
Olivares napping again. As Olivares stared in at the catcher,
Fernandez took off for second. Olivares turned and threw to second,
but neither shortstop Sheets nor second baseman Randy Velarde was
at the bag, and the ball sailed into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez took third and Olivares was charged with the error. In
all, the Blue Jays had four runs, four hits and four stolen bases
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened, I need an exorcist to find out,''
Olivares explained. ``I did feel weird.''
</P>
<P>
   And it only got worse for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares (2-2) was gone by the time the Angels played like
clowns again in the fifth inning. After a double, Green stole third
on pitcher Mike Magnante. It was Green's third steal of the game,
despite just one steal all season going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado followed with a grounder to first baseman Darin Erstad,
who caught Green too far off the bag at third and began a rundown.
Third baseman Troy Glaus got the ball and ran Green toward the
plate. Problem was, he never caught up and never threw the ball,
allowing Green to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do that play all season long and it'll never happen
like that again,'' Magnante said. ``It's over. Forget it. Let's
face it, we embarrassed ourselves. Every single person on this team
knows what we played like and what has to be done to do our job.
It's one thing to get beat, another thing to get beat like that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for many of the fans, who booed, including one
fan who went down to the dugout and berated the Angels players as
they came off the field at the end of the sixth inning. The fan was
cheered as he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Pat Hentgen (1-1) threw seven scoreless
innings, allowing only three hits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ What is it about playing the Red Sox that brings
out the best in the Minnesota Twins?
</P>
<P>
   If you have an answer, mail it to Boston manager Jimy Williams,
who watched in horror as his team surrendered a 4-0 lead Tueday
night and wound up losing to Minnesota again, 6-5, before 10,681
Twins fans who are beginning to appreciate a team that never seems
to give up.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins have won two straight from Boston after losing four in
a row to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played good,'' said Williams, who sees no pressure after
starting the season 10-10. ``We just got beat. We got 142 to go,
including one (today). Let's come out and play our best. Get some
hits and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Sox made the plays and put up five runs on 11
hits. Righthander Mark Portugal pitched three strong innings to
start off, but then things got out of synch. And the Sox generally
will lose when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming here for a long time and Tom Kelly has always
had a team that never gives up,'' said Mike Stanley. ``He's got to
be some kind of motivator because I've never seen these guys lay
down. They're always trying to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a lot of things. Little things that produce one run at
a time. A lot of running. Bunting a guy over. Doug Mientkiewicz is
a pretty good hitter. They had him bunting in the eighth inning
when they took the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal didn't lose the game by himself, but a four-run cushion
wasn't enough. The lead had been built in one inning, the second,
on Damon Buford's two-run triple and Darren Lewis's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal gave up single runs in the fourth and fifth innings and
the Boston bats went cold.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, still holding a 4-2 lead, Portugal gave up a
leadoff home run to Marty Cordova. In came lefty Rheal Cormier, and
two hits and a ground out later, the game was tied at 4-4. The
Twins just didn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, reliever Jim Corsi set the stage for
disaster by giving up a leadoff single to Ron Coomer, who was
sacrificed to second. Walks to Terry Steinbach (intentionally) and
Chad Allen loaded the bases. Corsi then got the second out of the
inning as pinch hitter Brent Gates grounded into a forceout back to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie replaced Corsi and needed an out to preserve the
tie, but he gave up a two-run single instead to Todd Walker, and
the Red Sox were toast.
</P>
<P>
   A pinch-hit home run by Reggie Jefferson in the ninth wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Losing is never any fun, but this loss left a particularly
bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't blame anyone,'' said Stanley. ``(Boston pitchers)
have been pretty darn good up until this point. I can't remember
that many leads that we've had after six innings that we lost. We
haven't played consistent baseball on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came off a huge series (against Cleveland), winning
two of three from probably the best team around at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to lose two to these guys. Not to slight
them, but we'd like to have kept the momentum going. Now we're
playing for our lives and hoping not to get swept.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pitchers must take some blame. Three good innings is not
good enough for a starter. And don't underrate the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what team or what hitter you face,'' said
Portugal. ``If you pitch up in the strike zone you're going to get
hit. I got some balls up in the zone and they hit them hard.
Hopefully I won't be doing that next time out.''

PISTONS BEAT CELTICS

 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their locker-room door remained closed much longer than usual.
There was a good reason. The Celtics had several issues to discuss
Tuesday night. If you happen to see a Celtic in the next couple
days, try to avoid using the word ``turnover''; it's a sensitive
subject.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Rick Pitino didn't ask one of his players to
hand him a stat sheet following the team's 92-85 loss to the
Detroit Pistons. That player probably would have turned the paper
over, too, just as the team turned the ball over 25 times at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The ball wasn't the only thing that was unstable in Celtic
hands. Any lead was kind of slippery as well. Most of the 16,408
fans in the building thought the game was won in the third quarter.
The Celtics led by 16 with 1:07 remaining. They didn't score in the
next 6 minutes 10 seconds. You will not be surprised to learn that
the 16-point lead had been cut to 1, 73-72, before the Celtics
would score again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't turned the ball over so many times, we would have
blown them out,'' said Paul Pierce, who led the Celtics with 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   Well, put it this way: A group of people can watch a movie and
see many different things; so can a group of people watching a
basketball game. Turnovers were a problem. But if you took all of
them away, you still would have had a Pistons team with Grant Hill
and Jerome Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why we turned it over, I think, was Jerome Williams,'' Pitino
said. ``He just pressured the ball and we got careless with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Celtic coach and director of operations M.L. Carr tried
to trade for Williams several times. That's because Williams hunts
for the ball every second he is on the court. He finished with an
incredible 11 offensive rebounds (14 overall), 21 points, and 7
steals. Every time the Pistons missed, there was Williams around
the ball. It drove Pitino nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the game away from ourselves,'' Pierce said. ``Too
many turnovers and we let Jerome Williams have too many rebounds. I
mean, Jerome Williams is a good player, but he had a career game
against us and you can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Celtic who started had at least two turnovers. Ron Mercer
had five of them; Walter McCarty finished with six. McCarty's
turnovers shadowed his 17 points and 11 rebounds. The forward was
talking to someone after the game when he was told that Pitino
wanted to see him in his office. The two men could have talked
about Williams. Or Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we tried to do after we went to Grant was
that we tried to go back to Grant,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry
said. ``And then we went back to Grant, they made the adjustment,
and we went to Grant again. And after we went to Grant and they
made another adjustment, we tried to go back to Grant again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill finished with 32 points, 19 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the smartest coach in the world,'' Gentry said, ``but
I just figured out I can throw it to 33 and he can get something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   After two Hill jump shots and a Lindsey Hunter layup, the score
was tied at 80 with 3:30 remaining. The Celtics knew they were in
trouble then. Not just because they had no one who could stop Hill.
And not because they acted as if the ball was dipped in mud. They
were in trouble because they couldn't score. They shot a chilling
14 percent in the fourth quarter. Their judgment wasn't the best,
either: they attempted a season-high 28 3-pointers and made 10 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, trying to maintain their playoff position, were
fine after that. They scored the next 7 points _ two Hill postups
and a wide-open Jud Buechler three _ to win the game. It was 87-80
with 90 seconds left and fans started to leave. Many were angry.
Some cursed the free throw shooting of Vitaly Potapenko, who missed
five of his six attempts. Others screamed at Pitino, begging him to
send double-teams toward Hill earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It baffles me we came up with the win,'' Hill said. ``It
looked like they were the team in the seventh spot and we were out
of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the fourth quarter. That's the 12-minute stretch in which
the Celtics reminded you why they will be in Secaucus, N.J., next
month. They left town Tuesday night for Miami, to prepare for a
game against the Heat. You can be sure it wasn't a pleasant flight.

TIGERS UNLOAD ON HINCLIFFE, MARINERS DON'T HIT BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This time, Brett Hinchliffe forgot to duck.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the mound for the first time since trading punches
with Anaheim's Todd Greene in a Sunday ESPN-TV game, the Mariners
pitcher took on the Detroit Tigers Tuesday night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe got bruised good, serving up home runs to Brad
Ausmus, Karim Garcia and Damion Easley in a 5-1 loss. The rookie
suffered through four innings of blows to his earned run average.
Even worse, no one stepped up to defend him, with Seattle's big
bats falling silent again.
</P>
<P>
   At least only 19,617 were ringside to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner defeat was the second in two nights in what quickly
has become an uncomfortable homestand and dropped the club to 8-12
overall _ one off last year's pace, when an underachieving Seattle
team finished nine games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have been a handy excuse so far this season, but one
now starting to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a big factor as to why we're not
functioning as we should,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella said.
``Every team has injuries and needs to play through them. That's
why you have a 25-man roster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners shuffled theirs after Tuesday's stumble, announcing
they will activate veteran reliever Mark Leiter from the disabled
list and had purchased shortstop/second baseman Rafael Bournigal
from Class AAA Oklahoma City, the Texas Rangers' top farm team. To
make room, reliever Melvin Bunch and shortstop Giomar Guevara were
sent to AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Bournigal, who spent last season with the Oakland A's and hit
.225 in 209 at-bats, is considered a better glove man than Domingo
Cedeno, a free agent signee now filling in for the injured Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bournigal?'' said a surprised Cedeno as he dressed in the
subdued Mariners clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe, back in action after being ejected, fined and
suspended three games for his part in the melee in Anaheim, was in
trouble from the outset against the Tigers. Gregg Jeffries lined
the youngster's fifth pitch of the game to left-center for a
single. Fortunately for the Hinchliffe, Jeffries got greedy, tried
for a double and was thrown out by Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie's seventh pitch was rocketed down the third-base line
by Easley for the two-base hit that Jeffries coveted. Tony Clark
walked with two outs. Hinchliffe, however, escaped without damage,
getting Dean Palmer on a fly ball. But that would be the only time.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Ausmus homered to left with two outs in the second.
Garcia socked a three-run homer to right in the third, also with
two gone. Easley finished the long-ball assault with a solo homer
in the fourth, again with two outs. All fastballs. All rookie
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up with the ball,'' Piniella said of Hinchliffe. ``He's
got to stay down. He doesn't pitch hard enough to stay at the
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe (0-1) said the layoff didn't bother him. He simply
got careless when he supposedly had the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All their runs came with two outs,'' the Detroit native said.
``Sometimes you get too relaxed in that situation _ you shouldn't _
and you lose concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Detroit lefty Jason Thompson (3-2) never wavered from
the task at hand. Following Brian Moehler's lead from the night
before, Thompson was in command throughout his six-inning stint,
permitting only Butch Huskey's RBI single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiger starter was so good, he struck out the side in the
first inning after putting two runners on. He got three infield
popups in the third. He escaped a two-out, base-loaded jam in the
fifth, retiring Jay Buhner on one pitch, a fly ball to left. He had
seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrown three aces in a row for us,'' Detroit manager
Larry Parrish said. ``He's got great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Thompson, Mariner hitters were called out on strikes
four times with runners in scoring position, not exactly an
aggressive approach. The manager has noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling with men on base,'' Piniella said.``It's been
our problem. ``We haven't gotten the big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to look back nine days, to Hinchliffe and
Anaheim. At least on that day, the Mariners were throwing punches,
not just standing there and taking them.

DUCKS SWEPT ASIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ If the Mighty Ducks were going to be swept, their
coach wanted them to go out fighting. That was the least Craig
Hartsburg expected from his team in Game 4 of the opening-round
playoff series with the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit did dispose of the Ducks in four games thanks to
Tuesday's 3-0 victory before 17,174 at the Pond, but Hartsburg was
as pleased as a losing coach could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never be happy when your season ends,'' he said. ``But
we played hard and battled and we lost to the team that probably is
going to win the Stanley Cup. They are the best team I've seen
since I started coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were missing two of their stars _ Paul Kariya was out
with a broken foot and Teemu Selanne was simply missing in action,
recording just one shot on goal. The Ducks battled for nearly 37
minutes, but it wasn't enough to satisfy Anaheim center Steve
Rucchin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work is one thing, but I don't take any satisfaction out
of it at all,'' he said. ``This series is hard for me to swallow.
I'm not going to say we could have beaten them, but we could have
made it closer.''
</P>
<P>
   What especially disappointed Rucchin was the fact that the Red
Wings scored on their first power play of the night after the Ducks
had squandered three of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close game, but they obviously know what it takes to
win. We have to learn that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings broke the scoreless tie with Marty McInnis in the
penalty box for slashing. Jason Marshall's attempt to clear the
zone took a bad bounce off the side boards at the Anaheim blue
line. Matt Cullen couldn't control the puck and Tomas Holmstrom
bullied his way into the slot and chipped a shot past Guy Hebert on
the glove side at 16:44.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment, it appeared that the Ducks had tied the game
33 seconds into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's shot from the right point bounced high in the air
after hitting Detroit goalie Chris Osgood. Moments later, the puck
was in the net and the Ducks were celebrating, but it was ruled
that McInnis tipped the puck in with a stick that was above the
level of the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Ducks' last glimmer of hope. With Anaheim pressing
to tie the game, Brendan Shanahan scored a breakaway goal with 8:09
left, and just three minutes later Vyacheslav Koslov put the game
on ice.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Kariya and defensemen Ruslan Salei (injured
right shoulder), Hartsburg was forced to shuffle his lineup.
Defenseman Dan Trebil and wingers Johann Davidsson and Mike Leclerc
got their first action of the series and Tomas Sandstrom replaced
Kariya on the No.1 line.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters Leclerc, Davidsson, Antti Aalto and Jeff Nielsen
along with veteran Ted Drury helped set the tone in the opening
minutes with a tenacious forecheck that kept the Red Wings hemmed
in their zone for most of the opening five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Red Wings 16-14 in the first but failed to
convert on their two power-play chances. Osgood stopped Marshall's
bid five minutes into the game and barely got a glove on Kevin
Haller's blast from the top of the slot midway through the period.

   Still, attaching one's wagon to Payton's star is not for the
light of weight or the fragile of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence was plentiful in the past couple of Sonic contests.
Since they were both against the venerable Utah Jazz, the measuring
stick had some merit.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Salt Lake City, Payton walked straight off the edge of
the Earth _ the place on the map marked ``Thar Be Dragons.'' He was
2-for-11, finished with five points and the Sonics were hatcheted
by the Jazz 98-81 on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night at KeyArena, Payton returned from the abyss,
became the center of the universe again, potted 30 points, and the
Sonics beat the Jazz wire-to-wire, 90-85.
</P>
<P>
   There was no particular explanation for the discrepancy between
games. Oh, Sonics coach Paul Westphal tried. After Sunday's game,
he said Payton might have been ill. By Monday, when asked by a
reporter how Payton was feeling, Westphal had blanked on his little
fib.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game yesterday, Westphal was back on more familiar
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have it,'' he said. ``That happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Westphal, the mysterious vaporization doesn't
happen often. When it does, Payton tends to respond as he did
Tuesday, redeeming himself with various growls, sneers, scoops and
whoops.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was upset, at least as far as playoff rankings _ No.
9 beat No. 1. Moreover, it added up to a split of the four-game
season series with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the 2-1 series advantage the Sonics hold over the
Lakers as well as the Trail Blazers, whom they meet in Portland
Wednesday night, and the thoughts of Karl Malone sounded less like
the
</P>
<P>
   &UR; rr &LR; usual false flattery from the vanquished locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe there's four or five teams in the league that
are much better than their records,'' said Malone, who went for 29
points and 13 rebounds. ``The Sonics are one of them. You look at
them and say, `How'd they get that (22-23) record?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night certainly was one of those looks _ for the first
16 minutes. The Sonics were up 35-11 and on their way to the
series' fourth rout in four games, further testimony to the
deleterious effects of a compressed schedule that would not be
permitted upon the sled dogs of the Iditarod.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the Jazz galumphed back into the contest. They did
the two things they always do when the night becomes what amounts
to a Payton bungee jump _ they tried to get under his skin and in
his face.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' monumental lead began to come apart late in the
second quarter when the Jazz banged Payton in the head and eye,
provoking the usual smoldering retaliatory recklessness. Payton
picked up his NBA-leading 20th technical foul, plus a flagrant foul
against his chief tormentor, John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   As the lead dissipated under a 24-8 run, Westphal benched Payton
for the half's final minute, and received an earful similar to what
Payton was dishing to the Jazz and the officials. He was
approaching a personal record for words per minute, which might
have been the evening's most notable historic moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him don't let Stockton get under your skin,'' Westphal
said. ``It's the only thing he can do. He can't guard you.''
</P>
<P>
   A calmer Payton came out in the third quarter and lit up the
Jazz for 11 points. But this time the Jazz were throwing
double-teams at him 25 feet from the hoop. It didn't stop Payton as
much as it slowed the rest of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually their third game in three nights prevailed upon
the Jazz and they sputtered down the stretch while Payton got his
groove back.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Payton was cavalierly dismissive of his Sunday
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't you used to me having a bad game?'' he asked of his
questioners. ``I did all the other things. When I focus on scoring
25 points a game, I shouldn't be on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the season edges nearer the brink, every Payton slip
or spectacle gets magnified. The burdens and resentments he has
carried because of the first poor season in his Sonic tenure have
bubbled tensely. A national magazine recently reported that Payton
was plotting a ``Paul or me'' ultimatum after the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of thing that leads to speculation that perhaps
Payton took a game off Sunday just to underscore his value,
particularly in contrast with Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal wasn't buying any hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's sending a message, you have to know what the message
is,'' said Westphal, claiming ignorance. ``Sometimes, guys just
have bad games.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's no fun for conspiracy theorists.
</P>
<P>
   But as entertainment, the Payton Thrill Ride, while hardly
championship caliber, just might be able to extend its stay one
week longer into May.

SONICS HOLD OFF JAZZ TO STRENGTHEN PLAYOFF POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Their start was super. Conversely, their finish was
even more surreal.
</P>
<P>
   But style points count for nothing as far as the Sonics are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   So what if they blew a 24-point lead in the first half. Never
mind that the Utah Jazz had a chance to force overtime in the
closing moments Tuesday night at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   All that matters is the Sonics eventually drowned the Jazz 90-85
in the first of what amounts to be a six-game season for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly for the Sonics, they drew even with idle
Minnesota for the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference
playoff standings. They are also a half-game behind seventh-seeded
Sacramento, which beat San Antonio Tuesday at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen,'' said Sonics guard Gary Payton, who
scored a game-high 30 points and dished out eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just have to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, the Sonics must forget about having avoided one
of their biggest losses this season with a huge win. The Sonics
left immediately after Tuesday night's game for Portland, where
they play the Pacific Division champion Trail Blazers Wednesday in
the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to come back (today) and win another one, or
(beating Utah) means nothing,'' said forward Detlef Schrempf, who
scored four of his 18 points from the free-throw line to hold off
Utah during the final 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're to the point where every game is do or die,'' Schrempf
added.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night turned out to be a microcosm of the Sonics'
season.
</P>
<P>
   Their 37-13 lead in the second quarter was a high note. The
bottom fell out in the fourth. Then, the Sonics somehow managed to
land on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle clung to an 86-83 lead with 21 seconds remaining. Utah
fouled Dale Ellis, who could have sealed the victory. But Ellis
missed both free throws and Karl Malone rebounded the second miss
with 19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell then sank a pair of free throws that made the
score 86-85. Schrempf, though, followed that with two free throws
that put the Sonics in front, 88-85.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics escaped moments later when Schrempf rebounded John
Stockton's game-tying 3-point attempt, then made two more free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all playoff games now,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said. ``We have confidence we can beat these good teams. We've been
doing it regularly enough this year, and this team still has
something left in it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a much different showing by the Sonics, who were blown
out 98-81 last Sunday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Payton rebounded the best. He made 10 of 20 shots after a
2-for-11, five-point outing at Utah. Payton negated Malone's 29
points for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fighting for their playoff lives,'' Malone said.
``They came out real aggressive tonight and you have to give them
credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite wilting during Utah's comeback attempt, the Sonics set
the tone early. They matched Utah's rough and physical play from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   They rode an aggressive start by Payton to an 18-8 lead midway
through the opening quarter. The Sonics ended the period with a
10-2 run that put them ahead 29-10.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fewest points scored in a quarter by a Sonic opponent
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out pumped,'' center Olden Polynice said. ``We were
very physical and our defensive matchups were a little different.
It threw them off a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' rigid defense and higher energy level kept Utah from
doing much of anything right in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, tempers flared late in the second quarter when Malone,
Payton and Stockton got ornery.
</P>
<P>
   It all boiled over when Payton receive his league-leading 20th
technical foul with 2:47 left in the half after giving referee
James Capers an earful.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   Payton then walked toward Malone and challenged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to split my face open,'' yelled Payton, who
was referring to an incident that involved Malone on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Joe Kleine needed 30 stitches and plastic surgery
after Malone's elbow resulted in a broken nose and split lip during
Utah's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Of Stockton, Payton said: ``I'm not going to back down from him.
If he hits me I'm going to hit him back. I don't care what the
officials say.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who had 14 points at the time, was called for an
offensive foul on the Sonics' next possession. Payton then picked
up a flagrant foul after he intentionally shoved Stockton to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The extracurricular activity changed the tone of the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Westphal sent Payton to the bench to cool off, Utah went on
a run. Malone scored on three straight possessions in the final
1:38 of the period. The Jazz cut the Sonics' lead to 45-35 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 67-54 after the third. They actually held an
84-74 advantage with 1:56 left in the fourth before holding on for
the win.

 DOCTOR, 2 DRUGGISTS ACCUSED IN 9 DEATHS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  REDDING, Calif. _ Prosecutors are accusing a Shasta County
physician and two pharmacy owners of causing at least nine deaths
in what they call a drug-selling scheme designed to defraud the
state Medi-Cal insurance system.
<P>
   Dr. Frank B. Fisher and his two co-defendants, Redding pharmacy
owners Stephen and Madeline Miller, have been charged with murder
in connection with three of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   More charges have not been ruled out, however, in the most
dramatic confrontation in recent memory between law enforcement and
a physician involving the use of narcotics for control of chronic
pain.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors linked the defendants to the six additional
fatalities Tuesday as a preliminary hearing into the criminal
charges began in Shasta County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's walk-in clinic in the town of Anderson and the Miller
pharmacy in Redding have been shut down since their arrests in
February. All three defendants are being held in County Jail in
Redding.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary hearing is expected to continue for at least
three weeks. During opening statements Tuesday, Deputy Attorney
General Gary Binkerd likened the defendants to common ``street
pushers'' whose sole interest was to pump out ``staggering
quantities'' of pain drugs most patients didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the three alleged murders, evidence will show ``no less
than six additional deaths are attributable to this scheme,''
Binkerd said. He added that records indicate Fisher became the
largest prescriber in the state of one opiate drug, a slow-release
form of morphine called OxyContin, and that his drug orders
accounted for 46 percent of all the OxyContin prescribed in
California.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fisher's defense team believes that it has some strong
arguments, particularly in connection with the murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic reports and other court documents raise questions about
just what caused many of the deaths deemed suspicious. One victim
may have died after a vehicle accident, for example, and another is
said to have succumbed to natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say there is no set upper limit on dosages of
opiate painkillers, whose most dangerous side effects tend to
diminish as patients grow tolerant of the medications.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hallinan, a prominent San Francisco attorney who is
representing Fisher, called the murder allegations ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the nine alleged victims, Hallinan said, were not even
Fisher's patients but instead were getting drugs from acquaintances
or from street sources when they died.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan's involvement in the case has already raised its
profile beyond the Redding area.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up in court Tuesday along with a nationally known pain
specialist, Virginia physician William Hurwitz, who is serving as a
technical adviser for the defense. Hurwitz sat in the front row of
a small courtroom packed with Fisher's former patients and
supporters, some of whom have begun circulating a newsletter and
selling T-shirts to support his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Legal and medical experts have been unable to find any prior
instance in which a doctor has faced multiple murder charges under
similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz, for example, temporarily lost his right to practice
medicine in 1996 after being accused of over-prescribing pain
medications. He won reinstatement in 1997 amid a spate of national
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts fear the Fisher case may make it more difficult for
chronic pain sufferers to find doctors willing to treat them,
considering the stigma attached to narcotics use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any such kind of criminal prosecution has a chilling effect,''
said Ben Moulton, executive director of the American Society of
Law, Medicine and Ethics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony began Tuesday with Dr. Ann Murphy, medical director of
Shasta Community Health Center, a nonprofit hospital that began
seeing many of Fisher's patients after he was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that after examining Fisher's patients, she
concluded that he was operating far beyond the bounds of sound
medical practice. Patients were ``set up for a fall,'' she said, by
his prescribing ``too much medicine, too freely, in a reckless
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan's pointed cross-examination suggested that such
judgments may be open to debate, and Murphy conceded that she has
had no recent formal training in the proper use of pain
medications. She testified that patients, under California law, are
entitled to get whatever level of drugs they need to alleviate the
pain, although ``not if it kills them.''

 &HT;    OK, kids, you have our attention
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I am still scared.
</P>
<P>
   I should feel some relief that the siege at Columbine High
School is over. The two members of the black-clad ``Trenchcoat
Mafia,'' Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, are no longer a
threat. They killed themselves, ending a Hitler birthday
celebration that slaughtered 12 other students and one teacher and
left 16 students injured. A girl who was in the school library when
the student-terrorists attacked managed to survive by begging one
of the killers to spare her life. Such humane response was
transitory. The killers, self-acknowledged outsiders, immediately
turned from her and shot popular student Isaiah Sholes, 18, in the
face. Several students said the killers laughed as they went about
their bloody work, loudly proclaiming intent to kill people of
color and athletes. The arsenal of explosives and weapons the
killers stockpiled was transported to the suburban Denver school in
student backpacks. Police more than 30 explosives, many with
elaborate timers. One is in awe at the intelligence necessary to
research and create such instruments of death. How I wish the two
youngsters had invested their talents in school science projects
designed to improve lives rather than destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   The final solution to whatever Angst, anger or rejection the
gang members felt was as cold and as calculated as that of their
spiritual mentor, Hitler. So I am scared, really scared, that
though two perpetrators of this unconscionable violence are dead,
the forces that created them are still with us. Today's children,
in growing numbers, are experiencing a numbing of the sensibilities
that make one human. The resultant product is killers without
consciences, many of whom revel in the only power they perceive
they own _ the power to destroy. They willingly commit violence
without thought of consequences, not even at the cost of their own
lives. Such youngsters are to be feared; people who do not value
their own lives cannot value the lives of others. How adults can
move from fear of our youths to restoration of nurturing control is
our challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Already, learned professors are proffering theories about this
latest atrocity. The most seductive explanations absolve the public
at large, focusing more on parents too permissive or strict,
inattentive or overindulgent.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent other causes identified include the availability of
guns and other weaponry, providing youths opportunities to act on
motives that otherwise might dissipate. Also, that amorphous
culprit, the media _ not advertisers or consumers _ is being blamed
for desensitizing children to violence. And depersonalized, but
cost-effective, gigantic warehouse schools are said to deny
children an identity within any group at a time when they
desperately need to develop a sense of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, some analysts hypothesize the most patent of all
rationales: Children who kill are mentally ill. Therefore, we need
more money for psychiatrists, school counselors and
behavior-altering drugs. Once the current hysteria is diffused,
however, none of these conclusions is likely to inspire specific
action beyond installation of more electronic barriers and monitors
to shore up school security plans. The evil blooms of violence will
be cut, the roots stunted, but they are destined to grow and menace
us again.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, Ore. Jonesboro, Ark. Pearl, Miss. Now Littleton has
shown us that we can't find a hiding place sufficiently removed
from mainstream violent culture to protect children. So we must act
collectively, without partisanship of any kind, to create an
environment that can save all of them. We adults must communicate
to our children in words and action that we believe in moral
limits.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm so scared. I fear we're incapable of that kind of
selflessness until after children kill to get our attention _ if
then.

 &HT;    Bagpiper blows sour
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Andrew Mackay must have a large knot in his kilt
located about where he sits down.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who writes a travel piece for the Glasgow
(Scotland) Sunday Herald taking cheap shots at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And he comes from a country where the people eat sheep guts on
purpose? Haggis, a traditional Scottish dish, is a mixture of
oatmeal and sheep innards.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, here in Texas we are smart enough to throw that part of
the sheep away.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 4 article about his visit to Austin, Mackay hurled
several nonsensical barbs at my fair city.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, what's this business about the Continental Club on South
Congress Avenue being ``a country and western club and gun shop''?
Is that your attempt to make Texans sound like a bunch of
gun-toting nutbags?
</P>
<P>
   If you had gotten out of your room at the Austin Motel and
crossed the street to the Continental, which you say you did, you
would have known the Continental and Just Guns, a couple of doors
down, are two different businesses. So blow it out your bagpipe,
laddie.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Mackay referred to the Lone Star State as ``a k
a 268,600 square miles of scrub and cow country near Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess the guy didn't make it to Barton Springs Pool, or the
Hill Country, or maybe even outdoors. Maybe he spent all of his
time here at Capital City Tattoo on Sixth Street, having ``Robert
Burns'' etched on his butt.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of cows, at least ours are not crazy and taking
Prozac, Andrew. I didn't realize mad cow disease was transmittable
to humans until I read your screwball ramblings, pal.
</P>
<P>
   But the capper was when Andrew wrote that the best thing he did
in Austin was ``get on a plane to Albuquerque.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll give you that one, buster, as long as you promise not to
show your Scots derriere around these parts again.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's piece chapped Austinite Diane Holland, who is living in
Bearsden, Scotland, with her husband, Rick, a Motorola engineer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it chapped her so much that on Tuesday she called me
from Scotland to report that country has a few of its own flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The food in Scotland is scary, Diane said, particularly the
haggis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, maybe it was just a delicacy here and nobody
still eats it here, but they do,'' Diane said. ``But it's real
greasy and real disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but could you use it to patch holes in plaster? ``There's
enough grease in there that when it dries, it would stick
forever,'' Diane said.
</P>
<P>
   The people are clannish. ``Glasgow looks down on Edinburgh, and
Edinburgh thinks Glasgow is dirty and nasty,'' Diane said. And
they're probably both right.
</P>
<P>
   The service industries are unreliable about showing up to fix
stuff. If you call a plumber, ``they just never come,'' Diane said.
``You've got a 50-50 chance of seeing them.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't get Mexican food. Diane says they couldn't get cable
TV so they had to get a satellite dish. The homes are so old that
there's sediment in the bath water.
</P>
<P>
   But what can you expect from a place where the people used to
paint themselves blue for battle and mooned their enemies?

 &HT;    The good among the bad
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was hard for Karen Weyhrich to know what to
say, what to do. She never faced anything like it, never dreamed of
anything like it at her high school in the late '60s. ``The thing
we were most afraid of was getting caught smoking a cigarette,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She camped out at her church, St. Frances Cabrini in Littleton,
Colo., down the street from Columbine High School, comforting
hundreds of survivors. The church lost four students from its youth
group; two others were injured. Teens are telling stories like
this:
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen approached students and asked, ``Do you believe in
God?'' _ shooting them if they said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Valeen Schnurr, a member of the youth group, said yes. ``She was
sprayed nine times with shrapnel,'' Weyhrich said. ``Not a living
organ was touched, and she's coming home soon. She's in her
hospital room proclaiming her love for God and reaching out to
others, feeling concerned for her classmates who died and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a living martyr.''
</P>
<P>
   In the news, Weyhrich said, we hear only about the gore. The
evil. The kids gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   She's seeing something else, something the news cameras don't
find as compelling. ``These kids believe in the Lord, and they're
teaching their parents to love the Lord. They want their school
back and they want to go back soon. And when they go, they want to
take the Lord back with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a time of anguish, but also a time of spiritual
courage and renewal. ``It has been horrible here,'' Weyhrich said.
``We're going to feel this forever; we'll never be the same.'' Yet
she has also seen parents and children ``hugging and crying and
praying like never before.'' Support and prayers have poured in
from all over the country, all over the world. A spontaneous prayer
service Wednesday night drew 800 people, so many they had to set up
folding chairs in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Weyhrich lives in nearby Englewood, Colo. She found herself in
the Denver suburb after her husband, Bill, was transferred to the
region by his employer, Borden Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Weyhrich was volunteering at the church when word came about the
shootings. Her own children, Peter and Abby, attend Arapahoe High
School in Littleton. ``There are ladies who work here who have
children in the school. You can imagine the terror, not knowing
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyhrich's children are afraid. ``We've talked about the copycat
thing,'' she said. She can't promise Abby and Peter _ or the
Columbine High School survivors _ their lives will never be touched
by violence. ``We can only promise them love, and faith,'' she
said. ``That's why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids will walk back into that school,'' she vowed. ``The
killers and the violence will not win.''
</P>
<P>
   After the innocence of her youth in Dayton, Weyhrich can't
imagine what these kids are going through: ``They stared death in
the face, and waited for four hours to escape.'' And came out
affirming their faith, sharing it with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   After a week in which the nation has talked of little else but
youth alienation, with what has gone terribly, horribly wrong with
some of them, what a profound testament to what is right with so
many.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ One guy on the Web is calling it
``Geek Profiling,'' and I guess I partly fit the profile, or at

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the identity of the pilot of the Stealth fighter that
went down in Yugoslavia not being released? I've heard he wasn't an
American.
</P>
<P>
   A: A NATO representative in Brussels, Belgium, told Q&AMP;A that
details about missions are never made public. But the Pentagon was
somewhat more forthcoming. The reason the pilot's identity wasn't
made public is a simple one, said Defense Department spokesman
Bryan Whitman: He asked not to be identified. In interviews with
the media, pilots often give only their first names to protect
their privacy and that of their family.
</P>
<P>
   When photos of the Stealth's wreckage were published, a person's
name was clearly visible painted on the aircraft, but that wasn't
this pilot's name. There are far more pilots and crew members than
there are aircraft, Whitman explained. The pilot, by the way, was
an American flying from Aviano Air Base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have planned a vacation in Jamaica in the
very near future. Given the political unrest there, how can we
obtain information to decide if there are tourist safety concerns?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department hasn't issued any sort of warning or
advisory against travel to Jamaica, so you'll have to use your own
judgment. Recent rioting sparked by gasoline price increases left
nine people dead and businesses gutted by looters, but the unrest
wasn't directed toward tourists. For updates as they occur, call
the State Department's Citizens Emergency Center hotline,
202-647-5225. The Jamaican government, meanwhile, is launching an
advertising blitz and is organizing a ``massive fly-in'' of travel
agents in an attempt to entice tourists to continue visiting the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently described Sandy Berger's background before he
became national security adviser for the United States. I've heard
that he once was a lobbyist for the Chinese. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: That appears to be so. Before he joined the Clinton
administration, Berger was on the staff of Hogan &AMP; Hartson, a
Washington law firm. In a Washington Post article in January 1997,
Berger was described by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as the ``point
person'' at the firm for the trade office of the Chinese
government. ``He was a lawyer-lobbyist,'' Pelosi said of Berger. In
the article, Pelosi decried what she called the revolving door by
which lobbyists become administration policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the term ``flea market'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two sources have differing explanations, so take your pick:
(1) From Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins: Open-air or
street markets have so many secondhand articles of all kinds for
sale that they're believed to gather fleas. (2) From The Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins: In Dutch Colonial
days, there was a market in downtown Manhattan known as Vallie
Market, at the valley (or foot) of Maiden Lane. It came to be
abbreviated as Vlie Market, and this soon was prounounced ``flea
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite many months on the job, White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart still appears to me to be uncomfortable and often
inarticulate when addressing the Washington press corps. What is
his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lockhart, who succeeded Mike McCurry, has an extensive
background in broadcasting and political campaigns. Before joining
the White House in 1997, Lockhart was national press secretary for
the Clinton-Gore 1996 re-election campaign, and previously he was a
senior vice president of Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller, where he
brought ``an international media and U.S. political background to
the management of sensitive communications issues,'' in the words
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   His political experience includes working with all three losing
Democratic presidential campaigns in the 1980s, for Jimmy Carter,
Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. His broadcast journalism
experience includes serving as foreign producer for SKY Television
News (London), Europe's first 24-hour television direct broadcast
news service. He also was deputy assignment manager for CNN, and
before that he was an assignment editor for ABC News. At the 1980
Democratic National Convention, he also covered the Pennsylvania
delegation for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in supporting the presidential candidacy of
Bill Bradley, but I can't find out how to contact his campaign
organization. I read Q&AMP;A in Stars and Stripes, so can you assist me
with this information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to help. The address: Bill Bradley for President, 395
Pleasant Valley Way, West Orange, NJ 07052 (or call the U.S.
numbers 1-888-643-9799 or 973-731-2100). You also can sign up to
support his candidacy at his Web site:
www.billbradley.com/main/home.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to plan my summer vacation to include a performance
by the Air Force Thunderbirds. When and where can I see them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds,
will be appearing widely. These are some of this year's dates and
locations:
</P>
<P>
   May: 1, Shell Air and Sea Show, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; 9,
Mountain Home Air Force Base Air Show, Mountain Home, Idaho; 12,
Hill AFB Air Show (near Ogden), Utah; 14, Joint Services Open
House, Andrews AFB, Md. (near Washington, D.C.).
</P>
<P>
   June: 5, Airfest '99, Mankato, Minn.; 16, McConnell AFB Air
Show, Wichita, Kan.; 19, Hamilton International Air Show, Hamilton,
Ontario; 26, McChord AFB Air Show (near Tacoma), Wash.; 27, Travis
AFB Air Show (Fairfield, 150 miles northeast of San Francisco),
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   July: 3, The Team U.S. National Hot Air Balloon Championship and
Air Show, Battle Creek, Mich.; 10, Thunder Over Niagara, Niagara
Falls, N.Y.; 17, Prairie Air Show 1999, Bloomington, Ill.; 24, U.S.
Air and Trade Show, Dayton, Ohio; 31, Armed Forces Air Show, Avoca,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   August: 14, Whiteman AFB Air Show, Knob Noster, Mo.; 21, Chicago
Air and Water Show, Chicago; 28, Great New England Air Show,
Westover AFB (35 miles north of Windsor Locks, Conn.), Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Before planning a trip, check first for possible changes: USAF
Thunderbirds, 4445 Tyndall Ave., Nellis AFB, NV 89891
(702-652-9945).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since China uses a different calendar year from the rest of
the world, how is it coping with the Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the Chinese calendar, the Year 2000 milestone came and
went millennia ago. But that has nothing to do with how it will
deal with the Y2K bug, because the calendar based on Jesus' birth _
even though most scholars agree he likely was born between 3 and 5
B.C. _ is common internationally in a technological age in which
the world needs a standard.
</P>
<P>
   So China's computer problem also will show up at midnight Dec.
31. The problem, in fact, will be uniquely difficult among the
world's countries because more than 90 percent of the software used
in China is pirated. This means technicians can't call in
manufacturers for help, or receive software updates on tackling the
situation. On top of that, the Chinese computer system includes
equipment and software from almost ever hardware- and
software-producing country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive in all this is that China, as a developing
country, has a lower reliance on computers in daily life. Seventy
percent of China's population is rural, and more than 100 million
people aren't connected to the electricity grid.

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've always heard that merchants cannot impose a minimum if a
person wants to use a Visa credit card to charge the product. Is
that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go ahead and charge that 25-cent candy bar if you want to.
Visa says merchants ``absolutely'' are not permitted to establish
minimum (or maximum) transaction amounts. All merchants are
expected to follow Visa's regulations on this subject, and the
regulations are enforced through Visa member financial
institutions. If you're having a problem with a merchant who won't
allow you to charge an inexpensive item, Visa advises checking with
the financial institution that issued your Visa card. Its telephone
number is on your Visa statement and probably on the back of your
card. Each institution knows the regulations and can file a
complaint regarding the merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 4 million merchants worldwide who accept
our card,'' said Visa publicist Debbie Bromowitz in San Francisco.
``We depend on our customers to be our eyes and ears in monitoring
their acceptance of the terms.'' Q: Two inmates who served 12 years
in prison on a murder conviction were released recently after a
judge dismissed charges against them. DNA tests from the crime
scene didn't match either man. What kind of compensation are they
being given?
</P>
<P>
   A: None, at least for the time being. Only two states, New York
and Illinois, have laws compensating those incarcerated wrongfully.
Dennis Fritz, 49, and Ron Williamson, 46, who were released April
15, were tried, convicted and imprisoned in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both men have called for legislation to compensate
people wrongfully incarcerated for years. ``These men deserve
compensation,'' said Barry Scheck, Williamson's attorney, in an
interview with The Oklahoman. Scheck, a member of the Innocence
Project, which has handled 41 cases nationwide in which DNA testing
has exonerated defendants, said awards in New York and Illinois
have amounted to $65,000 to $100,000 a year for the time people had
been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Fritz said he was leaving Oklahoma because he
was ``very distrustful of the legal system'' there. He said he
planned to live with his mother in Kansas City, Mo. Williamson, who
said he isn't bitter about his imprisonment, added that he planned
to visit Florida, and then would go on a cruise. After that, he
said he may move to Missouri, also.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much is Charlton Heston paid by the National Rifle
Association to be its president? Do you have an address where
concerned citizens can write him to express our discontent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heston's position is ``unpaid and essentially volunteer,''
said NRA spokesman Jim Manown. The address: Charlton Heston, c/o
National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Road, Fairfax,
VA 22030.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is feminist theology?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology explains:
``Feminist theology takes as its first agenda the criticism of the
masculinist bias of Christian theology. Feminists therefore see
Christian theology as having been done in exclusion of women's
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read several times that Johnny Cash suffers from a
rare neurological ailment called Shy-Drager Syndrome. What is this,
and where does it get its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also known as multiple system atrophy, Shy-Drager is a
disorder of unknown cause in which many parts of the nervous system
degenerate, according to the Merck Manual of Medical Information.
</P>
<P>
   Shy-Drager is similiar in many ways, such as causing movement
disorders, to Parkinson's disease, but it also causes malfunction
and destruction of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates
blood pressure, heart rate, gland secretion and eye focusing.
Degeneration of the cerebellum sometimes causes incoordination. The
treatment of Shy-Drager is the same as for Parkinson's, but
includes the drug fludrocortisone to help raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome takes its name from the American neurologists who
first observed and documented it, George Milton Shy and Glenn A.
Drager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloose, Ala., open for
public tours?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Tours are offered five times a day, Monday through
Friday, at 9, 9:15 and 11 a.m., and 1 and 1:15 p.m., by reservation
only. Call 1-888-286-8762 or 205-507-3300. The visitors center and
exhibition hall are open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Saturdays. Admission is $4 for ages 12-54; $3 for ages 6-12 and
older than 55. The visitor center, exhibition hall and plant are at
Vance, Ala., at Exit 89 (Mercedes Drive), on I-20/59 about 20 miles
east of Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend and I are having a disagreement. Who is the
highest-paid player in Major League baseball?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean long-term contract, if you said it's pitcher
Kevin Brown, you were right. The former Georgia Tech star is
getting paid $105 million over seven years by the Los Angeles
Dodgers, for an average of $15 million a year. As reported in
December when Brown became baseball's first 100-million-dollar man,
the agreement includes no deferred payments and allows for
twice-monthly charter jet flights from Brown's home in Macon, Ga.,
to Los Angeles at the Dodgers' expense during the season to allow
his wife, Candace, and the couple's young sons to visit. If you
mean salaries for this year only, Albert Belle is being paid just
under $12 million by the Baltimore Orioles, while Brown is being
paid $10.7 million, with a salary of $15.7 million for the
remaining six years of his contract (for the $105 million total).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard Garrison Keillor mention having a new baby daughter.
Who is his wife? I've never seen any personal information about
him.
</P>
<P>
   A: Gary Edward (his real name) Keillor, host of ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' rarely consents to be interviewed, which is why you
haven't read much personal information about him. He has been
married three times: No. 1, Mary C. Guntzel; No. 2, Ulla Skaerved;
and No. 3, Jenny Lind Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you define the term ``ethnic Albanians''? Why are they
called that, instead of just plain ``Albanians''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ethnic Albanians are a majority _ or at least they were
until the recent mass exodus and slaughter by Serbian forces _ in
Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of southern Yugoslavia in the Serbian
republic, which neighbors Albania. The people who live in Albania
are the ``just plain Albanians,'' as you put it. The term ``ethnic
Albanians,'' for Kosovars who have cultural ties to Albania, has
been used to distinguish between those who live in Albania and
those who don't. The Serbs, NATO claims, intend to drive the ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo, which they claim as theirs. This ``ethnic
cleansing'' is what caused NATO to launch a military offensive
against Yugoslavia's government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what year did daylight saving time begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States adopted the plan in 1918, but repealed it
in 1919. It also observed daylight time from Feb. 9, 1942, to Sept.
30, 1945, due to World War II (the reason: to conserve energy by
reducing evening use of lighting). After the war, many states
established some sort of daylight saving time. Beginning in 1967,
the entire nation went on daylight time from the last Sunday in
April to the last Sunday in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, during the Arab oil crisis, Congress enacted
daylight time from Jan. 6 to Oct. 27, 1974, and from Feb. 23 to
Oct. 26, 1975, again to conserve energy. Since 1987, daylight time
has begun on the first Sunday in April.

 &HT;    Hobson warns of `mistakes I made'
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Butch Hobson sat behind a desk in the visiting
manager's office Monday afternoon at Roger Dean Stadium wearing a
Red Sox T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Butch Hobson.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a Red Sox T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he's with the Class A Sarasota Red Sox of the Florida
State League and not the Boston Red Sox of the American League, for
whom he once played and later managed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from those glory days _ Hobson slugged 30 homers
and drove in 112 runs as Boston's regular third baseman in 1977 _
and an even longer way from the glory days when he was Bear
Bryant's quarterback at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But that's how it goes when a guy is 47 years old and has seen
his life almost disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, fired in 1994 after the third of three losing seasons as
Boston's manager, was arrested May 4, 1996, while managing the
Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-
</P>
<P>
   Barre (Pa.) team in the Philadelphia Phillies' organization when
Drug Enforcement Administration agents seized 2.6 grams of cocaine
from him in a Pawtucket, R.I., hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies suspended him, and fired him three months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't using drugs at that time,'' Hobson said. ``I had used
them during my playing career. It was easy to walk into a bar in
Chicago or New York and find a drug of your choice. It was the
thing to do, and I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, given another chance to assume a position of leadership,
Hobson is telling young people not to sabotage their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson admitted nothing more than being ``in possession of the
cocaine for 12 minutes,'' which he said Monday is how long it was
from the time he received the package, mailed from a friend, until
DEA agents showed up in what he has forever presumed to be a sting
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson was required to enter a diversion program and perform 60
hours of community service (he says he put in more than twice that
many hours), and the charge was expunged from his record. He was
out of baseball briefly after incident, but spent the past two
years as a special assignment scout in Boston's organization before
being offered the Sarasota job this season.
</P>
<P>
   From that bully pulpit, Hobson delivered a don't-do-what-I-did
message to the entire Red Sox family when spring training opened in
Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a counselor,'' Hobson said, ``but what I'm telling
these guys is: `You don't think it can happen to you? I'm the man
to see.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking about the mistakes I made. Put it out
there every single day. I'm good at this. I get their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   If only, he wishes, someone long ago had gotten his.
</P>
<P>
   He remains Butch from small-town and still hometown Fairhope,
Ala., but maybe there's a little more Clell Lavern Hobson Jr. to
him than there used to be.
</P>
<P>
   He's a grandfather to two boys, Tucker and Drew, sons of his
oldest daughter, Allene, from a first marriage. Two other daughters
_ Libby, a junior at Alabama, and Polly, a freshman at SMU _ also
are from that marriage. Hobson and his second wife, Krystine, are
parents to young sons K.C., Hank and Noah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy doing just what I'm doing,'' Hobson said. ``I'm not
looking for anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He put on a pair of glasses and filled out a lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Hobson, managing again, wearing a Red Sox T-shirt.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is the identity of the pilot of the Stealth fighter that
went down in Yugoslavia not being released? I've heard he wasn't an
American.
</P>
<P>
   A: A NATO representative in Brussels, Belgium, told Q&AMP;A that
details about missions are never made public. But the Pentagon was
somewhat more forthcoming. The reason the pilot's identity wasn't
made public is a simple one, said Defense Department spokesman
Bryan Whitman: He asked not to be identified. In interviews with
the media, pilots often give only their first names to protect
their privacy and that of their family.
</P>
<P>
   When photos of the Stealth's wreckage were published, a person's
name was clearly visible painted on the aircraft, but that wasn't
this pilot's name. There are far more pilots and crew members than
there are aircraft, Whitman explained. The pilot, by the way, was
an American flying from Aviano Air Base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I have planned a vacation in Jamaica in the
very near future. Given the political unrest there, how can we
obtain information to decide if there are tourist safety concerns?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department hasn't issued any sort of warning or
advisory against travel to Jamaica, so you'll have to use your own
judgment. Recent rioting sparked by gasoline price increases left
nine people dead and businesses gutted by looters, but the unrest
wasn't directed toward tourists. For updates as they occur, call
the State Department's Citizens Emergency Center hotline,
202-647-5225. The Jamaican government, meanwhile, is launching an
advertising blitz and is organizing a ``massive fly-in'' of travel
agents in an attempt to entice tourists to continue visiting the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently described Sandy Berger's background before he
became national security adviser for the United States. I've heard
that he once was a lobbyist for the Chinese. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: That appears to be so. Before he joined the Clinton
administration, Berger was on the staff of Hogan &AMP; Hartson, a
Washington law firm. In a Washington Post article in January 1997,
Berger was described by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as the ``point
person'' at the firm for the trade office of the Chinese
government. ``He was a lawyer-lobbyist,'' Pelosi said of Berger. In
the article, Pelosi decried what she called the revolving door by
which lobbyists become administration policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the term ``flea market'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Two sources have differing explanations, so take your pick:
(1) From Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins: Open-air or
street markets have so many secondhand articles of all kinds for
sale that they're believed to gather fleas. (2) From The Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins: In Dutch Colonial
days, there was a market in downtown Manhattan known as Vallie
Market, at the valley (or foot) of Maiden Lane. It came to be
abbreviated as Vlie Market, and this soon was prounounced ``flea
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Despite many months on the job, White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart still appears to me to be uncomfortable and often
inarticulate when addressing the Washington press corps. What is
his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lockhart, who succeeded Mike McCurry, has an extensive
background in broadcasting and political campaigns. Before joining
the White House in 1997, Lockhart was national press secretary for
the Clinton-Gore 1996 re-election campaign, and previously he was a
senior vice president of Robinson Lerer Sawyer Miller, where he
brought ``an international media and U.S. political background to
the management of sensitive communications issues,'' in the words
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   His political experience includes working with all three losing
Democratic presidential campaigns in the 1980s, for Jimmy Carter,
Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. His broadcast journalism
experience includes serving as foreign producer for SKY Television
News (London), Europe's first 24-hour television direct broadcast
news service. He also was deputy assignment manager for CNN, and
before that he was an assignment editor for ABC News. At the 1980
Democratic National Convention, he also covered the Pennsylvania
delegation for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in supporting the presidential candidacy of
Bill Bradley, but I can't find out how to contact his campaign
organization. I read Q&AMP;A in Stars and Stripes, so can you assist me
with this information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to help. The address: Bill Bradley for President, 395
Pleasant Valley Way, West Orange, NJ 07052 (or call the U.S.
numbers 1-888-643-9799 or 973-731-2100). You also can sign up to
support his candidacy at his Web site:
www.billbradley.com/main/home.htm
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to plan my summer vacation to include a performance
by the Air Force Thunderbirds. When and where can I see them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds,
will be appearing widely. These are some of this year's dates and
locations:
</P>
<P>
   May: 1, Shell Air and Sea Show, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; 9,
Mountain Home Air Force Base Air Show, Mountain Home, Idaho; 12,
Hill AFB Air Show (near Ogden), Utah; 14, Joint Services Open
House, Andrews AFB, Md. (near Washington, D.C.).
</P>
<P>
   June: 5, Airfest '99, Mankato, Minn.; 16, McConnell AFB Air
Show, Wichita, Kan.; 19, Hamilton International Air Show, Hamilton,
Ontario; 26, McChord AFB Air Show (near Tacoma), Wash.; 27, Travis
AFB Air Show (Fairfield, 150 miles northeast of San Francisco),
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   July: 3, The Team U.S. National Hot Air Balloon Championship and
Air Show, Battle Creek, Mich.; 10, Thunder Over Niagara, Niagara
Falls, N.Y.; 17, Prairie Air Show 1999, Bloomington, Ill.; 24, U.S.
Air and Trade Show, Dayton, Ohio; 31, Armed Forces Air Show, Avoca,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   August: 14, Whiteman AFB Air Show, Knob Noster, Mo.; 21, Chicago
Air and Water Show, Chicago; 28, Great New England Air Show,
Westover AFB (35 miles north of Windsor Locks, Conn.), Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Before planning a trip, check first for possible changes: USAF
Thunderbirds, 4445 Tyndall Ave., Nellis AFB, NV 89891
(702-652-9945).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since China uses a different calendar year from the rest of
the world, how is it coping with the Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Under the Chinese calendar, the Year 2000 milestone came and
went millennia ago. But that has nothing to do with how it will
deal with the Y2K bug, because the calendar based on Jesus' birth _
even though most scholars agree he likely was born between 3 and 5
B.C. _ is common internationally in a technological age in which
the world needs a standard.
</P>
<P>
   So China's computer problem also will show up at midnight Dec.
31. The problem, in fact, will be uniquely difficult among the
world's countries because more than 90 percent of the software used
in China is pirated. This means technicians can't call in
manufacturers for help, or receive software updates on tackling the
situation. On top of that, the Chinese computer system includes
equipment and software from almost ever hardware- and
software-producing country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive in all this is that China, as a developing
country, has a lower reliance on computers in daily life. Seventy
percent of China's population is rural, and more than 100 million
people aren't connected to the electricity grid.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've always heard that merchants cannot impose a minimum if a
person wants to use a Visa credit card to charge the product. Is
that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go ahead and charge that 25-cent candy bar if you want to.
Visa says merchants ``absolutely'' are not permitted to establish
minimum (or maximum) transaction amounts. All merchants are
expected to follow Visa's regulations on this subject, and the
regulations are enforced through Visa member financial
institutions. If you're having a problem with a merchant who won't
allow you to charge an inexpensive item, Visa advises checking with
the financial institution that issued your Visa card. Its telephone
number is on your Visa statement and probably on the back of your
card. Each institution knows the regulations and can file a
complaint regarding the merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 4 million merchants worldwide who accept
our card,'' said Visa publicist Debbie Bromowitz in San Francisco.
``We depend on our customers to be our eyes and ears in monitoring
their acceptance of the terms.'' Q: Two inmates who served 12 years
in prison on a murder conviction were released recently after a
judge dismissed charges against them. DNA tests from the crime
scene didn't match either man. What kind of compensation are they
being given?
</P>
<P>
   A: None, at least for the time being. Only two states, New York
and Illinois, have laws compensating those incarcerated wrongfully.
Dennis Fritz, 49, and Ron Williamson, 46, who were released April
15, were tried, convicted and imprisoned in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both men have called for legislation to compensate
people wrongfully incarcerated for years. ``These men deserve
compensation,'' said Barry Scheck, Williamson's attorney, in an
interview with The Oklahoman. Scheck, a member of the Innocence
Project, which has handled 41 cases nationwide in which DNA testing
has exonerated defendants, said awards in New York and Illinois
have amounted to $65,000 to $100,000 a year for the time people had
been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Fritz said he was leaving Oklahoma because he
was ``very distrustful of the legal system'' there. He said he
planned to live with his mother in Kansas City, Mo. Williamson, who
said he isn't bitter about his imprisonment, added that he planned
to visit Florida, and then would go on a cruise. After that, he
said he may move to Missouri, also.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much is Charlton Heston paid by the National Rifle
Association to be its president? Do you have an address where
concerned citizens can write him to express our discontent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heston's position is ``unpaid and essentially volunteer,''
said NRA spokesman Jim Manown. The address: Charlton Heston, c/o
National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Road, Fairfax,
VA 22030.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is feminist theology?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology explains:
``Feminist theology takes as its first agenda the criticism of the
masculinist bias of Christian theology. Feminists therefore see
Christian theology as having been done in exclusion of women's
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read several times that Johnny Cash suffers from a
rare neurological ailment called Shy-Drager Syndrome. What is this,
and where does it get its name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also known as multiple system atrophy, Shy-Drager is a
disorder of unknown cause in which many parts of the nervous system
degenerate, according to the Merck Manual of Medical Information.
</P>
<P>
   Shy-Drager is similiar in many ways, such as causing movement
disorders, to Parkinson's disease, but it also causes malfunction
and destruction of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates
blood pressure, heart rate, gland secretion and eye focusing.
Degeneration of the cerebellum sometimes causes incoordination. The

includes the drug fludrocortisone to help raise blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome takes its name from the American neurologists who
first observed and documented it, George Milton Shy and Glenn A.
Drager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloose, Ala., open for
public tours?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Tours are offered five times a day, Monday through
Friday, at 9, 9:15 and 11 a.m., and 1 and 1:15 p.m., by reservation
only. Call 1-888-286-8762 or 205-507-3300. The visitors center and
exhibition hall are open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Saturdays. Admission is $4 for ages 12-54; $3 for ages 6-12 and
older than 55. The visitor center, exhibition hall and plant are at
Vance, Ala., at Exit 89 (Mercedes Drive), on I-20/59 about 20 miles
east of Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend and I are having a disagreement. Who is the
highest-paid player in Major League baseball?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean long-term contract, if you said it's pitcher
Kevin Brown, you were right. The former Georgia Tech star is
getting paid $105 million over seven years by the Los Angeles
Dodgers, for an average of $15 million a year. As reported in
December when Brown became baseball's first 100-million-dollar man,
the agreement includes no deferred payments and allows for
twice-monthly charter jet flights from Brown's home in Macon, Ga.,
to Los Angeles at the Dodgers' expense during the season to allow
his wife, Candace, and the couple's young sons to visit. If you
mean salaries for this year only, Albert Belle is being paid just
under $12 million by the Baltimore Orioles, while Brown is being
paid $10.7 million, with a salary of $15.7 million for the
remaining six years of his contract (for the $105 million total).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard Garrison Keillor mention having a new baby daughter.
Who is his wife? I've never seen any personal information about
him.
</P>
<P>
   A: Gary Edward (his real name) Keillor, host of ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' rarely consents to be interviewed, which is why you
haven't read much personal information about him. He has been
married three times: No. 1, Mary C. Guntzel; No. 2, Ulla Skaerved;
and No. 3, Jenny Lind Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you define the term ``ethnic Albanians''? Why are they
called that, instead of just plain ``Albanians''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ethnic Albanians are a majority _ or at least they were
until the recent mass exodus and slaughter by Serbian forces _ in
Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of southern Yugoslavia in the Serbian
republic, which neighbors Albania. The people who live in Albania
are the ``just plain Albanians,'' as you put it. The term ``ethnic
Albanians,'' for Kosovars who have cultural ties to Albania, has
been used to distinguish between those who live in Albania and
those who don't. The Serbs, NATO claims, intend to drive the ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo, which they claim as theirs. This ``ethnic
cleansing'' is what caused NATO to launch a military offensive
against Yugoslavia's government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what year did daylight saving time begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: The United States adopted the plan in 1918, but repealed it
in 1919. It also observed daylight time from Feb. 9, 1942, to Sept.
30, 1945, due to World War II (the reason: to conserve energy by
reducing evening use of lighting). After the war, many states
established some sort of daylight saving time. Beginning in 1967,
the entire nation went on daylight time from the last Sunday in
April to the last Sunday in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, during the Arab oil crisis, Congress enacted
daylight time from Jan. 6 to Oct. 27, 1974, and from Feb. 23 to
Oct. 26, 1975, again to conserve energy. Since 1987, daylight time
has begun on the first Sunday in April.

 &HT;    Derby field open as ever
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the 100th birthday of the Kentucky Derby, 23 horses
were allowed to squeeze into the starting gate. Anybody who owned
anything with four legs that could whinny wanted to get his animal
on the track. Ten horses spilled over into the betting field _
that's for those commoners not considered threat enough to have
their own betting slot _ and one of them finished second. It was
more a stampede than a race, and amazing that through all that
traffic a favorite named Cannonade was able to find a way to the
finish line first.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Kentucky Racing Commission limited the starting
slots to 20 has there been a cast more befuddling than the one
going into the gate this weekend. The bettor who is best at darts
should have an edge. Put the names of all the horses on a board,
throw a dart, and you've got as good a chance as any.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, it looked as if the best three-year-olds were in
the West. Then one of the best, Exploit, went down. But Bob
Baffert, with the ready quip and silver thatch, had plenty left in
his bountiful stable. Indeed, when Churchill Downs closed the book
on future wagering, Prime Timber stood the favorite at 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The champion two-year-old, Answer Lively, has fared about like
most juvenile champions. He's 15-1. Another strong juvenile
finisher, Yes It's True, took a drop in class and is off the board.
Cat Thief, Lemon Drop Kid and Lucky Roberto, Mack Robinson's
longshot winner of the Hopeful, peaked too soon.
</P>
<P>
   There shouldn't be any common sense in Baffert sending
Silverbulletday out against the boys in the Derby. That would show
a lack of confidence in his two male stars, General Challenge and
Prime Timber, and if there is anything the bon vivant Baffert is
long on, it's confidence. With Excellent Meeting to go with
Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks, and the other pair in the
Derby, he has a double-barreled shot at both prizes.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Ashland Stakes aboard her at Keeneland, jockey
Jerry Bailey said of Silverbulletday, ``She's the best filly I ever
rode,'' and that covers a lot of fillies. But you can hardly see
the need of her in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Some unusual mystery is coming in from the sheiks in the United
Arab Emirates, operating as Godolphin Stable. Worldly Manner won
the Del Mar Futurity last year and was bought by one of the
Maktoums for $5 million, taking him out from under Baffert. Aljabr
is a complete mystery. ``He finished second behind Worldly Manner
in a `trial' race among Godolphin Stable horses in Dubai, then won
a second `trial' which Worldly Manner sat out,'' which reads like
an intramural scrimmage. Somebody must know how to unravel the
mystery, for Worldly Manner was bet down to 9-1 in the future book.
You gets yer money down and you takes yer chances here.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for horses that have come into the Derby at
the top of their game, there are two choices, Stephen Got Even and
Menifee. Stephen Got Even was running allowances races at
Gulfstream when I first heard of him, then won the big tuneup at
Turfway _ beating another of Baffert's herd _ and shot right into
the middle of the picture. He stalked the pace going wide, then
took charge in the stretch. All of his credentials pass muster.
Menifee came out of Florida behind in his homework, but he caught
up in the Blue Grass. Pat Day found a hole in traffic, pulled him
wide and beat Cat Thief and Vicar the way you like to see your
horse win. And at 9-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   It's a muddle. One big jigsaw puzzle that only the 125th
Kentucky Derby can solve for you. Right now I'd lean toward Stephen
Got Even, Prime Timber, Worldly Manner (with Bailey up) and
Menifee. But this is the guy who came off Spend a Buck, and I might
change directions several times after I get there.

<P>
   __  &UR; True love may last forever, but it hasn't been around that
long. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Love in the Western world _ to borrow Denis de Rougemont's
useful term _ has come to mean, in the popular imagination,
romantic love almost exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Pure emotion, passion, ``love at first sight'' _ we so take for
granted the import of romantic love, it may come as a surprise to
learn that the very concept of ``love'' based upon emotion as a
high value, and not as an outlaw passion, is relatively new in the
history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love isn't so much a love that defies conventions, for
romantic love is of all love types the most conventional, as a love
that arises with seeming spontaneity: unwilled, undirected by
others' suggestions or admonitions, raw and unpremeditated and of
the heart; not cerebral and not genital.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love is forever in opposition to formal, cultural and
tribal prescriptions of behavior: arranged marriages, for instance,
in which brides and their dowries are possessions to be handed over
to a bridegroom and his family, or in which titled names are wed in
businesslike arrangements that have little to do with the feelings
of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most celebrated of late-20th-century public
figures, Diana, princess of Wales, would seem to have been a martyr
to such an arrangement; her political marriage to Prince Charles
ending in dissolution and divorce, and her ``quest for personal
happiness'' (i.e., romantic love) ending in a grotesquely public
death on a Parisian boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   In the ancient world, romantic love would seem to have been
virtually unknown, and rarely celebrated. Our generic term ``love''
didn't exist. The sentiment of romantic love as we know it was the
homoerotic love of older Greek men for boys. Marital love, which
surely existed, seems oddly not to have been much honored, at least
in surviving literature.
</P>
<P>
   Plato's elaborately extended metaphor of the republic, or the
perfectly balanced state, discusses marriage primarily as mating;
by contrast, Plato's ``Symposium'' celebrates homoerotic love in
the most blushingly romantic terms.
</P>
<P>
   How different this is from the extramarital erotic attraction of
heterosexuals, which results in devastation and violent death. In
Euripides' ``Hippolytus,'' for instance, the young Queen Phaedra
falls in love with her husband's illegitimate son, who rejects her,
and causes her to commit suicide. Phaedra is no romantic, but
rather the victim of an ungovernable, unwished-for passion imposed
upon her by Aphrodite. Such sexual desire is akin to a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Where to the classical mind the intervention of eros in human
affairs signals chaos, disaster and retribution, to the more
modern, romantically inclined sensibility, eros is the very engine
of life's story, a seemingly inexhaustible fund of fantasies of
(mostly heterosexual) desire.
</P>
<P>
   The adulterous tale of Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere, the
wife of King Arthur, in Sir Thomas Malory's ``Morte d'Arthur''
strikes a startlingly contemporary note, though written in 1469;
the illicit romances of Hiloose and Abilard, Tristram and Isolde
and other medieval lovers concentrate upon an intensity of genuine
feeling not found in earlier literature.
</P>
<P>
   By the 14th and 15th centuries, in aristocratic European
societies at least, eros had become a fine art, worthy of a
courtier's fullest attention. Not coarse sexuality, but a refined
gentilesse is the ideal of these romances; the love of the courtier
for his lady, usually another man's wife, has been interpreted as a
secularization of the medieval cult of the Virgin Mary, a
``feminization'' of the patriarchal Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   These tales are inevitably from the male perspective. The lady
is saintly, and of an unearthly beauty. Or, in later refinements,
the lady is cruel, even diabolical, and the courtier's passion
becomes his punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent centuries in the West, romantic love has triumphed
as a sort of private, personal mystique linked with a high cultural
value.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential romantic-minded heroine is Flaubert's Emma
Bovary, a finely drawn portrait of a woman doomed to unhappiness in
love. Emma is corrupted not by any actual man but by her reading.
She yearns to locate, in the world, the elusive image of romantic
passion. The problem with such yearning, Flaubert suggests, is that
it invariably leads to disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one major American novelist, F. Scott Fitzgerald, wrote
of virtually nothing except romantic love (and its unforeseen
consequences), and it might be argued that writers as diverse as
Carson McCullers and Jack Kerouac are essentially celebrants of
homoerotic romance.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, our intrepid explorer of love's willful illusions,
would seem an American heir of Proust in both the poetic precision
of his style and his fascination with erotic infatuation. Updike's
preoccupations bring to mind a question of de Rougemont: ``Without
adultery, what would happen to imaginative writing?''
</P>
<P>
   Coming of age in America for most of us has to do with falling
under the spell of the culture's seductive promises about love. To
grow up in the '50s, as I did, was to be bombarded with images of
every kind of romantic-love idea. Advertisements presented
unfailingly pretty, feminine girl-women in various stages of bliss,
always male-related; Hollywood movies dramatized the predominant _
possibly for women the only _ story of significance, the love
story.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from these images of individuals fulfilled by romance,
there were few others, and none as glamorous. (What images of the
intellectual life, for instance? The artistic life?) Of course,
these are cliches, and yet _ what power cliches possess when we're
young and vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' for me somehow became disembodied from any
particular figure or icon and attached itself to the quest for
adventure, the wild exploration itself. Luckily for me, I can't be
disappointed in this ``romance'' precisely because it's purely
abstract and imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic love, that most precarious and gossamer of emotions,
will surely survive the millennia that gave birth to it as long as
a reasonably affluent civilization endures, for the secret of
romantic love is economic. It's a luxury only some can afford, just
as a refined taste in food is a consequence of a plentiful food
supply. Is romantic love illusion? Delusion? An ideal dream?
</P>
<P>
   Just as the majority of humankind will continue to believe in
gods of various denominations when no actual gods have been
sighted, so men and women will continue to fall under the spell of
romantic love and to shape, or misshape, their lives to that end.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists may grimly describe for us the mammalian
underpinnings of courtship, mating, bonding, fidelity (where there
is in fact fidelity) _ but, being human, knowing full well as the
song warns us that ``falling in love with love is falling for
make-believe,'' we are the species that demands to be lied to, in
the nicest ways.

   ___  &UR; Gutenberg didn't invent the printing press _ and other
surprises from 1,000 years of ingenuity. &LR;  __
</P>
<P>
   My 11-year-old twin sons just told me what they learned today in
school. ``Daddy, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press,
and that was one of the greatest inventions in history.''
</P>
<P>
   I learned that too when I was a child. I suspect that the same
view is taught in most other American and European schools. What we
are told about printing is partly true, or at least defensible.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would rate it as the best single ``invention'' of
this millennium. Just think of its enormous consequences for modern
societies. Without printing, millions of people wouldn't have read
quickly, with no transmission errors, Martin Luther's 95 Theses,
the Declaration of Independence, the Communist Manifesto or other
world-changing texts. Without printing, we wouldn't have modern
science.
</P>
<P>
   Without printing, Europeans might not have spread over the globe
since 1492, because consolidation of initial European conquests
required the emigration of thousands of would-be conquistadors
motivated by written accounts of Pizarro's capture of the Incan
emperor Atahualpa.
</P>
<P>
   So I agree with half of what my kids were taught _ the part
about the importance of printing. But things get more complicated
when you credit this invention specifically to Gutenberg, or even
when you credit him with just the printing press itself. Gutenberg
did much more than invent the printing press _ and much less than
invent printing.
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate rendering of his achievements would be something
like the following legalistic sentence: ``Gutenberg played a major
practical and symbolic role in independently reinventing, in a
greatly improved form and within a more receptive society, a
printing technique previously developed in Minoan Crete around 1700
B.C., if not long before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Gutenbergian printing take off while Minoan printing
didn't? Therein lies a fascinating story that punctures our usual
image of the lonely and heroic inventor: Gutenberg, James Watt,
Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Through his contribution to the millennium's best invention,
Gutenberg gave us the millennium's best window into how inventions
actually unfold. Even American and European schoolchildren reared
on Gutenberg hagiography soon learn that China had printing long
before Gutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese printing is known to go back to around the second
century A.D., when Buddhist texts on marble pillars began to be
transferred to the new Chinese invention of paper via smeared ink.
By the year 868, China was printing books.
</P>
<P>
   But most Chinese printers carved or otherwise wrote out a text
on a wooden block instead of assembling it letter by letter as
Gutenberg did (and as almost all subsequent printers using
alphabetic scripts have also done). Hence the credit for what
Gutenberg invented is also corrected from ``printing'' to
``printing with movable type'': That is, printing with individual
letters that can be composed into texts, printed, disassembled and
reused.
</P>
<P>
   Have we now got the story right? No, Gutenberg still doesn't
deserve credit even for that. By about 1041, the Chinese alchemist
Pi Sheng had devised movable type made of a baked-clay-and-glue
amalgam. Among the subsequent inventors who improved on Pi Sheng's
idea were Korea's King Htai Tjong (cast-bronze type, around 1403)
and the Dutch printer Laurens Janszoon (wooden type with
hand-carved letters, around 1430).
</P>
<P>
   From all those inventors, it's convenient (and, I think,
appropriate) to single out Gutenberg for special credit because of
his advances _ the use of a press, a technique for mass-producing
durable metal letters, a new metal alloy for the type and an
oil-based printing ink. We also find it convenient to focus on
Gutenberg as a symbol because he can be considered to have launched
book production in the West with his beautiful Bible of 1455.
</P>
<P>
   But a form of printing with movable type was invented far
earlier by an unnamed printer of ancient Crete in the Minoan age.
The proof of Minoan printing can be found in a single baked-clay
disk, six inches in diameter. Found buried deep in the ruins of a
1700 B.C. palace at Phaistos on Crete, the disk is covered on both
sides with remarkable spiraling arrays of 241 symbols constituting
45 different ``letters'' (actually, syllabic signs), which were not
deciphered until a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recent decipherment identifies the signs' language as an
ancient form of Greek that predates even Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the symbols of the Phaistos disk weren't
scratched into the clay by hand, as was true of most ancient
writing on clay, but were instead printed by a set of punches, one
for each of the 45 signs. Evidently, some ancient Cretan
predecessor of Pi Sheng beat him to the idea by 2,741 years.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Minoan printing die out? Why was Renaissance Europe
ready to make use of the millennium's best invention while Minoan
Crete was not?
</P>
<P>
   Technologically, the Minoans' hand-held punches were clumsy. The
early Minoan writing system itself, a syllabary rather than an
alphabet, was so ambiguous that it could be read by few people and
used for only very particular kinds of texts, perhaps only tax
lists and royal propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese printing's usefulness was similarly limited by China's
own nonalphabetic writing system. To make Minoan printing efficient
would have required technological advances that did not occur until
much later, like the creation of paper, an alphabet, improved inks,
metals and presses.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned that Gutenberg is part not only of the millennium's
best invention but also of its best insight into how our usual view
of inventions often misses the point. Coming up with an invention
itself may be the easy part; the real obstacle to progress may
instead be a particular society's capacity to utilize the
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Other famously premature inventions include wheels in
pre-Columbian Mexico (relegated to play toys because Mexican
Indians had no draft animals) and Cro-Magnon pottery from 25,000
B.C. (What nomadic hunter-gatherer really wants to carry pots?)
</P>
<P>
   The technological breakthroughs leading to great inventions
usually come from totally unrelated areas. For instance, if a queen
of ancient Crete had launched a Minoan Manhattan Project to achieve
mass literacy through improved printing, she would never have
thought to emphasize research into cheese, wine and olive presses _
but those presses furnished prototypes for Gutenberg's most
original contribution to printing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, American military planners trying to build powerful
bombs in the 1930s would have laughed at suggestions that they
finance research into anything so arcane as transuranic elements.
</P>
<P>
   We picture inventors as heroes with the genius to recognize and
solve a society's problems. In reality, the greatest inventors have
been tinkerers who loved tinkering for its own sake and who then
had to figure out what, if anything, their devices might be good
for.
</P>
<P>
   The prime example is Thomas Edison, whose phonograph is widely
considered to be his most brilliant invention. When he built his
first one, in 1877, it was not in response to a national clamor for
hearing Beethoven at home. Having built it, he wasn't sure what to
do with it, so he drew up a list of 10 uses, like recording the
last words of dying people, announcing the time and teaching
spelling.
</P>
<P>
   When entrepreneurs used his invention to play music, Edison
thought it was a debasement of his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Our widespread misunderstanding of inventors as setting out to
solve society's problems causes us to say that necessity is the
mother of invention. Actually, invention is the mother of
necessity, by creating needs that we never felt before. (Be honest:
did you really feel a need for your Walkman CD player long before
it existed?)
</P>
<P>
   Far from welcoming solutions to our supposed needs, society's
entrenched interests commonly resist inventions. In Gutenberg's
time, no one was pleading for a new way to churn out book copies:
There were hordes of copyists whose desire not to be put out of
business led to local bans on printing.
</P>
<P>
   The first internal-combustion engine was built in 1867, but no
motor vehicles came along for decades, because the public was
content with horses and railroads. Transistors were invented in the
United States, but the country's electronics industry ignored them
to protect its investment in vacuum-tube products; it was left to
Sony in bombed-out postwar Japan to adapt transistors to
consumer-electronics products.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of typing keyboards continue to prefer our
inefficient qwerty layout to a rationally designed one.
</P>
<P>
   All these misunderstandings about invention pervade our science
and technology policies. Every year, officials decry some areas of
basic research as a waste of tax dollars and urge that we instead
concentrate on ``solving problems'': that is, applied research.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much applied research is necessary to translate basic
discoveries into workable products _ a prime example being the
Manhattan Project, which spent three years and $2 billion to turn
Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman's discovery of nuclear fission into
an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, however, the world fails to realize that neither
the solutions to most difficult problems of technology nor the
potential uses of most basic research discoveries have been
predictable in advance. Instead, penicillin, X-rays and many other
modern wonders were discovered accidentally _ by tinkerers driven
by curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   So forget those stories about genius inventors who perceived a
need of society, solved it single-handedly and transformed the
world. There has never been such a genius; there have only been
processions of replaceable creative minds who made serendipitous or
incremental contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If Gutenberg himself hadn't devised the better alloys and inks
used in early printing, some other tinkerer with metals and oils
would have done so. For the best invention of the millennium, do
give Gutenberg some of the credit _ but not too much.

<P>
   _____  &UR; The message, whether from Yoruban elders of the Founding
Fathers, the Bible or the Koran, is the same: Humans have rights. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With the blood-soaked banner of religious fanaticism billowing
across the skies as one prominent legacy of this millennium, Martin
Luther's famous theses against religious absolutism struck me early
as a strong candidate for the best idea of the last thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   By progressive association, so did the microprocessor and its
implications _ the liberalization of access to knowledge, and a
quantum boost for the transmission of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a nobler idea that has spread by its own
power in this millennium and that has now begun to flourish: the
idea that certain fundamental rights are inherent to all humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Humankind has always struggled to assert certain values in their
own right, values that the individual intuitively felt belonged to
each person as part of natural existence. It is difficult to
imagine a period when such values were not pursued in spasmodic
acts of dissent from norms that appeared to govern society even in
its most rudimentary form.
</P>
<P>
   Even after years of conformity to hallowed precedents, a few
dissidents always arise, and they obtain their primary impulse in
crucial instances from the individual's seizure of his or her
subjective worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the devolution of authority to one individual as the head of
a collective, a system of checks on arbitrary authority is
prevalent. Take, for instance, monarchical rule among the Yoruba,
the people now concentrated in western Nigeria. At the apex is a
quasi-deified personage, endowed with supreme authority over his
subjects. To preserve the mystic aura of such a ruler, he is never
seen to eat or drink.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, he was not permitted to speak directly to his
people but had to employ an intermediary voice, a spokesman. For
the highest-ranked kings in the Yoruban world, the ``ekeji orisa''
(companions to the deities), it was forbidden even to see their
faces. Despite the social and psychological distance between the
leader and his subjects, the monarch was pledged to rule within a
strict contract of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Transgression of a taboo, say, or failure to fulfill ceremonial
duties on time, resulted in fines, rituals of appeasement or a
period of ostracism. The major crime, however, was abuse of power,
excessive authoritarianism and a trampling on the rights of the
citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   For this category of crimes, there was only one response: the
king, on being found guilty, was given a covered calabash and
invited to retreat to his inner chambers. He understood the
sentence: he must never again be seen among the living.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, an individual manages to convert
collective authority into a personal monopoly. In these instances,
society is characterized by tensions, palpable or hidden, between
the suppressed rights of the people and the power rapacity of one
individual.
</P>
<P>
   But where does society ground its claims, its resistant will, in
such circumstances? We know that rebellion may be triggered by
recollections of more equitable relationships, by material
expropriation or by a cultural transgression that affects the
spiritual well-being of the community or individual. Such rebellion
finds its authority in the belief, in one citizen after another,
that the ruler has violated a fundamental condition of human
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The ``droit du seigneur,'' the ``right'' that confers on the
lord the pleasure of deflowering, on her marriage night, the bride
of any of his vassals _ on what does the ritually cuckolded groom
finally ground his rebellion other than a subjective sense of
self-worth? What of the Yoruban monarch who, even today in certain
parts of my world, tries to exercise his ``right'' to ``gbese le''
_ that is, to place his royal slipper, symbolically, on any woman
who catches his fancy, and thus assign her to his harem?
</P>
<P>
   The manor lord's entitlement to compulsory labor from his
peasants, the ownership of another being as a slave, the new age of
enslavement of womanhood in countries such as Afghanistan _ the
challenges to these and other so-called rights surely commence with
the interrogation of self-worth, expanding progressively toward an
examination of the common worth of the human entity as a unit of
irreducible properties and rights.
</P>
<P>
   It took centuries for societies to influence one another to the
critical extent needed to incite the philosophic mind to address
the concept of the human race in general, and not simply as members
of a specific race or occupants of a geographical space. In its
rudimentary beginnings, each society remained limited by a process
that codified its own now-recognizable collective interests against
all others, like the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Such oaths of fealty by petty chieftains imposed duties on the
suzerain but also entrenched their own equally arbitrary mechanisms
of authority and coercion over the next level of society. This
sometimes resulted in the bizarre alliance of the monarch with his
lowest vassals against his overreaching barons and chieftains.
</P>
<P>
   Like race and citizenship, religion was not far behind in the
exclusionist philosophy of rights, formulating codes to protect the
rights of the faithful but denying the same to others _ the Cross
against the Crescent, Buddhist versus Hindu, the believer against
the infidel. Or simply religion versus secularism.
</P>
<P>
   Ground into powder beneath the hooves of the contending
behemoths of religion, ideology and race, each social unit ponders,
at least periodically, how he or she differs from cattle or sheep,
from the horses that pull the carriages of majesty, even when such
choices are the mere expressions of the collective will. If order
alone, ornamentation, social organization, technology, bonding and
even productive structures were all that defined the human species,
then what significant properties marked out Homo sapiens as
distinct from the rest of the living species?
</P>
<P>
   Polarizations within various micro-worlds _ us versus the
inferior them _ have long been armed with industrious
rationalizations. Christian and Islamic theologians throughout
history have quarried their scriptures for passages that stress the
incontestable primacy of an unseen and unknowable Supreme Deity who
has conferred authority on them. And to what end? Largely to divide
the world into us and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The great philosophical minds of Europe, such as Hume, Hegel and
Kant, bent their prodigious talents to separating the species into
those with rights and those with none, founded on the convenient
theory that some people were human and others less so.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedists of France, products of the so-called Age of
Reason, remain the most prolific codifiers of the human (and other)
species on an ambitiously comprehensive scale, and their scholarly
industry conferred a scientific benediction on a purely commercial
project that saw millions of souls dragged across the ocean to
serve as beasts of burden.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and commerce _ far older professions than the one that
is sometimes granted that distinction, but of an often-identical
temperament _ were reinforced by the authority of new scientific
theories to divide humanity into higher and lower manifestations of
the species. The dichotomy of the world was complete.
</P>
<P>
   It took the near triumph of fascism to bring the world to its
senses. The horror of the Holocaust finally took the rulers of the
world back to the original question: What is the true value of
humanity? It is to be doubted if the victorious three meeting in
Yalta actually went into any profound philosophical niceties in the
discussions that resulted in the United Nations, that partial
attempt to reverse the dichotomizing course of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   That course, taken to its ultimate conclusion, had just resulted
in an attempted purification of the species, the systematic
elimination of millions in gas chambers and a war that mired the
potential of Europe in the blood of its youth. After all, the
concept of the master race was not new, but it was never before so
obsessively articulated and systematically pursued. It was time to
rethink the entire fate of humanity. The conversations at Yalta,
conversations that led to the birth of the United Nations, were a
partial answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage was to render the new thinking in concrete
terms, to enshrine in a charter of rights the product of the
bruising lessons of the immediate past: the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The informing recognition is
that long-suppressed extract of the intuition that humanity had
guarded through evolution, one that had been proposed, compromised,
amended, vitiated, subverted but never abandoned: that, for all
human beings, there do exist certain fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
   The idea already exists in the Bible, in the Koran, in the
Bhagavad-Gita, in the Upanishads, but always in curtailed form,
relativist, patriarchal, always subject to the invisible divine
realms whose interpreters are mortals with distinct, secular
agendas, usually allied to the very arbitrary controls that are a
contradiction to such ideas. Quiet, restrained, ignored by but also
blissfully indifferent to the so-called world religions, Ifa, the
corpus of Yoruban spiritual precepts and secular philosophy, its
origins lost in antiquity but preserved and applied till today,
annunciates identical ideas through Orunmila, the god of
divination:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dandan enia l'ayan ko mu ire lo s'aye ... Ipo rere naa ni
aye-amotan ohungbogbo, ayo nnigbagbogbo, igbesi laisi ominu tabi
iberu ota.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it is the human being that was elected to bring
values to the world ... and his place of good is the knowledge of
all things, joy at all times, freedom from anxiety and freedom from
fear of the enemy.'' (Irosu Wori)
</P>
<P>
   Humanity has been straining to seize the fullness of this
doctrine, the right to knowledge, the freedom from anxiety, the
right to security of existence as inherent to the species. It is
only the process of promulgating its pertinence to all mankind that
has been long and costly. The kernel of the idea, therefore, is
both timeless and new. Its resurrection _ the concrete seizure of
the idea within this millennium, answering the exigencies of
politics, religion and power and securing it within the bedrock of
universality _ was a destiny that would first be embraced by
France.
</P>
<P>
   There, alas, the events that gave new life to this idea did not
encourage its adoption on a universal scale, indeed not even
durably within France itself. The restoration of slavery by
Napoleon was surely the most blatant contradiction of the idea, but
this did not much trouble the emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea had taken hold, the idea of the rights of man as
a universal principle. It certainly motored the passion of the
genuine idealists in the abolition of the slave trade, who must
always be distinguished from those to whom abolition was simply a
shrewd commercial calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the American Declaration of Independence _ an idea
that still lacks full realization _ that ``all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights'' is an adumbration of that original idea from
which the French Revolution obtained its inspiration, one that has
continued to convulse the unjust order of the world wherever it has
been grasped: the fundamental rights of man.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea whose suppression is the main occupation of
dictatorships _ be these military or civilian, of the right or the
left, secular or theocratic. It is, however, their nightmare, their
single province of terror, one that they cannot exorcise, not even
through the most unconscionable pogroms, scorched-earth campaigns
and crimes against humanity. It is an idea that has transformed the
lives of billions and remains poised to liberate billions more,
since it is an idea that will not settle for tokenism or for
relativism _ it implicitly links the liberation of one to the
liberation of all.
</P>
<P>
   Its gospel of universalism is anchored in the most affective
impulse that cynics attribute to the choices made by humanity,
self-love, but one that now translates humanity as one's own self.

</P>
<P>
   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that almost automatic response
stand up to informed comparison with past times?
</P>
<P>
   To answer this question, The New York Times Magazine convened a
panel, moderated by the longtime New York Times columnist Russell
Baker, comprising the following scholars:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Cahill, author of ``The Gifts of the Jews'' and ``How
the Irish Saved Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Douglas, professor of English and comparative literature
at Columbia, and author of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in
the 1920s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Elaine Pagels, professor of religion at Princeton, and author
of ``The Origin of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, and
author of ``Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two
American Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Spence, professor of history at Yale, and author of
``The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL BAKER: None of us are living in this time by choice.
We're here because of somebody else's decision. Maybe, given our
druthers, we would prefer to be somewhere else _ I would bet in
most cases not in the future. The idea is to debate a little about
the ideal time to live in, if you had your own choice.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose some people would say this is the ideal time. I'm
prepared to argue against that, but for the most part I'm here to
listen to your opinions. Mr. Spence, you would probably like to go
back in time?
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN SPENCE: Absolutely. I would be very interested to live
my life in Hangzhou. I know where my villa is going to be: on the
west side of the lake in the hills, looking down on what was then a
totally unpolluted lake, and what was a kind of large and
prosperous rural pleasure resort. A beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: What year is it on the Christian calendar?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: I would be born around 1540. One of the problems here is
I'd like to have a bit of money. I don't want too much, because the
official agents from Beijing would take it away from me. This was
one of the most urbane and cultured times in all of Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   I've always studied the Manchu Dynasty and modern China and the
revolution, and that was from 1644. But I would like to live in the
Ming Dynasty _ not knowing, of course, that the Ming was going to
fall. So I do need to die shortly before 1644. That was a great
time of scholarship, and it was also a great time for scholarship
for women.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all right, I want to be married to my real-life wife at
the same time, but my Chinese language would be much better in this
life. As a couple, we're always going to be able to play elegant
poetry games, word games that the Chinese have always loved to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And the reading _ the texts about that 16th-century period in
Hangzhou show an amazingly energized society. People read very
widely. It's a magnificent period in painting. The food is
magnificent. It is not a slave society. Booze is available but not
excessive. It's pre-opium, no heavy narcotics. And the distribution
of food in that region is efficient. It was a rich time to live.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: It sounds like a paradise. How about you, Mr. Cahill?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS CAHILL: Sticking within the confines of the last thousand
years, I find myself drawn to the 14th century. I would love to
have gone to a Christmas party in medieval London with Geoffrey
Chaucer. I would love to have been around when Giotto began to
paint _ this man, influenced by the spiritual realism of Francis of
Assisi, asking himself: What do human beings really look like? And
then trying to make them in that way. I would love to have been
there when Joan of Arc began to muster the troops.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: They burned her.
</P>
<P>
   ELAINE PAGELS: I think that this would be a fascinating journey,
but I'd want to go with a full set of inoculations and an American
passport.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: How long do you want to be present?
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Since this is an intellectual exercise, I think you have
to assume that you're going to be part of the culture of the time.
We'd all like to cruise around and watch Columbus come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I find it difficult to reduce myself to one spot.
</P>
<P>
   DOUGLAS: But we all are reduced to one spot. And you'd live how
long? Thirty years in about 1390? You'd hardly have time to get
around to see everything you said you wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: In Hangzhou, there were long-lived people, maybe 90 year
olds, edging 100. They also had wonderful food, which didn't even
require teeth! Delicious rice pilaf dishes, soft lotus-root dishes.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Mr. Patterson?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO PATTERSON: I chose three periods, excluding the period
following the civil rights movement in America. That has obviously
been the best time for Afro-Americans, but sticking to it would rid
the discussion of any fun. Working backward, my third choice would
have been to be a moderately prosperous New England farmer who
lived around 1750 to 1830 _ embracing the Revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been about 26 in 1776, so I would have fought in
the Revolutionary War. I would like to have had the opportunity to
talk intellectually with Madison, to club with Hamilton, to tell
Jefferson what a fraud I thought he was _ that really, it's not
fair that he should have a place in history just because he wrote a
great paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   My second choice is to have lived in Tokugawa, Japan, about the
18th century. I would not want to have been a samurai. By then,
they were no longer warriors; they were basically quasi
bureaucrats. And I wouldn't particularly care for the official
culture that the shogun imposed, although it was quite fascinating
_ those tea ceremonies. They would have been far too restrictive
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have been a moderately prosperous merchant
around the 1730s, participating in what the Japanese call the
floating world, which is a kind of counterculture to the official
world imposed by the shogunate. They had a ball!
</P>
<P>
   I'd have been drawn to Kabuki dramas, to the fashion, to the way
they subverted the official ideology so that when the shogun said,
``You can no longer wear fancy clothes; you have to wear cotton if
you're a merchant,'' they wore cotton on the outside and silk on
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   I think the life expectancy may well have been much better
living in Japan at that time than in Europe. And it was a very
peaceful period. They threw out the Europeans and were able to
develop their own culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now I come to my first choice. It's in the 14th century. It's a
city-state that produced some of the most beautiful art in the
world. Can you guess?
</P>
<P>
   PAGELS: Siena?
</P>
<P>
   PATTERSON: No. I wouldn't want to be in Renaissance Italy if you
paid me. There were towns where a third to a half of the population
was dropping dead from the plague!
</P>
<P>
   The little city-state I had in mind would have been the town of
Ife in Yorubaland, in what's now western Nigeria, somewhere about
the mid-to-late 14th century. I would want to have been a sculptor,
one of the people who produced those incredible bronze heads or the
terra-cotta work that you now can see in the British Museum. Again,
the life expectancy would have quite possibly been higher than for
a working man in Europe at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to have been a bourgeois gentleman in Holland
during the golden 17th and early 18th centuries, having your
portrait done by one of their great painters, but they were
involved with the slave trade. The same was true of the British.
</P>
<P>
   You think about being an entrepreneur in late 18th- and
19th-century England. You saw this incredible transformation, the
Industrial Revolution; the steam engine and all the rest. The
trouble is, one can't help thinking about the plight of the
displaced masses and the kids who were being sent down into the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: I wonder if I could change the focus to the idea of
progress. Do we all believe in progress?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: It seems to me it's not so much comfort or progress that
we're talking about; it's those who actually are drawn to live in a
period of extraordinary change and struggle vs. those who, I think,
want a period of enormous cultural subtlety and development.
</P>
<P>
   I tilt toward the latter, a time in which the culture is still
immensely lively, but the idea of progress would not exactly be the
point.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I would speak for progress. We are at the end of the
bloodiest of all centuries, to be sure. And it is not a universal
consciousness, by any means, but I think there is a consciousness
of the necessity for peace.

   ___  &UR; A revolutionary turning point. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 1777, 8,200 seasoned soldiers, including a German
brigade in blue, Indians in war paint and more than seven regiments
of British infantry in scarlet headed south from their base in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Their commander was Gen. John Burgoyne _ Gentleman Johnny, they
called him _ a playwright, bon viveur and member of Parliament. He
was headed straight into the battle of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The British plan was simple. Burgoyne would sail down Lake
George, capture Fort Ticonderoga and march on Albany. There he
hoped to meet the troops of Gen. William Howe, advancing up the
Hudson, and those of Col. Barry St. Leger, advancing east from Lake
Ontario. The rebellious colonies would be cut in two.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Burgoyne's operations went according to plan. He
captured ``impregnable'' Ticonderoga with ease. But instead of
continuing by boat down Lake George, he pushed south on foot. It
took him three weeks to reach the Hudson, north of Saratoga, and by
then the Americans had regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he sent an undersize force into Vermont on a raid for
cattle and horses; it was clobbered, losing 600 men. Then Burgoyne
heard the worst news: He was on his own. Howe had set off to attack
Philadelphia. And when Benedict Arnold _ hero in this phase of the
Revolution, villain in the next _ arrived at Fort Stanwix, Colonel
St. Leger hastily abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Burgoyne's lines of communication with Canada were fragile, and
he concluded that he had no alternative but to press on to Albany
and hope for help there. Anticipating a decisive engagement,
Washington sent reinforcements to Gen. Horatio Gates of the
Northern Continental Army _ Arnold and his 1,200 men and Daniel
Morgan and his 500 crack riflemen.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, Gates' force dug in on the west bank of the Hudson
atop a hill called Bemis Heights. On Sept. 19, Burgoyne's men
reached Freeman's Farm, almost within sight of the Heights.
Burgoyne hoped to outflank Gates to the west and then drive his foe
into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Gates kept the bulk of his force within his entrenchments. The
troops he sent forward were hard pressed until Arnold, cursing,
rallied them, galloping hither and yon like a man possessed. ``He
was our fighting general,'' a comrade wrote later, ``as brave a man
as ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle lasted from noon until sunset. It ended
inconclusively, but the British lost a third of their force. Arnold
had saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the Continental Congress fled Philadelphia for
Lancaster, Pa., and 11 days later it moved farther west to York,
Pa. Washington was losing his grip; between Sept. 11 and Oct. 4,
the Americans were beaten at Brandywine, Paoli and Germantown.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, much was at stake when Burgoyne rolled the dice at
Saratoga once more on Oct. 7. He threw most of his force into a
final effort to turn the enemy's flank. Gates, jealous, had
relieved Arnold, but the latter, fuming in isolation as battle
raged, shouted: ``No man shall keep me in my tent today. If I am
without command, I will fight in the ranks, but the soldiers, God
bless them, will follow my lead.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they did. His horse was killed and he was severely
wounded in the leg, but Burgoyne had to retreat, and, on Oct. 17,
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences were undeniable: France entered the war on the
American side. When Washington and his ragtag army, wintering in
Valley Forge, Pa., received news of the alliance in the spring of
1778, their spirits were lifted; the road was open to ultimate
victory in October 1781.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium would see other great battles, such as Gettysburg
and the Marne and D-Day. But in the last 1,000 years, I think, only
the defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near Vienna in 1683 rivaled
Saratoga. It turned back the tide of Islam. Saratoga did more.
</P>
<P>
   It launched two centuries of revolution elsewhere. It marked the
beginning of the end of the British Empire. And it breathed life
into the United States of America.

   __  &UR; Why Scheherazade keeps on talking. &LR;  __
</P>
<P>
   The best story ever told? Perhaps the story of the two brothers,
both kings, who found that their wives were unfaithful, took bloody
vengeance, and set out into the world to travel until they found
someone less fortunate than they were.
</P>
<P>
   They encountered a demon who kept a woman in a glass chest with
four locks; she came out while he slept and showed them 98 rings
she had collected from chance lovers and insisted on having sex
with the princes to make it a round 100. The princes decided that
the demon was more unfortunate than they were and returned to their
kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
   There the elder brother, Shahrayar, still angry over his wife's
betrayal, instituted a reign of terror, marrying a virgin each day
and handing her to his vizier for execution at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The vizier's daughter Shahrazad, a woman both wise and learned,
beseeched her father to give her to the king. On the wedding night,
the bride asked that her younger sister, Dinarzad, might sleep
under the bed, so that when the king had ``finished with
Shahrazad,'' the younger girl, as the sisters had agreed, might ask
Shahrazad to tell a story to while away the time until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   When dawn came, the story was not finished, and the curious king
stayed execution for a night. Shahrazad continued to tell tales,
which gave rise to other tales, all of which were unfinished at
dawn. The king's narrative curiosity kept Shahrazad alive, day
after day.
</P>
<P>
   She narrated a stay of execution, a space in which she bore
three children. And in the end, the king removed the sentence of
death, and they lived happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   This story has everything a tale should have. Sex, death,
treachery, vengeance, magic, humor, warmth, wit, surprise and a
happy ending. Though it appears to be a story against women, it
actually marks the creation of one of the strongest and cleverest
heroines in world literature.
</P>
<P>
   Shahrazad, who has been better known in the West as
Scheherazade, triumphs because she is endlessly inventive and keeps
her head. The stories in ``The Thousand and One Nights''
(interchangeably known as ``The Arabian Nights'') are stories about
storytelling without ever ceasing to be stories about love and life
and death and money and food and other human necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Narration is as much a part of human nature as breath and the
circulation of the blood. Modernist literature tried to do away
with storytelling, which it thought vulgar, replacing it with
flashbacks, epiphanies, streams of consciousness. But storytelling
is intrinsic to biological time, which we cannot escape.
</P>
<P>
   Life, Pascal said, is like living in a prison from which every
day fellow prisoners are taken away to be executed. We are all,
like Scheherazade, under sentence of death, and we all think of our
lives as narratives, with beginnings, middles and ends.
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling in general, and ``The Thousand and One Nights'' in
particular, consoles us for endings with endless new beginnings. I
have just finished my own telling of the frame story with the
European fairy-tale ending, ``they lived happily ever after,''
which is a consolatory false eternity, for no one does, except in
the endless repetitions of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Stories keep part of us alive after the end of our story, and
there is something very moving about Scheherazade entering on the
happiness ever after, not at her wedding, but after 1,001 tales and
three children.
</P>
<P>
   Great stories, and great story collections, are shape shifters.
``The Thousand and One Nights,'' with its roots in Persia and
India, has probably been circulating in one form or another since
the ninth century. It first appeared in Europe in the French
translation of Antoine Galland between 1704 and 1717.
</P>
<P>
   He used a 14th-century Syrian text but adapted and rewrote and
added for French taste _ it is possible that both Aladdin and Ali
Baba as we read them originate with the Frenchman. Subsequent
translators took liberties, or used their imaginations. Richard
Burton invented a curious Victorian-medieval style.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Charles Mardrus, in 1899, according to Robert Irwin,
whose ``Companion to the Arabian Nights'' is gripping and
indispensable, ``reshaped the 'Nights' in such a manner that the
stories appear to have been written by Oscar Wilde or Stephane
Mallarme.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern and Western literature contain other related collections
of interlinked tales _ ``Katha Sarit Sagara'' (``The Ocean of
Story''), Ovid's ``Metamorphoses,'' Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales''
and Boccaccio's ``Decameron,'' whose frame story has its characters
defying the Black Death by retreating to the country and telling
tales.
</P>
<P>
   Out of such works came 19th-century Gothic fantasy and the
intricate, paranoid nightmare plottings of such story webs as ``The
Crying of Lot 49'' and Lawrence Norfolk's ``Lemprierh's
Dictionary.'' Collections of tales talk to one another and borrow
from one another; motifs glide from culture to culture, century to
century.
</P>
<P>
   If the origin of stories is the human ability to remember the
past, speculate about beginnings and imagine the ending, it doesn't
follow that the search for any ``pure'' or undisputed origin for
any story will lead to definiteness.
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade's tales have lived on, like germ cells, in many
literatures. Dickens, who became the master of serial narration and
endless beginnings, comforted his lonely and miserable childhood
with ``The Arabian Nights,'' living in their world and learning
their craft. In British Romantic poetry, ``The Arabian Nights''
stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative
against the prosaically and reductively rational.
</P>
<P>
   Coleridge said his mind had been ``habituated to the vast'' by
his early reading of ``Romances, &AMP; Relations of Giants &AMP; Magicians,
&AMP; Genii.'' He used the tale of the angry and vengeful Djinn whose
invisible child had been killed by a thrown date stone as an
example of pure chance or fate.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth, in the fifth book of his ``Prelude,'' describes his
childhood treasure as ``a little yellow, canvas-covered book,/ A
slender abstract of the Arabian tales,'' and the ``promise scarcely
earthly'' of his discovery that there were four large volumes of
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Various Western writers have been tempted to write the 1,002nd
tale. Edgar Allan Poe's Scheherazade makes the mistake of telling
her aging husband about modern marvels like steamships, radio and
the telegraph. He finds these true tales so incredible that he
concludes that she has lost her touch and has her strangled after
all.
</P>
<P>
   Poe is a combative and irreverent Yankee at the Persian court.
Joseph Roth's Scheherazade resides in the decadent days of the
Austrian Empire, while John Barth, in his ``Dunyazadiad,'' appears
in person as a balding, bespectacled genie who tells the nervous
Scheherazade the tales she will tell because he has read them in
the future and she is his heroine _ thus creating another false
eternity, a circular time loop, in which storytellers hand on
stories of storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the modern Oriental fabulists, Naguib Mahfouz and
Salman Rushdie, both threatened with death for storytelling.
Mahfouz's ``Arabian Nights and Days'' is a collection of magical
tales with a political edge and a spiritual depth. His stories
rework ``The Thousand and One Nights'': his Shahriyar slowly learns
about justice and mercy, the Angel of Death is a bric-a-brac
merchant and genies play tricks with fate.
</P>
<P>
   Salman Rushdie's narratives are intertwined with the
storytelling of the ``Nights.'' ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories''
pits a resourceful child, Haroun, against the evil Khattam-Shud,
who wants to drain the ocean of the streams of story, which are
alive, and replace it with silence and darkness. Rushdie's tale,
like Scheherazade's, equates storytelling with life, but his
characters and wit owe as much to Western fantasies _ ``Alice in
Wonderland'' and ``The Wizard of Oz'' _ as they do to ``The
Thousand and One Nights.'' Another cross-fertilization, another
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's sea of stories is ``the biggest library in the
universe.'' Jorge Luis Borges, to whom libraries, labyrinths and
books were all images of infinity, wrote in ``The Garden of Forking
Paths'' of ``that night which is at the middle of the 'Thousand and
One Nights' when Scheherazade (through a magical oversight of the
copyist) begins to repeat her stories over again. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This circular tale fascinated Italo Calvino. It also inspired
him, for his ``If on a Winter's Night a Traveler'' is the endless
tale of a lost reader who starts a book only to find that the rest
is missing; when he replaces the book, he finds that it has a new
beginning. This novel contains a novelist _ as Borges' tale
contains Scheherazade within Scheherazade _ who wants to write a
book that will contain only the pure pleasure of anticipation of
the beginning, ``a book that is only an incipit,'' a book with no
ending, perhaps like ``The Arabian Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Proust saw himself as Scheherazade, in relation to both
sex and death. At the end of the almost endless novel,
``Remembrance of Things Past,'' he writes a triumphant meditation
on the presence of death, which has in fact driven him to create
his great and comprehensive book, the book of his life.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he even personifies this presence of death as ``le
sultan Sheriar,'' who might or might not put a dawn end to his
nocturnal writing. Malcolm Bowie, in ``Proust Among the Stars,''
comments that ``the big book of death-defying stories'' with which
Proust's novel compares itself is not Boccaccio's ``Decameron,'' in
which death appears as a ``horrifying initial trigger to
tale-telling,'' but the ``Nights,'' where stories are life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narrate or die,'' for Proust's narrator as for Scheherazade,
is the imperative. ``By mere sentences placed end on end, one's
sentence is commuted for a while, and the end is postponed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judeo-Christian culture is founded on a linear narrative in
time. It moves forward from creation through history, to redemption
in the Christian case, and looks forward to the promised end, when
time and death will cease to be.
</P>
<P>
   The great novels of Western culture, from ``Don Quixote'' to
``War and Peace,'' from ``Moby Dick'' to ``Dr. Faustus,'' were
constructed in the shadow of this story. People are excited by
millennial events as images of beginnings and endings. There is a
difference between these great, portentous histories and small
tales that are handed down like gifts for delight and
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Storytellers like Calvino and Scheherazade can offer readers and
listeners an infinity of incipits, an illusion of inexhaustibility.
Calvino's imaginary novelist sits and stares at a cartoon of
Snoopy, sitting at a typewriter, with the caption ``It was a dark
and stormy night,'' the beginning of a circular shaggy-dog story.
</P>
<P>
   Both cartoons and soap operas are versions of Scheherazade's
tale telling, worlds in which death and endings are put off
indefinitely _ and age too, in the case of Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   High modernism escaped time with epiphanic visions of timeless
moments, imagined infinities that have always seemed to me
strained, for they fail to offer any counter to fear and death. But
the small artifices of elegant, well-made tales and the vulgar
satisfaction of narrative curiosity do stand against death.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic novelist Georgette Heyer kept few fan letters, but
I saw two: one from a man who had laughed at one of her comic fops
on the trolley going to a life-threatening operation, and one from
a Polish woman who had kept her fellow prisoners alive during the
war by reciting, night after night, a Heyer novel she knew by
heart.
</P>
<P>
   During the bombardment of Sarajevo in 1994, a group of theater
workers in Amsterdam commissioned tales, from different European
writers, to be read aloud, simultaneously, in theaters in Sarajevo
itself and all over Europe, every Friday until the fighting ended.
This project pitted storytelling against destruction, imaginative
life against real death. It may not have saved lives, but it was a
form of living energy.
</P>
<P>
   It looked back to ``The Thousand and One Nights'' and forward to
the millennium. It was called Scheherazade 2001.

   &UR; THE LOCAL ANGLE: Here are a few ideas to localize this piece &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade wasn't the only one who could spin a tale. Every
community has its master storytellers whether they are patriarchs
or professionals. Here is how to find storytellers, storytelling
festivals, competitions and organizations in your circulation area.
</P>
<P>
   1. The National Storytelling Association  &QL; www.storynet.org &QR; 
offers an excellent source of festivals and links to other
storytelling sources. The organization, based in Jonesborough,
Tenn., is at 1-800-525-4514
</P>
<P>
   2. The Storytelling Ring online
 &QL; http://www.tiac.net/users/papajoe/ring.htm &QR;  presents a rich
selection of websites of storytellers, groups, festivals and
resources nationwide. Or phone 1-800-466-6835, PIN 7272; e-mail the
ringmaster at  &QL; mens &LR; tiac.net &QR;
</P>
<P>
   __ Interactive Ideas for Editors:
</P>
<P>
   1. Work with your local schools. Middle school is a good age
group for a tall-tales competition to encourage reading, writing
and newspaper appreciation. Panel of storytellers, teachers and
journalists can pick the tallest tales, then to be published in
your paper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Celebrate the ethnic diversity in your circulation area with
a feature on cross-cultural storytelling, perhaps comparing
different versions of the same basic tale. The Storytelling Ring
offers some good links.

<P>
   By any human measure, a millennium is a considerable chunk of
time. It is the longest fixed unit of time with a distinct name in
common usage.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of our spent millennium and at frequent
intervals throughout it, vexed to nightmare by the calendar,
believers have awaited Christ's imminent return to rule over a new
heaven and earth in a kingdom that was to run for the unthinkable
span of a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   Near the millennium's end, the Nazis, refiners of another one of
the period's most persistent concepts, predicted their own third
kingdom would last for a thousand years. They were off by 988.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this millennium, nothing resembling an accurate
map of any continent existed. Now a hand-held Global Positioning
System satellite receiver can pinpoint its owner's location
anywhere on the face of the globe. Trade and enterprise have
expanded beyond all reckoning. More volumes are printed each year
than existed in the year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 centuries have also seen global deforestation, a
steep falling off in spoken languages and mass extinction on a
scale beyond anything since the Cretaceous.
</P>
<P>
   Any search for the millennium's most important concept already
dooms itself to myopia. Consider the candidates that spring to
mind: parliamentary democracy, the nation-state, free markets, due
process, the limited liability corporation, insurance, the
university, mandatory formal education, abolition, socialism, the
emancipation of women, universal suffrage, universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the upheaval in social institutions suggests some
corresponding revolution in underlying thought almost too large to
isolate.
</P>
<P>
   Line up the usual intellectual suspects: the theory of
evolution, relativity, the mapping of the unconscious. As
cataclysmic as each has been for our own era, they are 11th-hour
arrivals, the latter-day consequences of ideas much larger and
longer in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Push backward to Boyle's Law, Newton's F equals ( &QC; ) ma or the
Copernican Revolution, and you begin to close in on that
fundamental leap in human conception.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of progress, the invention of the future, might
itself be a leading candidate for the most influential idea of the
millennium. But the belief in transformation and advancement, in a
constantly increasing control over the material world, is still
just a symptom of a wider conceptual revolution that lies at the
heart of what has happened to the world in these last 1,000 years:
the rise of the experimental method.
</P>
<P>
   Say, then, that the most important idea of this millennium was
set in motion by a man named Abu Ali al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, born
around the year 965 in Basra, in what is now Iraq. Even by his
Western name, Alhazen, he remains a little-known figure in the
history of thought. But the idea that Ibn al-Haytham championed is
so ingrained in us that we don't even think of it as an innovation,
let alone one that has appeared so late in the human day.
</P>
<P>
   Ibn al-Haytham resolved a scientific dispute that had remained
deadlocked for more than 800 years. Two inimical theories vied to
explain the mystery of vision. Euclid, Ptolemy and other
mathematicians demonstrated that light necessarily traveled from
the eye to the observed object.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle and the atomists assumed the reverse. Both theories
were complete and internally consistent, with no way to arbitrate
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ibn al-Haytham made several remarkable observations. His
most remarkable was also the simplest. He invited observers to
stare at the sun, which proved the point: When you looked at a
sufficiently bright object, it burned the eye. He made no appeal to
geometry or theoretical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he demolished a whole mountain of systematic theory
with a single appeal to data. Light started outside the eye and
reflected into it. No other explanation was consistent with the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ptolemy had appealed to math and reason; Aristotle's position
had been mere conjecture. The world, however, answered to neither
reason nor conjecture. What argument required was something more
than theory, something that would hold up in the court of
controlled looking.
</P>
<P>
   This empirical insistence lay at the heart of Ibn al-Haytham's
real revolution, and while he did not upend the world
single-handedly, his influence has spread without limits.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from authority to observation seems small,
self-evident, almost inevitable. In reality, it is none of these.
Over the course of 1,000 years, the conceptual shift would grow
catastrophic, and its consequences would transform every aspect of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Ibn al-Haytham made numerous other experimental contributions to
optics and physics, part of a surge of Arab science at a time when
Europe possessed little science to speak of. His contemporaries,
investigators such as Ibn Ahmad al-Biruni, Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and
Ibn Sina (Avicenna), revived and extended Greek thought, unhindered
by Augustine's insistence that the world was an inscrutable riddle
invented by God to lead us toward contemplation of a universe
beyond this one.
</P>
<P>
   While none of these men can be called an experimental scientist
in the modern sense, each helped to open up the possibility that
the world can be known through its particulars and that direct
observation was the best way to know it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Arab cities in southern Spain began to fall in the late
11th century, the contents of their great libraries flooded into
Christian Europe. Ibn al-Haytham's works on optics were at last
translated into Latin late in the 12th century, enlightening the
proto-empiricist Roger Bacon (c.1220-1292).
</P>
<P>
   Bacon _ Dr. Mirabilis, as he came to be known _ was a bizarre
mixture of old and new mind. Both a philosophical Franciscan and an
antiphilosophical experimentalist, he fought to introduce science
into university curriculums and became the first European to write
down the recipe for gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed ideas for airplanes, power-driven ships and
automobiles. Ibn al-Haytham's optics, which included the invention
of a primitive camera obscura, led Bacon to many optical insights.
</P>
<P>
   But optics formed just the visible surface of what Bacon took
away from Ibn al-Haytham. ``Argument,'' he asserted in his ``Opus
Majus'' (1267), ``... does not remove doubt, so that the mind may
rest in the sure knowledge of the truth, unless it finds it by the
method of experiment. ... For if any man who never saw fire proved
by satisfactory arguments that fire burns ... his hearer's mind
would never be satisfied, nor would he avoid the fire until he put
his hand in it ... that he might learn by experiment what argument
taught.''
</P>
<P>
   The world was not a vaporous trap but a collection of things
with heft and substance, worth the closest scrutiny and palpation.
Aristotle failed to see the value of controlled experiment,
believing that nature could only be understood whole. With Bacon,
through Ibn al-Haytham, there arises the idea of testing for truth
through isolated particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's was also the moment in Western sculpture when Mary stops
holding her child out in front of her like a pillar of stone and
starts to straddle her grasping boy over one load-bearing, sensual
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Another three centuries passed before science emerged from its
roots in natural philosophy. But the idea of looking had begun to
shake the foundations of authority at the base of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Light did not come from the eye, but rather fell into it. The
world could be grasped in its particulars.
</P>
<P>
   William of Ockham (c.1285-c.1347) bolstered empiricism with his
own Law of Parsimony, or Ockham's Razor: when multiple ways exist
to explain a datum, go with the one that requires the fewest
theoretical assumptions. Jan van Eyck (c.1395-c.1441) took the zeal
for nominal reality to such heights that his Ghent altarpiece
depicts more than 40 identifiable plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Ibn al-Haytham's empirical optics traveled down yet another path
to trouble the medieval mind into early modernism. If light entered
the eye from the outside, then the eye sat at the tip of a visual
cone, where the perpendicular ray dominated over all oblique ones.
</P>
<P>
   This implied a geometry of seeing, described by Ibn al-Haytham
and elaborated on by Witelo (d. after 1281), a Pole connected with
the papal court. Through Witelo, the idea of visual perspective
spread in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The new depth of seeing worked its spell on Giotto
(c.1267-1337). The solid spaces hinted at in his frescoes were said
to reduce viewers to alarm and ecstasy. The eye of Europe turned
itself inside out. Ibn al-Haytham's camera obscura, improved upon
by Bacon, set painters loose on the pursuit of light and its
reflection off real surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   But only when Brunelleschi, Masaccio and Uccello got wind of the
new optical mathematics through their compatriot, the
geographer-mathematician Paolo Toscanelli (b.1397), did Western
Europe achieve full liftoff into rectilinear reality.
</P>
<P>
   Using the techniques of deep perspective, with its ability to
measure the relative size of objects at any distance, Toscanelli
assembled a chart that wound up leading Columbus to the New World.
The deep spaces of the new painting opened up even deeper spaces on
the map, terra incognita that the Age of Exploration rushed to fill
in.
</P>
<P>
   Ibn al-Haytham's inexorable idea derives its power from a
radical overthrow of what constitutes acceptable demonstration.
Nothing, finally, can gainsay the data. Wholeness, harmony and
radiance must give way to verifiability and repeatability.
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of printing, experimental data could
proliferate without limit. Fueled by and fueling the Protestant
Reformation, with its universal priesthood of man, skepticism's
challenge to received wisdom spread into all quarters.
</P>
<P>
   So did Ibn al-Haytham's optics. His work on refraction and
lenses led to the development of the telescope and microscope. Once
these devices threw open their portals onto the invisible, there
was no looking back. Van Leeuwenhoek's (1632-1723) ``tiny
animalcules'' revealed the living world to be stranger than any
natural philosopher could have guessed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lutheran Kepler (1571-1630), in his ``Supplement to
Witelo,'' solved the problem of atmospheric refraction and built
Ibn al-Haytham's foundation into a full account of vision. Freed up
to cast his glance into the heavens, Kepler explained magnification
and laid out the laws of planetary motion.
</P>
<P>
   And Galileo, the true prototype of the modern skeptical
empiricist, looking at the light that fell into his telescope tube
and reporting what he saw, defying all theory and common sense,
moved the world against the world's wishes. Rising to his feet
after recanting to the authorities, as legend has it, he muttered
the words that would form the credo of triumphant science: ``But it
does move.'' In short order, measurement laid out the calculus
behind its every wobble.
</P>
<P>
   ``And new philosophy calls all in doubt,'' John Donne wrote in
his poem ``An Anatomy of the World: the First Anniversary'' (1611).
And doubt itself became the engine of the new creation.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Bacon (1561-1626) wrote the user's manual for the new
scientific instrument of thought. He banished the ``idols of the
mind,'' those habits of reason that blinded you to the evidence.
Knowledge depended on suspending belief in anything except the most
indifferent measurement. In ``The Advancement of Learning'' (1605),
he wrote, ``If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in
doubts, but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall
end in certainties.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Baconian method, knowledge did not stop at the curation
and annotation of bygone ideas. Bacon was right: The revolution
unleashed in Western Europe in the 17th century represents the
sharpest break with the past in history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 300 years since the break commenced, modern science and
its handmaid, technology, have altered the globe beyond recognition
or recall, revising the terms of material existence, not to mention
the geopolitical ones. For politics too is born in experiment. The
rise of a technological Europe produced an era of imperialism from
which the continents have yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes
him,'' Bertrand Russell said, ``but how and why he believes it. His
beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence,
not on authority or intuition.'' Out of that tentativeness have
flowed the airplane, air pump, anesthesia, aniline dye, antiseptic
surgery, aspirin, atomic energy, automobiles and on, ad infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   The most adventurous mind from the year 1000 _ even Ibn
al-Haytham himself _ faced with the runaway results of the
experimental method, would have no available mental response short
of schizophrenia. Ibn al-Haytham's doubt of existing optical theory
has led to the certainties of electron microscopy, retinal surgery
and robotic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Millennial expectation has shifted away from the thousand-year
reign of Christ toward the thousand-megahertz personal computer.
The universe has progressed from an enigmatic metaphysical emblem
to the accidental byproduct of superstrings. An orbiting telescope
now extends the cone of vision out to the very edges of creation.
</P>
<P>
   There is something paradoxical in claiming, as the greatest
concept of the last millennium, the skeptical rejection of concept
in favor of evidence. But there is something paradoxical in the
idea of radical empiricism itself.
</P>
<P>
   At its purest, science strives to be neither logical nor
reasonable, merely suspicious. It claims to begin in the abeyance
of theory, but strives to produce a deeper, wider explanation of
observable event. It pursues a relentless reductionism in order to
erect a single, consistent material theory of everything from the
unified cosmological force to the evolution of consciousness, a
vastly more comprehensive blueprint than any City of God, yet still
a theory, always tentative, and refutable at best.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the most fundamental sense, skeptical empiricism may
be a contradiction in terms. It has come under attack in recent
years by a number of thinkers _ from Ludwig Wittgenstein to Thomas
Kuhn and beyond _ who have no qualms about applying the same
skepticism toward the scientific method that Francis Bacon
advocated applying to any body of accepted lore.
</P>
<P>
   Their objections are many and varied: that fact and artifact may
be closer than most empiricists are comfortable accepting. That
even pure observation has an agenda. That great empiricists have
rejected initial data on hunches, until their observations produced
more acceptable numbers. That scientists need pre-existing theory
and supposition even to ask the questions that will lead to data.
That the shape of a question produces the data that answer it.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of cultural constructionists similarly
maintains that Western science, whatever its technological
triumphs, is the product of a certain cultural moment and
represents no transcultural truths. But that notion, too, may beg
the question of just which forces construct culture. You may well
wonder whether any but a culture of high technology could have
produced the theories of cultural construction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it lies beyond all reasonable doubt that no single idea
has had a more profound or ubiquitous impact on what the human race
has become, or what it has worked upon the face of the planet, than
the vesting of authority in experiment. Anyone who looks can arrive
at no other conclusion. More urgent, at this moment, is the
question of what the greatest idea of the next thousand years will
have to be if we are to survive the power unleashed by the last.
</P>
<P>
   Many have noted, here at millennium's end, that our vast
increase in technical ability has not been accompanied by a
commensurate increase in our social or ethical maturity. A soul in
the year 1000, from any region of the globe, knew more about its
place in the grand scheme than a body in the year 2000 does.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Bacon was right: The program that began in doubt has
produced certainties beyond a medieval mind's wildest dreams. But
what was once a certainty now drifts in a gulf of doubt wider than
the millennium itself.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest idea of the last 1,000 years has granted us
ascendance over matter by asking not how things ought to be but how
things are. We have given ourselves to finding out not what we
should do with the world, but what we can make the world do. The
greatest idea of the next 1,000 years must make up the difference,
returning subtlety and richness and morals and lightness of spirit
to the long human experiment, if any part of it is to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Light falls into the eye, reflected from the object under
observation. But something else too must go out from the eye to the
things we observe.

U.S. and international, can be found at:
 &QL; http:dir.yahoo.com/science/museums_and_exhibits &QR;  and
 &QL; http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mwm/sci.html &QR; . The second site specializes
in hands-on museums and includes a survey of museums good for
family outings, as compiled by Spectrum, the journal of The
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Optical Society of America, dedicated to advancing the
science of light, is a good source of information about scientific
revolutions today.  &QL; http://www.osa.org &QR;  lists conferences and also
25 branches in the U.S., Japan and Canada. Phone 202-223-8130.
</P>
<P>
   3. Basic books: The late Thomas S. Kuhn wrote the classic, ``The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (third edition, 1996). Also
see Karl R. Pepper's``The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' and
Daniel J. Boorstin's ``The Discoverers.'' Boorstin has good
information on Arabic scientific discoveries.

consequences, not even at the cost of their own lives. Such
youngsters are to be feared; people who do not value their own
lives cannot value the lives of others. How adults can move from
fear of our youths to restoration of nurturing control is our
challenge. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   JOURNAL-MACEDONIA _ NEPROSTINO REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ A
fellow journalist bemoaned to me that the news these days is so
depressing, since so much of it centers on the Kosovo crisis. The
observation is heard frequently from readers: Why isn't there more
good news in the paper? My reply: Look closer. (Holmes, Cox News

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It was hard for Karen Weyhrich
to know what to say, what to do. She never faced anything like it,
never dreamed of anything like it at her high school in the late
'60s. ``The thing we were most afraid of was getting caught smoking
a cigarette,'' she recalled. She camped out at her church, St.
Frances Cabrini in Littleton, Colo., down the street from Columbine
High School, comforting hundreds of survivors. In the news,
Weyhrich said, we hear only about the gore. The evil. The kids gone
bad. She's seeing something else, something the news cameras don't
find as compelling. (McCarty, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Andrew Mackay must have a large
knot in his kilt located about where he sits down. Here's a guy who
writes a travel piece for the Glasgow (Scotland) Sunday Herald
taking cheap shots at Austin. And he comes from a country where the
people eat sheep guts on purpose? (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ Today's children, in growing numbers, are
experiencing a numbing of the sensibilities that make one human.
The resultant product is killers without consciences, many of whom
revel in the only power they perceive they own _ the power to
destroy. They willingly commit violence without thought of
consequences, not even at the cost of their own lives. Such
youngsters are to be feared; people who do not value their own
lives cannot value the lives of others. How adults can move from
fear of our youths to restoration of nurturing control is our
challenge. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FOOD-MONTICELLO _ CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ When Thomas Jefferson
returned from Paris after four years as envoy, his fellow Virginian
Patrick Henry scoffed that he was ``so Frenchified that he abjured
his native victuals.'' Though it has been two centuries, the
Jeffersons have not forgotten the slight. ``Patrick Henry,'' says
the man with the long strawberry locks and fair, freckled
complexion. ``I believe he liked to go out in the woods and eat
bear meat.''No one would ever accuse Rob Coles of abjuring his
native victuals. A fifth great-grandson of Jefferson, through his
daughte r Martha, the 47-year-old actor grew up eating hot dogs and
prefers Brunswick stew and cornbread to fancy continental cooking.
Like his famous forebear, whom he impersonates in 200 appearances a
year, Coles eats his vegetables. But there are limits to his
enthusiasm. ``Jefferson grew 16 varietes of peas,'' he says. ``I
love peas, but, I mean, come on.'' (Auchmutey, Cox News Service).

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Column: What $400 Will Buy In a PC System  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I have been asked to advise a school about
purchasing new computers. I know that E-Machines sells a system for
$399, but I recall also reading about another machine that goes for
$299. Unfortunately, I forgot its name and how to contact the
company. Any help would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer:  &LR; The company you're referring to is Microworkz
Computer, which is based in Seattle. Microworkz makes low-cost PCs
for the corporate market and recently announced it was getting into
the consumer space with a series of low-cost ``Webzter'' systems
designed for people who want a computer mainly for the Internet.
The low-end model, called the Webzter Jr., sells for $299. It
includes a 300-MHz Cyrix chip, 32 megabytes of memory, a
3.2-gigabyte hard drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't come with a floppy disk drive or a CD-ROM
drive, both of which are standard equipment on most PCs. They cost
an additional $99, which brings the price of the system up to $398.
</P>
<P>
   The $399 etower from Emachines features a 333-MHz Cyrix chip, 32
megs of memory, a 2.1-gig hard drive, a 56K modem and both CD-ROM
and floppy drives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither system comes with a monitor. So which one is a better
choice? Well, the Microworkz PC has a slightly bigger hard drive,
and it comes with Corel's WordPerfect software suite as well as a
year of free Internet access. But Emachines offers a faster chip as
well as a more powerful video subsystem, which means it should be
better at running video games.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the Emachines systems at Best Buy and other office
and computer stores. Microworkz is selling its systems directly
online at www.webzterpc.com.
</P>
<P>
   E-Mail Problems
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just installed the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 5,
which includes the latest version of Outlook Express. Now I can't
send e-mail. Every time I try, the computer attempts to use my old
GTE Internet account, which I canceled months ago when I switched
to Earthlink. Is there any way I can change the server on the
e-mail to Earthlink?
</P>
<P>
   A: There sure is. Open Outlook Express, then choose Accounts
from the Tools menu. Tab over to Mail and you should see all the
mail accounts that are set up for your system. If Earthlink is one
of them, select it and click the Set as Default button.
</P>
<P>
   If Earthlink isn't listed, you'll have to create a new mail
account. Click the Add button, then click Mail. The Internet
Connection Wizard will then guide you through the process. You'll
need the names of Earthlink's incoming and outgoing mail servers,
which Earthlink can provide.

   A Lost Address

<P>
   Q: How come in Microsoft Internet Explorer I don't have an
Address line? I had one before.
</P>
<P>
   A: Have you looked under your desk? Seriously though, you
probably disabled it inadvertently. To set things right, choose
Toolbars from Internet Explorer's View menu, then click Address
Bar. The Address Bar, which includes the space for Internet
addresses, should return to your desktop. Another way to do the
same thing is to right-click on any open space in the gray area at
the top of the screen and choose Address Bar.

   Y2K Worries
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Dell Optiplex GMT 5166 computer that I purchased in
February 1997. Am I likely to experience Year 2000 problems when
January 1 rolls around? If so, what can I do to prevent them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Computers built more than a year ago may have problems
recognizing the year 2000 _ which could lead to all kinds of
problems with software programs that take their cue from the
computer's clock. The two primary areas of concern are the BIOS,
which includes information the system needs when it starts up, and
the real-time-clock itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Web site (www.dell.com) lists Y2K certification status
for its computers, and it shows that yours needs a BIOS upgrade _
which you should be able to download from the Dell site. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   PC owners worried about Y2K can also put their minds at ease by
using a program such as Norton 2000 ($49.95) or McAfee 2000 Toolbox
($29.95). Both programs can diagnose _ and in some cases fix _
hardware problems, as well as deal with software applications that
could have Y2K glitches. Apple says its Macintoshes should not have
Y2K problems.
</P>

 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
If you create and delete a lot of files and install and remove a
lot of programs, chances are that after a while your PC will slow
down because information on your hard disk gets all out of order.
To remedy the situation, give your disk a tune-up with Disk
Defragmenter, a utility program that comes with Windows. You'll
find it by clicking the Start button, then going to
Programs/Accessories/System Tools.

PITCHERS BYTE ON TECHNOLOGY  
 COMPUTERS GROW POPULAR AS AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICHARD OBERT   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's more than two hours before game time, and
Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling sits at his locker
stall, a laptop computer at his fingertips, clicking onto his video
library.
</P>
<P>
   He watches himself pitch against select Diamondbacks from last
season. He checks the pitches that Tony Batista drove for a double
and Matt Williams lined into left field, and figures how to pitch
them differently for his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch film the four days between my starts,'' said
Schilling, a Shadow Mountain High graduate who has hooked in with
the latest technology in search of an edge. ``It's very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Bank One Ballpark, inside the home team's clubhouse,
relievers Gregg Olson and Darren Holmes input information into
their computer programs that they say keep themselves on top of the
game's most dangerous hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, before the Diamondbacks take the field, Olson calls
up the file on every hitter he might face.
</P>
<P>
   His post-game ritual includes logging in every pitch he made. He
brings his computer on the road. He uses it on the airplane, in his
hotel room, in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Olson keeps the pitch sequence, the location, how hard the ball
was hit, if it was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always kept notes,'' he said. ``I try to give myself an
idea of what I'm going to throw the batter. I'll try to pick up
what hitters do and how to pitch to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who was acquired from the New York Yankees in a trade
during the spring, said he always charted everything on paper.
Olson, he said, helped him put it on a computer. But Holmes
emphasizes the hitters and their tendencies, not so much his
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put down the situation I faced the hitter in, what the
count was, what was the score, the inning,'' Holmes said. ``I'll
see what the hitters did, if nobody was on base, if they were
patient. I'll see if they were swinging at a breaking ball in the
dirt. That's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he got into charting everything with paper and pen
from former Colorado Rockies teammate Dante Bichette. They played
on the same teams together between 1991 and '97. Holmes recalls how
Bichette had a chart of every pitcher he's ever had to face in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's such a great hitter,'' Holmes said. ``(San
Diego Padres outfielder) Tony Gwynn does the same thing. Great
hitters do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a constant chess match. And the catchers play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett said he'll go over lineups with the
pitchers every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``How guys swing the bat, who's hot, who's not, what kind of
success we've had against them,'' Stinnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the physical work for starters are the days between
their turns in the rotation. There is weight lifting and running.
Pitching coach Mark Connor said the second day after a start is
usually a throw day off the mound to get the feel for it and work
on mechanics and location and to keep their arm strength up.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is an exception, Connor said. Johnson throws on
the third day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just feels it has a better feel going into his next
start,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The starter usually takes it easy on the fourth day. Connor
said, for some pitchers, he has to constantly reassure their
confidence. For others, there's no need to soothe egos. For a few,
you leave them alone to their laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, the day you pitch might be the
easiest of them all, not pressure-wise, but physically,'' said
left-hander Brian Anderson, who made the transition from starter to
reliever in the spring. ``Those other four days are really used to
beat yourself up, keep yourself strong and in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   And when things are going good, that next start feels like
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when things are going bad, it feels like 10 days between
starts,'' Anderson said.
</P>

ALARMS RAISED THAT SOME ONLINE SHOPPING MAY NOT BE SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PAUL SHUKOVSKY   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Some of the little guys who sell on the Internet may
have just dealt e-commerce a setback.
</P>
<P>
   A computer technician at a Bellevue, Wash., Internet service
provider says he found evidence that consumers who give private
information such as credit card numbers to small, online stores
can't count on the information being kept safe from theft.
</P>
<P>
   The technician for Blarg! Online Services discovered that
``shopping cart'' software used by small online retailers often may
be improperly installed, making private consumer data accessible to
anyone on the Web who might misuse it. One Blarg! executive said
the problem could have a chilling effect on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows how many retail sites on the Worldwide Web
are not secure, Blarg! executive Marc Lewis said when technician
Joe Harris checked Monday, ``We were shocked; there were literally
thousands'' of sites that use shopping cart software and thus pose
a potential problem. Harris checked just a sample of the
approximately 4,250 sites using the software and found about 300
that were not secure.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Blarg! posted a warning on Bugtraq, an e-mail
security advisory that goes out to about 22,000 computer
professionals. The report was picked up by the Los Angeles Times on
Thursday and received wide national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also tried to contact Visa and MasterCard fraud protection
and they didn't seem very interested,'' said Lewis. ``Then we tried
contacting a few of the software providers for shopping cart
services and most of them did not return our calls or passed it off
to the Web site developer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is with the Web site developer, said Lewis. Often
small companies will hire a solo, free-lance developer to put
together a retail Web site. These Web developers may choose not to
follow the proper protocols for installing the software ``because
they want to get the site online and get their check,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amateur Web developers are not experienced enough to put
together a secure system,'' Lewis said. ``They are doing a great
disservice to their clients as well as the Internet community at
large. People won't buy things (online) anymore if they don't trust
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he knows of at least one large Internet service
provider that also provides shopping cart software that is
reviewing the security of all its sites. ``Now that people know
that the problem exists, they are working toward fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone else had gotten the data earlier, they could have
done bad things,'' said Lewis. ``They could have imprinted credit
cards and used them... and unfortunately, there wouldn't be too
many people to protect consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the giant Seattle-based online bookseller, on
Thursday pronounced its site ``absolutely safe. There have been no
breaches of security at Amazon and we would expect none,'' said
spokesman Bill Curry. ``Customer privacy and security is of
paramount importance to us and we have multiple layers of
protection to ensure the trust of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   While Curry would not reveal specifics about Amazon security, he
said the company does not use off-the-shelf shopping cart software.
</P>
<P>
   But Curry agreed that it is important that people feel
comfortable and safe when they shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where people shop on the Web, we want people to
have a good experience because it builds confidence in e-commerce
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about security, consumers spent $9 billion on
online purchases last year, according to figures cited by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Blarg! technician Harris discovered the problem during a
conference call with a Blarg! client and a shopping cart vendor,
said Lewis. When they asked Harris to perform an improper technical
step that would have made the consumer data easily available to
anyone, it ``alarmed him and he would not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Harris checked the Web to see how many other sites were out
there with improper security, he found thousands using the
software. Then, when he started sifting through some, he was able
to call up ``about 300 actual order files with customers' phone
numbers, home addresses and credit card numbers as well as what
they ordered,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris believes ``it's only the tip of the iceberg'' and there
are hundreds more out there with with improperly installed shopping
cart software. ``There are so many would-be Web site developers out
there who don't know how to set up an online store safely, but they
don't tell their clients,'' Harris said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing anyone wants to do is kill the golden goose of
Internet commerce. But this isn't good,'' he said. ``Full
disclosure is the best policy. If the site doesn't have a privacy
statement or if it doesn't clearly spell out how they secure their
data, then shop elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   So called shopping cart programs that are vulnerable to Web
thieves if improperly installed include those from Order Form,
Seaside Enterprises, QuikStore, PDGSoft and Mercantec.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sites didn't follow their guidelines. The (software)
vendors shouldn't be blamed,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach, S.C.-based QuikStore spokesman Dwight Vietzke said
only two of its estimated 700 users have reported problems with
shopping cart installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case when human error comes into play,'' Vietzke said.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping cart software, if installed incorrectly, saves
customer order information in an unsecured file, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers can download files containing customer names,
addresses, telephone and credit card numbers, expiration dates and
order data simply by using a search engine like Hotbot or AltaVista
and punching in a few simple search words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those files aren't meant to be accessed by a Web browser.
There is no reason for it to be listed there in the Web site
tree,'' Harris said. ``If it's not encrypted, it shouldn't be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Online stores usually retrieve order information using
encryption and other security measures, but the orders are
sometimes placed in a file on the Web site's computer system that
is easily accessible to an outside Web surfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most companies see the magnitude of this. They
have to take action very quickly,'' said Tara Lemmey, president of
San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit
group that promotes online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   When correctly installed, shopping cart software creates a file
for confidential information that is inaccessible to outsiders.

WEB SITES BUSY AS MANY SEEK OUTLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A family in Orem, Utah, sent out kind words and electronic
prayers. A free-lance Web designer in California set up an on-line
condolence board. Teen-agers in chat rooms alternated between
anger, despair, and tough-guy posturing. Harvard professor and
child psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint counseled parents and teens in a
live chat on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Web sites with the words ``trench coat'' in
their addresses were bombarded with hits Wednesday, despite the
fact that these sites had nothing to do with suspected killers in
Tuesday's Littleton, Colorado school rampage or with their group,
the Trench Coat Mafia. Rumors blanketed bulletin boards and dubious
news sites before being quickly swatted down by vigilant Web users.
And in Golden, Colorado, at the offices of the Jefferson County
Schools, an official worked to dispel such rumors and set up a
on-line resource center in the aftermath of the tragic shootings at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   As it has in other crises, the Internet was both a labyrinth of
misinformation about the shootings as well as a comfort zone for
concerned citizens. ``Please be careful about taking any
information about this event from unreliable Internet sources,''
warned John Adsit, who set up the site for the the county school
system. (The site is at
http://204.98.1.2/communications/crisis/crisis.html.) Adsit was
responding to a series of on-line hoaxes and rumors that emerged
instantaneously on-line, even as police and rescue workers were
still clearing the school building of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   On America Online, for instance, more than a hundred users
altered their member profiles to include references to the killings
and the Trench Coat group _ seeking to draw attention to
themselves. In addition, several news reports broke late Tuesday
about an AOL page alleged to have been posted by deceased gunman
Eric Harris, one of the two students who went on a wild shooting
rampage at the Colordo high school. The address for the AOL site,
which is posted on many electronic discussion groups, has been
removed from the server, but it is said to have featured pictures
of the kind of pipe bombs used in the Tuesday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working with the FBI since (Tuesday) night, and
our folks here pulled content to preserve some information they
thought was relevant to the case,'' said AOL spokesperson Kim
McCleery.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other site was pulled from the Internet Wednesday,
and others posted disclaimers. An adult entertainment site with an
address that seemed affiliated with the fringe group received so
many hits Wednesday it temporarily suspended its business and
posted this message: ``This site has nothing to do with the Trench
Coat Mafia...I'm just as disturbed and saddened as the rest of you
about the events that transpired in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Internet users aimed to inflame the tragedy even as it
was still unfolding. In the discussion group
alt.motorcycles.harley, a user who used the handle Queen Jeff
alleged that the attack had been unleashed by ``gay bikers''
seeking revenge. The user posted the message via the popular
on-line service Dejanews.com. ``We are a very democratic site, and
we don't alter content,'' a spokesperson for the New York-based
Deja News, Inc said ``It's unbiased _ that's the beauty of it. The
company does not control content. That is too Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hoaxers used the Internet to posture, other users
sought solace and comfort in discussion groups and live chat
forums. Marian McKenna Olivas, a California Web designer, set up a
condolence site on her business pages (see
http://www.wecanhelp.net/columbine.html). ``I lost my second child
(to meningitis, not violence) and was just moved by the sight of
parents waiting to hear from their children,'' she said. ``I
decided to set up a place where people could send sympathy.'' The
site was receiving 10 condolence letters an hour Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, various on-line sites offered cyber
counseling: At family.com, for instance, therapist Sylvia Rimm
posted a piece called ``What to Tell Your Kids.'' Poussaint fielded
questions on AOL; friends supported each other in such forums as
alt.teens.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere on-line was a mix of heartfelt emotion and false
bravado. ``I could make a bomb,'' boasted an AOL member in a chat
room. Recipes for explosives are, in fact, readily available
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   But for every braggart on-line Wednesday, there was a somber
counterpoint. This message appeared on Olivas' bulletin board
Thursday night: ``All I can say is I'm sorry. I live in Jonesboro
(Arkansas), and I went to the high school at Westside when last
year there was the shooting. I know how hard it is and I know how
hard it will end up being.'' The posting was signed, ``Sincerely,
Erin.''

INTEL PRODUCT MAY EASE COST OF HOME NETWORKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARIE J. BALBA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the prices of personal computers moving
toward affordable levels, more and more families are buying them,
creating a new breed of computer-dependent households in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The number of households with at least one or two computers has
soared. According to a 1998 Dataquest survey, 28 million households
will have at least two computers by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As people buy more computers, they consider buying additional
peripherals, installing separate phone lines for Internet
connections and subscribing to an additional Internet service
provider. To bypass these costly additions, many have considered
networking their home computers to share resources and peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Networking can be a costly endeavor, however. A traditional home
network involves such expenses as adapters, wires and cables
including installation, hubs (if necessary) and the time spent in
learning and implementing the features of the operating system.
There may be additional costs for adding network cards.
</P>
<P>
   To justify home networking, its costs must not exceed the cost
of buying duplicate resources, such as printers. If each home
computer user needs a printer, would it be more expensive to buy a
second printer or to install a network to share the printer with
another home computer? What technical know-how is needed to install
another printer vs. installing a network?
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, the world's top chip maker, says it
has a solution to the cost and hassle of traditional networking:
the Intel AnyPoint Home Network, a home networking system.
</P>
<P>
   The AnyPoint Home Network kit includes all the hardware and
software needed to connect two home computers and enable them to
share Internet access, share resources and communicate with each
other using any existing phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel says that any home computer user who can set up a new
printer or install a new piece of software can also install and use
the AnyPoint Home Network.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Intel network uses regular phone lines, it's not
supposed to compromise telephone service. In my case, though, I
could hear some background noise on the phone lines after I'd
connected the network.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it affected the telephone connection. After using the
AnyPoint Home Network, we tried to call our home number from a
cellular phone and found that our line was busy even after we had
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring files across the newly formed network was rather
quick, but it could be interrupted by such things as lifting the
telephone receiver. Printing to a remote printer was just as quick
as transferring a file across the network.
</P>
<P>
   When downloading files from the Internet, AnyPoint users can
choose to use either the server or the client. The server was
definitely faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although our modem speed is 56K bps, data transfer tops out at
32.3K bps in my neighborhood and sometimes fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to note that two people in our household can access
the Internet at the same time, thus overcoming a common problem
when one person needs the Net for business and another needs it for
school work.
</P>
<P>
   This product is not a bad buy for $189, which includes two
external units, cables to connect two computers and one or more
printers and Intel's networking software. It beats paying hundreds
for a traditional networking environment installed in a home
setting.
</P>
<P>
   I would advise you to be sure that your equipment can handle any
additional gadgets before you start any installation.
</P>
<P>
   Because this product is new on the market, I would also give it
a chance to grow and develop into something else. I am sure that
Intel is already looking into upgrading it.

THROW OUT THE WINDOWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am about to get my first PC, and it will have
Windows. I've read so much about Linux and how good it is. Would it
be possible to use it without removing Windows? Also, would you
recommend that a newcomer use Linux?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Gates' Nightmare
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NIGHTMARE: I'd recommend you using it, but not installing
it. That's what your good buddy at work is for. You know who I'm
talking about: the four-eyed geek in Information Systems who gives
``socially dysfunctional'' a whole new spin. Sure, you never spoke
to him before in your life, but you never really needed to, did
you?
</P>
<P>
   Linux makes strange bedfellows. And it gives Big Bill heartburn.
It's an incredibly stable, free operating system you can use
instead of Windows or DOS. Unfortunately, a new user like you is
going to need help from Geek-boy installing it. You really have to
know a lot about your hardware and what you want to do with it, and
newbies rarely know either.
</P>

   The good news is that if you struggle through the installation
and get everything to work correctly, you'll know one heck of a lot
about your computer, unlike the people who just wave a mouse at the
screen and expect things to magically work the right way every
time.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to dump Windows to use Linux, which is probably
the only thing keeping Bill's intestinal walls intact. You'll need
to divide your hard drive into a Windows partition and a Linux
partition, though, using either a utility that comes with Linux or
a separate package like Partition Magic. In the wrong hands, these
utilities can hammer everything on your drive, so let Geek-boy do
this step. At least you have somebody to blame when things go
horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of commercial programs designed to run under
Linux yet, so don't expect to be playing Half-Life any time soon.
You can find shareware out the wazoo, though, most of it free for
the downloading. There's even something called StarOffice, a free
suite of applications that will leave Microsoft Office owners
wondering what they paid all that money for.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing footsteps, Bill?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Would you please explain memory? If you have 64
MB of memory and use 32 MB researching something, but never shut
the computer completely off, the next time you use it, will you
only have the remaining 32MB available?
</P>

   DEAR MEM: I'm sorry, I've forgotten the question. They said the
ginkgo would help, but ... Well, maybe it was ginkgo. They might
have said ginseng. No, that wasn't it. Uhhhh. ... Gecko? Glocko?
Gorgonzola? Somebody help me out here.
</P>
<P>
   Ohhhh, that's right. I remember now. Think of RAM as a shelf.
You pull some stuff off a disk or create some new data and stick it
on the shelf so it's handy when you need to refer to it.
</P>
<P>
   A decent program cleans off the shelf when it finishes its work
so others can use it. Less-than-decent programs leave remnants that
take up valuable shelf space other programs are expecting to use,
bringing the whole thing crashing to ... I forgot where I was going
with this.
</P>

PUTTING YOUR VCR ON STEROIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason I dread leaving the office for a week is all the mail
that piles up in my absence. It's 90 percent trash, of course, even
the boxes filled with software and gadgets that arrive unbidden
from publicity-hungry entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The big black box from Replay Networks Inc. of Mountain View,
Calif., fell into that category. I thought one of our arts and
entertainment reporters might want to take it home and play with
their new ReplayTV device. But he didn't. So I ended up lugging it
home, hooking it up to my television, and chuckling with admiration
and delight. You've heard of VCR Plus? ReplayTV is VCR Squared.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a computer that thinks it's a VCR. Hook it up to
a TV antenna or cable, and ReplayTV will let you copy 10 to 28
hours of video. Unlike a VCR, which records on a long spool of
analog videotape, ReplayTV uses a data protocol known as MPEG-2 to
create compressed digital copies of TV shows and store them on a
built-in hard drive. In addition, ReplayTV connects by telephone
modem to a free on-line service that automatically updates your
local TV listings every day, storing the information in an
electronic channel guide. And, of course, the thing sets its own
internal clock; no blinking 12:00 here.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a device that makes TV time-shifting a trivial
exercise. Want to tape tonight's evening news? Just open the
channel guide with ReplayTV's remote control. Flip to the network
of your choice, and press the record button. You can even tell it
to record the same news show every night.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a computer in charge of the process allows even more
sophisticated controls. Say you want to watch the Flintstones but
don't know when it's on. Punch in the word ``Flintstones,'' and
ReplayTV will scan its database, find the program, and record it.
</P>
<P>
   Some genius at ReplayTV came up with the idea of a data buffer
that records a portion of any live show you might be watching. What
good is that? Two words: instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   I tried it during an Atlanta Braves baseball game. The batter
hit a pop fly to right field. I wanted to see it again. I pressed
the replay button, and instantly the TV image leapt backward in
time by a few seconds, rerunning the play. Meanwhile, the unit kept
recording the live TV feed. I could keep watching in replay mode,
seeing the rest of the game delayed by several seconds. Or I could
push a live-feed button and go back to watching the game in real
time.
</P>
<P>
   The video recording looked at least as good as videotape on my
ancient RCA set, and the sound quality, pumped through my home
stereo system, was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, ReplayTV isn't a complete substitute for a VCR.
It won't play rented movies. Equally important, its hard drive
eventually fills up, forcing you to record over shows. It's easy to
plug a VCR into the back and offload the stuff you want to keep
permanently. As for extra hard drive space, the designers had the
wit to include a couple of data ports that use Apple Computer
Inc.'s red-hot FireWire system. Replay Networks plans to sell
plug-and-play FireWire hard drives that would let a user boost
video storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the price, $700 for the basic 10-hour unit, up to
$1,500 for a model that can store 28 hours of video. This is much
too high. Then again, it's bound to get cheaper. After all,
ReplayTV is a computer, and we all know what's been happening to
computer prices lately. In a year or so, one of the basic units
could well be in the $350-$400 range.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing I'd like to see is a hookup with Microsoft Corp.,
whose superb WebTV device still hasn't achieved the success it
deserves. WebTV has full Internet access, and a slick
picture-in-picture feature that would look great on a ReplayTV
unit. Merge the two technologies in a cheap consumer device and
you'd have the hottest home electronics product since the Sony
Playstation. I'd love to find a box like that waiting after my next
road trip.

IN HP'S CASE, SPEED THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With personal computer prices crashing, companies like Hewlett
Packard are scrambling at the high end.
</P>
<P>
   These PC makers are attempting to build powerful systems, loaded
with features, at a price point high enough to provide a healthy
profit margin. A major weapon for the computer companies is Intel's
new Pentium III microprocessor, a chip that can command a
significant premium because it is the latest and fastest from
chipmaker Intel .
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, of course, Intel created a different kind of
stir with its Pentium III. Every Pentium III chip contains a unique
serial number that can be used to track the movements of consumers
on the Internet. As a result, some privacy groups, including the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, have called for a boycott of
this chip.
</P>
<P>
   But does it make sense to boycott Intel's latest and greatest?
Eager to find out, and curious about what it would be like to
``drive'' the world's fastest PC, I asked Hewlett Packard to lend
me its top-of-the-line home computer, the HP Pavilion 8490.
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8490 is an imposing machine. The system comes with
a Pentium III microprocessor screaming along at 500 Mhz. (That's
more than 100 times faster than the original IBM PC, which had a
clock speed of just 4.77 Mhz.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion 8490 comes with not one, but two optical drives.
One is a CDROM/DVD drive that can play movies directly from an
optical disc onto the computer's screen. You can buy DVD movies in
the stores now for less than $15; there are literally hundreds of
titles. The second optical drive is a compact disc recorder (CD-R).
Black CDs can be purchased for roughly $2 each at Staples and most
computer supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives means that it's easy to copy from one CD to another.
In fact, the HP Pavilion comes with disc-copying software
pre-installed. (Unfortunately, you can't copy DVD discs, because
they store data in the a different format.)
</P>
<P>
   The HP Pavilion also comes with a fancy keyboard that includes
an extra row of buttons for playing audio CDs. There is also a big
volume control, and buttons that are supposed to automatically
launch your favorite application programs, sort of like station
presets that you might see on a car stereo.
</P>
<P>
   This whole package costs roughly $2,500 for the basic
configuration. That includes 128MB of RAM, a 17.9GB hard drive, and
a fax modem. Throw in another $150 and HP will install a Diamond
Viper 550 video card with 16 megabytes of video RAM,
high-performance 3D graphics, and a rock-solid refresh. (The
Pavilion's built-in video is an 8MB ATI Rage, which flickered
somewhat on my monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need a monitor. HP sells a 15-inch multimedia
monitor (which means it has a set of built-in speakers) for $299
and a 17-inch monitor for $449.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the whole package work together?
</P>
<P>
   Quite well. As long as Microsoft's software is cooperative. I
was amazed by how much faster programs like Outlook Express and
Internet Explorer ran on the 500 Mhz Pentium III. I had thought
that the main factor limiting these programs was the speed of my
Internet connection, which is a fairly zippy cable modem from
MediaOne. But running on the Pentium III, Web pages just snapped
into place. The browser's ``Back'' button gave me instantaneous
satisfaction. Even mundane activities like hitting the ``Page Up''
and ``Page Down'' keys were noticeably faster. The increased speed
made the computer more enjoyable to use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, faster doesn't mean more reliable. I consistently
had problems with drivers and other system software. Blue screens
would appear with writing on them, telling me that an illegal
operation had occurred. Sometimes the computer would just freeze up
for no apparent reason at all. Thankfully, the computer also boots
fast!
</P>
<P>
   Some of the built-in software didn't work properly, either. The
Pavilion comes with Symantec Fax Starter Edition, but it never
worked for me. I ended up installing WinFax instead. The special
``media'' buttons on the HP keyboard stopped working when I
installed Internet Explorer 5. The computer that I got came with
the Viper 550 video card, but the DVD playing software for the
built-in ATI video system. HP says that this was a mistake made
with my particular machine. Still, the only way that I could play a
DVD was by removing the Viper card and using the built-in video.
</P>
<P>
   I was also annoyed by a high-pitched chattering that accompanied
certain kinds of screen operations, such as moving a window or
redrawing a page of text. The chattering sounds a lot like the old
Apollo workstations from the early 1980s. I believe that it comes
from the power supply when it's called upon to supply a little
extra juice for transferring images to and from the screen. HP told
me that I could make the noise go away by changing a jumper on the
inside of the computer. I changed the jumper, but the noise
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ultra-fast speed, the Pentium III also brings a whole
bunch of new instructions that software vendors can use in their
products. Dragon Systems, for instance, has a version of its speech
recognition software that uses the special Pentium III instructions
to achieve faster recognition and shorter training times than was
with previous microprocessors. I tried a beta release of the
program and was amazed by the improvements _ you can now train
Dragon in just 3 minutes, as opposed to half an hour. Dragon's
product is a real reason to purchase the Pentium III, rather than
the competing chips from AMD and other vendors that are nearly as
fast but much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the privacy-shattering Pentium III goes, I must have
visited more than 100 Web sites during the time that I've been
testing the machine. Not one of them asked to download an applet
that could read the processor serial number (PSN).
</P>
<P>
   And why would they? Pentium IIIs are in the vast minority on the
Internet today. Why would any Web site restrict an area so that the
majority of Internet users couldn't access it?
</P>
<P>
   Overall, HP's Pavilion is great system if you want to watch
movies, master compact discs, or if you just need to have the
zippiest computer on the block and you are willing to pay for it.
Configured as it is, this is a computer that will last for several
years without the need to upgrade. But if you do decide to get it ,
you're probably better off buying your own 17-inch monitor for $300
and hooking the computer up to your stereo system. You'll get
better sound, and save money as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ James S. Gilmore III, the governor of
Virginia, stood on the steps of the Netscape Communications Corp.'s
headquarters last Tuesday and smiled in the morning sun. The man
Virginians know as the ``Internet Governor'' was 3,000 miles from
his constituents but he insisted he felt at home in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak their language,'' Gilmore said. ``We're on line
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the governor correctly interpreted the ties remains to
be seen. One thing is certain: as the worlds of politics and high
technology increasingly come together, Gilmore is a man who would
like to be at the nexus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Virginia's high-technology economy has surged
and Gilmore, a Republican, has made Internet policy central to his
18-month stint in office.
</P>
<P>
   He helped create and signed what supporters deemed the nation's
first comprehensive set of state Internet laws, created the first
state technology cabinet post, made fast ties with Virginia's
technology industry and aggressively recruited technology companies
to consider making Virginia their home.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is seeking to parlay his efforts into a national role.
Last December, he was named to a federal commission charged with
studying Internet tax issues, and he hopes the Internet policies
pioneered in Virginia will be used as a blueprint by other states.
</P>
<P>
   His three-day tour of California last week represented a
coming-out party of sorts, an effort to sell himself and Virginia
at ground zero of the digital revolution. He said he felt a warm
reception from executives at the likes of Netscape, Oracle and
Cisco Systems. But it was also clear that Gilmore's portrayal of
Virginia as the ``Internet state'' did not overly impress the
industry titans in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes here trying to get a little Silicon Valley
dust on their shoes,'' said Netscape's chief executive, James L.
Barksdale, during his meeting with the governor, though not
appearing to refer to the governor personally.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what made the visit to Netscape particularly
symbolic is that Netscape recently was purchased by America Online,
the brightest jewel in Virginia's high-technology crown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to America Online, Virginia is home to MCI Worldcom
and one of its subsidiaries, Uunet, as well as Psinet. Gilmore is
fond of saying that thanks to the presence of those companies _
Uunet and PSInet are Internet service providers _ 50 percent of all
Internet traffic goes through Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Virginia's high-technology economy has been on a
tear. Over the last five years, the technology sector has generated
more than 60 percent of the growth in the state's economy,
according to the governor's office. The office also projected that
the number of technology businesses in Virginia would grow to 5,300
by 2002, up from 3,400 now.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore says he has never called himself ``the Internet
Governor,'' but he does not mind the title a bit. ``If somebody
wants to refer to me as that, I won't run from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To his detractors, Gilmore is a Johnny-come-lately who has tried
to transform himself into a ``governor.com.'' Critics say he hardly
uttered a word about technology until after he became gvernor in
1997 and has since sought to take credit for Virginia's
high-technology growth. They point out that Gilmore's gubernatorial
opponent, Donald S. Beyer Jr., was much more closely tied to
northern Virginia's technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech economy has been booming for years,'' said
Kenneth R. Plum, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia.
``He's gotten on board and is riding it for all it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Plum and other critics do not dispute that Gilmore and
the Internet industry have become fast friends in the intervening
months. Many in the industry say the gvernor is one of the few
politicians who has made a truly concerted effort to understand
their new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's recognized what the Internet is, how it got there and
what impact it can have'' said Stephen M. Case, the chief executive
of America Online, adding that Gilmore's efforts in Virginia are
being emulated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a recognition this is a launching pad,'' Case said.
``The policies set in Virginia could become a blueprint.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not hurt the governor's standing among the state's
technology companies that he has offered tax breaks to support
their growth. For example, he engineered an $18 million tax break
for America Online as an incentive for the company to build a new
data center in Prince William County.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also credit Gilmore with being the first governor in
the nation to create a technology cabinet post (although Democratic
critics in the state contend they had the idea first). The
secretary of technology post is held by Donald W. Upson, a former
marketing executive, who is charged with attracting high-technology
business to Virginia and exploring how the state can use
information technology internally.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the work of a state commission created by Gilmore, he
signed the nation's most broad-based state Internet laws last
month, giving force to seven bills called the Internet Policy Act.
Among other things, the act has provisions to protect consumer
privacy, make it a crime to use encryption for criminal activity
and make it a criminal offense to send unsolicited commercial
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other states are considering Internet-related laws, and
some are patterning them after the work of Virginia, said Paul
Russinoff, state policy counsel for the Internet Alliance, an
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a fan of heavy regulation on the Internet, you may
find the Virginia act unsatisfying, but it is one of the few policy
initiatives I've seen at a state level that takes a realistic
approach,'' Russinoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying there aren't other `Internet governors' out
there,'' he added. ``But Governor Gilmore is absolutely focused on
the medium.''

NEW RATINGS GIVE LYCOS A REASON TO CELEBRATE  
 ANTI-VIRUS COMPANIES SOUND A NEW ALARM  
 TAKING TO THE ROAD WITH A NEW INTERNET PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Internet business, the top of the heap is a very unsteady
place. And nobody knows that better than Bob Davis, chief executive
of Lycos Network Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Media Metrix, which measures Web traffic, announced
that in March the Lycos network of 11 sites, including the search
service Lycos.com, surpassed Yahoo in audience reach for the first
time. That means that more people visited a Lycos site in March
than a Yahoo site _ 31.9 million people vs. 31.3 million. Lycos,
however, is still outranked by America Online and Microsoft sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo asserted that its figures did not include
Broadcast.com or Geocities, which the company is acquiring. In the
case of Lycos, however, the numbers do reflect its acquisition of
Wired Digital, which it announced plans to acquire last fall. That
deal has not officially closed, though Wired Digital has already
become part of the Lycos Network, which is based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis is celebrating, if only for the moment. ``What the
ratings say is that today we've got the No. 1 spot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first; it's never happened where Yahoo hasn't been
the dominant one,'' Davis said. ``It shows there's still
competition on the Web.'' He attributes Lycos' rise to its focus on
what he calls ``organic applications,'' like Tripod, an online
community site that the company acquired last year, and other
projects that encourage communications among Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Lycos announcement of taking first place is
premature, or even inaccurate, Davis has other reasons to
celebrate. In February, Lycos struck a deal to merge with USA
Networks, the media and electronic-commerce company controlled by
Barry Diller. Under that agreement, Lycos, along with Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch, will become USA/Lycos Interactive Network.

   Anti-Virus Companies Sound a New Alarm
</P>
<P>
   When the clock strikes midnight on Monday, it will set off a
nasty version of a computer virus known as CIH 1.2 that is capable
of deleting part of the contents of hard drives and preventing
computers from booting up.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks there has been an outbreak of a different
sort: Various makers of anti-virus programs have sent out news
releases warning of the virus and touting their own software for
use as a preventive measure. Several anti-virus companies, like
Network Associates Inc. and Computer Associates International Inc.,
said they were offering free CIH virus patches for download from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   All this simply underscores a constant tension in the anti-virus
community, which on the one hand exists to eradicate viruses and on
the other thrives on their existence and benefits from copious
press about the potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of CIH, the companies insist they are not blowing
the potential dangers out of proportion. Variants of the CIH virus
attack computers on the 26th of each month, but the one programmed
for Monday is considered the most virulent strain; it is known as
the ``Chernobyl virus'' because it hits on the anniversary of the
meltdown of the nuclear reactor in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most prevalent file virus in the wild,'' said Sal
Viveros, marketing manager for Network Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The CIH attacks files that can be opened in Windows 98 and
Windows 95, including Word and Excel files. The virus can be passed
by e-mail, floppy disk or other means, but is easily detected and
destroyed by most anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   Previous incarnations of the CIH virus have not proved as
harmful as computer security experts warned at the time. Still,
makers of anti-virus software are not out of line in bringing
attention to this latest strain, said Kathy Fithen, manager of the
CERT Coordination Center, a federally financed computer-virus
response team at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hysteria,'' she said. ``What they are doing is
alerting customers that they need to update software. And that's
good.''

   He is flush from the recent initial public offering of
iVillage.com, in which he got insider stock as a participant in the
Web site's Armchair Millionaire section. Now, Lewis Schiff, a New
York-based Internet marketer, is touting his latest venture,
Invest-o-rama, an online listing of some 10,000
financial-information sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff recently bought into Invest-o-rama, which was started
four years ago by Douglas Gerlach, and hopes to use the billboard
to attract other investors to help expand the site.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff paid $20,000 for a 14-foot-by-48-foot billboard ad, which
went up on April 15 and is strategically placed along Silicon
Valley's most traveled artery, Highway 101.

   LOS ANGELES _ Tax time was crunch time for the World Wide Web
site of Intuit Inc., the supplier of personal finance software.
Traffic shot up to as much as 20 times its levels the rest of year,
as customers downloaded the latest revisions to Intuit's Turbotax
tax preparation program.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike tax seasons past, this time Intuit had the help of
Sandpiper Networks Inc., a start-up company that has developed a
way to speed the delivery of information on the Web. ``Customers
got it faster than they would have with us,'' said Rick Parkinson,
director of the planning and delivery group at Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper and a rival start-up company, Akamai Technologies
Inc., are pioneering a way to distribute material over the Internet
that avoids much of the congestion that can turn the World Wide Web
into the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sandpiper is expected to announce that America
Online, the largest provider of Internet access, has made a small
investment in the company and will incorporate Sandpiper's
technology into its network.
</P>
<P>
   The Inktomi Corp., a supplier of Internet software is expected
to invest in the start-up company along with two Sandpiper
customers _ the Times Mirror Corp. and NBC. Sandpiper is raising a
total of $21.5 million in this, its second round of raising venture
capital, with each of the corporate partners believed to be putting
in $2 million to $3 million and the rest coming from venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, meanwhile, recently scored a coup of its own, hiring as
its president and chief executive George H. Conrades, formerly
president of the GTE Corp.'s BBN unit and before that a top
executive at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   As more corporations turn to the Web for marketing and sales,
long waits on the Internet are becoming bad for business. While the
companies can improve service somewhat by buying more powerful
computers for their Web sites, they have less control over the
traffic jams that can develop between their sites and the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since nobody controls the Internet, how do you insure quality
of service?'' said Scott Yara, vice president for marketing at
Sandpiper, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The answer proposed by both Sandpiper and Akamai is to
distribute the contents of a Web site to server computers dispersed
throughout the Internet, so that information does not always have
to wend its way through the network from one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole name of the game here is to push content to the edge
of the Internet, very, very close to the end user,'' said David
Goodtree, vice president for marketing at Akamai, which is based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One use of such a service would be to help with big Web events
that could bring the Internet to its knees. The Los Angeles Times,
owned by Times Mirror, used Sandpiper to help cope with the online
demand for the Starr Report last year and for the newspaper's
coverage of the Academy Awards in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandpiper and Akamai contend, and some analysts agree, that
distribution of Web content will eventually be a full-time
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar technique, known as caching, is already in
use. If, for example, an Internet service provider in Los Angeles
finds heavy demand among its customers for a Web page based in New
York, it will create a local copy of the page in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual producer of the Web page in New York has no
control over this cache, and thus no way of preventing the
information on it from becoming outdated. Moreover, the producer of
the Web page usually does not know how many visits or ``hits'' the
copy on the cache receives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai sell their service directly to the Web
content providers, automatically distributing the content to
servers, updating the material as necessary and keeping track of
the number of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper was founded three years ago by David Farber and Andrew
D. Swart, software experts who had worked for Interactive Systems,
a Unix company. Leo S. Spiegel, whom they recruited to be
president, started a computer company while still in college. That
company, LAN Systems, was sold to the Intel Corp. and R.R. Donnelly
&AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which says its name means ``intelligent, clever and
cool'' in Hawaiian, grew out of a math class at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the MIT researcher known as the father of the
Web, suggested to Tom Leighton, a professor of applied mathematics,
that ``load balancing'' on the Internet would be a good problem for
his class to tackle. The classwork led to algorithms that are used
by Akamai, which was founded by Leighton and a graduate student,
Danny Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai, which is only now beginning commercial service, says
that customers for its trial service included five of the 10 most
popular Web sites. But Goodtree would not identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai seems to have a more sophisticated approach, but
Sandpiper has the advantage of being first, said Peter Christy,
principal at Collaborative Research, a market research firm in Los
Altos, Calif. Akamai also has deployed 400 servers, compared with
only 32 for Sandpiper. ``We could handle the load today of 15
Yahoos and the top 20 Web sites combined,'' Goodtree said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal with America Online and Inktomi could help change
that. Inktomi already provides more than 300 cache servers to
America Online, and Sandpiper will now be able to use those, as
well as Inktomi servers in other networks. ``It really expands our
footprint,'' Spiegel said of Sandpiper (which calls its service
Footprint).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for the companies, though, might not be
each other but new entrants expected in the market. Julian of
Forrester said these could include big computer service providers
like IBM and Electronic Data Systems as well as companies like
Exodus Communications that provide computer sites used to host Web
pages. Even Intel announced last week that it would enter the
business of providing servers to host Web pages. But some of these
companies might decide to ally themselves with Sandpiper or Akamai
rather than compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge could be persuading companies to entrust
distribution of Web pages to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson of Intuit, for instance, said it made sense to use
Sandpiper to save Intuit from having to invest in enough capacity
to handle the rare peak demand. But at times of normal demand,
Intuit prefers to run its Web site by itself, to guard its
competitive information. ``You give up a little bit of control
every time you give something to someone else,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lemont Southworth, technology manager for latimes.com, said
another problem was that Sandpiper's system cannot handle the
customized advertisements that many Web sites offer.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible threat is that if technologies like high-speed
cable modems and optical fiber can sufficiently reduce congestion,
there would be less need to store Web pages close to users.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies insist that cable modems, by increasing the
flow of information between users' computers and Internet sites,
will only increase the strain on Web site providers, much as
widening freeway on-ramps can worsen congestion on the freeway
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's the next evolution of the Internet,''
Spiegel said.

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ Ask Jon Rubinstein, the man in charge of
hardware at Apple Computer Inc., about the supposedly imminent
``post-PC era,'' and he answers like someone who works for
Microsoft or Intel, the twin pillars of the personal-computer
industry, rather than for this quirky California computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   For though it has become fashionable to say that the PC era is
waning and the future of computing lies in a burgeoning assortment
of wired and wireless hand-held consumer-electronics gizmos,
Rubinstein is still a true believer in powerful, full-featured
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there will be appliances out there, but if you look at
the PC it's still in its infancy,'' Rubinstein said. ``I keep
hearing that the PC is dead, but when I look at the next couple of
years, that's not what I see at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer, which itself was all but given up for dead a few
years ago, has had a remarkable resurrection. Eleven days ago, the
company exceeded analysts' estimates in reporting its sixth
consecutive profitable quarter. For the last two quarters, it has
held more than 12 percent of the retail and mail-order PC market.
And the company is once again one of the top five makers of
personal computers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while manufacturers on the Microsoft-Intel side of the
PC industry are being pinched by prices that are spiraling below
$500 with no end in sight, Apple, the ``Think Different'' company,
is busily selling a line of desktop computers whose price begins at
$1,500, helping raise Apple's profit margin more than a point from
last year, to 26.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple understands simplicity, branding and style,'' said
Charles Wolf, a Wall Street analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. ``It's
amazing that nobody on the PC side gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, Apple's charismatic co-founder, Steve
Jobs, gets much of the public credit for what is certainly one of
the most remarkable turnarounds in U.S. corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret to Jobs' successful return to Apple is the small
manufacturing and design team and the highly disciplined
engineering process that Rubinstein has quietly put in place during
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is this team that is responsible for the popular iMac
machines that Apple began shipping last August, for the critically
acclaimed G3 desktop and portable machines that updated Apple's
moribund Macintosh and Powerbook lines, and for a new low-priced
portable to be introduced in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apple you and I knew two years ago is dead,'' said Andrew
Gore, editor in chief of Macworld, the trade magazine that tracks
Apple more closely than any other publication. ``It's a completely
different company. It's unfortunate that Apple has chosen to keep
Jon Rubinstein under wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with Rubinstein, 42, know him as someone who has
spent his entire career evolving with the computer industry. After
earning bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering
at Cornell University, and a master's in computer science from
Colorado State University, he moved to California, where he became
a computer work-station designer for Hewlett-Packard before joining
Ardent, a start-up supercomputer company.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he caught on with Next Computer, the company Jobs
founded in 1986 after being forced out at Apple. Rubinstein ran
Next's hardware engineering until the company shifted to an
all-software approach. He left to set up an independent
hardware-design firm that Rubinstein subsequently sold to Motorola
in 1996 _ part of the proceeds of which he planned to spend on
wandering the world.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into his sojourn, Rubinstein was touring Scotland
when a phone call caught up with him. It was from Gilbert Amelio,
who had recently been brought in as the chairman of Apple. Apple
had run up losses in 1996 and 1997 totaling $1.86 billion and was
being counted out of the game by virtually everyone in the
personal-computer industry. But offered the job of running Apple's
hardware operations, Rubinstein agreed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rubinstein accepted so readily that Amelio later
wondered in his book ``On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple''
whether he had been the victim of a palace coup. It was on the
advice of Jobs that Amelio hired not only Rubinstein but also Avi
Tevanian, who was then head of software at Next and now has that
job at Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was all part of a secret plan by Jobs to recapture
Apple, Amelio wondered in print, after he had been ousted by a
board that brought Jobs back to run the company temporarily _ an
arrangement that has continued for 20 months and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be news to me,'' Rubinstein said of the conspiracy
theory. He came to Apple, he said, because he saw himself primarily
as a desktop-computer designer and he thought that the company,
even in its deepest crises, was the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a no-brainer,'' he recalled. ``Apple was the last
innovative high-volume computer maker in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From a highly disorganized company where as many as four
independent engineering teams might work simultaneously to design
the same computer, Apple is now working on a dozen projects using
cooperating, interdisciplinary teams _ using what Rubinstein refers
to as a ``fast-track design.'' The approach puts many parts of the
design process in parallel, speeding the time to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as having a bag of technology tricks, and at
the appropriate time I bring them out and put them in our
products,'' he said. ``And we have more in our bag of tricks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Colleagues say that Rubinstein is obsessive about checklists,
which have now been built into every facet of Apple's engineering
system.
</P>
<P>
   And when things are not caught by the checklists, Apple's
designers take a SWAT-team approach to fixing bugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the company's innovative iMac computer first shipped last
year, Rubinstein attended a midnight store-opening celebration in
Palo Alto. By the next morning, after hearing consumer complaints
at the store and on Macintosh enthusiasts' Web sites, he knew that
the machine had some problems _ the worst being that the computer
did not work with a newly designed Epson printer.
</P>
<P>
   A software patch was created in a matter of days and widely
distributed with the aid of the Internet, sidestepping a
potentially serious public-relations stumble for the new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson episode could have been much worse. Several years
before Rubinstein's arrival, a few of the company's new Powerbook
portable machines actually caught fire while in use. The machine
had to be withdrawn from the market, and for more than a quarter
Apple went without revenue from an important part of its product
line.
</P>
<P>
   If Rubinstein's team is more efficient than Apple's earlier
hardware groups, it is also a remarkably more insular and
frequently secretive organization _ perhaps the clearest break from
the former Apple Computer, which was so porous that it was known in
some circles as ``a ship that leaks from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among the Valley's digerati the company is now referred
to as ``Jobs &AMP; Company,'' and Apple has adopted an almost
Japanese-style adherence to the ideal of the unified team.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubinstein dismisses the popular notion that Jobs can act as
a capricious tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working with Steve,'' he said. ``We make a good team,
and he raises the bar on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while working to uphold Jobs' exacting standards, Rubinstein
may provide an important buffer between Jobs and the rest of the
company. ``He is absolutely unflappable,'' said Glen Miranker,
Rubinstein's vice president for desktop systems. ``It's a
particular value in the present environment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those outside Apple who are skeptical about the
company's resurgence. They note that with the exception of the
iMac, which has found a market in both first-time computer users
and former owners of Microsoft-Intel PCs, Apple is still selling to
a core group of customers devoted to the Apple Macintosh legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them being strong for a while and then slowly fading,''
said Seymour Merrin, a computer industry consultant at Merrin
Information Services in Palo Alto. ``They can't afford the
development spending that an Intel can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple executives acknowledge that the company has made
little headway in corporate markets recently.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, despite the company's contention that thousands of new
software applications have been introduced for Apple machines,
companies like Nisus Software, which develops applications for the
Macintosh and benefited from the industry innovation the Macintosh
stimulated during the 1980s and early 1990s, say they have yet to
feel the impact of the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   And others wonder whether the introduction of two successful
computers under Rubinstein _ the iMac and the G3 desktop line _
necessarily mean Apple can sustain its comeback in the highly
volatile PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at this as pulling a rabbit out of the hat,''
Rubinstein said. ``Our strategy has a lot of dimension, from
industrial design to performance to functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim will be put to the test late this spring or early
summer when Apple introduces its long-awaited entry into the
consumer market for portable computers, priced in the $1,000 to
$1,500 range.
</P>
<P>
   With a sleek, gray translucent case and clamshell shape,
according to those who have seen it, the computer will be as
radical an industrial design departure from the standard boxy
notebooks as the iMac was from the conventional desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the machine _ which Jobs has reportedly insisted will
weigh less than 5 pounds and have a large flat-panel display _ will
be a runaway hit like the iMac is hard to predict. Though certainly
another example of Jobs' think-different philosophy, it will appear
while much of the rest of the PC industry is focusing on so-called
subnotebooks, which weigh less than 4 pounds and are the rage among
the computer road-warrior set.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein is confident the machine will be a hit, in part
because it will incorporate features from the company's heavier
laptops, like long battery life and disk-drive bays for floppies,
CD-ROMs or DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is waiting to see what we do next,'' he said. ``I
heard that some of them are holding back their products and saying,
`I don't want to be iMac'd.'''

Net brings campaigns, activism to masses 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If an e-mail titled ``Gas Out'' hasn't arrived
in your inbox yet, there's a good chance you'll receive a copy of
it in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail, which asks that all drivers avoid buying gas for one
day (April 30) in order to cripple ``the so-called oil cartel'' and
reduce gas prices, sounds like it will be about as effective as
changing the channel during a Nike commercial in an effort to
eliminate sweatshop working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more interesting than the message is the medium. The
anonymous originators of ``Gas Out'' have created a phenomenon by
using e-mail for this grass-roots protest. Some, however, would
call it an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Political action is a logical progression for the Internet,
which has brought us instant messaging, electronic commerce and
CD-quality music for the downloading. Social activism has always
strived for getting a message to the masses and what better, more
efficient way is there than e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots campaigns on the Internet have been around since
before the Web grew to prominence. Like-minded folks would meet in
newsgroups and start mail-in campaigns against companies or
organizations. In some cases, fan groups organized e-mail campaigns
to save their favorite TV shows. When Comedy Central canceled
``Mystery Science Theater 3000,'' for instance, a group of fans
organized their protest efforts on alt.fan.mst3k and used e-mail to
spread the call.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, online groups have gained attention by protesting a
new user identification feature in Intel Corp.'s Pentium III
processor (Intel has since decided to add an option for disabling
the feature), fighting unsolicited commercial e-mail (the Forum for
Responsible and Ethical E-mail has worked with legislators here on
anti-spam legislation), and most importantly, fighting to save
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' Though that campaign failed, CBS is
bringing the good doctor back in a series of TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Expect a flurry of activity on the Web next year as
the 2000 campaigns get into full swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the next election cycle spins faster, the Internet will play
a much larger role than it did as an embryonic public medium in
1996. Aristotle Publishing Inc., a San Francisco-based political
software company, said it estimates presidential and congressional
candidates will spend at least $20 million in Internet banner
advertisements next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jay McAniff, a spokesman for Aristotle, said the company is
reaching the very people on the Internet they hope will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a segment of the population that's
typically more educated, more affluent and more likely to vote,''
he said. ``This political cycle, we expect online activity will
mimic the overwhelming response to people for electronic commerce
last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it is such a great match for political campaigns is
because the Internet itself lends itself to public discourse,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be able to find information given by candidates on
official Web sites, but will just as likely be able to find things
some politicians may not want you to see _ their voting records,
finances and any messages anyone on their staff has ever posted to
a newsgroup, courtesy of Deja News, which catalogs newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Be it through e-mail protest or an online political pep rally,
Internet activism and campaigning is turning the Web into a global
town-hall meeting _ one with nearly unlimited boundaries and
unlimited opportunity to make the public's voice heard.

<P>
   This month considers designing and ordering note cards, finding
rare wine and registering your car.
</P>
<P>
   For note card ordering, the Web won. Yahoo! used www.iprint.com
and paid $74.99 for 200 cards, plus $9 to get them delivered in two
days. It took 15 minutes to pick and order, and two days to get
them. The traditional, card store way cost more ($105.50 for 200
cards delivered in two days) and took longer (one hour in the
store.)
</P>
<P>
   The wine hunt was a draw. It was shorter to search online than
in stores, but both proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Car registration was easier online. It took less than one minute
to download and print the form vs. 28 minutes in line at the
registration office.
</P>
<P>
   Movies, and nothing but
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered who played the vaguely familiar crew-cut guy who
testifies in the courtroom scene in ``A Few Good Men,'' but you
don't want to drop the four bucks to rent it?
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's help online.
</P>
<P>
   www.imdb.com is like having direct access to someone who does
nothing but eat and sleep movies. The site lists about 2.3 million
film entries, including information about actors, directors,
writers, composers, cinematographers, editors, production
designers, costumers and production designers.
</P>
<P>
   You can also search for information about one actor. The Noah
Wyle freaks out there might already know that the ``ER'' star
played Cpl. Jeffrey Barnes in ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Internet Movie Database, you can find out on which
popular TV series Wyle made a guest appearance, and in which movie
he also worked as associate producer.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held DVD player on way
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic is coming out with a hand-held version of the DVD
player.
</P>
<P>
   For now, digital video discs mostly are used to store movies.
Panasonic's new hand-held model is called the DVD-L50 PalmTheater.
</P>
<P>
   It retails for $1,099 and is expected to be on the market by
May.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized model weighs about 2.5 pounds, including the
battery. It is 5.51 inches by 5.96 inches and is less than 2 inches
thick. The 5-inch LCD monitor comes with 280,000-pixel resolution.

   In the May issue of Wired magazine, filmmaker George Lucas talks
about his craft and the state of digital filmmaking. The mastermind
behind the ``Star Wars'' trilogy discusses how he used largely
digital editing in his latest addition to the series. He says 95
percent of ``The Phantom Menace'' was created on computer, for
example. But Lucas added that all the digital gadgetry in the world
wouldn't necessarily make his film a success. Only good
storytelling can do that. ``Astounding you is not my job,'' said
Lucas. ``My job is to tell a story.'' On CD-ROM

   One of the most popular computer games of all time is
``Civilization,'' which lets you start and guide your own group of
people. Now Microprose is releasing the latest improvement on the
game called ``Civilization: A Call to Power.'' The game continues
the same idea but adds new graphics and tools. You also can lead
your civilization for 7,000 years rather than 3,000, as in the
original game. This latest version of ``Civilization'' is available
only for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In a different vein, Microprose has released another new game,
this one a golf simulation. It's called ``Golden Bear Challenge''
and represents the sixth title in a series bearing Jack Nicklaus'
nickname. In this latest title, players can play as Nicklaus
himself. The game features some famous golf courses, including the
Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, Shoal Creek Golf Club, Sherwood
Country Club and Sherry Montecastillo. ``Golden Bear Challenge'' is
available only for Windows PCs.

Linux inventor's bluster no match for Microsoft's battalions 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this while on vacation. I don't tell you
this to rub it in _ although it is a perfect spring day, and I do
own an excellent hammock.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I want you to know about my vacation is that I see
better when I back away from something and look from a distance.
That works with redwood trees, people and the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, before my wits deserted me and I became a full-time
editor and a part-time reporter and columnist, I traveled annually
to Comdex, the big computer show. For at least seven years, I stood
in line with the other propeller heads waiting to hear the Gospel
according to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, has been the keynote
speaker for Comdex back since the days before computers were trendy
appliances and available in a wide selection of colors. This year,
according to the news reports, Gates _ as usual _ outed the newest
version of Windows that's under development.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't business as usual at Comdex. Gates is no longer
the youthful developer, arrogantly challenging the audience. In
fact, Gates spent a lot of time talking about a nifty new mouse
Microsoft has developed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the role of innovator and boy genius was usurped by a
fellow with a first name that would be right at home in a comic
strip and an operating system that was once considered a joke by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Linus Torvalds, the developer of an operating system called
Linux, was also at Comdex. And his operating system _ long a
favorite of computer wizards but not taken seriously as competition
for Windows _ was on center stage. Torvalds, who spoke on the same
day as Gates, was taking no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds didn't tell the Comdex crowd that now, based on
alliances with IBM and some other computer giants, Linux should be
taken seriously as competition to Windows in the high-level
business and Internet market. He didn't shuffle his feet and thank
the computer world for beginning to rally behind the dark horse of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said of Microsoft: ``We will crush them.''
</P>
<P>
   All the world, including the part of it populated by people who
stay up late at night eating cold pizza and writing computer
programs, loves a David and Goliath story. So the audience went
wild. No matter which side of the fence you sit on, no matter how
wedded you are to Microsoft products, there's little warm and
cuddly about the giant software company. So the enthusiasm for such
a challenge is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   And Linux really is a terrific product that's catching on.
International Data Corp., which tracks stuff like this, predicts
the sales of Linux will grow at 25 percent for the next few years.
So Torvalds has a reason to be a little exuberant. But, sitting
here, eyeing my hammock, far away from the maddening Comdex crowds,
I keep hearing a small voice _ either an especially talented
mockingbird or the voice of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the voice is saying:
</P>
<P>
   In a battle, God is on the side of the army with the biggest
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not here to debate the comparative merits of Linux and
Windows. I'm not smart enough to do that. And you either are smart
enough _ and have formed an intelligent opinion _ or you're like a
lot of folks and care more about the pollen count than comparing
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   What I am here to tell you is that other, more powerful
companies have made the same boast of crushing Microsoft ... and
have done it with at least as much logic. Think of Apple and its
really terrific computer and operating system. Think of IBM, which
sold OS/2, an operating system that was more stable and more
powerful than Windows. It's the same _ only more so _ with Linux.
It's a wonderful operating system, and Torvalds is a smart guy. But
Gates has a killer advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sitting near a PC, just turn it on and you'll see the
advantage. Microsoft may not own the hearts and minds of the
computer world, but it doesn't need to. Its outsized battalions are
sitting there on the battlefield of your computer screen.

A little planning makes home-based LAN feasible 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My wife thinks I've lost it.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I suppose, she's right.
</P>
<P>
   You see, my plan is to wire my house with Ethernet cable and
create my own mini-LAN.
</P>
<P>
   A Yandel-LAN, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, every time I try to explain to her the method
behind my madness _ and there is method behind my madness _ the
same thing happens. Her eyes glaze over as soon as I say
``network,'' and she gets that far-away look you see on the faces
of students who sit by the window in Algebra.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when I heard the two best words a Web surfer can
ever hear: cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   You see, we are in the process of having a new house built, and
before the builders could flatten the lot, I called up MediaOne to
see if they serviced my future neighborhood. A very patient sales
rep answered all of my questions _ no matter how many times I asked
them.
</P>
<P>
   First, she gave me the good news. Cable modem service will be
available with blazingly fast connection speeds for $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told me the bad news. Additional cable modems for other
computers cost $40 a month each.
</P>
<P>
   That's what set me wandering into the Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know my household is atypical when it comes to computers
(and in many other ways, too). We will have three PCs in the new
house: The P166 with a fresh hard drive for my wife to use, an old
486 I am in the process of upgrading for my 5-year-old daughter,
and a blazing new AMD450 I am outfitting with RAM, my old hard
drives and other gadgetry.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a letdown to find out it was going to cost $120 per
month for cable modem access to these machines. Add in the cost for
cable TV service (it isn't included, even though it travels on the
same coaxial cable as the Net connection), and MediaOne was gonna
be raking in the same monthly amount I pay for Montessori school.
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I decided to wire the house. I could use only one cable
modem and share it across a network with the other computers in the
house. Although I am having mine installed as the house is built,
anyone can easily accomplish the same things without having to go
inside the walls of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother, you might ask.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious benefit _ saving $80 a month in cable modem
fees _ other compelling reasons are sharing programs located on
different machines, sharing one printer and monitoring what the
kids are doing on the Net by checking out their screens from a
remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Less-compelling reasons include networked family gaming or
running your own Web (or other) servers using the cable modem's
24-hour Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as PC prices continue to drop, in-house networks will
probably become as common as bathtubs in newly built homes.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up your LAN is easy. Each computer to be networked needs
to have an Ethernet card in one of its PCI slots _ like the one you
free up by removing your old telephone modem. My network sources at
the office assure me that 10BaseT cards _ available for less than
$20 at CompUSA _ are plenty for a small network. (MediaOne offers
to provide them for $50 each.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need an Ethernet hub, which allows four or five
computers to run off the same connection. Again, unless you plan on
running the next Amazon.com out of your den, a 10BaseT hub ($50 and
up) is plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll need enough RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect it
all.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I plan to install the hub in the garage and have a
cable jack installed there as well. Then I'll run Ethernet cable
that terminates in wall outlets into the rooms I might one day put
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, spokesman Tom Buttermore (who enjoys talking about
Ethernets way more than my wife does) says MediaOne is more than
happy to help subscribers customize their cable modem setups. They
are also developing commercial services for people who might
generate enough traffic to warrant a 100BaseT Ethernetwork.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say, however, if they would help you beat your kids
at a networked game of ``Quake II.''

World market in focus: Internet auctioning 
By Ernest Holsendolph  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Auctioning on the Internet is one of the
fastest-growing forms of electronic commerce, on a pace to reach
$40 billion a year, according to some experts.
</P>
<P>
   Singularly successful eBay, already a legend on Wall Street, is
raising some $1.11 billion in part to spur its international
expansion in the business of selling a huge range of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Its site on the Internet is a favorite for the sale, through a
bidding process, of items as varied as antiques, coins,
collectibles, computers, stamps and toys of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a consumer standpoint, auction activity on the Internet
has been particularly successful in moving used goods,'' said David
Lucking-Reiley, a specialist in auction activity at Vanderbilt
University.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of auctioning _ part commerce, part entertainment
_ has attracted other players on the Internet, including some who
have built their names in other spheres. For instance, Amazon.com,
well known for its success in moving books and records, is
assembling partners and the assets needed to get into the auction
business.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yahoo.com, one of the most successful portals that greet
Internet visitors of all kinds, contemplates expanded activity in
auctioning, according to specialists in the industry. Meanwhile,
even as consumers are drawn to auctioning, other firms are tackling
potentially even more lucrative selling, including
business-to-business auctioning of industrial equipment and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale Inc., which has had success in commercial and consumers
sales, is teaming up with VerticalNet, a major player in industrial
sales, with some 20 separate sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even as some auctions on the Web tout their global reach and
international potential, AuctionAtlanta, a newcomer, plans to
exploit its local connections and flavor. Holding out the prospect
that potential buyers will be able to inspect goods before bidding,
AuctionAtlanta launched an effort last week to sell such big-ticket
items as cars, boats and computer equipment by using the bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   For the small consumer, the magic of the auctioning process,
experts say, is the ability to find items they would not ordinarily
be able to locate without years of hit-or-miss searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the auctioning is like a new form of classified
advertising,'' said Lucking-Reiley. ``But the reach and scope of
the auctioning helps to make markets in a variety of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the process makes possible the pricing of rare
goods and, from the consumer's point of view, helps establish some
sense of what is affordable or not. Thus, the person holding a
garage sale now can attract better prices than the single offers
for prized chairs or tables, and likewise people who would
ordinarily consign items to a single small shop now can sample a
broadly-based appetite for goods.
</P>
<P>
   While most new items can probably be expected to move faster
through the warehouse selling now popular in electronics and other
goods, the discreet used-products market probably will find a home
in the Web sites, many of which will likely specialize.
</P>
<P>
   Lucking-Reily and his Vanderbilt colleagues operate a Web site
that helps educate surfers in the economics of electronic commerce,
including auctioning. It's at www.market.econ.vanderbilt.edu
</P>
<P>
   Among the variety of Web sites: eBay.com, Haggle Online, Auction
Central, One.Web Place, City Auction _ all mostly dedicated to used
consumer items of various kinds.

MICROSOFT TO JOIN RESEARCH ON NEXT INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., which was forced to scramble to catch up after
a sluggish start on the Internet a few years ago, is moving to
insure that it is at the forefront of Internet research.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will announce Wednesday that it is joining the
research coalition that is leading the development of the
next-generation Internet _ a highly reliable network that can move
data at speeds 1,000 times faster than the fastest communications
lines used by corporations and universities today.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as Internet2, is backed by 150 universities
and about 15 corporations, mostly telecommunications and network
equipment makers, including AT&AMP;T, 3Com and Cisco. Microsoft and IBM
are the software and hardware producers among Internet2's corporate
members.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's entry is expected to prompt other software companies
to join, said Doug Van Houweling, president of the University
Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, which oversees
Internet2 projects.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is to combine efforts of academia and business to
develop advanced Internet services including telemedicine,
interactive distance learning and digital libraries. Pilot projects
are expected to serve to persuade corporations to invest to build
the high-speed network and refine applications for business and
consumer markets. By involving corporations in early work on the
next-generation Internet, Van Houweling hopes to speed its
commercialization and use.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which will contribute more than $1 million a year in
cash, software and services, says its growing research group has
been increasingly working on software and services for high-speed
networks, so that joining Internet2 is a natural step. And because
Microsoft's software is used on most personal computers, it could
bring the next-generation Internet to millions of desktops quickly,
perhaps within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition is a joint research effort that seeks to stumble
upon and create the next big applications on the Internet,'' said
Rick Rashid, vice president of Microsoft's research division. ``We
can help see a lot of that technology realized much more rapidly
and incorporated into our products in the long run.''

<P>
   The craving for speed seized John Drees the day after he bought
his first personal computer late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a stir-crazy state that almost every home user of the
Internet can identify with, he counted the minutes it took for Web
pages to appear on his screen. He paced as his standard modem _ the
fastest on the market _ took an hour to funnel a huge file to his
hard drive, only to lose the connection before he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Then Drees, a college professor in Jenkintown, Pa., stepped
through a looking glass that transformed his journey from home to
cyberspace: he got a cable modem. Now he travels the Net roughly 50
times as fast as he did before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go on, it's just amazing to me,'' Drees said in
the hushed tones with which many recent converts speak of their
high-speed Internet connections. ``Look,'' he told a visitor,
twirling through a 3-D animated tour of a World War II submarine.
``It's changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Brian and Lisa Banberger can't help but agree. They
opted for a comparably fast service _ not from the cable company,
but from Bell Atlantic, the local phone company. More than the
speed, Brian is enamored of the fact that the line is always open,
turning the Internet into a silent, beckoning presence on his desk
whenever his computer is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   So far the two households in Jenkintown, a well-to-do
Philadelphia suburb, are among just half a million across the
nation to sample the phenomenon known among technology wonks as
broadband. Much-hyped and long-delayed, high-speed Internet access
is finally coming to the home, with research firms predicting that
10 to 16 million households will sign up by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Such fast connections via phone and cable lines will become
widely available over the next year, at a cost of $40 to $200 a
month plus installation. The experience of the early users offers a
glimpse at the Internet's next frontier, where waiting is rare,
dialing in is unnecessary, and local communications monopolies are
for the first time vying for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is the Internet's next version,'' said Kevin
Werbach, editor of Release 1.0, a technology industry newsletter.
``It's a fundamental advance over what we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most obvious sense, broadband crosses a technical
threshold that has long been a holy grail among media and
technology companies: enough bytes can be squeezed over their wires
to make video over the Internet look like television and audio
sound like radio. As a result, downloading the two-and-a-half
minute trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' movie over a cable modem
takes about two minutes, compared with about two hours over a
conventional modem.
</P>
<P>
   But the most far-reaching effect on the daily lives of broadband
users is this: instead of tapping into the network, they are simply
part of a network. The combination of speed and ease of access
suddenly makes it worthwhile to use the Internet for a myriad of
tasks from looking up a phone number to listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband has integrated the Internet into my life a hundred
times more than it was before,'' said Christopher Mines, an analyst
at Forrester Research, who moved his computer to the kitchen when
he got his cable modem and says most mornings his newspaper stays
in the driveway. ``What happens is the Web starts to take over from
other resources.''
</P>
<P>
   If millions of Americans now dabble in electronic shopping,
banking, publishing and information gathering, broadband seems
poised to significantly alter the nature of those activities as
well as the number of those who engage in them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the bandwidth-obsessed are making decisions on
where to buy their homes based on the availability of high-speed
access. In the geographical pockets where broadband has become
available, neighbors are comparing download speeds and modem
installation fees in a 1999 version of keeping up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   Even more striking than the speed, many users say, is the way
the ``always on'' connection removes a psychological barrier
between the user and cyberspace. Although the difference between
broadband and dial-up access is only a couple of minutes and a
screech of the modem, it seems enough to tip the balance, making
for shorter, but far more frequent sessions at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And with high-speed access, high-quality video and audio will
become a more routine part of the Internet experience, with the
advantage of being able to choose what you want to see and hear,
and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it right, by the back half of this year you're going
to see big spike in consumption of video and audio,'' said Jeff
Mallett, president of Yahoo, the prominent Internet company whose
purchase of Broadcast.com earlier this month for a stunning $5.6
billion reflected its faith in the future of broadband.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, for instance, anticipates that people who check their
stock quotes in the finance area of its site will supplement the
experience with a video news clip about their companies, or an
audio address by the chief executive. Businesses from mortgage
lenders to car dealers are expected to take advantage of the ease
of video conferencing over high-speed lines to entice customers to
make significant purchasing decisions over the Internet that they
would be unlikely to make without some human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The technology also makes it possible for anyone to become not
only a consumer but a broadcaster of audio and video, sending
continuous sound and images to other computers across the Internet.
John Breuer, 37, a network engineer in Danville, Calif., who in
March subscribed to Pacific Bell's high-speed service known as
digital subscriber line, or DSL, now regularly plays Led Zeppelin
over what amounts to his own radio station, accessible to anyone
who has downloaded the free software that enables them to listen.
While he works and spins tunes from home, he often gets video calls
from his brother in North Dakota, who was never big on e-mail.
Asked if his new Internet habits cut into any of his other
activities, Breuer cites housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily reach what I would call epidemic proportions
in terms of addiction level,'' he said. ``It's really easy to get
caught up in it. There's so much out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heralded for nearly a decade as the Internet's imminent
multimedia future, the deployment of broadband technology has been
long delayed in part because the technology was not ready and in
part because cable companies did not devote the cash to get it
ready. And without being prodded by competition, phone companies
were disinclined to offer a far less expensive service that would
eat into the lucrative high-speed T1 service that they now sell to
many businesses at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cable companies, flush with capital from a series of
investments like AT&AMP;T's purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., the
largest cable operator, are upgrading their equipment. The
companies are eager to supplement the annual $25 billion cable
service with broadband revenues that Forrester estimates will reach
$5.7 billion by 2001. Local phone companies, whose $90 billion
phone service market is already under siege from long-distance
carriers and cable companies providing dial-tone service, have
their own reasons to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preparing for a battle royal,'' said Richard Rasmus,
general manager of Philadelphia-based Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Castleton, executive director for Bell Atlantic's
high-speed products replies simply, ``Our intention is to beat
cable modems.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cable companies are equipped to provide cable modem
service to about 23 million households nationwide, and phone
companies are wired to offer DSL to another 6 million. The areas of
availability remain a patchwork _ for example, in New York City,
only a few homes can get cable modem service, but it is offered in
many areas of New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut. Bell
Atlantic, which provides DSL connections in parts of northern New
Jersey, said that by the end of the year it will offer service to
about 2.2 million homes in the metropolitan area, including areas
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake in the broadband wars is the future of the 4,500
Internet service providers who now offer dial-up access to American
households, one-quarter of which are now online. Because cable
modem service includes Internet access, companies like America
Online, by far the nation's biggest Internet service provider with
16 million customers, are scrambling to strike deals with the
regional Bell companies to offer high-speed service over their
digital telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-stakes lobbying battle is unfolding in Washington and
across the country over whether cable companies _ notably AT&AMP;T, as
a condition of its acquisition of Tele-Communications _ should be
compelled to establish a level playing field for Internet providers
over their cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Is all the fuss worth it?
</P>
<P>
   If the smug tone that creeps into conversations with many of the
early broadband subscribers is any indication, speed does make a
difference. A typical Internet user today connects at speeds
between 28,800 and 53,000 bits a second. Cable modems and DSL are
between 10 and 80 times as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was over at my brother-in-law's the other day and sat at his
modem and that's when I really realized how much better I have it
than all those folks still on 28.8,'' said Banberger, Drees'
neighbor in Jenkintown and an executive at a health care
information publishing company. ``It's like when you got automatic
door locks on your car, and at first you thought, `Do I really need
this?' Once you have them, you can never go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Banberger's wife, Lisa, isn't as thrilled with the new setup,
since she says her husband spends more time online now than he did
before. She also tends to more frequently lose the game where Brian
tries to find a phone number or a movie listing online first while
she searches more pedestrian sources like the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   But both like the fact that their three young daughters, who
used to be too bored to wait for Web pages to show up on the
screen, now regularly sit in their father's desk chair and explore.
(The Teletubbies page, for instance, is a much-used bookmark).
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Sechler of Phoenix, who subscribes to DSL from her
telephone carrier, US West, said the service had allowed her to run
her accounting firm out of her home. Several of her clients are
also self-employed at home by means of high-speed access from Cox
Cable or the wireless broadband company, Speedchoice, which takes
advantage of the area's flat geography to provide speeds comparable
to cable modems and DSL over the airwaves. With three competitors
in the market, broadband has become a subject to hash over at
cocktail parties, in the supermarket parking lot and, of course,
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes up,'' Ms. Sechler said. ``Everyone's talking
about who has the fastest access.''
</P>
<P>
   The main virtue of DSL is that it offers higher guaranteed
speeds than do cable modems. It is also potentially more portable.
But its range is limited: people who live more than about three
miles from a local switching station cannot get DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, cable modems are more readily available, and
their top speed is almost three times that of the average DSL
connection. But because each household in a given area shares the
cable network, the more subscribers, the slower their connections
can be. Cable executives insist that they can add capacity to
maintain the speed, but customers in several markets including
Fremont, Calif., and Connecticut have complained about slow speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a stopwatch here at my computer,'' said Marshall Wice,
75, of Hartford, Conn., who has cable modem service through
Tele-Communications. ``Sometimes I'm downloading two, three,
four-meg files in less than a minute. But at night, forget about
it. It just drags and drags and drags.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wolfington, 28, who chose his home in Foothill Ranch,
Calif., in part because Cox Cable was offering high-speed service
in the area, also sometimes feels his connection is slow. But he
has a remedy: ``When I feel myself getting spoiled, I make myself
spend some time on a 28.8 modem,'' he said. ``That's when reality
sets in.''

<P>
   Once the threat of computer viruses caused panic among technical
specialists and yawns among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Now the responses are reversed. Far-reaching computer networks
make it easier than ever for harmful programs to wipe out data. But
even as computer users become more fearful, defenses against
electronic epidemics have improved to the point where antivirus
technicians sound like doctors giving routine advice for reducing
the risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're practicing safe computing you should be OK,'' said
Raul Elnitiarta, an engineer at Symantec Corp. in Santa Monica,
Calif., which makes programs to detect and disable troublesome
code.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't take precautions run the risk of losing days or
weeks worth of work _ as computer users around the world, including
more than 100 Boston College students, discovered Monday, when the
virus known as Chernobyl struck their hard drives. The virus is so
named because it was set to activate itself on the anniversary of
the Russian nuclear disaster 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thought to have been created in the Far East, the Chernobyl
virus is often embedded in other programs downloadable from the
Internet. It strikes at computers running the 1995 and 1998
versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, overwriting
the first 2,048 sectors of hard drives with gibberish and causing
the computer to think the rest of the drive is empty of data.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists have known of the virus for more than a year, and
after arming themselves with the latest software, most businesses
and large institutions reported few problems Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon just seven sites across the country,
representing about 30 computer users, had made formal notifications
they were affected, said Bill Pollak, spokesman for the Computer
Emergency Response Team.
</P>
<P>
   The group, part of a federally funded institute, is located at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``We're not hearing
anything that would indicate it was big in the US,'' Pollak said.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, an estimated 100,000 computer users in the United
States were affected by the so-called Melissa virus that spread
over the Internet last month. The Melissa virus caused more
widespread damage because it was distributed via commonly used
e-mail programs; Chernobyl, by contrast, infected only users who
had downloaded certain executable programs to their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But woe befell plenty of people who weren't running electronic
countermeasures _ particularly local college students, who often
obtain free copies of pirated software from the Internet rather
than pay retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely ridiculous,'' said Patrick Morrissey, one
of the Boston College students whose records were vaporized Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   When Morrissey turns on his laptop now, the screen reads
``operating system not found,'' leaving inaccessible thousands of
e-mail messages and a 1,000-word theology paper due Tuesday at
10:30 a.m. ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so annoying,'' said his roommate Drew Wetzler, who lost
to the virus eight hours of work he had done for an accounting
project.
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey acknowledged using pirated copies of certain word
processing programs available via the Internet, programs
specialists say are particularly likely to be infected. Still, he
said BC's computing center should have sent around e-mails to warn
students of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A college spokesman said an update on a school Web site was
sufficient notice for the school's 8,600 undergraduates. In any
case, said spokesman Jack Dunn, they should have installed copies
of an antivirus program that was sold at the start of the academic
year.
</P>
<P>
   To those who didn't, Dunn said, ``We're sorry they put
themselves in that position.'' At Boston University, computer
consulting services director James Stone said a half-dozen students
called in with complaints about their hard drives Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Their options were limited, Stone said. ``Either they can hire
an expensive data recovery service or they can scratch the drive
and start again,'' he said. ``There's no good option.''
</P>
<P>
   Wire services reported the Chernobyl virus also struck at
computers in Finland and Russia. Bloomberg News reported that
Malaysia's stock exchange said computer systems at 12 of the
country's 60 brokerages were infected, slowing trading.
</P>
<P>
   Still, damages could have been worse, said Brooks Talley, test
manager for InfoWorld, a San Mateo, Calif.-based magazine published
by International Data Group in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Melissa virus got everybody's imagination going
and they started to take steps'' to use antivirus software, Talley
said. The average company of 100 people today spends about $23 per
employee per year on antivirus programs, he said, and home users
should expect to run antivirus protections about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Virus creators are also developing more powerful programs to
test those measures, said John Vranesevich, principal of the
AntiOnline Web site that monitors hacking groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more of this because of the growth of
Internet computing, the more companies do collaborations on line,
and the more distance-learning projects there are,'' he said.
``When something gets created and released it's spreading on a much
larger stage.''

TOO MUCH OF A BAD THING IN LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One guy on the Web is calling it ``Geek
Profiling,'' and I guess I partly fit the profile, or at least did
in high school.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the National School Safety Center has issued a
checklist of danger signs to watch for in children. These include
mood swings, a fondness for violent television or video games,
cursing, depression, and antisocial behavior and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   That's most kids I've ever known. After the shootings last week
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., maybe most American
adults fit the geek profile, too. Littleton is a big story, but
there has been too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   The danger signs are all flashing.
</P>
<P>
   My mood has swung between depression at the predictability of
the news stories and relief at how well kids in Littleton have
responded to the disaster that befell their school.
</P>
<P>
   I've been feeling antisocial.
</P>
<P>
   I turned down a chance to go to Littleton and join the media
crush _ not because I think I'm too good for that, but for reasons
of mental health, mine and the people of Littleton. One fewer
reporter wouldn't have meant much to them, but it did to me.
</P>
<P>
   I've been angry because I can't take any more stories trying to
jerk tears out of me. I've been cursing the TV for profiting off
others' grief 24 hours a day, every day for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Fondness for violent TV? Not usually, but when the shooting
started last Tuesday, I watched a lot of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes a mood swing again. The kids in Littleton have
spontaneously gone to their churches in groups of dozens and
hundreds to talk to their youth ministers, to build memorials and
regenerate their community.
</P>
<P>
   The culture lives. Kids are resilient, and I don't care what
their profile is.
</P>
<P>
   If you're stuck too firmly in front of the TV, you'd think
America is a series of events that come with logos and theme music.
``The Impeachment of the President.'' ``Crisis in Kosovo.'' ``The
Killings at Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   School shootings, the most unpredictable events, lead to the
most predictable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the awful live coverage, with lame commentary by
bubble-headed local anchors. Eventually we get to the healing and
need-for-closure phases, but first we have to go through the blame
phase, the decline of culture (or rise of gun culture) phase, and
the quick-fix phase.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the media is a psychologist. Every lawmaker wants
to pass laws.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very depressing. Pardon the mood swings and warning
signs again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some good has come of the Littleton massacre. Probably
very little.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids at a junior high in Texas were arrested for trying to
bomb their school. Trench coats have been banned at schools in the
Denver area. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has called for
bigger warning labels on video games.
</P>
<P>
   As if the pictures of futuristic mayhem on the boxes aren't big
enough to attract kids already.
</P>
<P>
   In El Cajon, Calif., an eighth-grader was expelled for talking
about bombs and shootings the day after the Littleton massacre,
even though his comments weren't directed at anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Every talking head was talking about the same things. They
blamed guns, parents, video games, lack of religion, violent movies
and TV, or some combination thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the talking heads weren't expelled the way the
kid in El Cajon was.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton introduced some gun-control proposals Tuesday.
None of the proposals would have prevented the two teen-age killers
in Littleton from getting their hands on the shotguns a friend
apparently bought for them.
</P>
<P>
   They took a year planning their raid. The best way to have
stopped these kids would have been to notice danger signals more
obvious than depression _ like swastikas, for example.
</P>
<P>
   New gun laws may make some people feel better, but they won't
prevent another school shooting. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens called
these events a cultural virus.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is deeply embedded in our culture, but it hasn't
caused a full-blown plague. School shootings aren't as frequent as
they seem. They just all look alike, and the media goes overboard
on each one in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why they all look alike.
</P>
<P>
   The culture lives. Maybe that's the mood swing talking again,
but we can escape the media morass. We can go out to the ballpark,
go mountain biking or go to a cafe and talk about books and movies
that have absolutely no violence in them. Yes, there are a few.
</P>
<P>
   We can even talk about violence. It won't hurt, even if these
days it would get you expelled from eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons I turned down the chance to go to Littleton
is that I've covered a mass shooting before, in a courthouse in
Orlando, where I then lived. It's disturbing to see your community
laid low with grief. It's also inspiring to see how the community
responds to attack and pulls together.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want to see that as an outsider in Littleton, one of
thousands of outsiders bearing notebooks and microphones. We have
our lives to live, filled with mood swings, cursing, depression and
antisocial attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the culture lives, and it isn't in decline.

   In the past five weeks, an exodus of biblical proportions has
taken place. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians fled into
neighboring countries. The grim trauma they experienced in Kosovo,
their forced deportations at gunpoint, the killings and rapes, is
unquestionably bad news.
</P>
<P>
   But the safety and care of most of the refugees since crossing
the border -- so many of them in such a short amount of time -- is
the good news. It could have been a disaster and at the outset it
looked like one in the making. Thanks largely to NATO and the hard
work of private aid groups, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The best of all the camps in Macedonia is the one formally known
as Neprostino, and more widely called ``the German camp.'' It was
built about a month ago by German NATO troops in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans graded the hilly terrain and spread a few tons of
white gravel as a base. They set up spacious tents complete with
wooden floors, cots and heaters. There is a mess hall, a field
hospital, even a school and a playground for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, over a range of green hills, there is another camp
called Radusa, established by the cash-poor Macedonian government.
Of the makeshift, month-old tent cities now home to Kosovo
refugees, Radusa is the worst.
</P>
<P>
   There, flimsy tents are pitched on a muddy hillside. When it
rains, as it does often in the spring, the water cascades down the
slopes and into the tents. There is drinking water, but none for
washing clothes. Showers are taken in shifts at a tent set up
outside the camp's gates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and field workers for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) get prickly when asked about this
striking disparity in the camps. The German camp, they are quick to
point out, is the exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not realistic,'' explained a U.N. field worker, citing
the cost and logistics her organization simply cannot bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then perhaps, as NATO redefines its new role in the world, it
should be in the business of providing a rapid-response service for
refugee crises. Why shouldn't the standards set by the Germans at
Neprostino be THE standard?
</P>
<P>
   The military have the cargo planes, tents, field hospitals,
latrines, portable kitchens and experience to get the job done
quickly. Aid agencies, some 200 of them operating in Macedonia and
Albania, hold meetings, solicit donations, divide responsibilities
and often struggle with time-consuming logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The people who work for the the UNHCR and for private,
non-profit organizations like CARE and the Red Cross are
hard-working and well-meaning. Their field workers are true heroes.
But in the army, a colonel tells his troops to erect the camp by
nightfall or have a damn good excuse why it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's participation, phased out in recent weeks as the refugee
flow dwindled, may be necessary again -- and sooner, rather than
later -- if an expected new wave still in Kosovo floods the
borders. Already this week, several thousand more Kosovar refugees
have come across into Macedonia, prompting UNHCR officials to warn
that camps packed beyond capacity were ``on the verge of rioting''
because of tensions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's actions have been not only humane, but also politically
useful to blunt criticism from some parts that it is the punishing
air strikes that provoked the ethnic cleansing by Serb-led Yugoslav
forces that in turn, prompted the mass exodus of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives, the results count. For the most part the
refugees have a tent over their heads, are being fed and are
receiving medical care -- the aid arriving quicker and in greater
volumes had the alliance not been involved.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news and it is something that Americans and the
citizens of the other 18 NATO countries should feel good about. In
the worst of times for the people of Kosovo, America and its allies
have demonstrated that they can be the best of humanitarians.

   NEPROSTINO REFUGEE CAMP, Macedonia _ A fellow journalist
bemoaned to me that the news these days is so depressing, since so
much of it centers on the Kosovo crisis. The observation is heard
frequently from readers: Why isn't there more good news in the
paper?
</P>
<P>
   My reply: Look closer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks, an exodus of biblical proportions has
taken place. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians fled into

their forced deportations at gunpoint, the killings and rapes, is

dangerous, illegal and unnecessary. Not only do they say it would
cost American consumers an estimated $6 billion, but it comes when
the American economy's demand for steel is at an all-time high.
Moreover, it would violate world trade agreements and could lead to
a trade war. Just last week, for instance, Federal Reserve Chairman

   KIPS-DECORATOR-SHOW (New York) _ A pair of monumental columns of
wire, not marble, and filled with oranges, stand sentry at the
entrance to the Kips Bay Boys &AMP; Girls Club Decorator Show House.
They are the latest indication that the American home has become a
place for navel-gazing. It's show-house time again, that riotous
seasonal decorating ritual in which angst takes a holiday and rooms
by decorators and architects _over half of them new to the
showhouse _ offer a heavy dose of visual caffeine. By Patricia Lee
Brown.

   INFIDELITY (Undated) _ Over the course of his 12-year marriage,
Tom Griffin, a banker from Annapolis, Md., had racked up a
considerable extramarital track record. One night in bed, his wife
Mary asked him whether he had ever strayed, and Tom, sick of the
deception, confirmed her worst suspicions. Two months later, their
marriage held together with prayer and Scotch tape, the Griffins
(not their real names) went to their first session with Frederick
DiBlasio, a therapist and professor of social work at the

   CIANI-AT&AMP;T (Undated) _ Suzanne Ciani lives in seclusion at the

composer, she created what may be the world's best-known audio
signature: the miniature chordal flourish that introduces every
AT&AMP;T call. By Philip Nobel.

   DESIGN-PRINCESS (New York) _ Earlier this month, Christina
Magnusson, a sophisticated 50-something Swede, sat in a Manhattan
hotel suite and discussed well-designed juice glasses,
toothbrushes, kitchen utensils, furniture, cars and houses. The
fact that Mrs. Magnuson is a sister of King Carl XVI Gustav and

 &HT;    Some fleet-footed winners for Derby Day
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Derby Day on Saturday, and we've got the horse movies right
here. We're talking horse racing, not horse heroes like Flicka and
Trigger or equine-themed psychological treatises like ``The Horse
Whisperer'' and ``Equus.'' And we're talking about movies that have
a lot to do with racing, so don't everybody write in asking where's
``Ben-Hur's'' chariot race.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, horse racing was once the second most popular
sport in movies (behind boxing). In the '30s, the studios churned
out 44 track-themed films. By the '80s and '90s, the number had
dwindled to a trickle, reflecting, perhaps, the culture's growing
lack of interest in betting on horseflesh when they can blow big
bucks on the NBA and the NFL. But during Derby Week, everybody gets
a little horse crazy. Here are a few video winners.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Day at the Races'' (1937).
</P>
<P>
   The Marx Brothers do for the backstretch what they did for the
arias in their hit ``A Night at the Opera.'' Allan Jones, an
``Opera'' alum, plays a horse owner who dreams of winning the big
race. Maureen O'Sullivan (Tarzan's mate and Mia Farrow's mom) is
his dream girl. Harpo plays a jockey. Chico is a tout who pretends
to sell ice cream (``Get your tutsi frutsi ice cream!''). And
Groucho is a shady vet who woos wealthy Margaret Dumont. Near the
end he swears his affection for her saying, ``Marry me and I'll
never look at another horse.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Thoroughbreds Don't Cry'' (1937).
</P>
<P>
   Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney really do put on a show in a
barn. A barn on the backstretch at Santa Anita (replicated on the
MGM backlot down to the last bale of hay). He's a big-headed,
sometimes crooked jockey and she's a true believer who lives with
her aunt, Sophie Tucker. This was their first film together and the
chemistry was so apparent that one reporter recalls seeing mogul
Louis B. Mayer leaving an early screening ``with the air of a man
heading to the pari-mutuel window to place a bet on a sure thing.''
In this case, the sure thing led to seven more Garland-Rooney
movies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Story of Seabiscuit'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   A quaint reminder that once upon a time, lightning-fast nags
were as famous as any pro athlete (and none were ever tried for
solicitation, rape or murder). Barry Fitzgerald plays the fleet,
four-legged champ's very Irish trainer, and Shirley Temple, making
the transition from child star to love interest, provided the name
above the title (never mind that by the time the movie was filming,
she was a wife, mother and soon-to-be divorcee). In her
autobiography, Temple sums up the entire enterprise pretty well as
``a movie for anyone wanting to know all about Seabiscuit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Casey's Shadow'' (1978).
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Ritt once again demonstrates his ability to
inject ambience and texture into small-scale stories. Walter
Matthau is a struggling Louisiana horse trainer, raising three sons
on a wing, a prayer, a Bud and a belief in a horse that'll put him
in the winner's circle. Matthau's performance is a small gem, and
Ritt makes us feel the dust and dashed dreams that hover around
little no-name tracks where the purses are small but the effort _
and the dreams _ are as huge as those of any Triple Crown
contender.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Phar Lap'' (1983).
</P>
<P>
   A story like this probably belongs on something like ``Mysteries
and Scandals of the Sports World.'' In the '30s, a Down Under race
horse named Phar Lap became an international star and headed to
America to beat the best. Instead, the animal died under mysterious
circumstances (I'm not ruining anything; that's how the film
begins). Was the death accidental or foul play? Director Simon
Wincer (``Eraser,'' ``Free Willy'') toys with several
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Black Stallion'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have, see it again.
Carroll Ballard's adaptation of Walter Farley's children's classic
about a wild stallion and the boy who could tame him is a true
classic that transcends age and genre.
</P>
<P>
   DVD NOTE:
</P>
<P>
   ``National Velvet,'' the 1945 classic about the horse-crazy
British girl (Elizabeth Taylor) who disguises herself as a boy to
ride in the Grand National Steeplechase, comes to DVD without any
special features. Frankly, it doesn't need any. The chance to see
this state-of-the-studio-art as it originally looked is a bonus in
and of itself. It's difficult to say which is more gorgeously
glowing _ the lush green countryside or the 11-year-old Taylor's
flawless complexion. Horsey-set note: The horse she rides in the
film was a grandson of Man O'War.

 &HT;    A royally riveting Elizabethan romp
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned bodice-ripper tricked out with some '90s
feminist trappings, this melodrama about England's greatest queen
is mainly a chance to soak in star Cate Blanchett's presence. For
all the skullduggery and glittering costumes _ not to mention seven
Oscar nominations this year, including a nod for best picture _
she's the one who carries the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, it's the tale of a spirited young lass who chooses a
sort of living death for the sake of her country. Given that, it
makes sense that the movie is shot with the shadowy gloom that
seems equal parts Hammer Horror and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for historical accuracy here. Instead, admire a
supporting cast of scoundrels, including Joseph Fiennes as
Blanchett's deceptively sweet suitor, Sir John Gielgud in a
blink-or-miss-him cameo as the pope and Geoffrey Rush (in the role
that should've earned his Oscar nomination; instead he got one for
``Shakespeare in Love'') as the shrewd adviser who keeps
Elizabeth's head from landing where her mother's did, on the
chopping block.

career centers on line first. They post resumes and search for job

 &HT;    CLOSE FRIENDS HELP TEENS LOWER PREGNANCY, BIRTH, ABORTION RATES
 &HT;    500&AMP;add. With TEEN-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Positive peer pressure from close friends is
helping teens avoid risky sexual behavior, according to reports
issued Thursday(cq) on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of pregnancy, birth and abortion are continuing to drop
among teens, according to a 50-state report released by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based research organization reported these national
trends for 1996 among women aged 15 to 19:
</P>
<P>
   - Pregnancy rates fell 4 percent from 1995, to 97 per 1,000
women.
</P>
<P>
   - Birth rates also fell 4 percent, down to 54 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Abortion rates fell 3 percent, down to 29 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen pregnancy rates have been coming down since 1990, and
birth rates have been coming down since 1990,'' said Isabel
Sawhill, president of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy. However, that still means that about 1 million teens are
getting pregnant each year, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many groups want to take credit for the drop in teenage
pregnancy, but the credit truly goes to teenagers,'' said
Jacqueline Darroch, vice president for research at the Guttmacher
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the decline to both decreased sexual activity and
more effective use of contraception by teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next, deeper question is, why did that happen?'' Sawhill
said.
</P>
<P>
   New polls and sociological studies aimed at finding the answer
were paid for by her Washington-based research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone polls in March, teens and parents of teens were
asked, ``When it comes to decisions about sex, what influence do
teens have on each other?'' Their answers were almost identical,
with 57 percent of the parents and 58 percent of the teens saying
``very positive'' or ``somewhat positive.''
</P>
<P>
   That upbeat assessment was upheld by the national campaign's new
in-depth research, which will be available through its Web site
(http://www.teenpregnancy.org).
</P>
<P>
   Sexual activity rates are being lowered by a ``domino effect,''
said one of the lead researchers, B. Bradford Brown, an educational
psychologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He reasoned
that, as fewer teens have sex or babies, more and more teens end up
with close friends whose example, behavior and admonitions
discourage early sexual debuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, peers were ranked as the second biggest influence
on teen sexual behavior, behind only parents.
</P>
<P>
   When teens were asked who, aside from a boyfriend or girlfriend,
influences a teen's decisions about sex, most named parents or
guardians (38 percent) or peers (25 percent), followed by religion
(14 percent) and TV, movies and musicians (8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Parents' answers were similar. Most named parents or guardians
(55 percent) or peers (14 percent), followed by religion (13
percent) and TV, movies and musicians (11 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 513 teens aged 12 to 17 and 303 parents of teens was
conducted in March. It had a margin of error of 4.3 to 5.6
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Similar support for the positive influence of teens on other
teens emerged from a massive study of the social networks of more
than 100,000 teens by sociologist Peter Bearman of Columbia
University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls who have mostly low-risk friends in their immediate
circle of (up to 10) friends or in their peer group (a clique of up
to 50 friends) are much less likely to transition to intercourse or
to experience a pregnancy than girls who have average or high-risk
friends,'' Bearman found.
</P>
<P>
   By ``high-risk,'' he meant those who have trouble with school or
in relating to adults, or who frequently fight, get drunk, smoke,
take dangerous dares or skip school without excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bearman's said peer influence is more likely to be positive than
negative because ``adolescent girls are generally good judges of
the others who are around and in relation to them, and are able to
counteract potential negative influences.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter if a few of the girls among a girl's close
friends were high-risk, as long as most of them were not. In fact,
he concluded, that was likely to help the high-risk friends delay
the onset of sexual activity and pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, that wasn't true if her close friends included a
high-risk boy. ``A relaxed approach by a parent regarding a
daughter's close set of female friends might well be matched by
vigilance concerning her close circle of male friends,'' Bearman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in addition to suggesting that parents encourage their
daughter to hang out with others of her own age, rather than older,
Bearman advised them to know the parents of their daughter's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their daughter's friends get along with their parents,
their daughter is at lower risk of pregnancy,'' he said. ``By
helping steer theirs toward friends who have good relationships
with their parents, they will help reduce their daughters' risk for
intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   He based his findings on questionnaires answered by more than
100,000 teens in schools and follow-up interviews over the next 18
months with 20,000 teens in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on the usual exaggeration of sexual activity by boys
and under-reporting of sexual activity by girls, the home
interviews protected the teens' privacy by having them punch into
laptop computers their answers to questions asked over earphones.

   &QR;  ``Happiness'' (unrated) _ ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic
movie title of the '90s. This controversial film is a bleak,
unsparing and yet relentlessly comic look at several residents of
New Jersey whose lives are defined by sexuality, including the
pedophilia of a family man played by Dylan Baker. Writer-director
Todd Solondz says he prefers the expression ``sad comedy'' to
``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is about as dark as they come.
Grade: A-
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Taste of Cherry'' (unrated) _ A sad-eyed middle-aged man
(Homayon Ershadi) circles the sandy roads outside Teheran, Iran,
seeking a stranger to do a very specific task. Symbolic and slow,
this award-winning Iranian film isn't for all tastes. But Abbas
Kiarostami's patient, elemental direction exerts a pull that
transforms the simplicity of the tale into something profound. With
subtitles. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``At First Sight'' (PG-13) _ Val Kilmer plays a blind man who
regains his sight. But this fact-based drama never finds its focus.
Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the chemistry between the
stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry setting. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stepmom'' (PG-13) _ Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play
competing moms _ one biological, the other step _ in this
comedy/weepie that tackles some complex ``blended family'' issues,
then cops out by giving a character a fatal disease. Still, the
sturdy cast does much to redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed
Harris in the dishonest role of doting dad who somehow never sees
his kids). Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Thief'' (R) _ This Russian fable of fathers and sons
will steal your heart. In 1952, as Stalin inflicts his style of
``paternalism'' on the Soviet Union, a young boy and his widowed
mom are wooed by a soldier (Vladimir Mashkov) who isn't what he
seems. As allegories go, this one's transparent. But the film's
considerable strength lies in its poetic vignettes, telling visual
details and three wonderful performances. With subtitles. Grade: A-

 &HT;    PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FIND GOLD IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington, (f) financial and (p) political
categories
 &HT;    With contribution chart at end of story
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON --- Al Gore may not have invented the Internet, but
he is connecting to Silicon Valley. So far, the vice president has
pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars from California's
high-tech corridor.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not alone. Nearly every presidential candidate is
tapping into support among the nation's growing tech elite, who
until recently have been minor players in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology community is playing a bigger and bigger role
in presidential politics,'' says Scott Olsen, director of campaign
finance at Common Cause, a Washington-based watchdog group. ``And
we expect that trend only to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology community, flush with funds from a soaring stock
market, has a new-found interest in Washington as lawmakers turn
attention to policies that affect the computer and Internet
industries. And presidential hopefuls, eager to capitalize on this
interest, are hitting up wealthy tech mavens for support.
</P>
<P>
   The non-partisan Technology Network political action committee
(TechNet), Silicon Valley's first vessel for a foray into national
politics, has hosted an estimated 140 political events for state
and federal candidates in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other political groups, though, TechNet is bipartisan,
with teams supporting both Republican and Democratic candidates.
And it leverages its power by hosting events and bundling many
individual contributions to a particular candidate, rather than
dishing out the federal PAC limit of $5,000 a pop to individual
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fund-raising frenzy is just underway, presidential
hopefuls filed quarterly reports with the Federal Election
Commission April 15 -- giving the first inkling of how candidates
are faring in the money chase.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leads the pack with $8.9 million raised, followed by George
W. Bush with $7.6 million. Democrat Bill Bradley places third with
a $4.3 million campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan watchdog
group in Washington, estimates that technology contributions
accounted for about 7 percent of the nearly $21 million raised by
those three candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The organization could not analyze records of other candidates
because they were not filed electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts say the early returns represent the tip
of the technology fund-raising iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates are just organizing Silicon Valley teams and a
few have attended lucrative events in recent weeks that aren't
reflected in the April 15 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Gore already has raised roughly $600,000 from individuals who
listed their occupations as being in communications or electronics.
Individuals are limited to giving $1,000 to any one politician for
each election.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics estimates $75,250 of Gore's
money came from computer executives, including Netscape
Communications co-founder Marc Andreessen (cq) ($1,000 ), now with
America Online, and Michael Morris ($1,000), vice president and
general counsel of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   These figures don't include another $400,000 raised for Gore in
early April at a Silicon Valley fund-raiser hosted by TechNet
founder John Doerr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support for Gore is much deeper and broader than it
appears from these first numbers,'' says Wade Randlett, TechNet's
Democratic political director.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, has surprised some Silicon Valley observers,
pulling in roughly $1 million at an April 13 fund-raiser in a swank
San Francisco hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who spent a year teaching at Stanford University, has
garnered $19,925 in contributions from computer executives in 1999,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Supporters include
Steve Jobs ($1,000), of Apple Computer, and Daniel Case ($1,000),
of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the brother of America Online Chairman Steve
Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley made a lot of friends when he was living out here,''
says John Deikman, a managing partner of Bay City Capital in San
Francisco whose wife organized the April event. ``He spent a lot of
time with the high-tech community and he really learned how our
industry works.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say, however, that Bush should not be overlooked
either.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush has not left Texas during the state's
legislative session to travel to Silicon Valley, his supporters are
gearing up for big events in June.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has received $67,750 from computer executives,
including contributions from Netscape Communications founder James
Barksdale ($1,000), and Gregory Slayton, ($1,000), founder of My
Software.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Kvamme, managing partner at the venture capital firm of
Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers in Menlo Park, Calif., said a
handful of Silicon Valley big-wigs and Bush supporters have flown
to Austin, Texas, to talk strategy with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is planning two big galas in Northern California,
on June 30 and July 1, at which they expect to raise the flag for
the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Silicon Valley business leaders have offices in Austin,''
said Kvamme, ``They are very comfortable with what Bush is doing in
Texas. So there might be more Republican support than you would
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech executives tends to be libertarian, with less of a
party allegiance than other business leaders, Silicon Valley
political activists say. That means the field is still wide open
for candidates to line up support among the nation's newest group
of political players.
</P>
<P>
   The race for Silicon Valley's money is only beginning, says
Larry Makinson, executive director at the Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the charmed industry and everyone is lining up to
take their money. They've got the picking (of candidates) to do.''

THOROUGHLY DESERVING HALL ENTRANT: WAYNE LUKAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ He may not be Mr. Nice Guy, but Tuesday D.
Wayne Lukas was all smiles as it was announced that he had been
elected to the National Thoroughbred Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has had his disagreements with the Hall, most notably
concerning his eligibility. The former quarterhorse trainer was not
credited with being a full-time thoroughbred trainer until 1974,
and the Hall has a 25-year waiting period for trainers. While
acknowledging that there had been gaps in his career, Lukas, 63,
maintained that he trained his first thoroughbreds in the early
'60s, and he would threaten not to attend the event if he were
elected. But all was forgiven Tuesday, and Lukas, who will be
inducted Aug. 9 at Saratoga, could not have been more gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This honors the people who got me there,'' said Lukas. ``I
have six alumni, head trainers who learned under me, including two,
Bobby Barnett (Answer Lively) and Dallas Stewart (Kimberlite Pipe),
who will face me in the Derby Saturday. They all came out of this
program and they have really made a mark by doing well. They are my
guys. I've worked with a lot of good guys and a lot of good owners.
And I've been blessed with a lot of good horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I am most proud of is that, by August, my stable
will have won $200 million. That's a milestone, it's significant.
There are 49 sires standing in Kentucky alone that I trained and a
lot of mares who have `black type' (been in-the-money in stakes
races). That represents a lot of return to the people who I trained
for. Only the late, great Charlie Whittingham ever earned as much
as $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is not at Churchill Downs solely to accept honors. He is
training two colts for the 125th running of the Kentucky Derby, Cat
Thief and Charismatic, and each has a legitimate chance. This will
mark the 19th consecutive Derby in which Lukas has been represented
and he's won three (Winning Colors, 1988; Thunder Gulch, '95, and
Grindstone '96).
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief has not won this year but has been consistent, running
second twice (Fountain of Youth and Blue Grass), and third twice
(Hutcheson and Florida Derby). Charismatic, who once won a $62,500
claiming race, has redeemed himself with a fourth-place finish in
the Santa Anita Derby, the best prep of the season, and a strong
tally in the Lexington at Keeneland April 18. Owned by Overbrook
Farm, Cat Thief, a son of Storm Cat, will be ridden by Mike Smith;
while Charismatic, a son of Summer Squall, is owned by Bob and
Beverly Lewis, and will have the services of Chris Antley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident with my situation,'' said Lukas. ``I feel I've
done what I can. I may finish fifth or 15th, or maybe win it. We'll
see. My whole program with Cat Thief has been to try to improve
him. We've had a few wrinkles with him. We've double-dribbled a
couple of times. If we had changed a few things in the Fountain of
Youth and Florida Derby, he would have won them and been one of the
favorites for the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic has just been exploding in the right direction.
That may be the best kind of horse to have for the Derby. When he
won the Lexington (at 12-1), it didn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas is not among the many who see this field, certain to reach
the limit of 20 when post positions are drawn, as evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are maybe six in here who seem like they can win it,''
said Lukas. ``They are the horses whose feet have been held to the
fire, the ones who have been tested. Both of (Bob) Baffert's horses
(General Challenge and Prime Timber) appear strong. Carl
(Nafzger's) horse (Vicar) has run well, and (Nick) Zito has a good
horse (Stephen Got Even). Plus mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at half a dozen. I'd be surprised if one of the
horses who have done less jumps up. It could be another Gato Del
Sol year'' _ lightly regarded Gato Del Sol paid $44.40 in 1982 _
``but I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
LUKAS'S HALL OF FAME NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
D. Wayne Lukas, who was named to throughbred racing's hall of fame
Tuesday, has compiled quite a few accomplishments: &QL; 
--Trained 19 Eclipse Award winning horses, the most champions of
any trainer. &QL; 
--Won 10 Triple Crown events. &QL; 
--Won six consecutive Triple Crown events with four horses,
beginning with the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat and
continuing with Thunder Gulch (Kentucky Derby), Timber Country
(Preakness and Belmont) and Grindstone (Kentucky Derby). &QL; 
--Won 13 Breeders' Cup races, the most of any trainer. &QL; 
--Leading money-winning trainer in the US 14 times. &QL; 
--Set one-year record for money earned, $17.8 million in 1988. &QL; 
--518 graded-stakes victories and 927 stakes overall. &QL;

`FACE OFF' IS A CHANCE TO GAIN A VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new weekly series of vignettes on Lifetime television is
tackling issues in women's sports. And as brief as they are, the
segments are already drawing a response akin to male-dominated
sports talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face Off,'' which premiered April 11, features 52-second,
rapid-fire debates between co-hosts Christine Brennan and Mary
Murphy on topics such as whether ``lady'' in the name of women's
college teams is degrading (Brennan says yes, Murphy no) and
whether ballroom dancing should be an Olympic sport (both
emphatically _ too emphatically for some viewers _ agree it should
not).
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are then invited to weigh in with their opinions at
http://www.lifetimetv.com. After the ballroom dancing segment,
dozens did, not shying away from calling the co-hosts everything
from ``ignorant'' to ``men in drag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' said Murphy. ``I just got raked over the
coals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we're getting them riled,'' said Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   So is Brian Donlon, who came up with the show's concept. ``Mary
and Christine are getting killed, killed,'' said Donlon, vice
president of sports at Lifetime and instigator of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Not that every segment is expected, or intended, to draw the
kind of heated reaction the network got from ballroom dance fans.
``There are issues in women's sports,'' said Donlon, ``and I was
trying to come up with a way to tackle some of those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like sitting at my kitchen table at home, or
sitting at a bar watching a game disagreeing with someone,'' said
Murphy. ``It's the American way of discussing sports.''
</P>
<P>
   A new vignette will air each Sunday night at 10:45 p.m., and
replay four times during the week. This Sunday, Brennan and Murphy
will debate whether the weight of a woman athlete should be
included on programs and rosters if a man's weight is included for
the same sport.
</P>
<P>
   The co-hosts come to the show from different sporting realms.
Brennan, author of ``Inside Edge'' and ``Edge of Glory,'' two books
on figure skating, is a former Washington Post reporter and now a
USA Today columnist, while Murphy is the former head coach and
general manager of the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs. Coincidentally,
the two were classmates at Northwestern University in the late
1970s, where Murphy was a basketball star and Brennan was managing
editor of the student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Their shared background, said Brennan, eases the way for
spirited debate. ``You can get down and dirty,'' she said, ``when
you have that kind of respect that goes way back.''
</P>
<P>
   In an annoucement expected to be made Wednesday, the duo will
also be analysts on one of Lifetime's WNBA broadcast teams this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I don't want them disagreeing just for the sake of
disagreeing,'' said Donlon. ``This is Siskel and Ebert going to
women's sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Donlon said a little controversy is a good thing. ``It's
even sparked debate in my own house,'' he said. ``My wife doesn't
like them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making the grade
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Providence College senior Gladys Ganiel of Harrington, Maine, is
a recipient of the NCAA's Walter Byers Scholarship. Ganiel, a
political science major with a cumulative grade-point average of
3.986, will receive $12,500, with which she plans to pursue a
doctorate at Trinity College in Dublin. During her career at
Providence, Ganiel, a standout in track and cross-country, has been
named an Academic All-Amnerica five times . . . The Massachusetts
Mad Dogs professional baseball team is adding a woman to its
roster. The Mad Dogs, based in Lynn, have signed Tammy Holmes, an
outfielder who played with the now-defunct Colorado Silver Bullets.
Holmes, who led the team in batting average (.341) and RBIs (42),
was on the volleyball team at the University of California at
Davis, and was trying to earn a spot in the ABL before it folded.
The Mad Dogs open their fourth season May 28 at Fraser Field in
Lynn against the Allentown (Pa.) Ambassadors.

PASSING THE BUCKS NOT EASY IN WNBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WNBA players finally appear ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a tentative agreement two weeks ago proved
premature, as the deal was shelved last Thursday and the WNBA and
the players' union resumed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference call Tuesday, player representatives voted on
the lastest proposals, and several players, including Pauline
Jordan of the Sacramento Monarchs, assumed the vote was positive.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Wheeler, the director of operations for the players'
association, told the callers that there was a majority vote but
did not indicate if it was up or down. The players will be
receiving their ballots for ratification by next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you could just tell it passed, because our reps were
saying, `It's a good deal; let's go play,' '' said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither management nor the union would confirm the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The sides have been haggling ever since the players formed a
union last fall and sought their first collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed four-year pact, the minimum salary for
rookies and veterans will be increased from $15,000 to $25,000 for
rookies and $30,000 for veterans. The minimums would be increased
in 2002 to $30,000 for rookies and $40,000 for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits package includes year-round health and dental
benefits, pension, maternity benefits, and life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But even Jordan, who will be earning more than her salary of
under $20,000 last year, sounded more resigned than overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never be relieved when it doesn't add up to what the
company is making, but this is what we have to do for the time
being,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the first women's professional basketball
league, the American Basketball League, was formed. In 1997, the
WNBA was created under the auspices of the NBA. Last year, the ABL
folded and the WNBA owned a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But, since last Thursday, the future of the surviving women's
league was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The league's management-player relationship seemed to be
mimicking that of its male counterpart. Like the men's recent
experience, negotiations soon stalled. The men's season was cut
short by a lockout; the women's was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no lockout, the league announced collective
bargaining talks were at an impasse last week, just nine days after
both sides had hailed the league's first contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was supposed to mark the league's third player draft.
Instead, management and players were huddled in conference rooms,
eying the clock and the calendar, mindful that the 32-game season
was scheduled to open June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to talk, but there is no deal at this
point,'' said WNBA spokesman Mark Pray Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA president Val Ackerman said last week that ``if there is no
deal, we have no choice but to postpone the season indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wheeler, one of the union's chief negotiators, said Monday
she was ``cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The major issues have not changed,'' said Wheeler. ``It's not
that they've come up with new issues, but the ones we have have to
be hammered out.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive committee of five players had been in on the
negotiations, and Billy Hunter of the NBA players' union has been
to about half of the meetings, according to players' association
spokesman Dan Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just sort of creeping toward the finish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They edged closer Tuesday, although neither side would confirm
that the deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Levy, an agent in New York who represents 33 WNBA players
and nine players who were with the ABL, said he was confident last
week that the settlement ``was a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the deal fell off the table last week, Levy said he was
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you get that letter from Ed McMahon that says
you're a winner,'' he said. ``Then you open the envelope and
discover you have no rights at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was an exaggeration, since the minimum salaries and
other major points were not contested. But there was still
wrangling over issues such as required player appearances and the
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that in addition to negotiating new contracts for the
WNBA players he represents, he also has to fight for his ABL
players who were left without a league in the middle of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been through so much, and now this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the players have to scramble for a spot on the
roster (under the new rules, each team can add three ABL players,
with the exception of the two expansion teams, which can draft
five), they also will be collecting much smaller paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABL players were shocked when they learned they'd be
getting one-quarter, or one-fifth what they had been making,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the players make the minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elite, who make a reported $200,000 and were
conspicuously silent when the negotiations broke down, are Rebecca
Lobo of the New York Liberty, Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets,
and Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks. Joining them this season
no doubt will be Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw, who graduates
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cavalli, who was one of the founders and CEO of the ABL,
said he got no pleasure out of the fact that the WNBA was having
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the experience of the ABL shows that women's
basketball is very fragile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take any joy in their troubles, and actually I feel
good about some things they got from the legacy of the ABL,'' he
said, citing the ABL's year-round medical benefits, its 401K plan,
and the establishment of a players' advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things that distinguished the ABL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Curvy, who works for Bob Woolf Associates and represents
Kara Walters, formerly with the ABL's New England Blizzard and
currently on the national team, said Tuesday that he was confident
that a resolution was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is not going to fold,'' he said. ``They have the
backing of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could be a good or a bad thing, based on the NBA's recent
labor problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who played her college ball at the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas and also played in Russia, Spain, and Italy,said
that when the league was formed the players were told ``they'd make
it so we don't have to go overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the mimimum salary rising only to $40,000 in 2002,
Jordan said that's hard to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the two leagues would be separate, but when it came
time to negotiate, they are both the same,'' said Jordan. ``Our
league is the same, just with a W in front of it.''

   PHOENIX - The thing is, they're really comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   No self-respecting American man would ever wear one in public,
of course. I wouldn't even walk out of the fitting room with one
on.
</P>
<P>
   But the bikini-bottom bathing suit I had wedged myself into felt
. . . good. Nice snug fit, without turning me into a soprano.
Support in spades.
</P>
<P>
   And despite worrying that I would look like the Pillsbury
Doughboy with a rubber band around his waist, I merely looked
chunky, a little thick.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, if I hadn't tried the suit on, I never would have known
the hygienically correct phenomenon familiar to every woman who has
ever tried on a swimsuit: the complementary try-on panty.
</P>
<P>
   (I didn't go to medical school, but it clearly wasn't designed
for men. Complete coverage was not attained. Let's just leave it at
that.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the relatively pleasant, private experience I had in no way
changes the rule when it comes to who should wear bikini bottoms in
public:
</P>
<P>
   Supermodels and competitive swimmers only.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as anyone who has ever visited any of the
nation's public beaches can tell you, many men _ most of them
European, judging from the accents _ openly defy this rule,
shoehorning themselves into tiny suits that cover almost nothing;
what they do cover is somehow . . . isolated, so that more
attention is drawn to it.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh. Kill the spotlight, Dieter. Some things need to be left to
the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   At least Americans think so. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lettin' it all hang out
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``American men are the only ones who wear the trunks,'' said
Jamie Hircock, the manager of Everything but Water, a swimsuit
store. ``We're so into image. You go down to Brazil, and you'll see
men in skimpier bikinis than some of the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Note to self: Cross Brazil off potential vacation list.
</P>
<P>
   Hircock actually prefers trunks to briefs on men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think trunks are sexier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one benefit. Another is the way they camouflage your
belly. Well, almost. But the bikini lets it all hang out, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   The occasional guy can get away with wearing one without
nauseating results. For instance, in his role as Fox Mulder on
``The X-Files,'' David Duchovny once wore a skintight red Speedo.
Think anyone noticed? Check out The David Duchovny Red Speedo Poems
Page (http://members.tripod.com/Wheelbarrow/speedo.html) for proof.
</P>
<P>
   In one offering, called ``Comet,'' a poet named Ree T writes,
``A red Speedo caresses his loins/like a comet caresses the night
sky. Blazing is its color/shocking is the speed with which it is
soon gone.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not Shakespeare. But these suits do caress your loins,
and they do attract attention. &QL; 
Belly laughs
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I stayed in the dressing room. What else could you
do? Walk up to the sales clerk while wearing what looks like the
head cover for a golf club and ask if it fits properly? I was
afraid she would slap me. Or worse, laugh.
</P>
<P>
   I tried on a brand called Sauvage. Despite its skimpiness, the
suit goes for $39. It wasn't as humiliating as some of the suits
you see, which make it appear as if you're wearing a change purse.
The Sauvage gave me more of the look of an Olympic swimmer gone
badly to seed.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like anything worn below their waist _ trousers, shorts,
underwear, whatever _ to ride just below the belly button. The
bikini swimsuit rides a good five inches below, making it feel as
if something is missing. And it is _ the rest of the suit.
</P>
<P>
   It was while studying the topography of my belly that it
occurred to me: Since so much more is exposed, there is so much
more to find fault with.
</P>
<P>
   I was obsessing over my figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what women do,'' Hircock said. ``It's so traumatic
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is another reason I'd never sport one of these suits in
public. Haven't these women suffered enough already? &QL;

PLAYOFFS MAY REDEEM THIS IRREGULAR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1999 NBA season ends a week from Wednesday. It will go down
as an ill-advised attempt to squeeze 50 games into 80-something
days, an unqualified nightmare for even the most casual purist.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has been routinely lamentable, from the nightly
shooting horrors to the unthinkable 49-point submission by the
Chicago Bulls. In terms of sheer offensive futility, we haven't
seen anything like this in a generation. Players were out of shape,
coaches were out of sorts, and everything was out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed. Yes, some individual and team
(itals)statistical(unitals) marks are at an all-time low. The
league's leading scorer will have the lowest per-game average since
that stat became the benchmark in 1969-70. (Before that, it was
total points.) For the first time since 1953-54, the last year with
no shot clock, we may have a season in which no team averages 100
points. There undoubtedly are other lowlights.
</P>
<P>
   But as the season winds down, we look at the
(itals)standings(unitals) and we wonder how different it would have
been had there been a real, 82-game season. Rick Pitino might try
to convince you otherwise, but the reality is that the NBA could
have adopted a 20-game season, a 40-game season, or a one-game
shootout and you'd still likely see the teams where they are today.
</P>
<P>
   Out West, the biggest surprise is probably Portland's ascension,
although the Blazers figured to be better with the acquisitions
they made. But Utah is still the king until proven otherwise and
the Jazz, at last glance, held the top spot, albeit precariously.
San Antonio? We figured they'd be good, and they are. Houston? We
figured they'd be there, and they seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers? Well, has there been any more satisfying sight to
watch from afar than the implosion of Jerry Buss's favorite toy?
Sure, they might magically get their act together for the
postseason, but that would represent a turnaround of staggering
proportions. This is a team that has just come off losses of 27 and
22 points to the Spurs and Rockets, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The East hasn't produced many surprises, either. We all had
Indiana pegged as the team to beat, and while they've wavered, the
Pacers are still in the hunt and leading the Central Division. Most
of us picked Miami to win the Atlantic Division, and that's
probably what's going to happen. Orlando and New Jersey are the
biggest surprises, for opposite reasons. The Knicks? They're the
Lakers of the East.
</P>
<P>
   While the teams inevitably sorted their way to their respective
stations, it is the players who've really borne the brunt of the
truncated schedule. They were asked to be ready with virtually no
training camp and that was only after they'd spent weeks reading
and hearing about the unlikeliness of any season at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were greeted with a schedule unlike anything they'd
seen before. At first, it didn't look all that bad. When Larry Bird
passed through town a week ago, he said he initially thought the
schedule was a bonus. Upon further review, Bird conceded, ``It's
beyond imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA players are no different from most other highly skilled
workers: They need time to hone those skills. Imagine Keith
Lockhart moving the Pops around like an NBA team this season with
no time for the oboes to get their act together. That's the biggest
downside to the season. The players weren't ready when it started
and many still aren't ready now that it's almost over. Where's
Ralph Nader when you really need him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, as a player, I thought to myself, `This is going to
be great,' '' the Pistons' Jud Buechler said Tuesday. ``There are
no practices! I'd much rather play games. But that's what has hurt
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the toughest thing is not practicing. If you're
playing great, on a roll, in a rhythm, bring on the games. But if
you're not, if your shot's not there, if your team is not clicking,
if you're losing, you need practice. There's no practice time.
That's been the toughest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   We know coaches would tell us _ they have been telling us _ that
a lack of practice time has been the biggest hurdle. How refreshing
to hear it from a player. In its rush to get in games, not to
mention placate its broadcast allies, the NBA tried to put the
toothpaste back into the tube.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been much more logical to extend the season into
July. Or to eliminate a round of the playoffs. But NBC wouldn't go
for a season in July because people supposedly don't watch
television in the summer. The owners wouldn't accept a loss of
playoff revenue. So the game lost.
</P>
<P>
   This will all be forgotten, and quite soon. The playoffs begin a
week from Saturday and then, and only then, will NBA life assume a
degree of normalcy. Teams in the hunt will luxuriate at the thought
of playing one opponent over a span of several days with minimal
travel. Coaches will have time to prepare. The quality of play may
even improve when, in the past, it has tended to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will be the lasting lesson of this season. Skeptics
always have said that the regular season is meaningless anyway.
They may have had their point driven home by what we just saw in
the last three months _ and what we're about to see in the ensuing
two.

LAWS HOLDING PARENTS LIABLE GAINING GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a recent under-age beer party in suburban
Washington got a little rowdy, the police came and gave warning
citations to the teenage drinkers while slapping a $1,000 fine on
each of the parent-hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is common across the country: A growing number of
state laws and local ordinances are holding parents accountable and
financially liable for their children's illegal, malicious, or
destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally understandable,'' said Martha Minow, a professor
at Harvard Law School. ``People want an explanation and someone to
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a week after the Littleton, Colo., high-school massacre
and in response to it, President Clinton upped the ante on blame.
He proposed making it a federal felony for adults to either
knowingly or recklessly allow youngsters to possess guns that are
later used to kill or injure another person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to redefine the national community so that we have
shared obligation to save children's lives, and we've got to get
out of this crazy denial that this won't make a difference,'' said
the president, flanked by 40 members of Congress who showed support
for his package of gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that parents could go to jail for the crimes of their
children isn't quite so popular with some criminal attorneys, who
fear the federal law could be selectively enforced. Many family
therapists are lukewarm, too, saying parents might be more
reluctant to intervene with troubled youngsters if they feared the
involvement could incriminate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to stop kids who are out of
control,'' said Dr. Victor Strasburger, a professor of pediatrics
at the University of New Mexico. ``Threats are meaningless to the
parents who are disorganized and inadequate, and they aren't going
to help the parents who are trying to do the best job they know how
in raising extraordinarily difficult kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Strasburger, the author of ``Getting Your Kids to Say No in the
'90s When You Said Yes in the '60s,'' said baby-boomer parents who
``stopped the Vietnam War should be able to stop the war on the
nation's playgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many baby-boomer legislators have helped enact criminal laws
in 13 states in the last decade to punish parents whose child
commits a crime. Those criminal laws have been enforced less than
the more popular civil parental-responsibility laws that impose
fines on parents of children who drink alochol under age or commit
acts of vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, where Columbine High School seniors Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold allegedly gunned down 12 students and a teacher
before killing themselves, the parents could be subject to two to
six years in jail if it were proved they permitted the boys to
possess a firearm and there was ``substantial risk'' it could be
used in a felony. Under Colorado law, the parents could not be held
responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that seemed to be just what Jefferson County Sheriff John
Stone was suggesting when he said, ``Parents should be held
accountable for their kids' actions,'' after bomb-making materials
and the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun were found in Harris's home
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would be a little concerned about my son's room if I
went in there and I found a sawed-off shotgun barrel,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Soler, president of the Youth Law Center, a private,
nonprofit group, called the White House initiative on parents and
guns ``a good idea'' because it sends parents a strong message
about the high cost of ignoring warning signs in their children. As
a practical matter, he said, it also makes adults suffer the
consequences if they are careless and reckless with the weapons
they own.
</P>
<P>
   Minow, an expert in family law, called the president's proposal
``a symbolic action that comes too late in the day'' and would have
little practical effect in curbing youth violence and alienation.
It also poses the danger of selective prosecution of adults and the
``perverse effect'' of possibly putting more distance between
parents and children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most constructive thing the law can do is support
preventive practices,'' Minow said. ``We need to address the
central issue for every kid, which is the absence of sustained
contact in the life of an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Harris and Klebold died in the Columbine rampage, the
search for answers to what went wrong in Littleton starts with
their parents. James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal
Justice at Northeastern University, said it is both normal and
unfair to blame them for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People point fingers at the parent and say, ``Why didn't you
see it coming?' or `Why didn't you heed the warning signs?''' said
Fox, who is a member of the president's advisory committee on
school shootings. ``Often, the red flags are only crystal clear in
the aftermath. Rather than pointing fingers, we should embrace
families. This is a really sad thing for them, and we should assist
them, not assail them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Knight, director of cultural studies at the conservative
Family Research Council, said it could be nonsense to hold parents
responsible for their child's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a kid drives the family car into a crowded store?
Should the parents be held liable?'' Knight said. ``You have to
look at it case by case. Not every parent is negligent because a
kid has turned out to be a bad apple.''
</P>
<P>
   California in 1988 passed a law to make parents liable for acts
of gang violence. The measure proved unworkable, according to
Soler, because prosecutors could not persuade courts that the
parents were responsible for, much less able to control, the
criminal behavior of their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But laws can serve purposes other than putting mom and dad
behind bars. For some, parental-responsibility laws might provide
both a wake-up call and a crutch to put busy parents in touch with
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is enormous concern, and should be in our
country, about the extent to which parents are not involved with
their children or aware of what is going on in their lives,'' said
Dr. Steven Marans, a child psychoanalyst at Yale University's Child
Studies Center and also a member of Clinton's committee on school
shootings. Some parents ``really do need support to pay attention,
including the support of the law.''

PRO SPORTS DEALS ARE A NEW GAME FOR HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doughnut makers and shoe peddlers learned decades ago that
advertising on ballpark billboards and scoreboards let them tap
into the magical selling power of professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   More recently Fortune 500 firms, from utilities to computer
suppliers, have gotten into the game, offering deals on electricity
and e-commerce in return for the right to say they're the
ballclub's official supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a different lineup of players aggressively pitching
their wares via sports celebrities: hospitals, doctors, and other
health providers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants will be paid $15 million by Catholic
Healthcare West, while the Boston Celtics are teaming up with New
England Baptist Hospital. And lots of other clubs in hockey and
basketball, football and baseball, are forging their own alliances
in ways that are raising disturbing ethical questions. Some
analysts say it's a slippery slope for the teams, which might be
tempted to put money ahead of competence when they endorse or hire
doctors; others insist it's unseemly for health-care companies to
spin their services in a way that seems to trivialize their mission
of saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new thing and it's troubling,'' said Dr. Frank Jobe,
whose 35 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers make him the dean of
Major League physicians. ``You just wonder if you're always getting
the best doctor when you take the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, a health lawyer and medical ethicist at the Boston
University School of Public Health, is even more distressed by the
trend: ``It's a sign of the times for medicine, which are bad right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rationale, not even a pretext of a rationale, that
if I need somebody to diagnose me I should go to the person who
works for the Celtics. It's like the British buying from the vacuum
cleaner company for the queen, which gets to put the royal seal on
its vacuum . . . We don't have kings and queens here, but we have
professional sports teams, they're our celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph DiLorenzo, the Celtics' senior vice president for
administration, said he understands the concerns yet feels they
aren't warranted with his team. ``We have given Baptist that
ability to call themselves our official health-care provider,'' he
said. ``Baptist is the preeminent sports-medicine hospital in the
region, if not the country . . . but we have the ability to get any
treatment we deem needed regardless of the source.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time questions of conflict have arisen
between pro teams and their physicians. The issue is perpetually
cited with Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Red Sox doctor who's also a
part-owner, and with every team that puts a physician on its
payroll even as it tries to reassure players that the doctor
represents them, not the team.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not the first time hospitals and HMOs have raised
hackles by aggressively peddling their products in the increasingly
cost-competitive, consumer-sensitive world of American medicine. In
New England, cancer patients are taking to the airwaves to endorse
their favorite facility while slick brochures feature faces of fat
people made thin through anti-obesity programs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deals between teams and health-care providers,
however, raise new concerns about clubs' relationships to their
medical staffs _ and about how far hospitals should go in using
glitz to sell their services.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants are on the cutting edge of that debate
as they prepare to move into their new stadium a year from now. In
addition to plush seats and great views, Pac Bell Park will have a
6,200-square-foot medical clinic that provides rehabilitation and
other services to nearby homes and businesses, as well as to the
Giants. The new arrangement, under which Catholic Healthcare will
pay the team about $15 million over 10 years, is an outgrowth of an
existing deal where the health firm runs special days at the
ballpark, advertises on billboards, and is part of the Giants' Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of marketing, our new relationship with the Giants
will be a tremendous leap forward; it would take us 10 years to
generate the kind of awareness we'll get with this relationship,''
said Robert Polzoni, vice president of communications at Catholic
Healthcare. ``The provision of health care to the team is a
separate issue from our partnership . . . If we don't do a good job
they have every right to find someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's generally the way it works with marriages between teams
and health companies, from the Jacksonville Jaguars to the
Philadelphia Eagles, Tennessee Titans and Orlando Magic. The club
gets money and services in return for letting the company advertise
that it is the official health-care provider. The doctor treating
the team, meanwhile, almost always is affiliated with that company
but is paid by the team.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big switch from the old setup, where teams simply went
out and looked for the best doctor. And it has caught on to the
point where the National Hockey League says that 18 of its 27 teams
have some sort of sponsorship arrangement with a health-care
company.
</P>
<P>
   But do such deals pose problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area which could be fraught with issues if teams and
hospitals enter into arrangements where the only reason the
hospital or physician is providing services is because of some
compensation or marketing arrangement,'' said Lou Woolf, executive
vice president at New England Baptist, which recently completed a
$32.5 million training center in Waltham that the Celtics will use
for the next 12 years, in return for tickets, advertising, and
other non-cash payments. Baptist also gets the reflected glory of
letting its paying customers work out near the Celtics, and of
having its doctors be the team's doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Baptist-Celtics deal shouldn't pose any conflicts, said
Woolf, because ``for the last 12 years Baptist has provided the
Celtics with services which they decided year after year to keep
utilizing totally independently of any marketing arrangements.''
And while Celtics' team doctor Arnold Scheller is affiliated with
Baptist, Woolf said, ``he's totally independent of'' the new
marketing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other teams, including the Giants, have switched doctors as
a result of their new financial arrangements with hospitals. ``It
just strikes me that if doctors are chosen at least partly because
they put up money for the team, it puts them in an awkward position
to give unbiased care,'' said Dr. William E. Straw, who was the
Giants' doctor for 13 seasons and whose medical group represented
the team for 25 years until last season, when the team signed on
with Catholic Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also puts the team in an awkward position: If its doctors
don't give good care would the team look the other way?'' asked
Straw. ``The Giants gave us the same offer they gave Catholic
Healthcare West, to put up $15 million, and we said, `No, thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clubs appear to be sufficiently concerned about such
conflicts, or at least the appearance of them, that they won't
reveal details of their deals with health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see where it would be necessary or appropriate
to comment on the elements of our contract'' with Baptist/St
Vincent's Health System, said Dan Connell, senior vice president
for marketing of the Jacksonville Jaguars. ``But I can assure you
that at no time have or will the Jacksonville Jaguars compromise
getting and providing the best health care for our players or our
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   An Orlando Magic spokeswoman, meanwhile, declined to discuss the
team's health-care arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   But information that is available gives some in the medical
world pause. ``Our official position is that we praise teams that
come down on the side of quality and refuse to let too many
competing interests get in the way of their selection of doctors,
but the fact is that as business owners they do have competing
interests,'' said Marc Allen, vice president of the Association of
Professional Team Physicians, a consumer education group
representing more than 250 doctors working with pro clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Altchek, team doctor for the New York Mets, also is
concerned: ``It's very common now for doctors to pay to be the team
doctor, and they're like sponsors of the team. That's where the
conflict comes in. They're not just there because they're the best
doctor.''

   Lost in the Maine woods, 9-year-old Trisha McFarland battles
hunger, fatigue, marauding insects, and worse in a desperate effort
to stay alive. Her sole link to civilization: a portable radio on
which she listens to Red Sox games and to the exploits of her hero,
ace relief pitcher Tom Gordon. Gordon becomes the girl's personal
inspiration and, as time and hope both slip away, her imaginary
trail guide, too.
</P>
<P>
   Trisha is the title character in ``The Girl Who Loved Tom
Gordon,'' frightmeister Stephen King's new novel, which debuted
last week at No. 2 on The New York Times bestseller list. This
being King's world, Trisha must also contend with a spectral beast
of awesome power and malevolent intent. (No, not George
Steinbrenner. Even scarier.) Because King metaphorically milks the
closer's function _ to save his team's hide in the late stages of a
ballgame _ for all it's worth, you can bet your 1986 Bill Buckner
card as well that Trisha's fate will go to a full count in the
bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent authors have woven real-life figures into their
fiction, to be sure. E. L. Doctorow in ``Ragtime,'' for one. W. P.
Kinsella, for another, in the peerless baseball novel ``Shoeless
Joe,'' from which ``Field of Dreams'' was made. And while charming
enough and flattering to the pitcher, Gordon's role in the King
novel is not going to make many lit majors forget Lewis Carroll's
White Rabbit. (Rabbit Maranville and Clay Carroll, maybe.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pairing of King and Gordon seems supernaturally
provident to millions of New Englanders. One, because King is one
of us _ a monster of a Red Sox fan himself. And two, because
``Flash'' Gordon happens to hold the most hair-raising job on the
planet's most divinely challenged baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   (Cubs fans, feel free to stop reading here.)
</P>
<P>
   So what does Gordon think of his induction into literary
immortality? We put that question to the two principals, author and
save artist, in a conference call not long ago, just hours before
Gordon landed on the disabled list with an inflamed elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a man like Stephen King to do something like this is truly
a blessing to me and my family,'' said Gordon, who was ``most of
the way'' through King's 224-page novel at the time.
</P>
<P>
   (We won't tell him how it ends.
</P>
<P>
   (Nor will we blame King for Gordon's elbow woes. We believe the
interview and mysterious injury were an eerie coincidence. Not The
Curse of the Bangor-bino or some such nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   (Really.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my family is talking about,'' continued Gordon. ``I'm
very excited about it. I'm just grateful it was Stephen King doing
this and not somebody pulling a prank.''
</P>
<P>
   King broke in, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm just glad I didn't decide to do `The Girl Who Loved
Darryl Strawberry,' '' he quipped, referring to the New York Yankee
outfielder who was recently busted on charges of cocaine possession
and soliciting a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was writing a short story,'' he added. ``So I
never thought much about the name issue until it grew into a novel.
At that point I figured I'd better get in touch with Tom and see if
it would be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   King confirmed that the germ of his story (``Hansel and Gretel
with just Gretel around,'' as he described it) was the idea of
someone specializing in pressure situations, as Gordon does. At one
point King has Trish begging, ``God, if You can't be a Red Sox fan,
be a Tom Gordon fan.'' You don't have to be a Harvard Divinity
School graduate to understand how that line resonates with Red Sox
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to go through much of our lives not thinking about God
until we get into a real jam,'' King observed. ``Then we're praying
for somebody to come along and get us out of trouble. The idea of
closing a ballgame began to merge in my mind with the idea of this
girl being lost in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I started to notice that Tom points to the sky when
he finishes a ballgame, which to me says, `I saved the game by the
grace of God.' Since I wanted to say something about God in this
book, Tom seemed like the perfect person for this girl to have as
her hero. I was delighted to find out he was a good guy, too. I
figured he was, but I hadn't met him before writing the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon smoothly fielded the compliment and tossed it back in
King's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very appreciative of what Stephen has done,'' he said.
``My teammates ask me lots of questions about (King). Now they'll
probably be less shy about going up and talking to him. I tell them
he's one of the best people I've ever met. We didn't get a chance
to go fishing yet, but we sure are going to. Stephen came down to
my house this winter and we had a great time. I'm looking forward
to taking him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was converted from so-so starter to stellar reliever two
seasons ago. Last summer _ King's story takes place in June of 1998
_ Gordon set a major-league record for consecutive saves (43). His
total of 46 led the American League and established a new
single-season mark for Boston pitchers. Gordon, who lives in Avon
Park, Fla., during the off-season, was toiling in a spring training
game last year when inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came to me,'' he said of his signature
index-finger-to-the-sky finish on the mound. ``I've always believed
in God, that he's blessed me with a certain strength and ability.
For a while I didn't think about it much. But then people started
to bring it up and ask me why I do it. That's just the way I see
things, I guess. The first thing I do when I get up every morning
is thank God for what he's given me.''
</P>
<P>
   King is the author of more than 30 novels and short story
collections, all of them extra-base hits. He is wealthy enough to
be mentioned in all seriousness as a future owner of the Red Sox,
should the team come up for sale. A resident of Bangor, Maine, King
and his wife, Tabitha, also a well-regarded writer, spent their
first winter out of New England this year. Taking a house in
Longboat Key, Fla., the Kings happily accepted an invitation to
meet the Gordon family, which includes Tom's mother and his five
children, aged 3 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to Avon Park, it felt just like home _ except warm
and with orange trees,'' sais King. ``Tom took us to a local
restaurant and it seemed like everyone in there knew him. We went
to the local high school where he works out with the baseball team,
stuff like that. It's a small town with a family feel to it, and
that made me feel very comfortable, because that's where I come
from. There's a lake across from his mother's house and Tom's got a
great-looking boat. I'm looking forward to going out fishing with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said King, of the proposed fishing trip, ``you can't make
fun of me, Tom. I haven't done it in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said that when he started reading King's book and
thinking about a little girl alone in the woods, he flashed back
(no pun intended) to his own childhood. What was his scariest
moment as a kid?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon: ``My scariest moment was going into the woods to hunt
for treasure and running into these pirates, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he have any imaginary friends?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon: ``There were so many kids in our neighborhood, I didn't
need any. I always imagined myself as Superman, though. All the
kids imagined they were some superhero or other.''
</P>
<P>
   Does King's story make himthink twice about going hiking in the
woods with his own kids?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, laughing: ``I've never been big on hiking, anyway. I
might try a trail or two, but I don't think I could stay out all
night. And I don't go in the woods much anymore because they pretty
much knocked them all down where I live in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Since King brought up the subject of God, we asked the writer if
he was praying for the Sox to keep Gordon, given the team's
unfortunate history of letting star players go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' said King. ``When Mo Vaughn went _ it's not a
question that they can't play without Mo, they've already proven
they can win games without him. It's more a case of getting to like
a guy, of him starting to feel like family in a way. So no, I hope
that doesn't happen with Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Added King, ``Certainly it never crossed my mind while writing
this book to ask what Tom's contract situation was. Hopefully,
we'll be rooting for Tom Gordon in a Red Sox uniform for many years
to come. And I'd root for you anyway, Tom. Unless you were playing
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon: ``I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, King was asked about the fate of Fenway Park (talk
about spine-tingling suspense yarns) and the ownership of a
franchise that has not won a World Series since the days of H. P.
Lovecraft. King sounded fatalistic on the future of the olde ball
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway is old and not user-friendly in a lot of ways,'' he
admitted. ``But it's a place I love. The good thing about Boston
is, the politicians, business leaders, and labor unions are so
screwed up, it will probably be five years before anybody can turn
a spade on a new stadium anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Does King realize that if he buys a piece of the Red Sox, he
could wind up as ``The Man Who Owned Tom Gordon''?
</P>
<P>
   King, howling: ``Oh, man. I just want to go fishing with him. I
don't want to boss him.''

MILOSEVIC GESTURES ARE VIEWED AS UNLIKELY TO END DEADLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political solution to the conflict in Yugoslavia
is likely to remain elusive, despite a flurry of diplomatic efforts
this week and overtures by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
such as allowing the Red Cross to visit three POWs, foreign policy
experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's latest gesture _ permitting the Rev. Jesse Jackson
to lead a religious delegation, scheduled to leave Wednesday for
Belgrade to visit the POWs _ was part of the Serb leader's effort
to divide NATO and split American public opinion about the
conflict, the US and British analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small move, it makes him look good in his own domestic
propaganda war, to show he's playing by the rules and that NATO is
the aggressor,'' said Joshua S. Goldstein, professor of
international politics and foreign policy at American University.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein and other analysts said the United States is
playing its own games, too, including using the Russians to broker
a deal with Milosevic to end the conflict but without giving Moscow
room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Susan L. Woodward, senior fellow in foreign policy studies at
the Brookings Institution and an expert on the Balkans, said the
Russians can't ``completely violate their own interests or just act
as a kind of lap dog of NATO. They've got to have something to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the current stalemate, Woodward and other analysts
forecast a lengthy conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't easily see any negotiated solution in the near
future,'' said Anatol Lieven, a fellow at the Institute for
Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank that focuses on
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the signals from Yugoslavia have been mixed. After
holding the POWs nearly a month, Milosevic allowed the Red Cross to
visit and now presumably the US delegation led by Jackson. One of
Milosevic's deputy prime ministers, Vuk Draskovic, earlier this
week fueled speculation about the weaknesses of the Serb military
by saying that NATO's bombing campaign had ravaged Kosovo and that
his government was prepared to accept a UN force that would include
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Milosevic allowed a second visit by representatives of
the International Committee of the Red Cross with the three US
soldiers, who were captured March 31 along the Macedonia-Kosovo
border. US officials, however, complained that the POWs had been
denied their full visitation rights under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also is permitting Jackson and Joan Brown Campbell,
general secretary of the National Council of Churches, to enter
Belgrade to visit with the soldiers. They are leading about a dozen
interfaith leaders on what Jackson called ``a pilgrimage of faith,
not of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the Yugoslav ambassador to the United Nations,
Vladislav Jovanovic, has assured their visit with the POWs. The
group plans to take Bibles and tape-recorded and written messages
from the soldiers' families. She said Yugoslav authorities told
them they will also be allowed to videotape the soliders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Under Secretary of State, Thomas R.
Pickering, met with the group Monday night and said the
administration ``can't bless'' the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Though Campbell could not confirm whether the group would meet
with Milosevic, she said the ministers would urge the release of
the POWs if they did.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the religious leaders were not ``naive'' about
Milosevic's motives. ``They have a propoganda machine. We all do,
and I think there's every likelihood that he will try to use this
for his own purposes in his own country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
US officials could not ``guarantee safe passage for private
citizens'' to Belgrade, but ``we will do everything within our
power to make sure that Reverend Jackson's mission is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic efforts have increased since NATO's three-day summit
here ended Sunday without an agreement on sending ground troops
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, left Moscow
Tuesday after meetings with former Prime Minster Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on Kosovo, and Foreign
Minister Igor S. Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is scheduled to arrive in Russia
later this week, and in the past few days, phone conversations have
taken place between Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin,
Vice President Al Gore and Chernomyrdin and Tuesday, between
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Ivanov. The foreign
ministers of Greece and Canada also are due in Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see this issue resolved diplomatically, if
diplomatic ways and means can be found that lead to Serb acceptance
of our political objectives,'' said State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   But those objectives _ that Serb forces leave Kosovo, allow the
refugees to return, and accept an international security force with
NATO at its core _ ``are unshakable,'' Rubin said. ``There is no
compromise on those objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieven of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London said,
``If Russia is actually going to negotiate a compromise, then
clearly NATO has to be prepared to compromise on something or NATO
has to be prepared to go on fighting until the Serbs are
defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's no good thinking that Russia is going to pull
some kind of a magical hat on this.''

GROUP STUDIES VARYING RELIGIONS AND BELIEFS AS A WHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spend any time these days delving into what's hot on the
religious and spiritual scene and it won't take long to figure out
that many Americans seeking answers and meaning to life's mysteries
are turning to the East.
</P>
<P>
   From Buddhism to Hinduism to Taoism, practices and belief
systems born in Asia have captured the imagination of many
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet, the
birthplace of one branch of Buddhism, is virtually a household
name. Books on Zen, yoga, and meditation fill shelves at Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Borders.
</P>
<P>
   But long before karma, reincarnation, and nirvana became part of
our spiritual lexicon, there was one person who played a small but
critical role in bringing Eastern spirituality to the West _ Helena
P. Blavatsky.
</P>
<P>
   Most people probably have never heard of her, or the ideology
she founded. But Blavatsky, a 19th-century Ukrainian immigrant to
New York City, not only helped introduce America to Eastern
spirituality, she and her followers, it could be argued, were also
trying to unite the world's major religions long before
interreligious dialogue became fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875, Blavatsky, who had spent time traveling in Tibet,
founded the Theosophical Society in New York and authored several
books outlining her beliefs. Blavatsky argued that all the world's
great religions and philosophies, from Christianity to Hinduism to
Islam, stem from a universal curriculum or philosophy designed to
allow humans to live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The term theosophy means ``divine wisdom,'' and its
practitioners compare the world's religions to the branches of a
tree whose trunk is one all-encompassing religion.
</P>
<P>
   All the founders of these different religions came from, and
were inspired by, one source, explains Zachary Lansdowne, an
Arlington engineer who is president of the Theosophical Society in
Boston. It was founded in 1922 and has about 70 members.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are several thousand theosophy followers in the
United States embracing an ideology that seeks to reconcile the
differences and divisions among religions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, theosophy has attracted some major figures, such
as noted Harvard psychologist William James and Albert Einstein,
who reportedly kept a copy of one of Blavatsky's most famous books
on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principles theosophy promotes is the idea of
reincarnation _ karma _ or the notion that our actions in this life
determine our fate in our next life, and the belief that humans
were created by intelligent design and did not evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Blavatsky said her ideas were inspired, Lansdowne explained, by
her contacts with members of the spiritual kingdom, including
Jesus, Buddha, saints, and some of history's great religious
philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believed there were several who worked specifically with
her to found the Theosophical Society because they felt there was
need to bring these ideas to the public,'' said Lansdowne, who
first became interested in theosophy while studying philosophy and
religion in San Francisco 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Blavatsky's claim may seem odd, theosophy has evolved into
a small but mainstream movement that appeals to spiritual seekers
content to find a place that seems to blend the best major
religions have to offer. In fact, the Theosophical Society in
Boston has become a one-stop religious market offering weekly
classes on a variety of topics touching on different religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we offer that other denominations don't is one place
where you can learn about many different belief systems,''
Lansdowne said. ``Some of our members describe our organization as
kind of a poor man's Department of Religion at Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Theosophy followers conduct meditations to celebrate different
festivals associated with great religious figures, including Jesus
and Buddha. This week they are celebrating the Festival of Wesak,
which Buddhists associate as the time when Buddha was born,
achieved enlightenment, and died.
</P>
<P>
   Theosophy is an opportunity to learn the same basic truth in
different ways, Lansdowne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way to appreciate our commonality. There is a nucleus
of universal humanity without distinction of race, creed, color,
gender, religion, or anything else.''

DON'T LOSE HOPE ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those ready to surrender on gun control are missing the point.
It was never going to happen from the top down. The National Rifle
Association has a stranglehold on the Republican Congress. But the
pressure for reform, like lava from a volcanic fissure, is
irresistable from the bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of different ways, like molten lava oozing through
wrinkles of the earth's crust, the societal urge to limit the
access to deadly weapons emerges gradually, fitfully, slowly, but
with inexorable thrust.
</P>
<P>
   If modern American society can do what it has done to rein in
the catastrophic damage caused by the lure of tobacco, similar
restraints can be imposed on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco model is apt. The human lust for nictoine is one of
physiology's grand conundrums. That humans crave this drug so
strongly, despite the destruction wrought by its delivery system _
smoke _ is an established behavior pattern, documented physically
and psychologically. No one can deny that the lure of the gun is
another primordial urge. Having at hand a concealable weapon that
can bring instant death to an enemy or a tormentor at the flick of
a finger is terribly alluring to those in fear.
</P>
<P>
   And our media, both information and entertainment branches, are
fixated on creating fear. Fear moves people. That's why the evening
news is larded with violence and threats of violence. Fear sells,
and entertainment conglomerates understand that by salting
shootouts and garrotings and punch-ups into the entertainment menu,
they can build audience share.
</P>
<P>
   Putting eyeballs in front of TV sets is what broadcasting is all
about. Violence is like pornography. It has that neck-snapping
duality that drags our eyes from whatever to comprehend the sudden
danger. Adrenaline is the hole card up the sleeve of the visual
salesman. So guns are everywhere in our media culture. They are
``The Great Equalizer'' of a thousand cowboy movies. And gang
movies. And drug movies.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that kind of free advertising for the advantages of
gun possession, that the heater in your holster helps you to wipe
out your enemies, take what you want, and blow away societal
restraints, it is remarkable that more people don't covet guns. The
gun lobby has so much going for it.
</P>
<P>
   Till there's another high-profile outrage, like the
assassination of a famous person, or a bloody swath scythed by the
Columbine High School shooters in Colorado. Such mass executions do
not have to be swallowed whole by a society that has lost its
spirit of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   We can control guns and we don't have to live in fear of the
200-million odd firearms salted away in this country. When many
teen-agers fear that the unstable kid who confronts them might have
access to one of the 60 million handguns in America, no wonder some
kids are afraid to go to school by day or out by night.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nine school shootings in just two years, with
almost 100 people shot on school grounds. Every day 14 kids, age 18
or younger, die from bullets. Every day a total of 94 people are
fatally shot, some by their own hand, says John Rosenthal, the
founder of Massachusetts-based Stop Handgun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be a certain age to buy alcohol or drive, but
disturbed kids can lay hands on killer weapons. The government
regulates toy guns so kids don't kill themselves accidentally; but
the craven Congress cowers before the gun lobby, so real guns are
virtually unregulated at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   But there are successes. Massachusetts has the nation's best
record on regulating firearms. Over the past four years, Rosenthal
calculates, the state has witnessed a 41 percent reduction in
gunshot injuries and deaths. That spawned ``the lowest violent
crime rate per capita in the country,'' he argues. ``Massachusetts
gun laws work.''
</P>
<P>
   How? By requiring training, licensing, a 21-year-old age limit,
safe storage, child safety devices, and limits on gun dealers
operating out of their car or garage sales. We enforce the
assault-weapons ban, and banned ``Saturday Night Specials.'' We
track gun traffickers, steer kids away from guns and gangs, and
encourage police chiefs to go slow on issuing gun permits.
</P>
<P>
   This works. It's not as dramatic as the tobacco crackdown that
wrested $300 million per year for the foreseeable future for
Massachusetts from the cigarette manufacturers. But similar legal
pressures tighten the noose around the gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The British showed what an aroused populace could do after their
own horrific school massacre; they banned handguns. We're not there
yet. We still produce a gun every 20 seconds in this country. But
the death toll is hard to hide. No amount of blather from Charlton
Heston can obscure the fact that 34,000 people die annually from
gunfire, intended or accidental, almost as many as the 40,000 who
perish in car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby is strong in rural areas. But the tobacco lobby
was thought to be even stronger, and richer, and more invincible,
and tobacco is on the ropes. We regulate alcohol, a bit; we're
starting to regulate tobacco. And we'll get there on guns.
Gunpowder cannot be as addictive as nicotine.

PRO SPORTS DEALS ARE A NEW GAME FOR HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Doughnut makers and shoe peddlers learned decades ago that
advertising on ballpark billboards and scoreboards let them tap
into the magical selling power of professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   More recently Fortune 500 firms, from utilities to computer
suppliers, have gotten into the game, offering deals on electricity
and e-commerce in return for the right to say they're the
ballclub's official supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a different lineup of players aggressively pitching
their wares via sports celebrities: hospitals, doctors, and other
health providers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants will be paid $15 million by Catholic
Healthcare West, while the Boston Celtics are teaming up with New
England Baptist Hospital. And lots of other clubs in hockey and
basketball, football and baseball, are forging their own alliances
in ways that are raising disturbing ethical questions. Some
analysts say it's a slippery slope for the teams, which might be
tempted to put money ahead of competence when they endorse or hire
doctors; others insist it's unseemly for health-care companies to
spin their services in a way that seems to trivialize their mission
of saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new thing and it's troubling,'' said Dr. Frank Jobe,
whose 35 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers make him the dean of
Major League physicians. ``You just wonder if you're always getting
the best doctor when you take the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, a health lawyer and medical ethicist at the Boston
University School of Public Health, is even more distressed by the
trend: ``It's a sign of the times for medicine, which are bad right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rationale, not even a pretext of a rationale, that
if I need somebody to diagnose me I should go to the person who
works for the Celtics. It's like the British buying from the vacuum
cleaner company for the queen, which gets to put the royal seal on
its vacuum . . . We don't have kings and queens here, but we have
professional sports teams, they're our celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph DiLorenzo, the Celtics' senior vice president for
administration, said he understands the concerns yet feels they
aren't warranted with his team. ``We have given Baptist that
ability to call themselves our official health-care provider,'' he
said. ``Baptist is the preeminent sports-medicine hospital in the
region, if not the country . . . but we have the ability to get any
treatment we deem needed regardless of the source.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time questions of conflict have arisen
between pro teams and their physicians. The issue is perpetually
cited with Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Red Sox doctor who's also a
part-owner, and with every team that puts a physician on its
payroll even as it tries to reassure players that the doctor
represents them, not the team.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not the first time hospitals and HMOs have raised
hackles by aggressively peddling their products in the increasingly
cost-competitive, consumer-sensitive world of American medicine. In
New England, cancer patients are taking to the airwaves to endorse
their favorite facility while slick brochures feature faces of fat
people made thin through anti-obesity programs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deals between teams and health-care providers,
however, raise new concerns about clubs' relationships to their
medical staffs _ and about how far hospitals should go in using
glitz to sell their services.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants are on the cutting edge of that debate
as they prepare to move into their new stadium a year from now. In
addition to plush seats and great views, Pac Bell Park will have a
6,200-square-foot medical clinic that provides rehabilitation and
other services to nearby homes and businesses, as well as to the
Giants. The new arrangement, under which Catholic Healthcare will
pay the team about $15 million over 10 years, is an outgrowth of an
existing deal where the health firm runs special days at the
ballpark, advertises on billboards, and is part of the Giants' Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of marketing, our new relationship with the Giants
will be a tremendous leap forward; it would take us 10 years to
generate the kind of awareness we'll get with this relationship,''
said Robert Polzoni, vice president of communications at Catholic
Healthcare. ``The provision of health care to the team is a
separate issue from our partnership . . . If we don't do a good job
they have every right to find someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's generally the way it works with marriages between teams
and health companies, from the Jacksonville Jaguars to the
Philadelphia Eagles, Tennessee Titans and Orlando Magic. The club
gets money and services in return for letting the company advertise
that it is the official health-care provider. The doctor treating
the team, meanwhile, almost always is affiliated with that company
but is paid by the team.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big switch from the old setup, where teams simply went
out and looked for the best doctor. And it has caught on to the
point where the National Hockey League says that 18 of its 27 teams
have some sort of sponsorship arrangement with a health-care
company.
</P>
<P>
   But do such deals pose problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an area which could be fraught with issues if teams and
hospitals enter into arrangements where the only reason the
hospital or physician is providing services is because of some
compensation or marketing arrangement,'' said Lou Woolf, executive
vice president at New England Baptist, which recently completed a
$32.5 million training center in Waltham that the Celtics will use
for the next 12 years, in return for tickets, advertising, and
other non-cash payments. Baptist also gets the reflected glory of
letting its paying customers work out near the Celtics, and of
having its doctors be the team's doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The new Baptist-Celtics deal shouldn't pose any conflicts, said
Woolf, because ``for the last 12 years Baptist has provided the
Celtics with services which they decided year after year to keep
utilizing totally independently of any marketing arrangements.''
And while Celtics' team doctor Arnold Scheller is affiliated with
Baptist, Woolf said, ``he's totally independent of'' the new
marketing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other teams, including the Giants, have switched doctors as
a result of their new financial arrangements with hospitals. ``It
just strikes me that if doctors are chosen at least partly because
they put up money for the team, it puts them in an awkward position
to give unbiased care,'' said Dr. William E. Straw, who was the
Giants' doctor for 13 seasons and whose medical group represented
the team for 25 years until last season, when the team signed on
with Catholic Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also puts the team in an awkward position: If its doctors
don't give good care would the team look the other way?'' asked
Straw. ``The Giants gave us the same offer they gave Catholic
Healthcare West, to put up $15 million, and we said, `No, thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clubs appear to be sufficiently concerned about such
conflicts, or at least the appearance of them, that they won't
reveal details of their deals with health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see where it would be necessary or appropriate
to comment on the elements of our contract'' with Baptist/St
Vincent's Health System, said Dan Connell, senior vice president
for marketing of the Jacksonville Jaguars. ``But I can assure you
that at no time have or will the Jacksonville Jaguars compromise
getting and providing the best health care for our players or our
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   An Orlando Magic spokeswoman, meanwhile, declined to discuss the
team's health-care arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   But information that is available gives some in the medical
world pause. ``Our official position is that we praise teams that
come down on the side of quality and refuse to let too many
competing interests get in the way of their selection of doctors,
but the fact is that as business owners they do have competing
interests,'' said Marc Allen, vice president of the Association of
Professional Team Physicians, a consumer education group
representing more than 250 doctors working with pro clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Altchek, team doctor for the New York Mets, also is
concerned: ``It's very common now for doctors to pay to be the team
doctor, and they're like sponsors of the team. That's where the
conflict comes in. They're not just there because they're the best
doctor.''

A LOOKING GLASS FOR LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ What now?
</P>
<P>
   The heroic coach has been eulogized. The Christian martyr has
been buried. One of the presumed killers has been laid to whatever
uneasy rest awaits a boy who laughed as he and a friend strolled
through Columbine High School, executing 12 classmates and a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   For those left to make sense of the worst schoolhouse shooting
in US history, the question of the hour is: Where do we go from
here?
</P>
<P>
   Not until the funerals end this week will the hard questioning
begin here. But not the general, philosophical questions the entire
nation is asking about alienated youth, distant parents, gun
control, dress codes, violent video games, cyberspace, and
adolescent cliques.
</P>
<P>
   In this Denver suburb of 35,000, the questions need to be much
more specific, much more personal.
</P>
<P>
   The pastors and youth ministers of the evangelical Christian
churches, who have wrapped a grief-stricken community in their
tender embrace, need to ask themselves whether that warm welcome
would have been extended had two hate-filled, non-believers knocked
on the doors of their sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure of a person's righteousness is whether he accepts
Jesus as his savior, where did that leave Dylan Klebold, who
celebrated Passover last month and whose great-grandfather was an
Ohio businessman and philanthropist for whom the Jewish Community
Center in Columbus is named?
</P>
<P>
   The star athletes, whose macho exteriors have been softened by
their tears, need to ask themselves how far they pushed Dylan and
Eric Harris, the social outcasts who stormed their high school
eight days ago to exact revenge on their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   If conformity is the price of acceptance, where did that leave
Eric, whose style of dress and scorn for sports earned him the
epithet ``faggot'' in the corridors of Columbine High, where he and
other misfits were regularly spat upon and shoved into lockers by
some of the well-scrubbed, Scripture-citing young men now in
mourning for their murdered friends?
</P>
<P>
   The loose confederation of Columbine outcasts known as the
Trenchcoat Mafia needs to ask itself how much it knew of, or
silently suspected, the deadly plot hatched by Eric and Dylan a
year before the pair laid seige to the school last Tuesday, a day
on which many of the ``mafia'' were inexplicably absent.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of individualism is isolation, aren't members of the
Trenchcoat Mafia now experiencing their social alienation in full,
many of them afraid to leave their houses, fearing harrassment or
worse?
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeAngelis, the principal who says he had not heard of the
Trenchcoat Mafia until last week, needs to ask himself just how big
is too big a school for one man to manage.
</P>
<P>
   If DeAngelis had never heard of a clique that advertised its
existence in the high school yearbook, doesn't that suggest that it
is not only the architecture that makes so many American high
schools like Columbine, with 1,965 students, resemble factories?
</P>
<P>
   To confront these questions is not to exempt the killers from
ultimate responsibility for their acts. It is to acknowledge the
obvious, if painful, truth that the carnage at Columbine did not
occur in a vacuum. To consider only the actions of the gunmen is to
insure that our children never learn the larger lessons, about
tolerance and mutual respect, so crucial in a culture as diverse as
our own.
</P>
<P>
   It would be naive to expect that the stratified world of
adolescence would yield automatically to a more accepting impulse
in the aftermath of this tragedy. But it would be even more
foolhardy to ignore the anger that the gunmen's violence has
reignited against ``Goths'' and ``freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   By any yardstick, Littleton is a lovely town, full of fine
people. A fast-growing prairie suburb at the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains, it is a place where homeowners leave their doors
unlocked and no one worries about sending a child to the corner
store alone for bread or milk.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only Littleton's minivans and skateboard parks
that are familiar symbols of middle-class America. In its
intolerance of those who are different, in its indifference to
those who are marginalized, Littleton, Colorado could be Anytown,
U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   If the residents of Littleton conclude that Dylan Klebold and
Eric Harris embodied Satanic evil loosed on a God-fearing
community, how will they, or we, ever entertain the need for change
and reconciliation?

A WHITE-KNUCKLER FEEDS HIS FEAR OF FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course when I heard that the new John Cusack movie, ``Pushing
Tin,'' concerned flight controllers, I ran out and saw it. The
critics were right; as a dramatic work it lands a few hundred feet
short of the runway. But for aviation lore, it doesn't disappoint.
``Squawk-ident,'' ``wake turbulence,'' and the descriptive
``aluminum shower'' for midair collision _ I could listen to that
jargon all day.
</P>
<P>
   There's very little I haven't done to grapple with my flying
anxiety. I sat through the movie ``Turbulence,'' which the
Hollywood web site Ain't-it-Cool News fingered as the worst movie
of 1998. I've flown in the jump seat of the Boston-New York
shuttle. I've stood in the cockpit of a Pan Am 747, somewhere over
Greenland, and listened to the pilot boast that he could program
the plane to land at Kennedy Airport without touching the controls
again. (True.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course I read Darcy Frey's New York Times magazine story on
the New York TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) center, which
inspired the Cusack movie. I've hung out in the control tower at
Logan. Man! Are those controllers jumpy. They all looked like
31-year-old amphetamine addicts, which is exactly the stage of
alertness I'd encourage in the man or woman guiding my plane
through 10,000 feet over Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent cross-country flight I developed the usual
jitters and planted myself next to one of the off-duty pilots on
board. He was very pilot-like; articulate, self-confident,
reassuring. Some of the stuff he told me was old hat. I knew about
the many backup systems built into commercial aircraft, and I had a
pretty firm grip on how the on-board TCAS (Traffic Collision
Avoidance System) worked. I had even read about the 747 stress
tests, when the wings withstood 200,000 pounds of lateral pressure
without breaking.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, this man shared his most harrowing flying
experience, a flight to Salt Lake City in which 14 passengers were
injured. Sketching on a cocktail napkin, he showed me how strong
westerly winds create maelstroms of turbulence on the Colorado side
of the Rockies, where his plane was that day. He flew out of the
trouble, which lasted less than 20 seconds. I was too gracious to
mention that my paranoid-encyclopedic knowledge of airline
disasters included United Airline's Flight 585, which banked out of
control on final approach to Colorado Springs in 1991.
Investigators theorized that the mountain turbulence may have
caused the plane's rudder to go haywire.
</P>
<P>
   I solicit flight horror stories so I can see how my own
experience stacks up. One flight attendant told me she got her hair
caught in a ceiling seam during a wild ride over _ yes _ the
Rockies. My brother-in-law, who looks out for my interests, once
called me from the business section of a particularly bumpy
AeroMexico flight. ``They're screaming in economy,'' he reported.
Happily, everyone arrived safely.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course there's a copy of the definitive ``Why Airplanes
Crash'' front and center on my office bookshelf, and no, I would
never miss an article by either the Atlantic's William Langewiesche
or the Wall Street Journal's William Carley, the best aviation
journalists in America. Carley's latest scoop, about a fully loaded
United Airlines 747 that missed San Bruno Mountain near San
Francisco by 100 feet (WSJ, March 19) is yet another feather in his
cap.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the strange thing: My anxiety notwithstanding,
there's virtually nowhere I wouldn't fly. Every time I'm sitting
inside a plane that breaks through the clouds, I marvel at the
privilege of seeing a piece of creation most humans have never
seen. The Utne Reader recently listed ``Overseas Air Travel'' as
one of 50 things worth saving from the 20th century, along with
Alcoholics Anonymous, crossword puzzles, ice cream cones, the
zipper, and ``Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' Yes, on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   And the benefits of flying far outweigh the aggravation. Five
hours of sporadic terror in return for a same-day trip to Ireland,
or California? Save me a window seat, and I'll be the first one
down the jetway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dessert fads come and dessert fads go _ remember tiramisu? _ but
I remain loyal to flan.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Barranquilla, Colombia, and in Miami, two places
where the caramel custard that the Spanish call flan is a beloved
institution. Since moving to Boston, I've been obsessively
searching for a flan that comes close to the ones of my childhood.
At every new restaurant, the first thing I do is check the dessert
menu. If there is flan, I'll pass up all kinds of tempting and
trendy confections in the hope that this will be the flan to rival
the ones I grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   The flan I love is a homey and comforting dessert. It's usually
just topped with caramelized sugar but is sometimes made with
apples or other fruit. It has none of the cachet of its glitzy
cousin, creme brulee, but it's denser and much more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for my quest, I've found that flan by other names
does taste as sweet. It's called creme caramel by the French, pudim
by the Portuguese, crema caramella by the Italians, and caramel
custard by English speakers. It's all flan to me.
</P>
<P>
   Flan originated in Spain, probably around the sherry-producing
region of Jerez, says Mario Leon-Iriate, co-owner of Dali
restaurant in Somerville, Mass., which serves a luscious flan
flavored with orange. Egg whites were added to sherry barrels to
clarify the sherry, he explains, and the whites would sink to the
bottom, taking any impurities along. ``After the sherry makers used
the egg whites, they had to do something with the yolks,'' he says.
So they gave the yolks to local orders of nuns, who devised various
rich desserts, including flan. The traditional formula includes
several yolks, in addition to whole eggs. Though Dali's recipe uses
condensed milk instead of the extra yolks, Leon-Iriate likes the
story. But, he concedes with a laugh, ``the French probably have a
different explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Azita Bina-Seibel, co-owner of Lala Rokh on Beacon Hill in
Boston, doesn't have a theory about the origins of the dessert, but
she does serve a lovely, delicate creme caramel at her Persian
restaurant. She explains that the French pastry-making tradition is
very strong in her native Iran and that creme caramel is very
popular there. ``Ninety percent of households in my country, when
they have dinner parties, will serve a creme caramel for dessert,''
says Bina-Seibel.
</P>
<P>
   The flan against which I measure all others is probably also the
product of a cross-cultural exchange. I found it in Miami, which is
flan heaven with its jumble of Latin and Caribbean cultures.
Practically every little Cuban cafeteria and Latin or Haitian
restaurant makes a good version of caramel custard. But I found
this flan at the house of my friend Nellie Khoury.
</P>
<P>
   The Khourys, though Lebanese, had lived in Haiti before coming
to Miami, and the recipe of Nellie's mother doubtless owed equal
thanks to the French and Latin influences. Whatever its
antecedents, her flan was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   I did try to make Mrs. Khoury's flan once, but I never got past
caramelizing the sugar. I wound up with a pan full of blackened
sugar crystals and splatter burns on both arms. For years after
that unfortunate incident, I decided to let other people make flan
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've tasted a lot of flan since then. When it's good, as Mrs.
Khoury's is, the custard has a delicate vanilla taste that combines
with, but isn't overpowered by, the caramel sauce. It has the
smooth, velvety texture of pudding, but with more substance. When
it's bad, it's coarse and grainy, or so gelatinous it bounces back
against your spoon, and the caramel often tastes burnt. There's a
lot of bad flan out there.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, during my search for flan, I have actually found
several that measure up to, and even surpass, Mrs. Khoury's. (Lucky
for me, because I misplaced her magic formula after the sugar
fiasco.) I've even learned to caramelize sugar and found some good
recipes, so that now I can have good flan whether I eat out or stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
CARAMELIZED SUGAR
</P>
<P>
   I've tried several methods of caramelizing sugar, but the most
effective one is also, happily, the easiest. Use this method to
prepare the custard cups before proceeding with any of the recipes
that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Butter (for custard cups)
</P>
<P>
   White sugar (see recipes for amounts)
</P>
<P>
   Have on hand the number of custard cups called for in each
recipe. Grease them lightly with butter and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat the
sugar. Periodically swirl the sugar around in the pan, so it heats
evenly. Continue until all the sugar has melted and turned a light
caramel color, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning
the sugar, and handle with caution _ it's very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Pour enough of the caramelized sugar into each custard cup to
coat the bottom and sides. Set the cups aside and make the custard
filling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
DALI'S FLAN
</P>
<P>
   The Dali menu calls this ``Ubiquitous Flan.'' If only that were
true, flan aficionados everywhere would be a very happy bunch. In
fact, it's quite out of the ordinary. The orange peel and triple
sec give the custard a refreshing flavor. It is very easy to make,
and the long cooking time at low heat produces a perfect, firm but
creamy texture.
</P>
<P>
   For the caramel:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the custard:
</P>
<P>
   12 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups light cream
</P>
<P>
   1 can (14 ounces) condensed milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup triple sec
</P>
<P>
   Peels from 2 oranges
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven to 250 degrees. Prepare 10 6-ounce custard cups
with the 2 cups of sugar (see the method above) and have on hand 2
roasting pans that will hold the cups without crowding.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine the eggs, sugar, cream, condensed milk,
and triple sec. Beat lightly until well mixed. In a blender, blend
the orange peels and the milk until the peels are completely ground
up. Strain the milk mixture into the egg mixture. Beat lightly,
then strain again.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the prepared custard cups about 3/4 full of custard. Place
the cups in the roasting pans and fill the pans with enough hot
water to come about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the cups.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until a knife slipped into the
center of the custard comes out clean. Remove the pans from the
oven. Remove the custard cups from the pans and let them cool on a
rack. When they have cooled, cover them with plastic wrap or tin
foil and refrigerate. To serve, run a knife around the inside edge
of the custard cup, then invert onto a serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
LALA ROKH'S CREME CARAMEL
</P>
<P>
   This is the lightest of the three custards. It is easy to
prepare and has a wonderful vanilla taste, while the lemon zest
adds a subtle complexity.
</P>
<P>
   For the caramel:

REDBONES' CARAMEL CUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   Don't go into this Southern barbecue restaurant asking for creme
caramel or flan. They'll tell you in no uncertain terms that they
serve caramel custard. This version is the sweetest of the three,
which makes sense when you think of the Southern desserts it shares
billing with, such as pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   For the caramel:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the custard:
</P>
<P>
   12 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   6 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven to 325 degrees. Prepare 10 8-ounce custard cups
with the 2 cups of sugar (see the method above) and have on hand 2
roasting pans that will hold them without crowding.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the yolks, eggs, 1 1/3 cups of
sugar, and vanilla. Whisk until well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan, combine the milk and the remaining 1 2/3 cup of
sugar. Scald the mixture, but make sure it does not boil.
</P>
<P>
   When the milk mixture is hot, add a little to the egg mixture
and whisk. Add the rest of the milk to the egg mixture, whisking as
you pour. Strain the custard to remove any coagulated egg
particles. Skim any bubbles off the hot custard mix.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the prepared custard cups about 3/4 full of custard. Place
the cups in the roasting pan and fill the pan with enough hot water
to come about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the cups. Bake for 2
hours _ checking frequently after 1 1/2 hours _ until the custard
is set. Remove the custard cups from the pans and let them cool on
a rack. When they have cooled, cover them with plastic wrap or
aluminum foil and refrigerate. To serve, run a knife around the
inside edge of the custard cup, then invert onto a serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 10.

TV NEWS FAILS THE TEST ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Television news just can't to focus on more than
one thing at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It knows how to hover over a story like a single-minded bird of
prey. It can swarm over Los Angeles looking for O.J. Simpson, but
only until Jon Benet Ramsey comes along, or Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Then it skitters off and drops a net on something else, rousting
it out for the American public to gasp at, lingering until it's
drained of meaning, or, in the case of Kosovo, leaving too soon
because Littleton was calling.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to keep the public informed? Television coverage
of the Littleton nightmare, an undeniably important story, has now
gone into around-the-clock overkill. The networks and 24-hour news
channels, during their yearlong Monica binge, managed to avoid the
war's early warnings (you thought President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia started saber-rattling yesterday?), even as the American
public was crying, ``enough Monica, already.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo _ an international story of enormous
complexity _ is a worthy subject for this kind of blanket coverage.
It is one story that stands up to, and would have benefited more
from, recaps and analysis and government briefings.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd have to excuse a refugee from Kosovo who suddenly got
hold of a television set for asking, ``Where did we go?'' The
Littleton massacre rocked this country for a legion of reasons, and
important stories will continue to emerge. But the story did not
necessitate 24-hour coverage; it quickly turned to thinly veiled
exploitation _ O.J., Jon Benet, Monica, by another name.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's either talking about Littleton, even when there's
nothing new to say, or they're on site. ``Nightline,'' MSNBC, CNN,
Larry King, Fox News, all the major networks and everyone's
favorite local television anchors. All the seedy TV shows are
taking advantage of it _ from the daytime talk shows to the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Edition'' has been egregious, tracking down a victim of
the similar shooting in Paducah, Ky., and the father of one of the
Jonesboro, Ark., gunmen. Not to mention student eyewitness accounts
from Littleton and the father of a slain Littleton girl crying for
the nation, snagging huge ratings for ``Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to criticize tabloid shows for feasting on the remains
of the horror, but the line between TV news coverage and tabloid
coverage is nearly indistinguishable these days, something that
couldn't be said as recently as five years ago. Some syndicated
tabloid shows are going out of business now that ``mainstream''
news has gotten seamier in order to compete.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a hopeless suggestion that TV news organizations learn
from the past, given that they haven't up to now. One of the main
problems with a 24-hour news environment is that it's easy to
forget that coverage does not exist in a vacuum. A full day of
Colorado coverage on CNN _ if that were the only outlet available _
might be fine. But Colorado is suddenly the center of the universe
for every station, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   You know things have hit the saturation level when Nickelodeon _
the children's cable channel _ has to ask Linda Ellerbee to explain
(wonderfully) what's going on to the little ones. On April 22 she
aired a special on gun violence and talked about Littleton. Three
days later she hosted a special on the Balkans for the same
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself why we need these shows. Answer: Because children
can't get away from the relentless news coverage, either. Even MTV
is talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   While Kosovo has been pushed to the side, at least there has
been improved coverage. CNN has been leading the pack as usual and
often advances the story when it doesn't have its eye on kids
crying in Colorado. (This is with mandated restraint: An in-house
CNN memo cautioned producers and reporters not to engage in pack
journalism, not to stake out grieving parents and not to put
microphones in front of crying kids _ a memo that hasn't always
been followed.)
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC _ wisely _ has John Hockenberry doing his nightly show
from Albania. But Kosovo is no longer sexy. Even though we should
have averted our eyes from Littleton by this point, TV news says
no, there's more. But is there? If we have to suffer through one
more empathetic reporter, one more analyst trying to explain why
all of a sudden kids have morphed into mini Hitlers, or one more
fade-out of students huddled and crying, we'll burst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that fixating back on Kosovo is the answer.
Balance, that's the key. Maybe it's easier to try and fail to
explain two nut-job teen-agers than it is to dissect a political,
religious and ethnic struggle on the other side of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it's time to pack up and get out. There are
other events we're ignoring, both at home and internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Linger too long, and reality gets bent by all of this
time-filling, repetitive analyzing and emotional hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of its fruitlessness? Look no further than the target
receiving much of the blame for Littleton: TV.
</P>
<P>
   Television is always the whipping boy of the outraged.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton _ perhaps hinting that his V-chip idea and the
much-pondered ratings system won't be enough _ called on Hollywood
to censor itself.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst after paid, talking-head analyst rants about the
destructive nature of television, conveniently forgetting that
people were actually killed _ some randomly, many without reason _
before television came along. Even a crib-sheet knowledge of
American history should tell us that long before anyone sat in
front of that box, unspeakable violence occurred.
</P>
<P>
   And there has not been one instance when a news anchor has
responded to the demonizing of TV by saying, ``That plays well in a
time of crisis or an election year, but you know it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Why botch an interview that is offering, for the umpteenth time,
a scapegoat for this atrocity?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Milosevic grew up on cop dramas? Did ``Walker,
Texas Ranger'' drive those teen-age boys to kill? It might be nice
to pin it all _ even Kosovo _ on Jerry Springer, but it won't
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Talk like that comes from filling time, which you do in
television when you run out of things to say, when your video
images have faded.

MIT TECH MAGAZINE FINDS KILLER APP: COMMERCIALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER MIT TECH MAGAZINE, ON PLATEAU, FINDS KILLER APP:
COMMERCIALISM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July 1996, R. Bruce Journey flew to New York to pitch
advertisers on Technology Review, the MIT alumni magazine that had
just named him publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But a vice president at the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather ad agency turned him
down. The mix of articles in Journey's magazine was too esoteric,
the adman said, citing an article about robots used to clean up
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Bruce, I can buy your magazine's readers 40
different ways,' '' Journey recalls of the rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turned out to be a big turning point for the
Technology Review, which had existed quietly for years as a
contrarian journal on science and policy.
</P>
<P>
   Journey decided to refocus the magazine more closely on its
parent university's hallmark: technology and its commercial
applications. Since then he has replaced most of his staff and
launched a makeover that has shifted the magazine, nearly a century
old, into the booming arena of publications on business and
technology. Now it competes against hot books like Wired and Fast
Company.
</P>
<P>
   The new mission seems to be working. A year after a revamped,
bimonthly version of Technology Review hit newsstands, it claims a
paid circulation of 205,000, more than double the 92,000 it stood
at last year. Advertising is up (Ogilvy &AMP; Mather takes more
interest now). The magazine expects to turn a profit next year. And
it has been nominated for a National Magazine Award for coverage of
controversial topics such as human stem-cell research and
Internet-governance policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With technology being such a hot topic these days, they had to
go more commercial,'' says Reed Phillips, partner at a New York
media investment banking firm. ``They're following the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the changes amount to corporate boosterism.
But others such as Phillips say the new look only reflects the
shift of influential research away from universities and into
for-profit corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Review remains unusual among magazines published by
university alumni societies. Most of them write about research at
their home universities and are distributed mainly to graduates.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, few Technology Review articles concern events or
research at MIT. (A separate alumni notes section is included with
copies of the magazine sent to 40,000 subscribers who graduated
from the Cambridge university.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrival of Journey, a 1976 graduate of Gordon
College, the magazine was published eight times a year and was
often likened to Science magazine and Scientific American. Stories
ranged from a feature about living in Boston without owning a car
to a polemic about the dangers of food irradiation. Editors boasted
of covering ``technology and its implications.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the alumni board complained that the magazine was
too negative and unpredictable to justify annual subsidies of $1.6
million. They supported Journey when he fired the magazine's 22
staffers in November 1997 and invited them to re-apply for their
old jobs. Today, only six of the 22 still work at the magazine,
which is housed near MIT's athletic fields.
</P>
<P>
   One board member, 3Com Corp. founder Robert Metcalfe,
contributed $500,000 to support a direct-mail circulation drive.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Technology Review officially describes itself as ``MIT's
magazine of innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really about new technologies and how they get
commercialized,'' says John M. Benditt, who began as editor in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   To some longtime readers, such rhetoric suggests the magazine
has sold out. ``Please don't turn TR into a company claque,'' wrote
one reader from Chicago in a letter published last year. ``Your
crass entrepreneurial cheerleading leaves me cold,'' wrote a reader
from California.
</P>
<P>
   But Technology Review hasn't backed off controversial public
policy issues. For example, when asked to cite some of the
magazine's best recent work, Benditt mentions a piece by staffer
Antonio Regalado last summer, ``Biotech Taboo.'' It described how
research into human embryonic stem cells was cloaked in corporate
secrecy because of past unwillingness by the federal government to
fund research involving tissue from aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the story's focus on policy, Benditt says, it still fit
the magazine's new emphasis on covering commercial innovation.
``The new TR is very interested in the kinds of policy that have a
bearing on how quickly innovation happens,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another article, ``The Web's Unelected Government,'' described
the MIT-based consortium that sets technical standards for the
World Wide Web and detailed criticism that the group was too
secretive. (The article was written by Simson Garfinkel, a
contributor to this newspaper).
</P>
<P>
   The piece drew complaints from officers of the consortium, who
expected better treatment from a fellow MIT institution. ``It's a
question of whether the issues are treated with the seriousness you
would hope something affiliated with MIT would have, or whether it
came across like a tabloid,'' says one officer, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``In trying to prove they're not a house
organ, they've swung too far in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Benditt says he isn't troubled. ``I thought it was fair and
balanced,'' he says of the story, ``and that's what you set out to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 92,000 people who subscribed to the magazine before the
makeover, fewer than 1,000 canceled their subscriptions, says
Journey.
</P>
<P>
   That loss has been more than offset by new readers. Soon the
magazine will mail copies of its July/August issue to 205,000
readers _ a target its business plan didn't call for until
mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of its main competitors, Fast Company magazine, based in
Boston, had a total paid circulation of 256,000 as of the end of
last year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
California-based Wired magazine had 511,500.
</P>
<P>
   More readers means more ad revenue for Technology Review from
companies like IBM Corp., which ad agency Ogilvy &AMP; Mather has
brought on board. Others include Boeing Co. and General Motors
Corp.'s Corvette division. Between 40 and 55 pages of ads run in
each issue _ up from around 15 pages a year ago. And rates per page
have climbed with the circulation increase: Technology Review now
charges more than $18,000 a page, up from $7,200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Journey says the magazine expects 2000 revenue to reach $10
million, up from $2.4 million in 1997. The magazine also is
considering becoming a monthly, Benditt says.
</P>
<P>
   Readership of many technology magazines is up in part because
``there's an immense hunger everywhere for information, ideas, and
examples of what's going on,'' says William C. Taylor, a cofounder
of Fast Company, which is owned by New York real estate developer
Mortimer B. Zuckerman. He also owns US News &AMP; World Report and The
Atlantic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor thinks readers soon may become more discriminating.
``As with all things in American life, what happens is there's an
excess supply to satisfy demand. In this case, there are far too
many articles and magazines about the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Journey agrees but says his magazine's focus on development in
areas other than information technology will set it apart.
</P>
<P>
   Business gains aside, Journey says he is most pleased by a nod
of approval from the American Society of Magazine Editors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the group named Technology Review _ and competitor
Fast Company _ among five candidates for a National Magazine Award
for general excellence for publications with circulation between
100,000 and 400,000. Technology Review's reinvention shows
``refreshing clarity and authority,'' the judges wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will be announced in New York on Wednesday.

TECH RALLY FUELED BY MORE THAN HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been written in many places, including here, that
technology stocks have climbed to outrageous heights. We're not
backing down from that opinion _ at least not yet. But after poring
through the first-quarter earnings reports of the nation's
technology giants, it is hard not to come away impressed, both by
their current performance and their future potential.
</P>
<P>
   As Buffalo Springfield once sang, ``There's something happening
here.''
</P>
<P>
   A few things jump out:
</P>
<P>
   --The big tech companies are putting up great numbers.
Microsoft's earnings were up 43 percent; IBM's were up 42 percent.
EMC grew its revenue by 36 percent; Lucent Technologies' sales were
up 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The tech companies are doing well overseas, even in parts of
the world that are struggling economically. Gateway, the personal
computer company, said its first-quarter sales rose 65 percent in
Japan, a country in its second straight year of recession. The
Gateway experience is not a fluke. According to International Data
Corp., a Framingham research firm, PC sales in Japan grew 23
percent in the first three months of the year. IBM's revenue in the
depressed Asia-Pacific region was up 20 percent in the first
quarter. Microsoft's Asian sales rose 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to point out that many traditional companies _
the representatives of the old economy _ found the going a lot
rougher overseas. Household names like Gillette, Coke, and Procter
&AMP; Gamble all blamed their disappointing first-quarter sales on weak
foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
   So why are businesses and consumers in Latin America and Asia
still buying computers and telecommunications equipment even as
they are cutting back their purchases of soft drinks and dish
detergent? ``They are doing it because they have to,'' says Ben
Hock, manager of John Hancock's Growth Fund. ``If they don't make
these investments they will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Hock may be overstating the case, but not by a lot. The rest of
the world is well behind the United States in the technology race,
and it is a race other countries cannot afford to lose. Over time
that means they will need to close the gap in personal computer
use, Internet use, and communications technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think two-thirds of our opportunity is outside the US,''
says Jeff Baum, a spokesman for Lucent, which registered a 61
percent hike in foreign sales in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --The US economy can't seem to get enough technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, US shipments of personal computers rose 24
percent in the first quarter, far more than anyone anticipated. The
drop in computer prices seems to be stimulating new purchases; the
growing popularity of the Internet is another big selling point.
Forrester Research of Cambridge estimates that 38 million
households will be on line this year, up from 24 million two years
ago. Cellular phone use is growing, although not quite as rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate side, IDC estimates that the typical large
American company is increasing its telecom spending at a rate of 32
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have noticed. They point out that spending on
business equipment is climbing at the fastest rate since the 1960s.
That capital spending has fueled the current expansion, boosted
productivity, and helped keep inflation low by allowing businesses
to cut their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years into the current recovery, the process shows no sign
of losing steam. ``It's the wave of the future,'' says Allen Sinai,
chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in Waltham. ``It's
why the potential for technology companies is open-ended.''
</P>
<P>
   --Technology begets more technology. Remember the old kids song,
``The thigh bone's connected to the knee bone, the knee bone's
connected to the shin bone . . .,'' technology works much the same
way. As electronic commerce booms, it drives demand for more
computers, which in turn drives the demand for more chips and
software, which drives the demand for more of the switches and
routers the telecom companies produce. ``The whole thing feeds on
itself,'' says Thomas Willmott, president of the Aberdeen Group, a
Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Does all of this good news mean that technology stocks should
sell at 60, 70, or 100 times earnings? Or that Internet stocks
should go up 10 or 20 percent each day?
</P>
<P>
   No. But it does mean that technology is reshaping the world,
that the pace of change is faster than most of us appreciate, and
that the whole process is not going to stop anytime soon. In other
words, technology rules, something investors need to keep in mind
as they make their choices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   Even if the planes don't crash and the power doesn't go off,
there is still plenty to worry about as the year 2000 approaches.
Like will you get your paycheck?
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by the consulting firm of Towers Perrin found that
nearly 70 percent of companies polled said they were not finished
testing the Y2K readiness of their human resources systems. Some
companies said they wouldn't be ready until December.
</P>
<P>
   Towers Perrin noted that in addition to issuing paychecks, human
resources departments have to handle interactions with benefits
providers like 401(k) plans and health insurance companies.

   BOSTON -- The ancient Thracians had neither written language nor
a fixed capital city, so it's not surprising that most of us have
only the vaguest notion of who _ and where _ they were. An
incentive to expand that notion comes in ``Ancient Gold: The Wealth
of the Thracians, Treasures From the Republic of Bulgaria,'' at the
Museum of Fine Arts through June 6. The title alone is a help. The
Thracians were rich, and they lived in what is now Bulgaria,
although the map on the Torf Gallery wall indicates that they also
ranged into what is now a troubled part of the world _ Serbia,
Macedonia, and Bosnia _ as well as reaching south into Greece and
north to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Gold is golden in museums, whether it's the treasure from King
Tut's tomb that's the big draw in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo or
the Trojan gold owned by the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. Tales of how
such treasures were discovered only add to their allure. The
Thracians, who made their money by levying huge taxes on goods
passing through their strategically located territory, didn't leave
monumental architecture behind. Much of the Bulgarian gold now at
the MFA came from burial mounds, some excavated by archeologists,
but others dug up accidentally, by farmers or construction workers,
within the last century. Discovered after the era when ancient
artifacts were routinely spirited off to Western Europe or America,
these have remained in Bulgaria, where they're divided among 19
museums. Now, though, they're on the road, for a US tour to several
venues. At the MFA, they're in the care of classical curator John
Herrmann, who calls the more than 200 objects in the Boston
presentation ``the cream of Bulgarian national treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisans in Varna, on the Black Sea, produced the first known
gold objects worked by human hands, some 7,000 years ago. Their
Thracian successors worked in gold for millennia: The objects in
the MFA show are as recent as AD 400. Like this society of many
tribes itself, the Thracians' designs fluctuated wildly over that
huge expanse of time. The metalwork at the MFA shows influences
from Persian to Hellenistic, a stylistic range from fully modeled
figures to flat, elaborate interlace, iconographies, and
mythologies from East and West _ sometimes within the same piece.
</P>
<P>
   The show is installed not in chronological order, but according
to theme, starting with horses. The importance of the horse to this
warrior culture is instantly evident in the adornments the
Thracians lavished on the beasts. The silver-gilt appliques on
bridles and harnesses weren't merely ornamental: They provided
divine protection as well. Lacking written accounts of their
conquests, the Thracians spelled them out on horse trappings. One
silver medallion depicts the Greek hero Heracles slaying the Nemean
lion, a theme the Thracians appropriated to show the exploits of
their own kings.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the works in the MFA, when the Thracians weren't
battling, they were drinking _ often out of rhytons, ceremonial
vessels, generally in the shape of a bull's horn. The lower part of
one rhyton in the MFA, from the Panagyurishte Treasure discovered
in 1946, is in the form of a goat. Fleet and graceful, its legs
extending into space, it appears to fly. The wine comes out of a
tiny spout in its chest. The goat was a sacrificial animal,
Herrmann notes, and the red wine squirting from it would evoke its
blood, and connect it to a liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   While the sheer quantity of 24-karat gold in the exhibition
dazzles, the craftsmanship impresses even more, especially the
granulation and filigree work on the beaded necklaces Thracian
noblewomen wore. Details like the feathering effects on wings add
depth to surfaces your eye would otherwise bounce off. And on a
stunning gold laurel wreath that once crowned the head of an
aristocrat, the delicately veined leaves reach out in all
directions. Here is nature given immortality.
</P>
<P>
   An exquisite phiale _ a shallow dish _ depicts Heracles'
seduction of Auge, a priestess of Athena, with great psychological
detail and sense of movement. The lusty couple _ you wonder who's
seducing whom _ fairly pop off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-known Thracian text fits on a small and simple ring.
The alphabet is ancient Greek; the words have yet to be fully
deciphered by scholars, but the show's fine catalog offers a recent
suggested translation. Coming from a bellicose society, it is
particularly touching: ``I your young wife, the chosen one, am
dying next (to you), my resting in peace, (I) who brought up the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   A vivid tour Herrmann recently gave ended with a gold cylinder
shape, rather plain by the standards of this show. ``Fertility, in
both humans and animals, was of paramount importance to the
Thracians,'' he said by way of introducing the object. ``There was
no Planned Parenthood. No population control. The more the better.
Hence this penis shield.'' It's impossible not to note that while
this essential item of protection may well have belonged to the
bloodiest warrior on the block, he was rather modestly endowed.

TRUE BELIEVERS OF LIFE(AT)WORK; TABLOID TELEVISION ON THE PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time begat Newsweek begat U.S. News. People begat Entertainment
Weekly begat In Style. Esquire begat GQ begat Maxim begat Stuff for
Men.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout magazinedom, there are so few new ideas, which is one
of the reasons to thank God for Life(at)Work, a bimonthly that's
been publishing since May 1998. Its subtitle tells it all:
``Blending Bibilical wisdom with business excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the March/April issue is innovation, which the
editors approach from several directions, but as you might imagine,
they start at the beginning: ``The first verb in the first chapter
of the first book in the Bible is `bara,' the Hebrew word for
`create.' `In the beginning God created . . . ' ''
</P>
<P>
   From there it is not too great a leap to Jesus, who ``began
articulating a theology of innovation early in His public
ministry,'' write Thomas Addington and Stephen Graves, who the
masthead identifies not just as writers but as two of the
magazine's founders. From two biblical anecdotes about the
``God-Man'' they draw two principles: ``The possibility of new
always exists,'' and ``Innovation is always systemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Life(at)Work gets down to business. There is a case study
on Wal-Mart that reasonably could have been published in, say,
Forbes, or Fortune _ a straightforward look at how a behemoth got
that way and how it stays nimble nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   But the next article veers back toward the cloth: ``Reinventing
the church'' posits what Jesus's ``vision statement'' for the
church might have been, then introduces some innovative ministers
who are looking for fresh ways to carry the message. Writes Rob
Wilkins: ``On a dismal December day in Dayton, (senior pastor Mike)
Slaughter is huddled around a Macintosh G3 with team leaders from
graphics, media, worship, music and technology. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Television pioneer Bud Paxon (Home Shopping Network, the Pax TV
network) gets a turn, and uses it in part to plug corporate
tithing: `` `We have always seen tithing at one level, where all of
this commerce floated down to a paycheck and 10 percent of that was
supposed to be tithed,' Paxon said. `But you take that 10 percent
way back up to the gross, and it's a whole other number.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The point is not particularly whether one believes in Jesus
Christ. Maybe it's that one plaint of skeptics has long been that
too many of the ``faithful'' kneel on Sunday morning, and then are
hellbent for greed the rest of the week. Not only does Life(at)Work
get points for originality, but here is a semi-real-world
enterprise (there's not a single ad in the book) that's trying to
put prophets and profits together.
</P>
<P>
   Along a similar line _ not quite as unusual but newer to
newsstands _ is Solimar, tagged ``Living in the New Millennium.''
Its ``special preview issue'' is dated ``Spring Equinox 1999,''
which gives you an idea of its new age orientation, but the cover
also has the word ``sex'' in bold red capital letters. Its table of
contents is divided into sections of ``self,'' ``family,''
``world,'' and ``community.'' Two features are on Hollywood types
and one of the columns offers ``investment tips for the soul.''
It's a peculiar mix.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The May Maxim is its ``second anniversary special collector's
issue'' (hurry, before they're all gone!) It appears on newsstands
in a faux foil wrapping, touting its insides with the boast, ``So
Hot We Had To Bag It!'' It's got a lot of the usual puerile he-man
stuff _ lots of women in scanties, ``Obi-Wan vs. o. b. tampons,''
and enlightening articles on what your lover says about you to her
babe friends the night after.
</P>
<P>
   But one offering here might actually be worth your time: In
format and attitude (speaking of new ideas), ``100 Things Every Guy
Must Know'' is not unlike Esquire's Dubious Achievement Awards. It
has its predictably shameless facets (i.e., the illustrated ``how
to unclasp a bra with one hand'' _ hey, I'm not proud that I did,
but I read it), but many entries present interesting or useful
information you could share in polite company. Examples from a very
broad range: ``the logic behind Mount Rushmore,'' what the ``33''
means on Rolling Rock beer bottles, the proper temperature to serve
wine, why left-handed pitchers are called southpaws.
</P>
<P>
   Also just out from the creative geniuses at Maxim is Stuff, a
lowlife reality-TV clone put to glossy stock. Some of the stories
they are most proud of: ``I Saw My Wife Get Killed by a Bear,''
subtitled ``A Grizzly Tale'' (get it? grisly? grizzly bear? sure
got a ``roar'' out of that one); ``Brainwash Your Boss and Double
Your Salary,'' and a photo spread of the ``Gnarliest Sports
Injuries of All Time'' (make sure you wait at least a half hour
before diving in). And I was at 20 when I stopped counting all the
practically naked women.
</P>
<P>
   Based on just one issue, it is fair to say there is no redeeming
value to this Stuff. But, as you might expect, it is loaded with
advertising, and it seems far more likely to have a future than,
say, Life(at)Work.
</P>
<P>
   God bless us, one and all.

ELDERLY ESCAPEE JAILED IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 20 years after a daring escape from San
Quentin prison in a makeshift kayak, an elderly thief was back in
custody as a suspect in a Florida bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Silva Tucker, who has a criminal record dating back to
the 1930s and is a member of the ``Over the Hill Gang'' of robbers,
was arrested near Pompano, Fla., April 22 by the police and the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, 78, was wanted by the FBI for allegedly holding up
several south Florida banks and committing other robberies dating
as far back as the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was nabbed while visiting a girlfriend in the Pompano
Beach area. When Broward County sheriff's deputies attempted to
pull him over, he refused to stop and led the authorities on a
low-speed chase. The chase led to a school parking lot, where
Tucker became trapped and crashed into a palm tree trying to flee.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested by officials without incident and is being held
without bond at the Broward County jail on charges of bank robbery
and reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found burglary tools, weapons, police scanners and
a large amount of cash in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Tucker pulled off a daring escape from the San Quentin
prison when he and several other inmates built a makeshift kayak
and floated several hundred yards to shore and fled. Tucker
escaped, but the others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was 15 when he was first arrested for stealing a bicycle.
He was arrested several times thereafter for bank robbery and
served time in Florida and California, including the notorious
Alcatraz prison.

THE TEMPTATIONS OF BEING A TEMP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE FORD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I recently decided it would be a terrific idea
to work as a temp.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that writing doesn't pay really well. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I wanted to work as a temp because I was interested in
observing the ways people behave in a corporate environment, where
millions of dollars are at stake and every employee is compelled to
dress like a cast member of ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, I wanted to work as a temp because, well, because writing
doesn't pay really well.
</P>
<P>
   Temping has a long and honorable history, which lasts just over
15 minutes. That's the amount of time it takes a temp to discover
that, in terms of office status, he or she ranks just below the fax
machine and right above the spittoon. Ha ha, I'm just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Offices don't have spittoons anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't expect temps to know that. Temps come to
corporateland from all walks of life, otherwise known as ``I am an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a temp has as firm a grip on business reality as
does, say, a cat. Funnily enough, a cat is likely to show more
presence of mind when the office copier jams.
</P>
<P>
   Artists are very sensitive. This causes them to do zany things,
like creating nine-day performance pieces with bat sonar
soundtracks, and temping because they believe it will bring them
scads of cash. Artists also are very imaginative, by which I mean
they are very dumb, mainly because they fail to ``imagine'' that
they would make more money by gluing a dust speck to a steel I-beam
and selling it at a fancy downtown gallery than they'll make in
7,594 hours of filing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there comes a happy moment when a reputable temp agency,
whose offices are conveniently located in the back of a primer-
painted 1974 Dodge van, assigns an eager temp to his or her very
first corporate job.
</P>
<P>
   The temp arrives bright-eyed Monday morning at 9 sharp. This is
no mean feat. For most artists, ``early morning'' means ``just
after sundown.''
</P>
<P>
   The canny temp takes some comfort in the fact that, in today's
zinging, info-techno-driven economy, people _ including those with
``permanent'' positions _ are expected to stay at the same job for
no more than three days.
</P>
<P>
   Temps who do find a suitable placement are delighted to discover
the joys of working downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Can I say this? What is it with you downtown people? The
tattoos, the dreadlocks, the kooky shades, the saggy pants and
those bikes you slam around the sidewalks _ what company do you
work for? And does it hire temps? Downtown is a jungle, albeit one
with salad bars.
</P>
<P>
   You come face to face with keen competition, shoving crowds,
crazy traffic, tribal conflict and wild roaming beasts. And that's
just in the Starbucks coffee line.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back to work. If you're a temp, you resume activities
so mind-numbing that you won't notice the blood trickling down your
right hand, a result of having stapled your first three fingers
together. Unfortunately, you also stapled the chief executive's
monthly paycheck to your fingers, which means he now makes a
monthly salary somewhere in the eight digits, not including your
thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But there are trade-offs for having to do work a third-grader
could complete with more skill and panache.
</P>
<P>
   For example: free pens. Also, any company worth its cyber-salt
will have great Internet access. This means you will spend 7 hours
and 40 minutes of your eight-hour day logging on to
KINKYTHINGS.com, where you will become deeply involved in a
supercharged ``instant message'' exchange with a person who, you
discover as details emerge, is seated in a cubicle 8 feet away from
you.
</P>
<P>
   This person's on-line title is ``HotStuff.'' This person's
real-life title is ``Your Supervisor.''
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. For any artist in a temp job, there is plenty of
time to work on personal projects. Not that I would do so; I
believe in doing the work I'm paid to do.
</P>
<P>

BILLY BOB'S ROUNDS UP ITS OWN RECORD LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some nightspots imprint their logos on
matchbook covers or paper coasters or T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob's Texas is going that one better: This week, the
extreme honky-tonk is debuting its own record label, ``Live at
Billy Bob's Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The recordings became available Tuesday at Billy Bob's Texas,
Wal-Mart and Tom Thumb locations. Eddy Raven, John Conlee and Pat
Green, all headliners this year at Billy Bob's, are the first stars
featured on the CDs, which cost $16.98 each.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard magazine says the Fort Worth nightclub is the first
such venue to have its own record label. The CD series will include
only live recordings made at the club during concert appearances,
mostly by veteran performers, and most songs will be vintage
audience favorites. The discs were recorded on 32-track digital
audio equipment set up in a former backstage dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   The label is a cooperative venture between Billy Bob's and Smith
Music Group of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., headed by North Texas native
Rick Smith. The five-year record deal with Smith Music Group calls
for as many as 12 to 20 titles a year. Smith also produces and
licenses music to national retailers including Pier 1 Imports, J.C.
Penney, Whataburger and others.
</P>
<P>
   The first act recorded was Merle Haggard on New Year's Eve. That
CD will be released in June. Future releases will include Roy
Clark, Moe Bandy and Joe Stampley.
</P>
<P>
   During Clark's recent taping, there were no distracting
mechanics onstage, nor any retakes or lengthy technical pauses to
dampen his momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it turns out that we can capture the magic from the
audience that we always have here,'' Clark said backstage before
going on. ``They don't ever want you to quit here, and you don't
want to leave, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expects ``a feeding frenzy'' when other venues
realize that they could do something similar, though he says only
Billy Bob's has the reputation to sell it. Ray Price and Waylon
Jennings are contracted to do albums, Smith says, and deals are
pending with the Bellamy Brothers, Kris Kristofferson, Crystal
Gayle, Lee Greenwood and Charley Pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with these guys is it's so hard to promote them
individually anymore. So we're bringing them all under the Billy
Bob's banner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the ``greatest hits'' aspect of the song selection
was a benefit to artists like him, whose lifetime catalog is more
important than any new material he might record.
</P>
<P>
   Quality control, however, was a concern from the outset. Things
can get pretty rowdy at Billy Bob's on a Saturday night. Eddy
Raven, who has played two or three dates at the club every year
since it opened in 1981, knows this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical at first,'' he said. ``Would it be good
quality? But it seems like they're doing it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Crow, who hosts a weekend Texas music program at KSCS/96.3
FM, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is studio quality, but yet you get a live feel,'' said
Crow after he heard the Pat Green preliminary mix. ``A lot of live
albums, you hear the crowd too much, but this is just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's inclusion here is an anomaly, because the young Texan is
an up-and-comer who released a live album just last year. But Crow
said Green's CD could give the entire project a certain
contemporary sheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, Billy Bob's could have a superstar on their label,''
he said.

CATHOLIC PROJECT HELPS YOUNG WOMAN COPE WITH TWO ABORTIONS

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The clay angel Victoria Hinojosa molded with her
own two hands is a ``memorial'' to her daughter. A basket cradling
doves inside a Christmas tree bulb and surrounded by dried rose
buds is in honor of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella and Michael.
</P>
<P>
   She named them, even though she's never seen them or had any
physical proof of their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa calls herself a mother ``whose children aren't here
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   They're gone because the resident of San Marcos, Texas, has had
two abortions _ the first when she was 19 and the second at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose the abortions because I was weak and couldn't stand up
to my parents,'' Hinojosa said. ``My self-esteem was so weak. I
needed them to be encouraging and they said `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Five years have passed since her last abortion, and during that
time Hinojosa has gone from the lowest point in her life to a place
where she smiles again and doesn't punish herself.
</P>
<P>
   She credits friends in Austin who opened their home and hearts
to her, and eventually led her to a program offered by the Diocese
of Austin called Project Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest fears a lot of us have is that God will
punish us for wasting what he gave us,'' Hinojosa said of the
theory that some women who have abortions become infertile. ``It
was through Project Rachel that I knew God had forgiven me.''
</P>
<P>
   And through Project Rachel, Hinojosa is able reconcile with
herself, her unborn babies and God. The program encouraged her to
name the babies, create memorials to them and forgive those
involved in the abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The post-abortion reconciliation program was started in the
Archdiocese of Milwaukee in 1984 by Vicki Thorn and has been
adopted by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Dioceses
across the United States are encouraged to start it, and so far 110
have.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel was the woman in the Old Testament who ``mourns her
children ... because her children are no more.'' Thorn said she
started the program after watching a friend ``suffer through the
pain of her abortion. ''
</P>
<P>
   She said Catholic women are just as likely to have abortions as
non-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about saying `Shame on you.' It's about saying,
`We're here for you,''' Thorn said. ``It isn't about inducing guilt
trips. It's really about a journey, it's not about magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Open to people of all faiths, the program offers a variety of
counseling to help women, men, family members and friends who have
had some role in an abortion. It includes eight weekly group
sessions, a weekend retreat, individual counseling from a priest or
a licensed mental health professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring them to face their abortion honestly, but in
a safe, confident context where they understand we wouldn't even
have this program if it wasn't for the love of them and love of
their child,'' said Helen Alvare, spokeswoman for the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops. ``We don't hold ourselves out to
these women as better or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church has been steadfast in its opposition to
abortion, but in 1995, Pope John Paul II called for women who had
abortions to come back to the church in his encyclical that reads
in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``You will come to understand that nothing is definitively lost,
and you will also be able to ask forgiveness from your child, who
is now living in the Lord. With the friendly and expert help and
advice of other people and as a result of your own experience, you
can be among the most eloquent defenders of everyone's right to
life.''
</P>
<P>
   While the program has been available for 15 years, the
Archdiocese of San Antonio is now launching Project Rachel.
Counselors and priests have been trained, and the first weekend
retreat is planned for September.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has a new name, post-abortion counseling has always
been available to people involved in abortions, said Monsignor

   ``This isn't something we just started to do. If five years ago
someone came and said they had an abortion, we wouldn't say `You're
gone,' I've cried and welcomed them back,'' he said. ``If this
person wants to stand rightly before the God of the church, then we
need to do everything we can to help them do it. There are those
who have had abortions who say, `God, I'm sorry. I want to come
home.'''

   Mary Ann Parks coordinates the program in San Antonio. She said
a society that made abortions legal also expects women who end
their pregnancies to walk out of a clinic and continue with life
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are not allowed to grieve. You're suppose to be happy,''
she said. ``Abortion is a deep wound. A woman has to be brought to
a sense of forgiveness by herself and her church before she's fully
able to be accept the forgiveness of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of abortion rights argue that trauma is not the main
emotion linked to the procedure. Jo Ann King-Sinnett of Planned
Parenthood of San Antonio said women who are upset or experience
depression represent a small percentage compared to those who are
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is depression or emotions felt it may be related to
other problems or complications by the unintended pregnancy,'' she
said. ``Studies have shown that the No. 1 emotion that women feel
after having an abortion is relief. They're able to go on with
their life.''
</P>
<P>
   But going on with her life was the last thing Hinojosa could do
after her first abortion at age 19. Immediately following the
15-minute procedure in her hometown of Houston, she recalls sitting
in a recliner chair in a room with other women. Television sets
were on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a woman crying and I wanted to console her, but I
couldn't. I felt empty inside,'' she said. ``There was nothing
inside me to give. In order to get through something like this, you
have to be so completely numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents wanted her to get on with her life, but she ended up
dropping out of Austin College and started working in public
theater where she always accepted erotic roles and often dressed in
provocative clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't turn to drugs or alcohol. I just wanted to publicly
shame myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa met an old friend through the theater, started a
relationship with him and was pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, her first reaction was to keep her baby, but her
parents opposed the idea. Her boyfriend told her it was her
decision, and in the end, she terminated the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa said all trust with her parents was broken and she's
never been able to rebuild a positive relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abortions ripped our family apart,'' she said. ``I was so
angry at them and they didn't understand and they've never wanted
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after the second abortion, Hinojosa moved to Austin
to start life over. She met people she calls ``very religious'' who
introduced her to Project Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Episcopalian, Hinojosa was reluctant to attend, but
she found it was just what she needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they want is for you to tell your story. Many
women have this story hidden in them an average of 12 years,'' she
said. ``It's important to tell. It's no longer this secret, this
personal hell.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing Project Rachel, Hinojosa converted to the
Catholic faith. She's now a director of Project Rachel in Austin
and also works at a crisis pregnancy center.
</P>
<P>
   Her small apartment in San Marcos, a town south of Austin, is
typical of a college student except for the many religious icons
and pictures of saints decorating the walls. Among those items are
the two memorials to her babies _ the clay angel and the Christmas
bulb in a basket of roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created these art pieces to remember my kids,'' she said.
``I don't want to replace them, I don't want to cover them up. You
never get over it.''

   Ann Strawser of Arlington, Texas, saw our request from Lane
Bowles for a chewy chocolate bar and e-mailed the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just reminiscing recently about the day our neighbor
in Ohio, in the '70s, brought us a plate of these bars. They have
been our family's favorite ever since and a must at Christmas time.
They cut best when cool, if you can wait that long. We always have
to dig out a few while they are still warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daughter in Ohio always gives us a container of these to
eat on our long drive back to Texas after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you might slide into a snow bank and have
to live on them for a few days.''

   CIR-JOB-SEARCH (Undated) _ Before the Internet, job searches
were done in person. College career offices were nerve centers on
campus, as places where students would leaf through binders full of
career information and sign up for interviews with employers who
came to campus. Job fairs required attendance. The firm handshake
and clear gaze were the order of the day. Now most students visit
career centers on line first. They post resumes and search for job
information on the Internet. They may close the deal in person, but
they often start in front of the computer. By Lisa Guernsey

   DESIGN-PRINCESS (New York) _ Earlier this month, Christina
Magnusson, a sophisticated 50-something Swede, sat in a Manhattan

fact that Mrs. Magnuson is a sister of King Carl XVI Gustav and
thus a princess, might make her interest in juice glasses seem
strange. But in Sweden, where the creation of everyday objects has
been elevated to a fine art, the term ``Design Princess'' is a

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no other company like it, and yet the
Metropolitan Opera may end up a model for the future. In the season
just closed and the one to come, the Met continues a practice of
self-sufficiency and free enterprise that is largely unfamiliar to
the international opera world.
</P>
<P>
   But now we see the free-spending ways of government-subsidized
opera houses being strenuously curbed. Indeed, the adventurous, the
innovative and sometimes the reckless are no longer automatically
underwritten by generous European ministries of culture.
</P>
<P>
   The new bedfellows in opera are financial responsibility and
art, and it is not love at first sight. European houses once looked
down on the Met as a business operation bent on staying in
business. Things have changed. London's Covent Garden is
momentarily silent for renovations and fiscally on its knees.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 major Italian houses that once threw away lavish new
productions after a single use are sweating over money. France is
still generous, but even German houses are finding they need more
performances of ``Die Fledermaus'' to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times a week, more than 200 times a year, the Met puts
forth seamlessly managed theater. Its backstage is the envy of the
world. Things work; people work. Foreign directors know the
built-in problems _ the size of the house, in particular _ but they
love to come.
</P>
<P>
   For whether their productions are good or bad, they have a good
chance of being honestly portrayed. Opera always comes with a
degree of chaos, but here there is less.
</P>
<P>
   So the Met becomes a subject of study. Europeans never had to
learn about private fund-raising but need to in a hurry. The Met
knows. It is efficient and productive and earns the vast percentage
of its income. Government support runs from small to laughable (now
less than half a percent).
</P>
<P>
   Those erstwhile European critics had a point. The Norman
Rockwell-like realism and standard repertory depressed us all, and
to a degree still do. But through all the missteps and victories of
this last season, one feels a new conscience in place. Works that
must be done are being done, and pragmatic businessmen who care
about art are finding ways to make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for opera's hit parade, lavishly produced, remains
voracious. This season I counted 21 performances of ``Aida,'' 19 of
``La Boheme'' and 14 of ``Tosca.'' The Met's new ``Traviata,'' the
latest of Franco Zeffirelli's overstatements, did not appear until
late November but was worked hard thereafter (13 times).
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to argue artistically against these productions.
``Aida'' can't be big enough, but ``Boheme'' is an ensemble opera,
even a chamber piece, and aside from Zeffirelli's very successful
Act III, Puccini's intimate lives tend to be swallowed by
overpopulation. ``Tosca,'' also from Zeffirelli, suffers from a
similar elephantiasis. The new ``Traviata'' seems more interested
in Empire-style interior decoration than in music.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is grand opera, with the emphasis on ``grand.'' And
there is a part of our operatic hearts that will always long for
the shallow spectacle. Indeed, opera's loyal majority worldwide
clamors for opera to be grand: it wants operas that it knows and
wants them to be big. There is nothing wrong with that. It is part
of the tradition, and for intendants raising money and selling
tickets, it is fiscal necessity.
</P>
<P>
   But look what else the Met gave us this season: Schoenberg's
``Moses und Aron,'' a historical document if not great opera but
hardly a barn-burner at the box office. ``Wozzeck'' returned, the
hair-raising theatrical experience that ``Moses und Aron'' will
never be. ``Katya Kabanova'' was a connoisseur's delight if not
catnip for the ticket buyer. Robert Wilson's ``Lohengrin,'' initial
kinks reportedly worked out, returned as well.
</P>
<P>
   The solution has been sane: play difficult pieces fewer times. A
smaller audience will have the substance it craves, and the chances
of gapingly empty houses are diminished. ``Katya'' and ``Moses und
Aron'' played six times. ``Wozzeck'' only three.
</P>
<P>
   It is an oversimplification but not completely untrue that the
Met balances itself between two very different men. Joseph Volpe
manages a house whose workings he has learned from the ground up;
and he is known by employees as a tough and often unforgiving
administrator. Volpe is, if not by training, then by experience, a
man of the arts, and one can infer from his actions over the last
few years that he will do the right thing even if it is not to his
personal taste.

of the season, is Volpe's alter ego. Opera is by its nature a world
of exaggerated emotion and gesture, so it is difficult not to think
that some element of power struggle is in play.
</P>
<P>
   These are two big but different personalities. Volpe does not
shy from unpleasant decisions and in fact seems to relish them. His
unbending attitude toward such operatic egos as Kathleen Battle and
Angela Gheorghiu, both of whom have felt Volpe's exclusionary
wrath, has been correct if brutal; yet one almost feels that he has
enjoyed his decisiveness too much.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Levine avoids unpleasantness, hates confrontation but knows how
to get his way. We should rejoice in how well Volpe is running
things; bad productions and bad singers find their way into the
house, but there are more and more good ones. Never forget,
however, that Levine is the binding force at the Met. It could be a
well-run house in his absence; but if it is a great house, it is,
at the end of the day, because of him.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think we truly take in what a great conductor James
Levine is. Greatness is best seen at a distance, and he is before
us on an almost daily basis. I have never heard Levine's best
qualities come across on records, but as his symphonic work with
the Met Orchestra expands, perhaps that will come.
</P>
<P>
   His work in the opera house, experienced firsthand, produces
wonders of coordination, and I know of no one else who can project
powerful emotional force with such utter instrumental elegance.
That was clear to anyone at the recent revival of ``Wozzeck,''
where shattered nerves and flawless sound were not in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the appearance of Valery Gergiev as a Met associate
threatens Levine's hegemony is not yet clear, but it is profitable
_ and here I think Volpe has done a good thing _ to have some
musical brutishness to counterbalance the amazing beauty of
Levine's conducting. In times to come, Gergiev will be remembered
as the busiest of our conductors, but Levine _ for his command of
the German and Italian repertory and for his dedication to modern
music _ will have the more profound effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Opera enjoys a powerful donor base, wonderful
organizational skills and perhaps the best pit orchestra anywhere.
It has James Levine. The Met also has New York, media capital of
the world. Top-rated singers, who can earn bigger fees elsewhere,
come here not only to sing in a house that works but also for the
extraordinary exposure they receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Met must battle artistically with a space that is literally
twice too large but whose 3,800 seats, filled, are necessary to
survival. This season, ``The Queen of Spades'' occupied all of that
room with great success; Britten's ``Billy Budd'' (not done this
year) does it better than any Met production I know.
</P>
<P>
   Given the right piece and some imagination, the house works; its
acoustics are very good, considering the distances sound must
travel.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the physical nature of the place has a
disconcerting effect on both performance style and the way opera
voices are developed and managed. Mozart can be beautiful here, but
it is very different from Mozart in Vienna's tiny Redoutensaal.
</P>
<P>
   Young singers and their teachers know that the Met is a major
part of a successful career and that many beautiful voices of
limited carrying power will not work in it. Big becomes better, and
this can be unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   For a company to make its living at the Met's level is a
constant struggle, and the conflict between commerce and art is
carried on daily. So wise in so many ways, the house makes
decisions that from the outside look inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   The casting problems for ``La Traviata'' began as bad luck, but
the solutions to a series of dropouts and dismissals were just bad
thinking. Handel's ``Giulio Cesare, which closed the season, was
well sung but vulgar to the eye. Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah'' is a
sweet little opera, but setting it down in the grandness of the Met
was not wise.
</P>
<P>
   Successful institutions like the Metropolitan Opera will always
attract the sharpest criticism and the closest scrutiny. This is
both fair and unfair, but it is so. Indeed, if this house had less
intrinsically to offer, if its gifts and accomplishments were not
so obvious, there might be more patience for things gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But the Met needs no one's charity. That listeners want and
expect so much of it is the highest compliment that could be paid.

BEYOND SEQUELS: IT'S ON TO THE HOLLYWOOD HYBRID  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Franz Lidz, the author of ``Unstrung Heroes,'' and Steve Rushin,
the author of ``Road Swing,'' are senior writers at Sports
Illustrated.  
 By FRANZ LIDZ and STEVE RUSHIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days of the sequel are numbered. Or rather, Roman numeraled.
``Lethal Weapon,'' the Mel Gibson vehicle that went from zero to IV
in 11 years, will have no '99 model. Rocky Balboa's five-bout film
career ended in 1990, after a savage critical beating that left
him, and moviegoers, with collateral brain damage. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, whose most famous film line is, ``I'll be back,''
won't be: The Terminator's term limit was two.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, because the sequel and prequel have become
cinematic Nyquil, putting audiences to sleep with their metronomic
monotony. This summer film season, for the first time in memory,
audiences will endure but a single sequel (``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me'') and a single prequel (``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace'').
</P>
<P>
   We may have seen the last of Kryptonite (``Superman'') and
crypto-knights (``Batman and Robin'') and crypted nights
(``Dracula''). This diehard genre _ indeed, this ``Die Hard'' genre
_ is comatose. Have we finally felled this sequential Sequoia,
silenced this sequential cicada?
</P>
<P>
   If so, audiences will never have to see Denzel Washington in
``Malcolm XX'' or Brad Pitt in ``Seven 11.'' Then again, one lesson
horror sequels teach is that the villain is never quite dead. The
sequel may well rise from the grave and return in an altered state
(a 1980 film curiously without sequel).
</P>
<P>
   It takes little imagination _ and Hollywood executives have just
that _ to envision the grim future. Inevitably, as more studios
consolidate and media mergers proliferate, companies will comb
their back catalog of successful sequels, gene-splicing different
genres together to form lucrative new franchises. In fact, the
following are already in development: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If ever two franchise players needed filmic defibrillation, they
are Dashiell Hammett's Thin Man and Ian Fleming's James Bond. By
installment No. 6 of ``The Thin Man'' movies, the characters' sharp
edges had been removed with a No. 17 sandpaper. The once manly 007
has been neutered, and worse, now has a license to shill.
</P>
<P>
   In this unholy matrimony, the new Thin Man (Alan Thicke) and his
much thinner wife (Calista Flockhart) founder in a much, much
thinner plot entailing a solid-gold Beretta (Robert Blake) and
peppered with product placements (Wheat Thins, Rold Gold pretzels,
Gulden's mustard ... ) The couple rubs elbows _ or, elbow _ with
The Man With The Golden Arm (a woefully miscast Hideki Irabu), head
of the reviled organization Jobless, Obscure Ex-Performers
Inflicting Senseless Chaos on Public Order (J.O.E.P.I.S.C.O.P.O.).
These franchises are revived; alas, the audience cannot be. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `FATHER OF THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You remember her: That twitching, lurching woman with a
frightening muddle of hair and a scream like mating cheese graters.
But enough about Diane Keaton, female lead in ``Father of the
Bride'' I and II. This time, director John Frankenheimer stitches
the 1991 lite comedy to the 1935 horror classic _ and meta-sequel _
``Bride of Frankenstein.'' Steve Martin once again plays the
father.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, whose toy canon of New Yorker ``casuals'' is prescribed
reading in Viennese sleep-disorder clinics, finds his long-lost
muse, which has been in a federal witness protection program since
1986's ``Three Amigos!'' Scheduled for 2002: ``Godfather of the
Bride of Frankenstein.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN, TEXAS, CHAIN SAW MASSACRE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A (con)fusion of ``Austin Powers'' and ``Texas Chainsaw
Massacre'' in which Mike Myers, as the dentally ill British
superspy, has his part cut. Fortunately, doctors are able to sew it
back on. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BRUCE WAYNE'S WORLD OF APU' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Bermuda triangulation of sequel machines: ``Batman,''
``Wayne's World'' and ``The World of Apu,'' Satyajit Ray's 1959
tour de force. A pirated copy of the soundtrack master tape has
yielded an underground hit single in England: ``My Pappadum Told
Me.'' Already in the can is an arranged marriage between Ray's 1955
feature ``Pather Panchali'' and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau.
The result is due out next summer: ``Pink Panther Panchali.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SHERLOCK HOLMES ALONE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red-Headed League (the lounge comics Red Buttons, Red
Skelton, Redd Foxx and Shecky Greene, working blue) opens a British
branch of the Friars Club at 221-A Baker Street. Their relentless
roasting, interminable toasting and Borscht Belt boasting
exasperates the rabbit-eared resident of apartment 221-B, young
Sherlock Holmes (MacCauley Culkin). So Mac enlists the aid of Emily
Watson, Michael Moriarty and Rupert Holmes, whose ``Pina Colada
Song'' is featured in the stunning opening sequence, set at the
Hyde Park Hilton's rooftop tiki bar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ROCKY ROAD WARRIOR' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream impresarios Ben and Jerry (Ben and Jerry Stiller)
battle Baskin (``Mad Max's'' Mel Gibson) and Robbins (``Rocky's''
Sylvester Stallone) for control of a Nazi submarine in what Daily
Variety is calling a ``Haagen-Das Boot.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `HOOK KNOWS (WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER)' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wes Craven's sequel to Steven Spielberg's sequel to Walt
Disney's animated film of John Barrie's children's book ``Peter
Pan.'' Starring Golden Globe winner Robin Williams (``Hook'') and
Gold Glove winner Bernie Williams. The movie's ``Hook Knows'' title
is unfortunate, as is the Yankee centerfielder's torpid
performance. Indeed, the project has already been denounced by both
the Anti-Defamation League and the American League. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `2048 HOURS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This puzzling film is a sort of Rubik's Kubrick in which
Kubrick's rubric is Confuse the Viewer. HAL, the murderous computer
from ``2001'' and ``2010,'' has been working malevolently at an
airline reservation counter. He is (italics)really(end italics)
having computer problems: Ravaged by the Melissa virus, made
anxious by Y2K hysteria, incompatible with the Apple of his eye,
Hal (IBM's Big Blue) uplinks with Microsoft's mainframe and
transfers $27 of Bill Gates' fortune to charity. Outraged, Gates
enlists Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, the buddy team of ``48 Hours''
and ``Another 48 Hours,'' to help take a byte out of crime. Chevy
Chase, the self-styled ``King of All Sequels'' (``Caddyshack,''
``National Lampoon's Vacation,'' ``Fletch'') cameos in multiple
alien roles: a Vulcan, a Romulan, a Talaxian, a Comedian.

STORYTELLERS VS. TOY SELLERS: WE ALL LOSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How quaint to recall the days when doubting a movie's honesty
meant wondering whether its hero was standing on a box. Now there
are more important things to question: whether the box is virtual
or real, and whether it contains anything that the film might want
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing prevalence of the many-tentacled corporate
concept known as vertical integration, we've seen ever more
ingenious ways to undermine what appears on screen. Would-be hits
on the summer horizon offer an invitation to visit the Web site,
buy the toys, wear the T-shirt, hear the soundtrack and play the
video game. Oh, if there's time left over, see the movie, too.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this tie-in mentality are most noxious, though
least dangerous, when the hucksterism is at least out in the open.
The already execrable ``Baby Geniuses,'' a Tri-Star Pictures
release, amazingly found a way to make itself even worse: one
sequence featured a tot visiting a shopping mall to play with
merchandise by Sony, the studio's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers bombarded by advertising in once-sacrosanct places, like
milk cartons or the movie theater itself, have every reason to
resent such glaring product plugs in the midst of a story. A film
like the otherwise admirable ``Election'' should be able to
illustrate what being in second place means without using a Pepsi
for a prop.
</P>
<P>
   True, we've long since grown inured to commercial opportunism.
And it doesn't often do serious damage to a story. Though the
satire ``EdTV'' was undercut by the actual brand names that flashed
(not so satirically) on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But this casually venal atmosphere has softened resistance to
so-called vertical thinking, whereby a film company, its corporate
parent and other, synergistically linked interests can manufacture
films to suit their collective interests. Need No. 1 will always be
an audience, but beyond that, there's no telling where the
strategic thinking may lead.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it in terms of the most influential pop idea of the
moment, the virtual reality game. And think of moviegoers as
reluctant players, never sure they can trust what they see. Have
the characters in a film's story been created for dramatically
legitimate reasons, or are we merely watching a prospective action
figure with a pulse? (``Small Soldiers'' found a way to offer
both.)
</P>
<P>
   And are the principals' fates being manipulated for the sake of
a franchise? In sequel-prequel circles, it's always been a given
that nobody worth rehiring deserves to die. But any movie directed
by a filmmaker whose television commercials looked great on the
Super Bowl is just as liable to take that same puppeteer's approach
to exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was unnerving last summer to learn that whole
cities were being blown up as afterthoughts in ``Armageddon''; only
at a late stage in the filmmaking was it determined that Paris
should go kaboom for the sake of more exciting advance promotional
spots for the film. Decisions like that reduce viewers to woefully
insignificant creatures on a film's overall food chain.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie's mission is defined in terms of corporate goals
and tie-in opportunities, the audience's role is reduced to simply
showing up. No filmmaker builds for the future with such tactics.
But when the marketers' thinking is sufficiently vertical, the
future doesn't last much past opening weekend anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident last summer to find that the runaway sleeper
hit, ``There's Something About Mary,'' showed no apparent concern
for any of these business strategies. The Farrelly brothers' comedy
looked happily oblivious, and that was a hefty part of its charm.
If their film hoped to pitch anything besides big laughs, that
strategy never showed, and in any case it would have been obscured
by such an oversupply of anarchic glee.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of seemingly dumbed-down escapism, whether from
the Farrellys or Adam Sandler, is a reaction against the slick
cinematic engineering that prevails elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If one response to vertical integration and its monolithic
thinking is rebellion, there's also a worse one: boredom. When a
film becomes the nexus of such a complex marketing juggernaut,
inevitable consequences include weariness and even deja vu. Nobody
on this planet will be able to approach the ``Star Wars'' prequel,
``The Phantom Menace,'' with a sense of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   So much commerce rides on this product, so much advance flogging
has been necessary, that the film's own innate appeal is
compromised. Even the ``Phantom Menace'' screenplay will be out
before the film itself arrives.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that an incestuous corporate climate is
more beneficial to incestuous corporations than to filmmakers _ at
least in the short run. Over time, it helps nobody.
</P>
<P>
   When films are denatured enough to make splendid products, they
will have morphed into something very different from bona fide
events (``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'') that
audiences don't dare miss. The more a movie resembles a plaything
or theme park ride, the more easily it is cloned and copied until
it loses any compelling spirit of its own.
</P>
<P>
   And the more audiences are reduced to bit players in the
corporate hit-making, the less inclined they may be to buy, play,
wear, read or snack as instructed. The more vertically integrated a
film's conception and marketing, the less distinct the film is from
all the other products.
</P>
<P>
   Until we reach that point in the assembly line, let's hope that
seeing the movie still counts for more than chewing the gum.

MONUMENTS OF JUNK ARTFULLY COMPACTED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, Nancy Rubins received a phone call
from out of the blue. For her, it was like winning the Lotto. The
director of a kunsthalle in Austria said he had heard that Air
France had a defunct Concorde airplane.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Rubins was willing to create an installation at his
kunsthalle, the director promised he would arrange for her to have
the plane free of charge, not to fly but to use as material for her
art. ``I was just salivating,'' she recalled. ``I couldn't wait to
get my hands on an entire Concorde and cut it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people would relish such an opportunity, let alone receive
the offer, even though it didn't work out in the end. But Ms.
Rubins, 46, a sculptor who creates monumental works out of oversize
junkyard debris is in the Rolodex of certain suppliers of airplane
parts. They call her when something special comes in, like a
dismembered fuselage, a severed wing or a battered engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors and shapes are just gorgeous,'' she said. ``They're
really voluptuous. I love the holes, the orifices. They're almost
obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   For her show that opened Saturday at the Paul Kasmin Gallery,
Ms. Rubins has created an extravagant aluminum-and-stainless-steel
sculpture out of a few thousand pounds of colorful airplane parts,
as well as 600 pounds of wire. Despite its heft, the work is
designed to cantilever effortlessly from one end of the gallery to
the other, cresting like a titanic wave nearly 15 feet into the air
over a wall dividing the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks precarious,'' said Ms. Rubins. ``But in actuality,
it's very solid. The sculpture is bolted to the floor. Plus,
airplane parts are quite light. After all, they are meant to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the work was created specifically for the gallery, the
sculpture was actually reassembled there after it was first built
atop a staggeringly steep hill in Topanga Canyon, Calif., where Ms.
Rubins lives with her husband, the artist Chris Burden. Dogs loll
about their modest, light-filled house packed with the miniature
toys and train tracks that Burden uses in his art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubins' trove of refuse litters the grounds _ piles of hot
water heaters and an old mobile home that were once part of a
sculpture, along with heaps of airplane parts. It is here, against
the surrounding landscape of rugged, olive-colored hills textured
with cactus plants, where the scent of eucalyptus and lemon trees
perfumes the air, that Ms. Rubins fabricates many of her pieces.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of three assistants, it took a month to complete
the work now on view. To determine the scale of the sculpture, Ms.
Rubins marked off the gallery's dimensions and layout on her gravel
driveway with pieces of string. Climbing up and down a scaffolding,
she and her assistants constructed a steel armature onto which the
airplane parts were fastened with a web of wire cables. ``I kind of
engineer by the seat of my pants,'' she said, explaining how she
achieves her gravity-defying compositions in which the jagged,
roiling forms appear to be suspended in a midair crash, like a clap
of visual thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Rubins' materials call to mind technological
obsolescence, destruction and the discarded waste of a consumer
society, her work has been read as social commentary. But the
artist insists that her concerns are purely formal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really interested in the balance, engineering and
tenuousness of the objects, as well as the dynamic tension and
energy created by the wires,'' she said. ``We build these things in
a very gradual way. A continuum starts happening with one piece
attached to another. I'm thinking about the way that crystals or
cells grow. I'm interested in the bigger picture. People can draw
very specific conclusions about the materials, to find something in
it for themselves, but that's not what makes the piece work as a
work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 70s, Ms. Rubins has been developing her signature
monumental style and precarious compositions from scrap-heap finds.
But it was during her childhood growing up in Tullahoma, Tenn.,
that she first became enthralled with objects discovered by
happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in the woods and there were Civil War trenches,''
she recalled. ``Sometimes we'd find arrowheads and bullet casings.
I remember these wacky art shows in the Appalachian mountains where
local painters would set up their paintings on trails in the woods.
That was my cultural exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubins attended the Maryland Institute of Art in Baltimore
and received her Master of Fine Arts degree in 1976 from the
University of California at Davis, where she created igloolike
sculptures out of mud, concrete and straw. After graduate school,
she became fascinated with bricolage artists, who make their work
from found objects.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered Antonio Gaudi, the Catalonian architect who
designed fantastic facades out of ceramic tiles and cut stone. She
was awed by Simon Rodia, who built Watts Towers, and Grandma
Brisbee, a folk artist who constructed houses out of glass bottles.
``The desire to make something beautiful out of whatever you have
got appealed to me,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Thus inspired, she started scavenging the local Goodwill and
Salvation Army stores in San Francisco, where she was living at the
time, collecting nearly 300 television sets for 25 to 50 cents a
piece. She packed them together with concrete and painted them
florescent orange. But the objects just did not ``transcend their
TV-ness,'' she said, with lingering disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a cataclysmic event occurred, and a light bulb went off in
her head. Late one night, an actual earthquake hit, and Ms. Rubins
watched in disbelief as the concrete walls in her apartment began
to undulate. ``I never thought something that hard and solid could
be so fluid,'' she said. ``It embraced a certain contradiction that
I started thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   And so began her experimentation with the nature of gravity,
found objects and stability versus movement. At first she
constructed thin, free-standing concrete walls that oscillated when
she pushed them. Then she layered the concrete with a new cache of
Salvation Army finds, small appliances like hair dryers, electric
shavers, waffle irons, and hot dog cookers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The result was a wall _ 22 feet long, 12 feet high, no wider
than a toaster _ imbedded with thousands of consumer castoffs. ``I
figured out what you can do with materials and how to cantilever
things from the experience of making those works,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the 80s, Ms. Rubins had moved on to Herculean projects. With
money from the Washington Project for the Arts, an alternative art
center in the capital, she built ``Worlds Apart'' (1982), an
assemblage of steel, concrete and electric appliances that
mushroomed 45 feet into the sky alongside the Whitehurst Freeway
near the Watergate building. Provoking public outrage, the piece
was decried as a visual atrocity. (After that, Ms. Rubins gave up
public commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Paul Schimmel, the chief curator of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, was impressed. ``To take the
muscularity of Abstract Expressionism and push it to a monumental
level, the work was no longer a public sculpture but an outdoor
monument,'' he said. ``Nancy is really about formalism. Her roots
are in David Smith and John Chamberlain. But no one had ever taken
it to the heroic level that she had, and to do it in D.C., where
there are these public monuments, was really something. It created
an uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that Ms. Rubins was both extending and challenging the
tradition of modernist sculpture, Schimmel watched her closely for
the next 10 years. He took increased notice when she started using
enormous inanimate objects, like hot water heaters, dishwashers and
cut-up trailer homes _ ``swollen appliances,'' as she described
them _ to create organic-looking forms. When the time came for
Schimmel to put together ``Helter Skelter,'' his 1992 blockbuster
exhibition about contemporary Los Angeles artists, Ms. Rubins was
prominently featured. In fact, her work dominated the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a sculptor waiting to happen, and it was explosive,''
Schimmel said of Ms. Rubins' behemoth work _ 65 feet in length _
made of trailers and hot water heaters bound together by steel
cables. ``It was a monstrous construction, absolutely beautiful in
its finesse. There were passages in this piece that were like
poetry, and others that were ferocious.''
</P>
<P>
   The show brought Ms. Rubins immediate recognition and critical
acclaim in both Europe and New York. She was included in the 1993
Whitney Biennial for which she concocted ``Mattresses and Cakes''
(all of Ms. Rubins' titles are literal, simply listing the
materials in her pieces). With characteristic excess, she rolled up
and bound together 10,000 pounds of mattresses and smeared them
with 1,000 pounds of Entenmann's cakes, which gave off a sugary
scent, and suspended the entire contraption from the ceiling. The
work was robust, decadent and sensual, the tumble of
sweet-smelling, heaving forms suggesting Baroque representations of
ecstasy and exultation.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Ms. Rubins not only created a similar
installation for the Aperto section of the Venice Bienale, but she
also had her first show at Paul Kasmin, where she again exhibited a
mattress piece. (Using a shovel and plastic gloves, she scooped the
cake off the mattresses, which were only slightly stained, and then
re-used them recoated with fresh confections.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ms. Rubins did an installation at the Museum of Modern
Art, densely packing the Projects Room with airplane parts that
hazardously jutted out from the gallery space.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nature or in a museum, Nancy is an exuberant and
uncontainable intruder,'' said Robert Storr, a curator in the
department of painting and sculpture. ``But it's the cohesiveness
of her cantilevered chaos that, in the end, makes her work sit so
well in both settings.''
</P>
<P>
   Working back from three dimensions to two, Ms. Rubins is also
exhibiting, for the first time, a new body of work: collages. To
create them, she photographed her sculptures, cutting out and
crumpling the images and reconfiguring them on archival paper.
Overlapping the forms to achieve a circular pattern, Ms. Rubins
built up bas-reliefs that suggest the centrifugal arrangement of
chrysanthemum petals.
</P>
<P>
   Is a silver conelike image in one of the collages an airplane
engine or a gas tank? Ms. Rubins cocked her head and blinked, as if
she had never before pondered that question. ``I have no idea,''
she said. ``It doesn't matter. These are things that just make
sense to me. They have tubes, liquid goes in and out of them. They
have systems throughout. And you have to admit, they're good
looking, aren't they?''

ALLY MCBEAL DUSTS OFF HER SHAKESPEARE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Iowa, N.J.)   (af)  
 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
``Mad TV.''  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There were those in the team of British hair and
makeup experts hired to give her the fairy-tale makeover for
Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' who
expected nothing good from Calista Flockhart. And they told her so.
</P>
<P>
   Cast as the lovesick Helena, the television star was going to
pop over from America and proceed to be finicky, imperious and
exasperatingly unaware of just how horribly she was mangling the
Bard's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were laughing when they told me this, saying I was a nice
surprise,'' Ms. Flockhart said with a little shrug. ``So I thought,
`Well, I'm not going to take this as an insult.'''
</P>
<P>
   Had she decided to take umbrage, it would be because of this: In
the nearly eight years that Ms. Flockhart lived in New York, she
went from being a busy waif ingenue Off Broadway to a budding waif
ingenue on Broadway. Her Laura Wingfield in a revival of ``The
Glass Menagerie'' was declared ``near perfect'' by Newsweek, ``her
pathological shyness so organic that it's painful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was back in 1994, three years before she locked the
door to her Greenwich Village apartment and moved to Los Angeles to
become the crown princess of neurosis on Fox television's ``Ally
McBeal.'' Now everyone assumes she can't tell a Greek chorus from a
chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People only know me from `Ally McBeal,''' said Ms. Flockhart,
who came up with two adjectives that are frequently affixed to
those who ply their trade on the small screen. ``Bad,'' said Ms.
Flockhart. ``Cheesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that if you're on television, you must not
be a very good actress. That's a stigma that's going to take time
to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   One person's stigma, though, can be a movie studio's selling
point. In order to lure ``Ally McBeal'' fans into the movie
theater, Fox Searchlight, which financed the film for a reported
$13 million, will begin running commercials for ``William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' on the highly rated Fox
television series Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in a way, Helena is just Ally in a high-necked
corseted frock. Both are unmarried. Both are singularly obsessed
with the idea of finding not just a man but a soul mate to
incorporate into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are going through, um, emotional turmoil,'' said Ms.
Flockhart, who devotes much of her time as Helena determinedly
pedaling after her beloved Demetrius (Christian Bale) on a bicycle
and being coldly rebuked even when she delivers the plea echoed by
so many doleful blues singers and the occasional stalker: ``Use me
but as your spaniel/Spurn me, strike me, neglect me, lose me/But
give me leave unworthy as I am to follow you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the modern comedy disguised as a period piece that is
``Shakespeare in Love,'' nor as endlessly faithful as Kenneth
Branagh's four-hour ``Hamlet,'' Hoffman's version of ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' which opens May 14, is contemporary in spirit
while being conscientious about theme, text and Elizabethan
diction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Ms. Flockhart recites Helena's lines, it's in
an accent that makes her sound as if she were from the same olde
English neighborhood as Michelle Pfeiffer's Fairy Queen and Kevin
Kline's Nick Bottom, as well as that of the other all-star players
_ which is more than can be said for Keanu Reeves's arch Valley boy
in Branagh's ``Much Ado About Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The time frame of the 400-year-old romantic comedy has been
moved to the end of the 19th century, and the exterior scenes were
shot in Tuscany, so that everyone and everything was bathed in the
area's iridescent golden light. But one of the most noticeable of
Hoffman's changes is how he used the subplot that Ms. Flockhart
appears in as an entry point for moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of productions treat the four lovers as interchangeable
tools of the farce, but I really tried to get people grounded in
their problems,'' said Hoffman. The amorous gridlock to which he
referred can be broken down thus: Helena (Ms. Flockhart) loves
Demetrius (Bale), Demetrius loves Helena's best friend Hermia (Anna
Friel) who loves Lysander (Dominic West), who in turn loves Hermia
back.
</P>
<P>
   To become one of Hoffman's pivots, Ms. Flockhart studied briefly
with a dialect coach and read her copy of the play until the pages
were in danger of disintegrating. But the rigors of her day job
meant that one afternoon last May an otherwise unrehearsed Ms.
Flockhart found herself on a soundstage at Rome's Cinecitta studio
repeatedly practicing a pratfall from her bicycle on a faux hillock
in the Magic Forest set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very jet-lagged, sort of green with exhaustion,'' said
Ms. Flockhart, who only two evenings before had wrapped the 23rd
episode of ``Ally McBeal,'' then jumped on a plane only to spend
the entire flight obsessing about whether she could erase a
season's worth of acting tics, whose slightest appearance in the
film would brand her unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a part for so long, it becomes part of who you
are,'' said Ms. Flockhart. ``So I went there with fear, going, `I
don't have enough time to let Ally go.' But once I got there, I
figured, `Whatever happens, happens.' Because once you're in the
middle of something, you're forced to move ahead. I was much busier
wondering how I was going to be able to ride that bike.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the little things that helped her leave
behind her Boston lawyer. ``I'm a big believer in shoes _ they can,
like, tell you who exactly your character is,'' said Ms. Flockhart
of her high-heeled buttoned boots. As for the waist-length
pre-Raphaelite tresses she wore, they might have also assisted her,
were they not hair extensions that she was required to sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wig was fun, but it didn't transform me,'' said Ms.
Flockhart, who on her days off would wander through the narrow,
cobbled streets of Rome with her ersatz locks twisted into pin
curls and swathed, ethnic turban-style, in a scarf or her white
silk nightie. ``After I had it on for five minutes, I sort of
forgot it was on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether she forgot, or whether she never intended to, Ms.
Flockhart kept her anxieties to herself. ``You don't spend very
much time talking to Calista about what she's nervous about or
afraid of,'' said Leslie Urdang, who produced ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.'' ``But I don't think anyone on the set thought of her as
anything but poised. She's really private.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet now she has a legion of followers who can spew her core
biographical details, as well as ace such pop quiz questions as,
``What instrument did she tootle away at in her junior high school
band?'' ( She played the flute.) Or ``How will she spend her summer
hiatus from `Ally McBeal'?'' (Putting her art before her movie star
ambitions, she will appear for five weeks in a
still-to-be-announced Off Broadway production.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Currently, theater insiders are betting that it will be either
John Van Druten's ``I Am a Camera'' or William Mastrosimone's ``The
Woolgatherer.'')
</P>
<P>
   Although she was born in 1964 in Freeport, Ill., her parents _
Ron Flockhart, a Kraft Foods executive, and Kay Flockhart, a
schoolteacher _ moved with such regularity that their only daughter
(Ms. Flockhart has an older brother, Gary) believed it emotionally
accurate to say she was from Boone, Iowa, where she spent every
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where my grandparents lived, and all my relatives,''
said Ms. Flockhart, whose recollection of herself as a child is as
the ``strong, silent type _ and maybe the comedian.'' She added:
``I spent a lot of time alone, fantasizing. Some people kind of
live in their minds and some people socialize. I was sort of a
person who did both.''
</P>
<P>
   As often as not, though, her social urges prevailed. It was as a
Shawnee High School football cheerleader and student council member
that Ms. Flockhart, as a slightly built 18-year-old, left Medford,
N.J., for New Brunswick, N.J. Even she wasn't sure why, but she'd
decided to major in acting at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't want to be undeclared,'' said Ms. Flockhart,
who found herself in a fine arts program that essentially assumed
the lien on her life and returned it to her, by then a
precision-trained technician, four years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can do anything,'' said Paul Giamatti, who was the milksop
husband Andrei to her calculating wife Natasha in the Roundabout
Theater Company's 1997 production of ``The Three Sisters'' and once
just sat there, during rehearsal, watching as Ms. Flockhart worked
on a scene where her Natasha, the play's least likable character,
manipulates Andrei by flirting with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She must have done it 10 million ways, and every time it was
completely different. One time, it was very sexual. One time, very
cold. One time, she made it be all about my belly. It was
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday evening, after taking her bows at that night's
``Three Sisters'' performance, Ms. Flockhart took the redeye to Los
Angeles for a Monday morning audition. Although she'd appeared in a
couple of soap operas, a few television movies and several films
(most notably, she played the timorous fiancee in ``The
Birdcage''), she was hardly on a track that would lead to her own
hourlong television comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were faking it, just trying to be polite,'' she
recalled, about a roomful of ``Ally McBeal'' producers and Fox
television executives who roared appreciatively through her tryout.
The next thing she knew, Ms. Flockhart was living in Los Angeles
and her life had boiled down to leaving her rented West Hollywood
apartment as the morning sun rose, acting for 14 hours, then
returning home to memorize her next day's lines.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else that happened to her _ and some things that hadn't
_ was meticulously noted by the news media. Ms. Flockhart, who is a
perennial in the tabloids, won't be sending valentines to
journalists any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person who the press has really picked on _ and I'm not
particularly in love with them,'' said Ms. Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this year's Emmy Awards that Ms. Flockhart showed up
in a sleeveless, scooped-back Richard Tyler pink gown that drew the
wrong kind of attention to her skin-and-bones figure. Since then,
whenever Ms. Flockhart's name comes up, so does the she's-too-thin
controversy that continues to engender speculation.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Flockhart, for example, ordered and ate a spinach,
tomato and cheese egg-white omelette one recent afternoon at a West
Hollywood restaurant, it was hard not to wonder if she was hungry
or playing healthy for a reporter. Either way, the serving of a
light omelette had created an awkwardly heavy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is expansive on the subject. When it comes to the
reading on her bathroom scale, Ms. Flockhart and the world are in
perpetual disagreement. ``The world is telling me I'm too skinny _
and that's just a matter of opinion,'' Ms. Flockhart would say
later. ``It's my choice to weigh what I want to weigh. Maybe I just
have it together. This whole societal obsession with physical
appearance is really the problem _ not my weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Ms. Flockhart told this reporter, ``Some weeks,
I'm a water-glass-half-empty person and some weeks I'm half-full.''
Back then, she was a newcomer to Hollywood who would stiffen
irritably at innocuous questions.
</P>
<P>
   But recently it was a half-full day for Ms. Flockhart, who
seemed ready to drive through the streets of Los Angeles in her
rented gray Volvo sedan until she ran out of time, gasoline or
things to say about everything she noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that's, like, someone who's just had a face
lift?'' she mused about a motorist with a gauze-wrapped head in a
yellow Mercedes in the lane next to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's something you can't complain about!'' she said,
when three thuggish teen-age boys froze in their tracks
midcrosswalk upon recognizing Ms. Flockhart's familiar face and
smiled at her to show their love.
</P>
<P>
   She was at a stoplight when she was asked why, in Italy, she
picked up nothing of the language but ``grazie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, back off!'' replied Ms. Flockhart. But this time, she was
laughing.

 Paula Deitz is the editor of The Hudson Review.  
 By PAULA DEITZS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 10 years after his death, the work of the
sculptor Scott Burton continues to give esthetic pleasure as well
as perform a useful function on the streets of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the plazas alongside the PaineWebber building on Sixth Avenue
at 51st Street, Burton created two ``room settings'' with his
archetypal conceptions of furniture in dark green granite: massive
settees in the ``salon'' on the north side and conical cafe tables
and seats for the ``dining room'' on the south.
</P>
<P>
   He would say of these objects, ``What office workers do in their
lunch hour is more important than my pushing the limits of my
self-expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burton pieces are only part of what visitors to the
PaineWebber building might see: the ground floor concourse is an
art gallery that puts on four or five exhibitions a year. Merging
the two experiences was an idea waiting to be taken advantage of,
and Amy Wolf, an independent curator, has done so.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that
supports projects around New York, she came up with ``Comfort Zone:
Furniture by Artists,'' an engaging exhibition of sculpture that is
also furniture. The show remains on view at PaineWebber through
June 25.
</P>
<P>
   In her catalog essay, Ms. Wolf states that Burton's work was the
paradigm for the exhibition, which includes pieces designed by 36
artists over the last 60 years. As one views the works inside the
gallery, the Burton pieces are visible through a glass wall, making
comparisons of the two inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   What appears simple at first _ artists exploring functionality
in everyday life _ turns out to be complex: things aren't always as
they appear. Whereas Burton's objective was altruistic, much of the
work by the other artists was self-referential. They designed for
themselves as a way to control their lives and their environment.
Viewers are warned that to understand these piece is going to
require close attention.
</P>
<P>
   The designs on view represent each artist's oeuvre in microcosm.
For example, Robert Rauschenberg's ``Tire Lamp,'' a discarded
automobile tire with a rim of light glowing from its interior, sums
up his penchant for incorporating found objects in his
installations.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Isamu Noguchi's low chess table, with its
flowing lines, epitomizes his free-form sculptures and lyrical
stage sets. And Alberto Giacometti's lamp in the shape of a woman's
head suggests his cast bronze sculpture and the decorative objects
that his brother Diego later produced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the furniture seems to function at a practical level,
elements often do not cohere in a normal fashion. This quirkiness
builds a tension that engages the viewer's imagination. David
Deutsch's ``Folding, Writing Desk'' looks like a beach chair with
vinyl webbing before its intended purpose becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Green's antique chairs covered in toile could furnish a
stately dining room, except that the toile subtly depicts scenes
from the slave trade. On first glance, the light bulbs framing the
mirror of Dennis Adams' ``Vanity for Jean Seberg,'' an actress'
dressing table, appear to be reflected in the glass counter, but in
fact, the line of bulbs continues below the counter surface. The
effect is like seeing a reflection become tangible.
</P>
<P>
   R.M. Fischer's lamps reconfigure off-the-shelf parts into
hybridized objects that give new meanings to ordinary forms.
Situated at the entrance to the exhibit, his roly-poly collection
of white globes of light, topped by a single red one, serves as a
beacon lighting the way into the show.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds in achieving his stated goal of ``giving personality
to an object that would otherwise be inert''; the lamp has all the
charm of a good snowman.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Long casts two identical abstract concrete forms and
leaves one as a sculpture while transforming the other into a lamp
that looks like an animal with a tail made of electric wire.
</P>
<P>
   Lest one think that the exhibition consists entirely of
contemporary-looking works, Brian Tolle has made an art of
reinventing revival styles for the present. Playing with the notion
of public and private, he has designed a square Gothic revival bed
that combines 19th-century church architecture with domestic forms
of that period. With his cabinetmaker's skill, he mastered the task
of making a bed that also serves as a prie-dieu.
</P>
<P>
   With artists' furniture, the form-follows-function formula is
expanded by personal experience and experimental ideas. For some
time now, Andrea Zittel has exhibited her A-Z Living Units that
provide the user, according to her sales brochure, ``total comfort
and function within a portable and customized structure.''
</P>
<P>
   These fold-away room settings that combine living space, kitchen
and dining facilities, bed and bath are immensely satisfying to
anyone who yearns to make life more compact and manageable.
</P>
<P>
   On view is the original unit she designed for herself when she
lived at the back of a storefront studio in Brooklyn in 1991 and
bred chickens in the front as her art. Her work is founded in the
belief that modern design derives from the simplicity of the
pared-down settings associated with poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For her, such design is a glamorization of limitations. One
wants to crawl into the cozy environment Ms. Zittel has created.
She sees it not as a reduction of material life, but as moving
toward an ideal. That concept could be the motto for the show.

HOLLYWOOD HITCHES ITS WAGON TO `STAR WARS'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga.)   (Eds: Please note subslug for NOTTING-HILL-FILM)  
 (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Nikki Rocco, the president of distribution at
Universal Pictures, and her colleagues are nervous. Who can blame
them?
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the summer-movie landscape, the studio had at first
intended to open its high-profile romance ``Notting Hill,''
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, a month after the release,
on May 19, of George Lucas's ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' one of the most anticipated films in years.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Universal executives sat down, took a second look
and decided on a more innovative, if riskier, plan: move ``Notting
Hill,'' which is about a Hollywood star and a British bookshop
owner who fall in love, right into the eye of the storm. Now, it
will open only one week after the new ``Star Wars,'' when frenzy
over the science-fiction film is likely to be at a peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this long and hard and decided, what better way
to capitalize on the fabulous box-office business than to be able
to open on that weekend,'' said Ms. Rocco. ``The target audience
for `Star Wars' is young males. `Notting Hill' has definite female
interest. And not everyone in North America will go and see `Star
Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the $115 million Lucas film _ which is being
released by 20th Century Fox as the first of three ``Star Wars''
prequels, tracing the life of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's dad _ has
generated enormous early interest. So much interest, in fact, that
not only rival studios but also theater owners across the country
have had to alter the way they make decisions for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten more phone calls on `Star Wars' than any movie
we've played,'' said Mike Patrick, president of Carmike Cinemas,
which is one of America's top theater chains, based in Columbus,
Ga. ``But different types of phone calls: corporations want to buy
out the theaters for one or two shows; people want to buy 100
tickets at one time. What's going to happen _ I think, I hope _ is
that other pictures will capitalize on the success of `Star
Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the rival Hollywood studios, the magic word is
``counterprogramming'' _that is, positioning romances, comedies and
arty films against the ``Star Wars'' juggernaut, rather than going
head to head with it. The result of this thinking is that when it
comes to movies, the summer of 1999 is not going to be a
traditional summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when ``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``Lethal
Weapon 4'' and ``Deep Impact'' squared off, this year won't be
offering an assortment of big-budget, big-star extravaganzas from
which to choose _ even though just as many movies are being
released over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw `Star Wars' coming for a couple of years,'' said Joe
Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ``It immediately cut off
your appetite to get involved in a really expensive movie because
you're eliminating the first half of the summer, between Memorial
Day and July 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's studio, of course, does have several films to present
this summer, among them the animated ``Tarzan'' (June 18), with
music by Phil Collins, and a drama, ``Instinct'' (June 4), with
Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. ``You don't want to be out
there with a big movie,'' said Roth. ```Titanic,' for example, just
suffocated the marketplace for big movies both here and overseas
for weeks. There's a real chance you'd be swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, said Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of
production at Warner Brothers, Hollywood's appetite for big-budget
films has diminished. ``It's so hard to make these movies, and it
gets harder and harder because of cost and attendant problems,'' he
said. ``The process can be really unpleasant, it's often hard to
make a profit and the Internet has altered the way films are put
together. You can't expose your film to preview audiences the way
you did before. Veteran filmmakers used to use that process, but
now you're at risk of people saying on the Internet that the film
doesn't work, or the ending doesn't work. You can't experiment in
the ways you did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their neighbors at Universal, di Bonaventura and his
colleagues at Warner Brothers are especially nervous. If there is a
``big film'' this summer beyond ``Star Wars,'' it's their ``Wild,
Wild West,'' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. An action fantasy based
loosely on the 60s television western, it stars, among others, Will
Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   The film is in the midst of last-minute reshoots, there are
rumors of problems and the budget is spiraling (Warner Brothers
insists that it's only a little more than $105 million).
</P>
<P>
   The counterprogramming strategy is based on recent history:
successful films like ``As Good as It Gets'' and ``Good Will
Hunting'' opened just before ``Titanic'' at the end of 1997, and
the John Travolta hit ``Phenomenon'' arrived at the same time that
``Independence Day'' did in the summer earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after ``Star Wars,'' the studios are releasing
several comedies, including ``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' a sequel to the successful spy spoof starring Mike Myers
(June 11); ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' based on the
hit Comedy Central television series (June 18), and ``Big Daddy,''
in which Adam Sandler plays a man forced to raise a little boy
(June 25).
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks is perhaps showing the greatest counterprogramming
courage _ or greatest temerity _ by releasing a low-budget romance,
``The Love Letter,'' in the same week that the Lucas film opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, `Star Wars' is opening against us,'' said Terry
Press, the Dreamworks marketing chief. ``The Love Letter'' stars
Kate Capshaw, Blythe Danner, Ellen DeGeneres and Tom Selleck and is
directed by Peter Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a very good weekend for moviegoing, and we
believe there's an audience of older females who will want to see
this film,'' Ms. Press continued, sounding some of the same notes
that Universal's Ms. Rocco had. ``After all, this is the one
breathing segment of the population that I don't think is an
automatic `Star Wars' attendee.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, women, an audience constantly being rediscovered
by Hollywood, will have plenty to choose from in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Opening on June 18 is ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' a remake of
the 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway romance about a cool bank
robber and an insurance investigator, starring Rene Russo and
Pierce Brosnan. On June 18, Miramax will release ``An Ideal
Husband,'' an adaptation of the Oscar Wilde romantic comedy,
starring Cate Blanchett, Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Minnie
Driver and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same time slot as `Mrs. Brown,' which worked
successfully for us the year `Lost World' opened,'' said Marcy
Granata, the executive vice president of marketing and publicity at
Miramax. ``It's worked for us in films like `Emma,' and `Il
Postino' and `Smoke.' If you counterprogram art-house films, you
can do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Fox, which is releasing the Lucas film, is providing a film
for the art-house crowd, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,''' at roughly
the same time, releasing it on May 14. Set in Tuscany at the end of
the 19th century, it stars, among others, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin
Kline, Stanley Tucci, Rupert Everett and Calista Flockhart and was
directed by Michael Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has got to see some other movie beside `Star Wars,'''
said Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight. ``The parents will
go only once to see `Star Wars.' The kids will go seven times. So
what's a parent to do but see another film?''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, of course, are just as uneasy about the impact of
``Star Wars'' as studio executives are. Jan De Bont (``Twister'')
said that the July 23 release date for his new film, ``The
Haunting,'' with Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, was selected by
Dreamworks because of the success last year of another film
released on that weekend, ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is geared toward an older audience,'' De Bont said of
``The Haunting,'' which is based on the Shirley Jackson horror tale
``The Haunting of Hill House.'' ``It's a very adult psychological
horror movie that I hope is in the same vein as films like `The
Exorcist,' `The Omen' and `Rosemary's Baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar situation is Jon Turteltaub, the director of
Disney's ``Instinct,'' in which Hopkins plays a seemingly deranged
man who has been living in Rwanda among gorillas and Gooding
portrays his psychiatrist. Turteltaub said that because his film
would appeal to adult audiences, it would have a chance to do well
even though it is opening only two weeks after ``Star Wars.''
``There's no question that it will be like a bulldozer,'' he said
of the Lucas movie. ``But people will want to see other movies _ I
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Also among the smattering of mainstream adult films that will be
released by studios this summer are John Sayles's drama ``Limbo,''
about various people struggling to reinvent themselves in Alaska
(June 4); ``The General's Daughter,'' starring John Travolta as an
investigator looking into a murder on an Army post, directed by
Simon West (June 11), and Spike Lee's ``Summer of Sam,'' which is
about New York in 1977, when the city was in a panic over the
serial killer whom the tabloids called Son of Sam (July 30).
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated film in this category is Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut'' (July 16), a psychological thriller about sexual
obsession starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Shrewdly, Kubrick,
shortly before his death, gave distributors a peek at a sexy scene
between the two stars that stirred strong interest in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Surely at least a couple of these movies will turn out to be
hits, but the overriding question facing Hollywood in this odd
summer dominated by one film remains: Will rival studios be helped
or hurt by the mega-hit ``Star Wars''? That is, will their
counterprogramming work?
</P>
<P>
   As for the theater owners, they can rest easier: even if other
movies do simply normal business, the theaters are going to benefit
from the invasion of ``Star Wars.'' Asked if he had any worries
about the summer of '99, Patrick, the president of Carmike, thought
for a long moment, then said, ``We might melt a popcorn machine
here and there, but I see no problems at all.''

 MARIACHI MEMORIES OF A '30s TONE POET   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the calendar of saints, the last day of the year belongs to
St. Sylvester, and it was on that day in the last year of the 1800s
that the Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas was born.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several months before his centenary, Sony Classical has
released an exhilarating Revueltas album, with Esa-Pekka Salonen
conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its New Music Group,
and other new releases round out the picture.
</P>
<P>
   American music, in the fullest sense of the term, had its first
great period in the 1930s, and Revueltas, nearly all of whose works
date from that decade, merits a place with such contemporaries as
Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, Henry Cowell, Amadeo Roldan, Louis
Armstrong, Roger Sessions and George Gershwin, all born within the
same few years around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Revueltas wrote in an autobiographical sketch that his mother
had dreamed of having an artist son who could express everything
she admired and loved in nature and life. ``This probably
explains,'' he added, ``why I was born with a regrettable
inclination towards music and loafing and an unquenchable yearning
for new horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of his pieces have to do with travel: ``Itinerarios''
and ``Caminos'' are among his several short tone poems, and from a
score for a film about the Baja California railroad he created
``Musica Para Charlar'' (``Chitchat Music''). The piece rattles
with the regular rhythms of train wheels, between episodes in which
it breaks off to look at the view, including one remarkable passage
of smooth low strings and rippling upper instruments to represent
sand and water. Such music came from a life of journeys and
participatory observation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Revueltas was emphatically a musician of his
home country. Into his ears as a child had gone the sounds of
street bands and mariachis, and out came that music again, recalled
in tight, bright motifs, spirited and unsentimental, often with two
or three dance rhythms going on at the same time, quite frequently
with a caustic contrast of wind instruments high (piccolo, E flat
clarinet) and low (bassoon, tuba), and nearly always with jump-cuts
from one texture to another, juxtaposed like strips of vibrant
color on a rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rhythms are booming, dynamic, tactile, visual,'' he wrote.
``I think in images that are melodic strains, that move
dynamically.'' All that is true, and makes his music a Mexican
parallel to the ethnic works of Stravinsky, Bartok and Janacek.
</P>
<P>
   Like those composers, Revueltas cherished the rough edges of
folk music _ the cues for abrasive sounds and dissonant harmonies _
as well as the immediacy. What separates him from the Europeans of
his time, and most of the Americans, is his happiness, which may be
both undercut and reinforced by the sly irony that enlivened his
music as much as his prose.
</P>
<P>
   His tone poem ``Janitzio'' provides examples, in itself and in
what he said about it. ``Janitzio is an island of fishermen, gently
rocked by the lake of Patzcuaro,'' he wrote of a well-known beauty
spot. ``The lake of Patzcuaro is ugly. Romantic and sentimental
travelers have embellished it with postcard kisses and music. Not
to be left out, I have made my own small contribution, in an
infinite yearning for fame and renown. Posterity will no doubt be
thankful for these efforts on behalf of tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Santiago Papasquiaro, in the western Sierra Madre,
Revueltas apparently had violin lessons as a boy in the provincial
capital of Durango and in Mexico City before his father, evidently
just as encouraging as his mother, sent him and his brother to St.
Edward College across the border in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He also studied at the Chicago Musical College between the ages
of 18 and 20, and seems to have remained in the United States for
several years. But in 1929 Carlos Chavez, whose centenary also
falls this year, recalled him to help in the work of invigorating
the Mexico Symphony and the National Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   He broke with Chavez in 1935 and, in 1937, spent several months
in Europe. By now a committed socialist, he wanted to lend support
to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, which he did, and
visit the Soviet Union, which he was unable to do. He also stayed a
while in Paris. Once back in Mexico City, he threw himself into
writing film scores, a ballet _ ``La Coronela'' (``The Colonel's
Wife'') _ and other pieces, and died of exhaustion, pneumonia and
alcoholism at 40.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time thereafter his fame rested on two scores for
large orchestra, ``Sensemaya'' and ``La Noche de los Mayos,'' both
of which are included on the new Sony CD (SK 60676-2).
``Sensemaya'' is indeed his best piece of a certain kind.
</P>
<P>
   Audibly indebted to ``Le Sacre du Printemps,'' it is music of
persistent repetitions, big sonorities, and melodies as short as
signals, and it does its job of powerfully evoking a ritual:
specifically, the ritual described in a poem by the Afro-Cuban poet
Nicolas Guillen, whose refrain of ``mayombe, bombe, mayombe''
Revueltas translated into his most continuous and thumping
ostinato. Salonen takes the piece slowly and delivers its
immensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Noche de los Mayos'' is a sort of four-movement primitive
symphony, created by the Mexican conductor Jose Yves Limantour 20
years after Revueltas's death out of 36 sequences he had written
for a film. (You have to read the Spanish version of the booklet
notes to learn this.) The reworking may account for a certain
looseness in the form as well as a banality in the scoring, where
Revueltas on his own was always so exact and fresh; though the
conch trumpet makes a great noise in the last movement, this is not
a score anyone will want to hear too often.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard not to keep playing the smaller pieces on this
record again and again, for they represent Revueltas at his most
inventive, humorous and lovable. ``Ocho por Radio'' is a comic,
trumpet-led mosaic of simultaneous and successive quick dances
around a slow section that is almost a ``Bachiana Mexicana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homenaje a Federico Garcia Lorca'' was certainly written out
of respect for the assassinated poet, but it remembers his vitality
more than his death, again with helter-skelter dances around a
quiet, watchful, nocturnelike elegy, and again with trumpet
prominent. The two ``Little Serious Pieces'' for Stravinskian wind
ensembles are little but not at all serious, except in that all
play is so.
</P>
<P>
   This new recording effectively replaces a compilation of mixed
conductors in much the same program on BMG Catalyst, the
performances being at once livelier and more robust. But the older
disk is useful for three otherwise unavailable selections from the
chamber-orchestra repertory in which the best of Revueltas is to be
found: the ``Toccata Without a Fugue,'' spiky with piccolo,
clarinets and violins; ``Alcancias,'' where no harmonic holds are
barred at the end of the slow movement, and ``Planos''
(``Layers'').
</P>
<P>
   Revueltas described this last piece as a set of math equations
that he had solved in notes, and when he orchestrated the music, he
changed the title to ``Danza Geometrica.'' As usual in anything
concerning his life or his music, he was being half-humorous, but
``Planos'' does have less local color than usual, and in its chain
of contrasts and allusions it gets beyond the two formal types
Revueltas was rather stuck on: the fast-slow-fast model and growth
by accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether Varese was remembering its striking opening,
for piano and percussion with wind pedal tone, when he started his
``Deserts.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other recent CDs, one conducted by Gisele Ben-Dor offers
the late ``Coronela'' together with two tone poems: ``Itinerarios''
and ``Colorines'' (Koch 3-7421-2H1). ``La Coronela'' is a problem
piece, put in shape, like ``La Noche de las Mayas,'' after the
composer's death.
</P>
<P>
   Whether for that reason or not, the zest is spread rather thin.
The performance is lively, and the tone poems are well worth
hearing, but anyone whose appetite for more Revueltas is whetted by
the Sony release would do better to go on to a beautifully
performed and presented recording of smaller-scale pieces by the
Camerata de las Americas under Enrique Arturo Diemecke (Dorian DOR
90244).
</P>
<P>
   This includes an early version of ``Sensemaya'' for chamber
ensemble, in which form the music works surprisingly well: Diemecke
makes it faster as well as slimmer. Also here are several songs
with highly characterful instrumental accompaniments. ``Ranas''
(``Frogs''), for instance, uses characteristic hiccups between
piccolo and low wind to amusing illustrative ends.
</P>
<P>
   Revueltas's model for such pieces must have been Stravinsky, and
it is hard to think of any other composer anywhere who was
following that road in 1932 so easily and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The same marvelous record includes earlier pieces that show
Revueltas's individuality already well developed, and a wonderful
dance score, ``Troka,'' full of typical weird textures, bright
tunes and ideas broken off or lost in the exuberance, soulfulness
and comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The third Revueltas collection to hear is the Cuarteto
Latinoamericano's recording of the complete string quartets (New
Albion NA 062), an album that quickly conveys the composer's good
humor and magic.
</P>
<P>
   All four works are short (the longest lasting just 13 minutes):
a quality that should, along with the music's delightfulness,
recommend them to performers. The Second Quartet is curious in that
its second movement is a digest of its first; the Third has more of
the mystery that balances gaiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silvestre,'' Octavio Paz once wrote, ``like all real people,
was a battlefield. Inside Silvestre lived numerous interlocutors,
many passions, many capabilities, weaknesses as well as
refinement.'' One can hear that in the best of his music, in pieces
like ``Homenaje a Federico Garcia Lorca'' or ``Troka.'' But all the
people he was seem to be having a terrific time together.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the school year winds down, I look forward to summer reading.
There's nothing like getting lost in a good book while relaxing on
the porch swing or at the beach. Summer provides an excuse to catch
up on books I want to read.
 &HT;    This year, I started summer reading earlier than usual and have
been reading spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Maybe I'm just nosy, but I love memoirs. I first became
acquainted with the genre of spiritual autobiography while a
college student. Since then, I have read hundreds, ranging from St.
Augustine's ``Confessions'' and St. Teresa of Avila's
``Autobiography'' to C.S. Lewis's ``Surprised by Joy'' and Thomas
Merton's ``Seven Story Mountain.''
 &HT;    However worthy these classics, this year I decided to limit my
reading to contemporary spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Every time I visit the local bookstore I find two or three new
spiritual-journey books. As a fan of the classics, I admit to
having been a bit skeptical regarding the current publishing craze.
Over the months, however, I bought a couple dozen interesting
titles and finally dedicated myself to reading them. Many are
intelligent and insightful renderings of vital spirituality. I have
been challenged and, in some cases, changed by reading these books.
 &HT;    Here are some suggestions for a spiritual summer reading list:
 &HT;    More than any other writer, Kathleen Norris has mastered this
genre. Her best-selling books testify to her grace and insight.
``Cloister Walk'' and ``Amazing Grace'' are thoughtful
interpretations of traditional Christianity. However, do not miss
her first and less well-known book, ``Dakota.'' Its spare and
poetic prose communicates spirituality in small community better
than any book I have ever read.
 &HT;    ``Ordinary Time'' by Nancy Mairs could not be a greater contrast
to Norris. She writes crisply and bluntly: ``Religious belief is
something like masturbation: You may do it -- and it won't even
make you crazy or give you warts if you do -- but it's the sort of
thing you keep to yourself.'' Mairs is not for the spiritually
timid.
 &HT;    Gary Dorsey's ``Congregation'' narrates a single year at First
Church in Windsor, Connecticut. Dorsey, a journalist, begins by
reporting on church life. Within months, however, the line between
reporter and parishioner blurs. This is a funny book -- with a
complete cast of crusty New England characters and New Age
baby-boomer seekers. More like a novel than non-fiction, I had to
keep reminding myself it was true!
 &HT;    ``Encountering God'' by Harvard professor Diana Eck recounts her
journey from her Methodist childhood in Bozeman, Montana to being
transformed while studying Hinduism in India. Well-written and
theologically sophisticated, Eck explores the issues surrounding
American religious pluralism. This book is deeply Christian and
completely inclusive -- a model of religious dialogue and a good
introduction to Hinduism.
 &HT;    A new book, ``The Ironic Christian's Companion'' by Patrick
Henry, pushes Christians to embrace doubt as a way to God. Henry
knits together church history, contemporary events and his own life
experience and points out that God may be found in the
least-expected places -- such as a classroom at Swarthmore College,
the feminist Re-Imagining Conference, and in divorce and death.
Although the author is not ordained, I wished every minister in
America was as pastoral as Henry.
 &HT;    Two books by gay men address the issues facing Christian
homosexuals. John McNeill's ``Both Feet Firmly Planted in Midair''
and Mel White's ``Stranger at the Gate'' helped me, as a
heterosexual wife and mother, understand the painful struggle of my
gay and lesbian friends regarding faith and identity. McNeill, a
liberal Roman Catholic, and White, a conservative evangelical, come
to the point of self- and divine acceptance from opposite sides of
the theological fence. But they wind up in remarkably the same
place. I found these books profoundly human -- and should not be
limited in readership to the homosexual community.
 &HT;    Julius Lester's ``Lovesong'' recounts his conversion from
Methodism to Judaism. Lester, an African-American and son of a
southern Methodist minister, struggles with a lifetime of exclusion
until he meets God in Judaism. There, ``exclusion'' melts into
finding meaning through a distinctive community. ``Being a Jew,''
he writes, ``is more than loving Judaism; it is also belonging to a
people.''
 &HT;    ``Things Seen and Unseen'' by Nora Gallagher is another year at
church -- this time Trinity Episcopal in Santa Barbara. Her book
captures the ethos of contemporary Episcopalianism: contemplative
and activist. She takes the reader into the secret places of
Christian community as the people pray, serve the poor, minister to
one another, and struggle with the big issues of the day --
including having a gay priest.
 &HT;    Enjoy!

SMILE! IT'S DIGITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent visit to an amusement park in Florida, where he was
supposed to be having fun, poor little Taylor was in agony.
``Taylor, take a bite of your hot dog,'' his father coached.
``Smile! That's it! Taylor, turn around and walk toward the roller
coaster. No, walk the other way. Taylor, look over here. Over here!
Wave to your grandpa. Say, `Hi, Grandpa!' Show him your new
T-shirt. Come on, Taylor, smile!''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's father had a video camcorder attached to his face and
was determined, apparently, to let no moment of this vacation go
undocumented. Taylor riding the carousel. Taylor drinking from a
fountain. Taylor looking miserable as he is hugged by some garishly
costumed theme park employee.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Taylor, his father did not have access to one of
Sony's new Digital 8 Handycam camcorders with up to 10 hours of
battery life and the capability to shoot video in the dark.
Otherwise, his entire day might have been directed and
choreographed by his video-crazed dad.
</P>
<P>
   The new Handycam, in the right hands, is actually a delightful
piece of technology. It has many of the best features of digital
camcorders, including superior picture quality, near CD-quality
sound, the ability to snap digital still photographs, to make exact
digital copies of tapes, to add special effects and to transfer
images easily to a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   It can also record on and play back from older, less expensive
and more widely available 8-mm and Hi-8 video cassettes. Most
digital camcorders use a special digital video (DV) cassette, which
is smaller than an 8-mm cassette, and of course they are
incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   So the new Handycam is an ideal bridge between digital and
analog video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also makes DV-only camcorders, for those who are willing to
make a clean break with the past. But the new line of Digital 8
video cameras _ three models ranging from $699 to $1,399 (suggested
retail prices), offer a smart compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason to get a digital video camera is picture
quality. With a horizontal resolution of more than 500 lines, a
digital video camera can create very sharp pictures, much better
than analogue camcorders. By contrast, Super VHS and Hi-8 formats
record 400 lines, standard television is 330 lines, and
8-millimeter and VHS camcorders record only 250 lines.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing the top-of-the-line Digital 8 model, the
DCR-TRV510. It is larger and heavier than most DV camcorders, but
about the same size and heft as analog 8-mm cameras. Although it
records onto Hi-8 tapes with exactly the same high resolution and
clarity of digital camcorders that use DV tape, it does so at the
expense of recording time.
</P>
<P>
   A 120-minute Hi-8 tape in a Digital 8 camcorder yields just 60
minutes of recorded video, while a 120-minute DV tape in a DV
digital camcorder yields the full two hours.
</P>
<P>
   At $1,399, the DCR-TRV510 is more expensive than most 8-mm
camcorders, yet less expensive than some DV models, which charge a
premium for miniaturization. Still, it comes loaded with digital
camera features.
</P>
<P>
   The DCR-TRV510 has a color viewfinder and a flip-out, four-inch
color display screen that is among the best I've seen. The screen
image still washes out in bright sunlight, as they all seem to do,
but it is impressive indoors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Sony Digital 8 models come with a 20X optical zoom
lens that can be boosted to 360X magnification via digital zooming.
Digital zooming is overrated. It does not add anything to picture
quality, but merely enlarges the size of the digital picture
elements (pixels) in the center of the image.
</P>
<P>
   Zooming in too tightly creates a blocky, mosaic effect that one
often sees on television when one of Jerry Springer's guests
decides to reveal an intimate tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The camera is also equipped with image stabilization technology
that reduces the normal shakes and jitters that plague hand-held
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has video and audio ports, which means that it can be
hooked up to an older video camera, a VCR or a television set to
make digital copies of older analog tapes or even TV broadcasts.
With analog tapes, every time a copy is made, the picture is
degraded just a little. When both the image and the soundtrack are
made of 1s and 0s, digital copies are identical to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may want to transfer their older analog tapes to
newer digital tapes, to preserve picture quality and memories for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing features of the DCR-TRV510 is called
I-Link, which is Sony's brand name for an IEEE 1394 digital
interface. IEEE 1394, also known as Firewire, is a high-speed data
transfer port that is popular on newer personal computers and
digital peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Link port is bidirectional, which means that it can send
not only video to a PC _ because it is digital, there is no need
for a separate PC video capture board _ but also easily transfer
edited video from a PC back to the camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Once the video is in the PC, a creative videographer might wish
to add a CD soundtrack, edit out the 99 percent of most videos that
are uninteresting except to parents and grandparents, and add fancy
scene transitions with fades, wipes, old-time movie and other
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Another snazzy feature is Laser Link, which uses infrared waves
to transfer images. When an optional ($70) infrared receiver is
attached to a television, you can beam video directly to the
television set without wires, cables or gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared waves have other interesting properties, like the
ability to invisibly illuminate things at night. The Sony I tested
has a feature called Nightshot, which functions much like the night
vision scopes used by spies. It works over short distances in
almost complete darkness (zero lux), although the image is a
washed-out monochrome with an eerie green tint.
</P>
<P>
   Sony suggests that Nightshot is handy during camping trips,
perhaps for tracking and videotaping wily nocturnal creatures like
foxes or teen-agers. Another possible use, Sony suggests, is for
keeping an infrared eye on the baby at night without turning on the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed feelings about using the video camera as a digital
still camera. The Sony can store hundreds of snapshots on a tape.
Its ability to capture both video and still images is a harbinger
of the eventual convergence of digital cameras with digital
camcorders. But transferring the pictures off the tape is somewhat
awkward, and I still prefer a true digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   But I liked the Sony's ability to capture a single frame from a
video tape. The image can be transferred to a PC and perhaps sent
as e-mail or posted to a Web site. The software to allow the PC to
receive and manipulate the images is included.
</P>
<P>
   Another clever touch is the use of an ``Info-Lithium'' battery.
Lithium ion batteries are far superior to the older nickel cadmium
batteries (NiCads), because they do not have the so-called memory
effect that required the owner to worry about discharging the
battery completely before recharging. Lithium batteries can be
recharged whenever the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   The ``info'' part of the battery is very handy. It tells, via a
digital meter in the camera's viewfinder and on its side control
panel, exactly how many minutes are left before the battery goes
kaput.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely got 30 minutes of active use from the battery that came
with the camera. For $60 to $150 more, Sony offers optional Stamina
batteries that promise up to 10 hours of uninterrupted recording
time. Sorry, Taylor.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Earlier this month, Christina Magnuson, a
sophisticated 50-something Swede, sat in a Manhattan hotel suite
and discussed well-designed juice glasses, toothbrushes, kitchen
utensils, furniture, cars and houses. ``Design is one of society's
largest cultural assets,'' she said, a gauge with which to measure
the aspirations of a civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Mrs. Magnuson is a sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf
and thus a princess, and that she lives with her husband and three
children in a large villa on the grounds of Ulriksdal Palace in
Stockholm, might make her interest in juice glasses seem strange.
But in Sweden, where the creation of everyday objects has been
elevated to a fine art, the term ``Design Princess'' is a serious
honorific.
</P>
<P>
   The princess, whose primary career is as chairwoman of the
Swedish Red Cross and whose royal status in a socially democratic
country makes her something of an anomaly, has spent the last 10
years promoting design in the hopes of establishing a museum in
Stockholm. For now, there is a temporary exhibition space called
the Forum for Form _ which she and Swedish designers, critics and
curators refer to as a ``museum in embryo.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders are usually surprised that Sweden has no national
design museum, given the country's reputation. But this says a lot
about Sweden. ``Because we're used to the lines and style of
Swedish design, we tend to think of the things that surround us as
very ordinary,'' the princess explained. ``When we get outside
attention, we start to take notice of how special it really is.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no dearth of outside attention. Wallpaper
magazine recently dedicated an entire issue to the current Swedish
design scene. The International Contemporary Furniture Fair, to be
held in New York next month, will feature a number of young Swedish
stars like Thomas Sandell and Bjorn Dahlstrom at the Totem design
booth. And there are a host of new wave Swedish companies like
David Design, Asplund, Box Mobler and CBI.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1940s, most Swedes have lived with textiles, glass,
ceramics, furniture and flatware that seamlessly merge craft and
industry. Such design seems to be a natural extension of the
country's social ideals. Recently there has been an international
revival of interest in early-20th-century Swedish companies like
Svenskt Tenn (the name means Swedish Pewter), the decorative arts
workshop that brought Swedish design to the 1939 New York World's
Fair. Some of Svenskt Tenn's exquisite metal jewelry (by its
founder, Estrid Ericson) is being reproduced at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, and nine of its wildly vibrant textiles (by the
Austrian transplant Josef Frank) are still available from
Brunschwig &AMP; Fils.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Danes and Finns in the 1950s and '60s may have been
equally responsible for the widespread popularity of curvilinear
chairs, surfboard tables, biomorphic glassware and striking
geometric rugs. But it was a 1955 exposition in Helsingborg,
Sweden, that spread Scandinavian design abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a new design store in Manhattan is called H55 in honor
of the exposition. The store's chunky, brightly colored '50s glass
vessels by Sven Palmqvist speak volumes about the enthusiasm and
expectations of that time in Sweden, which had just experienced a
50-year climb from poverty to prosperity. The decorative ceramics
of Henrik Allert and Stig Lindberg show the era's blending of fine
and applied arts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a celebration of this heritage that brought Princess
Christina to New York, where she opened a seminar on 20th-century
Swedish design sponsored in part by the Bard Graduate Center for
Studies in the Decorative Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The princess imbibed Swedish creativity from the priceless
handcrafted artifacts and artwork that filled her childhood home,
the Royal Palace in Stockholm, and the functionalist design of her
youth in the '50s and '60s. And her grandfather King Gustaf VI
Adolf often discussed his interest in Chinese porcelain. She
studied art history at the University of Stockholm and attended
Radcliffe College for a year in which she formed her passion for
Warhol and Rauschenberg. Moreover, Sigvard Bernadotte, her uncle,
is Sweden's first modern industrial designer. Count Bernadotte, now
92, created everything from silverware to plastic bowls. ``At a
certain point I started feeling that objects spoke a language,''
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By lineage, the princess, who is married to a businessman, Tord
Magnuson, is actually more French and German than anything. ``If
there's an ounce of Swedish blood in me,'' she said, ``it must be
diluted 100 times. Yet I'm terribly Swedish.''
</P>
<P>
   She appreciates glass above any other decorative art. ``Glass is
one of the joys of life,'' she said. ``It's an integral part of the
Swedish experience _ to drink out of it, to have it in the window
with the light shining through, to fill it with flowers or
leaves.'' So it's not surprising that she keeps an extensive
personal collection of Swedish glass.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Princess Christina was notably self-effacing and
retained her cool during a photography session, when a wall of ice,
built as a backdrop, collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   During her stay she inaugurated a new collection of Skruf
glassware by Ingegerd Raman at the American Craft Museum, where an
exhibition of turn-of-the-century Swedish Rorstrand porcelain runs
through May 23. Rorstrand's playful Art Nouveau vases with
cavorting sea creatures present one extreme of 20th-century Swedish
design. Ms. Raman represents the other, the severe Nordic
simplicity in her ice-clear glass carafes and decanters as austere
as Lutheran churches.
</P>
<P>
   Both strands will be represented at a new exhibition, called
H99, in Helsingborg, to begin in July. With mid-century so close in
history's rearview mirror and the turn of the century just around
the corner, the show will feature Swedish design and architecture
from the 1950s to the infinitely adventurous present.

<P>
   Having spent Easter in northern Italy with the sound of NATO
bombers screaming overhead, I travelled back to Sweden through
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There, a number of retired generals were speaking out. One of
them, Gerd Schmueckle, was wounded six times on the Russian front
during World War II, but then served in the highest positions
inside NATO. And he warned of a new fascination with war. Perhaps,
he said, it is a question of generations. When the war veterans are
losing their hair and teeth, and disappearing into homes for the
elderly, the new generation suddenly has a different attitude
toward war.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmueckle, war was associated with horror beyond
imagination, leaving deep psychological scars on individuals and
nations. Bombs, he said, do not create peace; instead, they breed
hatred for years, perhaps for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Younger politicians believe that they can fight new types of
wars. And these new wars are becoming increasingly popular. Indeed,
they are now conducted a couple of times a year. They are supposed
to be clean wars: high-rhetoric, high-altitude and high-technology
wars; smart bombs for smart politicians. The ``third way'' in war.
</P>
<P>
   These smart wars can be used to beef up diplomacy when it runs
into problems which seem too complicated. But they can also be used
to replace diplomacy entirely and just express the outrage that we
feel over evil regimes doing evil things.
</P>
<P>
   It's evil, isn't it? No one can really defend the outrageous
acts of a Saddam Hussein or a Slobodan Milosevic. Well then, it
can't be wrong to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   So in the West, we are in the strange situation that instead of
cashing in our peace dividend, we are on the verge of running out
of cruise missiles, or at least the air-launched version. The smart
wars are beginning to take their toll on war stock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these smart wars conducted from the air is that
they are often difficult to relate to political objectives, and so
far have not proved a great success in achieving those objectives.
In Baghdad, there are no longer any U.N. inspectors to look for
weapons of mass destruction, but Saddam Hussein is still there.
Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the aim of the smart war was to keep the Albanians in
Kosovo and get rid of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. So far, it
has turned out to be the other way around. The air war against
Yugoslavia has not prevented a humanitarian catastrophe; rather, it
has become associated with one.
</P>
<P>
   The air war against Serbia will not only be a war over the
future of Kosovo, but also a war over the future of smart wars and
the use of air power in isolation. If Milosevic throws in the towel
and agrees to all the NATO demands, smart wars will be here to
stay, to be used whenever diplomacy runs into too many
complications.
</P>
<P>
   But if the air war turns out to be a prolonged phase of wanton
destruction and humanitarian disaster preceding a reluctant
decision by NATO to mount a ground offensive against Kosovo (and
take responsibility for a long-term occupation of part of the
Balkans), the future of smart wars will be very different.
</P>
<P>
   We are now seeing the refighting of the war of words over the
use of air power in the Bosnian conflict. In that war, Washington
was always arguing that a few volleys of cruise missiles and
strategic strikes would sort out the problem, while others argued
that this would only aggravate the situation on the ground and
worsen the plight of exposed civilians and U.N. peace-keeping
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the emotional debate about the responsibility
for the massacre of Muslims after the fall of the U.N.-declared
safe area of Srebrenica in July 1995 turned on whether it was NATO
or the United Nations which had prevented air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This presumes that air strikes could have stopped the Serb
soldiers marching in. In Kosovo, massive NATO air strikes have
clearly done nothing to prevent or limit the Serb onslaught on the
Kosovo Albanians. It certainly felt nice to see the good missiles
heading for their evil targets. But one day we may discover that
the massacres in Kosovo during the days and nights when NATO was
striking from the sky were even worse than the terrible war crimes
in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   We must learn again the lessons of war and power; we must
painfully start to reread the classics such as Clausewitz and all
those who learned about war and power the hard way. Perhaps there
are no smart wars, even in our smart age.

BIRDS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For birds, spring is the season to build nests, lay eggs and
poke a constant supply of fish and insects into the mouths of
ever-hungry chicks. It is also the season when birds play a
starring role on the Internet, their domestic lives shown on dozens
of live video Web sites where the public can keep abreast of every
flutter.
</P>
<P>
   Birds are filmed from cameras installed before their arrival at
regular nesting sites high in tree branches, inside birdhouses and
on office ledges. The birds seem to be none the wiser about their
global audience and go about rearing chicks as they have since long
before the Web was created.
</P>
<P>
   In photographs that are updated via a Web camera, or Webcam, as
often as every 15 seconds, birds can be seen furnishing nests with
feathers, laying eggs and returning home with lizards in their
beaks. At other times, the view can be dull as parents sit
motionless on their eggs or leave the nest unattended.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting nest cams on the Web is focused on a
pair of peregrine falcons that roost in a box 400 feet up a power
plant smokestack in Oak Park Heights, Minn. The female, named Mae,
who is sitting on four eggs that are expected to hatch at any time,
has returned to this site for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unprecedented look into the life of an endangered
species,'' said Paul Adelmann, a spokesman for Northern States
Power Co., which has included Mae and her mate on its Web site
(www.nspco.com/nspbird.htm) as a public relations (and educational)
tool since 1996. ``Boy, when those babies hatch, it's always fun to
watch. They're really furry.''
</P>
<P>
   Live images of Mae are generally available from mid-April to
early June, from the time the parents prepare their nest to when
their hatchlings fly away.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the birds' stay, the camera is focused on the
nest. But for the last two weeks, the camera is directed toward a
wooden flight deck where the young stand and stretch their wings
for a few days before throwing themselves into the air high above
the St. Croix River.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what species of bird, watching the hatchlings break
through their eggshells is an especially coveted event on the Web.
Of course, catching a glimpse of it requires luck. The process can
be relatively fast, is sometimes blocked from view by a parent and
can happen at night when there is no light to see.
</P>
<P>
   Of all nest cam Web sites, peregrine falcons and bald eagles
appear to be the most popular species in terms of numbers. Other
birds include storks, ospreys and geese.
</P>
<P>
   The nests featured on the Web are found around the world, though
given the limited panoramas of most of the cameras, the photographs
could be coming from anywhere. They are run by universities,
companies and amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites have audio samples of birds chirping. There is
frequently background information about the birds, including what
they eat, whether the parents are paired for life and how long
their eggs take to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   A family of kestrels may be seen at the www.jps.net/dnaprice
site, from Arizona. Two bald eagles in Tennessee are at
www.eaglewatch.com. The nest of a family of Carolina chickadees can
be found at www.ornith.cornell.edu. And one of the most extensive
links to several different bird cams is at www.pitt.edu/dziadosz.

FIVE YEARS INTO A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE, TRUE LOVE BLOSSOMS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By EMILY PRAGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My computer is sick and I'm worried. The screen is yellow. It
won't print. When I called a techie and told him the symptoms, he
laughed devilishly and refused to help me over the phone. I don't
like this. I feel as if my lifeline is fraying and I'm about to be
set adrift. I think I have post-traumatic Web syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, I didn't even have a computer. I had an
electronic typewriter and a television, and I was happy. I got a
computer primarily because I was forced to. My book editor laid
down the law. Correcting my manuscripts by cutting and pasting, a
creative act I miss to this day, was no longer acceptable. I had to
join the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   So I threw away my white-out and bought a Mac in December 1994,
thinking of it as a secretarial tool and a bottomless file cabinet.
In fact, all I knew about computers was their storage and
correction capabilities. I had no idea that a computer would change
my life completely. I had never heard the term cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   My television had always been my connection to the world. I was,
for example, a devotee of live television events. From the Kennedy
assassination on, I don't think I missed a great happening in the
world. I saw the moon landing from start to finish, the 1972
Olympics, the last flight out of Vietnam, the Watergate hearings
and on and on _ and yes, Chernobyl, the day Ronald Reagan was shot,
Iran-contra, Bork, the O.J. Simpson chase. Through my television, I
felt that I was part of some worldwide family of watchers, and I
was loyal to the group. I thought of it as a great informational
tool, and it indeed taught me a lot.
</P>
<P>
   I became a parent about the same time that I got a computer, and
parenthood changed my relationship to television, too. I was no
longer free to watch anything I liked at any time I liked, and one
thing I had to stop watching completely was my favorite thing, the
nightly news. As network news became more lurid, it was too
unpredictable, too often wildly unsuitable for children. For
solace, I turned to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, my Internet service provider was in a
rudimentary state, and it was not easy to get out of its world and
onto the Web. That was all right because I didn't really know the
difference between the two.
</P>
<P>
   I was just delighted when I found that by plugging my phone cord
into my modem, I could get access to an entire newsstand's worth of
newspapers and magazines, seemingly for free. So after a long day
of baby care, I started sitting down at the computer and reading
the news. And in the process of doing that, one night I
inadvertently got onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that I was seeking the front page of the main
newspaper in Jakarta, Indonesia. I clicked on something I had
clicked on many times before, and suddenly there were strange
rippling movements on the screen and a new kind of page appeared,
with a bar at the top that I instantly dubbed ``the www thing.''
Presto, I was on the Web. Reading a newspaper on the other side of
the world while watching my sleeping baby at home _ the whole event
gave life to the term futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   Then one night when I was reading the news, a news flash
suddenly appeared on the screen. I had not realized before that the
Web was ``live'' in that way. I was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   In those two moments, I felt an entirely new connection to the
world; I was a member of a new group more informed than ever
before. Our information was as up to the minute as was
technologically possible. At last I felt solidarity with my
computer. It became not only my favorite but also my most trusted
machine.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, five years later, my computer has never let me
down. I have become more and more accustomed to it and, perhaps,
most important, I no longer fear it. At first, I was terribly
intimidated by URL's (Uniform Resource Locators, or Web page
addresses). But that was because I thought I had to understand
them. Now I know I only have to use them, and I feel much better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's true of the whole computer system. Once I
realized that I will never understand its workings as I understood
the typewriter _ that understanding the computer is beyond my
capability and something not expected of me, that I could simply be
a drone and that was OK _ I began to love going on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the Web remains a fantastical construct and perhaps
always will. I see it as a vast spider's web woven globally across
the world with little sites, like bound-up houseflies, caught
within its silken thread. The U.R.L.'s take me to these sites,
which are manned, I fantasize, by different humans of other lands,
in distant homes and offices decorated with foreign home
furnishings. The home pages are like huge billboards for these
sites, visible out there in cyberspace, where there is, at present,
still no gravity.
</P>
<P>
   I recently consulted the Chinese yellow pages for a phone number
in rural China, and I found it! I cannot think now of going on a
trip without using my e-mail to connect me to my home. Every day I
E-mote to friends who have moved to London, Los Angeles and rural
China. Our friendships are up to date now, reconnected through
cyberspace, never to be lost again.
</P>
<P>
   I am in the first generation of writers who no longer use paper
and at first, it was terribly wrenching. But now I send all pieces
via e-mail and I don't have to worry about pages getting lost or
bent or mashed and paper being everywhere in my office and
yellowing from age.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relief, actually. That my overhead has gone from the cost
of a pencil and paper to the cost of a computer plus supplies irks
me, but I wouldn't change back, not for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now I watch television only rarely _ when ``The Sopranos'' is
on, or when I want to take a really good look at something. I have
switched both my mental and physical allegiance to cyberspace,
something I would never have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the techie finally found time for me and came over.
There's nothing, thank God, wrong with my computer. The screen was
yellow because a wire was loose, so my computer guru told me to
tape it. It was sluggish because the hard drive was, as he put it,
``full of garbage.'' Its problems were the result of my neglect.
</P>
<P>
   I am terribly embarrassed and somewhat amazed. I didn't realize
that it was bad for the computer not to throw out old applications
and obsolete software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as a car,'' the techie kept saying, but I never
will. I think of my computer as a miniature version of Hal in
``2001,'' a sentient machine that is my escort into the 21st
century. If it needs a little maid service in return for the entree
it gives me, I'll be happy to comply.

<P>
   Kristina Johnson and David Franke are circumnavigating the
world, taking in sights as remote as the glaciers of New Zealand
and the mountains of Nepal. But don't assume that this couple have
dropped off the map.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. Click on the Web site (www.wired2theworld.com)
that Franke and Ms. Johnson lovingly maintain, and you'll see a
smorgasbord of trip details.
</P>
<P>
   The site is crammed with dozens of pictures, a pretrip journal,
Ms. Johnson's global recipe collection, links to almost 30 related
travel sites and a spot for sending e-mail to the travelers. The
couple, who are married, are also using the Internet to stay in
touch with some two dozen family members and friends, as well as to
give advice to travelers who ask.
</P>
<P>
   They manage all their finances on line, using tools like
Citibank's online banking service and the online stock trading that
is offered by Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Call it dharma bums go digital, even though they seem a far cry
from what Jack Kerouac had in mind when he described his wanderings
in search of spiritual truth in his 1958 novel ``Dharma Bums.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, extended trips abroad usually meant that
travelers would disappear, surfacing occasionally only through
hideously expensive phone calls or rumpled airmail envelopes
bearing ancient postmarks.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new breed of technonomad is taking to the road. These
travelers are fortifying themselves with things like laptops,
personal digital assistants, telephone adapter kits, digital
cameras, photo-editing software and Web-design tools. They're using
the Net not just to take care of pesky daily matters _ like paying
credit card bills _ but also to trade tips with fellow travelers on
the road, scout out resources in countries to be visited and post
online travelogues.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site that carries the Round-the-World Travel Guide
(www.travel-library.com/rtw/html), for example, posts nearly 100
travelogues for trips that are either in the works or already
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers may find the idea of tethering themselves to
cyberspace while they are taking in faraway places downright odd.
After all, much of the charm of travel is the chance to throw off
the chains of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother taking in the exotic aura of, say, a camel fair in
Pushkar, India, if you're busy worrying whether your errant
relatives have turned your home into Party Central? Or whether your
former employer now lists you as ``deceased''?
</P>
<P>
   Many technonomads do, in fact, try to strike a balance when
they're on the road so their cyberspace travels do not overwhelm
their real ones. And they occasionally grumble about turning on
their computers to find 80 e-mail messages. But for the most part,
these travelers are happy to be wired, and their enthusiasm shows
in the mounds of information they post on line.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that information is decidedly homespun. There are
road-kill counts on line, as well as detailed descriptions of
scourges like ``Bali belly.'' And then there's the online
``souvenir'' collection that Scott and Laura Kruglewicz, a
``thirty-something'' Atlanta couple, are maintaining during their
yearlong, 36-country odyssey (www.worldwidewanderings.com).
</P>
<P>
   Before they left home, Ms. Kruglewicz was a customer service
representative in the travel industry, while Kruglewicz was a sales
and marketing director at General Electric Capital. Now their
souvenir bin contains pictures of things like a Russian candy bar
and a mummified Egyptian cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used technology to do the thing that's most important to
us _ share our experiences with those who weren't able to come,''
the couple wrote in an e-mail message from Bangkok, Thailand. ``Let
them travel vicariously through our adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also important to Almitra Von-Willcox, 51, from
San Diego, who is on a walking tour of the world. Ms. Von-Willcox
was a single parent for 18 years, and she supported her three
children mostly by working as a cocktail waitress and renovating
and selling rundown houses. She says it will take 14 years to
complete her trip.
</P>
<P>
   She is traveling with an Apple Powerbook computer, a digital
camera, a printer, a solar panel and a satellite-based navigation
system. She is also posting her trip on the Web under the moniker
of Almitra the Photo Gypsy (www.photogypsy.com).
</P>
<P>
   In a recent e-mail message from Australia, Ms. Von-Willcox wrote
that she hoped her Web site would help ``more people around the
world learn the wonder and delight of the goodness of strangers, as
well as the uniqueness of other cultures.'' She added, ``I also
hope to be an inspiration to those who need to challenge
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Kruglewicz are posting intriguing online interviews with
some of the people they have met on the road, and their travels are
being followed by a number of elementary school classes. And John
Berns, a former world traveler who is now living in Bangkok, offers
a host of technical tips, among other things, at his Web site
(www.travelog.net), which he describes as ``a geek, a digital
camera and a laptop go around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overly modest. Partly because Berns has received so
many inquiries about extended travel, he has turned his Web site
into an Internet publishing business for educating travelers.
</P>
<P>
   He posts his own global adventures, often within hours after
they occur. Berns quit a job in Internet publishing in 1997, when
he was 35, to hit the road. Now two of his closest companions are
an IBM Thinkpad 560 laptop and a Kodak DCS-120 digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   He also relies on Microsoft's Front Page software to write and
edit his Web pages quickly. To process and edit his travel photos,
he tends to rely on the Thumbsplus software from Cerious Software,
although he also uses Photoshop 4.0, by Adobe.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a dried-squid vendor has set up outside his
apartment, Berns feels ``amazingly connected'' to the digital
world, he wrote in a recent e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   When George Mason, Salli Slaughter and their two young daughters
took off on a yearlong, 18-country ``sabbatical'' in late 1996,
they also wanted to stay wired.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the family used a Macintosh laptop, a Web site and
an Internet service provider to receive more than 100 e-mail
messages a week and get information from people in countries that
they were about to visit, like Greece and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mason and Ms. Slaughter home-schooled their
daughters, Samantha and Cassidy, while they were away, they used
the Net to communicate with their daughters' teachers back home and
teachers elsewhere, like a Bulgarian math professor they met in
Japan. She helped Samantha, who was 14 when she left home, with her
precalculus homework over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Mason-Slaughter family used the computer daily. And the
family's photo-packed adventure is still on line
(www.worldhop.com). It contains such decidedly personal notes as
Samantha's guide to Asian toilets and Mason's experience teaching
the hokey-pokey in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The Net even helped the family return home. After they got to
England, near the end of their trip, they hunted for job leads by
sending e-mail messages to everyone they knew. One of the messages
landed Mason _ who turned 50 while he was on the road _ a public
relations job in Portland, Ore., where he and the family now live.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mason-Slaughter family, the pros of staying connected on
the road definitely outweighed the cons. When the family left home,
Mason and Ms. Slaughter had just quit their jobs and given up their
leased house. Two weeks into the trip, the family's pet wolf died
back in Anchorage, leaving them feeling more disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally adrift,'' Ms. Slaughter said recently. ``So
the Internet became a real place _ it wasn't just cyber anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, going digital on an extended highway abroad isn't
always easy, as Ms. Johnson and Franke have found.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out on her travels last fall, Ms. Johnson, a
former seafood chef, spent two years preparing for the trip that
she and Franke, a former bilingual primary school teacher, would
take. Their gear includes a Toshiba Libretto laptop that weighs
1.87 pounds; a Ricoh digital camera and a telephone hook-up kit
that includes numerous adapter plugs, adapter jacks, a telephone
line tester and an acoustic coupler.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they are paying roughly $28 a month for both an
Internet service provider and a service called iPass, which
provides them with dial-up software and international-access phone
numbers. Because iPass relies on local phone numbers, wherever
possible, for access to the Internet, Ms. Johnson and Franke are
using it to cut down on their connection charges overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But those charges are adding up. Ms. Johnson and Franke
currently pay between $4 to $12 an hour for Internet access alone,
which runs $20 to $40 a month. And then there are the costs of
simply dialing up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because the couple are staying mostly in hotels, even local
phone calls tend to be extremely expensive. And when local numbers
have not worked, Ms. Johnson and Franke have had to gain access to
the Internet through long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they have also had to turn to cybercafes. That has
usually been the case when iPass has failed them, or when they have
been unable to afford a room with a phone or when the quality of
the phone lines has simply been too poor. They estimate that they
spend $15 to $30 a week for computer-generated phone calls and
cybercafes.
</P>
<P>
   But relying on Internet cafes can create its own set of
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   When Geoff and Lauren Slater took off on a journey in late 1996
that eventually took them to more than a dozen countries, they soon
discovered that cybercafes tended to sprout up and disappear with
alarming frequency. And access to the Internet from the cafes
varied enormously in price; a cafe in La Paz, Bolivia, charged the
Slaters 50 cents an hour, while a cafe in Chile charged them $8 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went on the road, Slater quit a job as a planning
director for Boston's transit system, while Ms. Slater was an
education services manager for a software company. Now the couple
call Vermont their home, although their global adventures are still
posted on line at the www.madriver.com/users/rtw2vt site.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Donath, a former long-term traveler who is now home in
Chicago, spent weeks in India before he finally found a cybercafe
that had working equipment. He also discovered that many cafes he
visited would deliberately overestimate the amount of time he spent
on line, often tacking on the time he had to spend simply waiting
to be connected.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, money is useful to the digital dharma bum, and several
sites post sponsorship information. Some of the travelers have
managed to attract sponsors, although many appear to be flying
solo. Ms. Von-Willcox said she had not approached anyone for money
yet; the companies listed as sponsors, she said, have contributed
``stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers now wouldn't dream of circling the globe without
being wired. The Slaters, for example, relied on the Net to stay in
contact with friends and family members, and Slater also turned to
it to keep up with the Boston Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes digital connections have helped travelers in
unexpected ways.
</P>
<P>
   Take Donath. He cut short his round-the-world trip in Singapore
last winter, when it was discovered that his wife and traveling
companion, Sybil, had breast cancer. Shortly after they came home,
they received in the mail a video about breast cancer that had been
sent by an Internet user who had visited the couple's Web site
(www.travel-library.com/rtw/donath).
</P>
<P>
   Donath said the video is helping his wife cope with her disease.
Before the recent explosion in the number of personal Web sites _
including those written by travelers like himself _ receiving such
support ``would have been unimaginable,'' he wrote in a recent
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term travelers can easily get information about gaining
access to the Internet and posting their travels from the road.
There are probably hundreds of travelogues on line, and at least
one guidebook publisher, Lonely Planet, also maintains an extensive
message board, the Thorn Tree, at its site (www.lonelyplanet.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many seasoned travelers also like the broad range of information
that is offered at sites like www.travel-library.com, and the
www.roadnews.com site is geared toward people traveling with
laptops. Many people who post tales of their journeys on Web sites
include a ``how we did it'' section that lists technological
information. For a list of Internet cafes abroad, see the
www.netcafeguide.com site.
</P>
<P>
   A site called www.photo.net is useful for both improving photo
skills and building personal Web pages. Another site at
www.microship.com/technomads is filled with travelogues.
</P>
<P>
   What about lugging a computer on the road? Marc Brosius, a
former long-term traveler who runs the popular Round-the-World
Guide on line (www.travel-library &QC; .com/rtw/html), recommends that
travelers stick to a laptop that weighs no more than two or three
pounds, like the Sony Vaio.
</P>
<P>
   While smaller machines can often run on AA batteries, travelers
who want to use a digital camera and edit their photos should
choose machines with relatively large screens, of at least 10
inches, to insure that they can see enough of each picture to edit
properly, Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other long-term travelers, Brosius recommends taking a
digital camera on the road, to avoid photo development hassles on
the road and to be able to post pictures quickly and easily at Web
sites. To avoid problems like blurry action shots, he recommends
that travelers stick to machines with at least one million pixels
of resolution.
</P>
<P>
   What about software? Brosius advises that beginners, in
particular, should keep it simple. For travelers who want to write
Web pages with interesting layouts and who do not want to have to
do their own HTML coding _ the common computer language of the Web
_ he recommends sticking to a product like Adobe's Page Mill. He
likes Photodeluxe, also made by Adobe, for photo editing.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone hardware abroad is still a problem. Travelers still
complain about ancient phone lines and phones that are hard-wired
to the wall without phone jacks. Many travelers carry adapter kits
like those made by Road Warrior International (www.warrior.com) or
Teleadapt (www.teleadapt.com).
</P>
<P>
   Internet access from around the world has improved significantly
lately, as companies like America Online and International Business
Machines have set up global networks. AOL offers access in more
than 100 countries, while IBM offers access in 53 countries,
through more than 1,300 access numbers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 of those numbers operate at modem speeds of 56K,
unlike the 33K speeds that are more common through other Internet
service providers, a company spokesman said. Most AOL numbers, a
spokeswoman said, operate at 56K.
</P>
<P>
   A company in Mountain View, Calif., called iPass says it has
some 3,200 access points in 150 countries (www.ipass.com). The
iPass company tries to provide Internet access through local
telephone calls wherever possible. But travelers have to sign up
with an ISP to get access to iPass.
</P>
<P>
   The iPass service is not available in Vietnam or North Korea,
and some travelers have reported access problems in countries like
Thailand and France.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Chakmakian, an iPass co-founder, said her company was
trying to iron out access problems, especially in Thailand, China
and India. Some computer users may have modems that are
incompatible with some countries' phone systems, Ms. Chakmakian
said, and iPass, like many ISPs, is trying to alert its users to
potential modem problems. A 56K modem, for example, may not connect
through a slower access number.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius recommends thorough planning for a trip. ``I see a lot
of people who at the last minute buy their equipment and who have
no idea of the full range of it,'' he said. ``Also, you have to
work the bugs out.''

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Building a simple set of stairs is not difficult, but it does
require taking accurate measurements, making a few calculations and
taking care to lay out the figures carefully on the carriage
boards. When you have taken all the required measurements, you can
estimate how much lumber you need for the project. If possible, buy
extra lengths. This will allow you some latitude if you have to cut
out sections that have knots or cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The carriages provide the support for the steps, so it is
important to cut them from lumber that is sound and relatively free
of defects. If possible, go to the lumber yard and hand-pick the
boards yourself. The stock does not have to be perfectly clear
(free of knots). A few knots or cracks near the edge may be
acceptable if you can cut them away when you cut the pattern for
the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Carriage boards should be wide; they must be at lease 3 inches
wider than the riser height. If your risers are 7 inches deep, the
carriages will have to be at least 10 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   To lay out the step pattern on the carriage start about six
inches from the end and mark off the width of the first tread, then
draw a line, perpendicular to the first, for the riser. Marking off
the tread/riser lines is demanding because lines must be straight,
they must always be the same respective lengths, and they must join
at a perfect right, that is 90 degree, angles. This, however, is
easy if you use a framing square with a pair of stair gauges. Stair
gauges are small screw clamps. They are sold in pairs at most home
centers and hardware stores for about $5.
</P>
<P>
   Locate the riser measurement on the short arm of the square and
lock one gauge at this point. Move to the adjacent arm of the
square and lock the other gauge at the tread measurement. To mark
off the steps, position the square on the board so both gauges butt
against the edge. Draw lines along the square arms.
</P>
<P>
   Reposition the square for the next step and draw new lines. All
the lines will be consistent, and they will always form a right
angle. At the end of the step pattern, draw the final riser line.
Finish the stair pattern by drawing a base line. It will be
parallel to the last tread and connect with the end of the last
riser.
</P>
<P>
   After laying out the step pattern, check to make sure that it
matches on both carriage boards. Then use a circular saw to cut
through the lines. Cut along the layout lines, but stop cutting at
the intersection. Use a handsaw or saber saw to complete the cuts.
Cutting beyond the lines can weaken the carriages.
</P>
<P>
   Next cut the lumber to make the risers and treads. Start by
ripping (cutting through the length) the boards to the right width.
Then cut them to length. For example, assume that your stairs will
be 32 inches wide, with 6 risers and 5 treads. The risers will be 7
inches wide and the treads 10 inches. Rip the riser boards to 7
inches wide, then cut six 32-inch lengths. Rip the tread stock to a
10-inch width, then cut five 32-inch lengths.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you may want to nail all the pieces together, then
attach the assembled stairs to the deck. This way you can see how
the stairs will look before they are mounted on the deck. The
problem with this method is that the stairs are apt to be heavy and
difficult to maneuver into place. Most professional carpenters,
therefore, prefer to attach the carriage boards onto the deck then
nail the steps in place. In this way they can easily adjust the
carriages to get the proper pitch for the steps. If you choose to
mount the carriage boards before attaching the steps, first nail 2
by 4s to the boards to brace them at the proper width.
</P>
<P>
   The method you use to attach the stairs to the deck will depend
on the deck structure. Probably the easiest way to attach the
stairs is with stair hangers. The hangers are simply three lengths
of 2 by 4s that run vertically from the carriages to the rim joist
on the deck. You will need a nailing surface on the carriages to
attach the hangers. Make this by nailing a 2 by 4 brace across the
top of the carriages so it is parallel to the top riser.
</P>
<P>
   If the joists on your deck run perpendicular to the steps, you
can install mounting blocks to attach the carriages. These blocks
can be cut from 2 by 8s and nailed between the joists. Nail the
carriages directly to the blocks with 10-penny nails.

   Debates over online privacy have led to the proliferation of
seal-of-approval programs designed to signal privacy protection.
Like the presence of a Good Housekeeping seal, which is supposed to
designate a worthwhile product, the privacy seals are displayed by
Web sites to indicate that they have met standards of
trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Three main seal programs have popped up in the last few years:
Truste (pronounced Trust-EE), which was founded in 1997 by
Electronic Frontier Foundation, Boston Consulting Group and a trade
association called Commercenet; CPA Webtrust, which was developed
last year by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and BBB
Online, which was unveiled in March by the Better Business Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The seal programs are being touted by leading companies in
electronic commerce as the best way to protect consumers without
resorting to federal legislation _ a few examples of which are
starting to make their way through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is branding the concept of privacy,'' said Terry Pittman,
a Truste board member.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer-advocacy groups have major doubts about
whether the seals truly signify the level of protection that people
want. And they stress that a privacy seal for a Web site does not
mean that the site will refrain from giving another company
information about you. In many cases, said Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
the seals ``are just a colorful link to a privacy policy that can
say almost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the debate do agree on one thing: Many,
if not most, Web users are not yet familiar with the concept of
privacy seals. AT&AMP;T Labs recently conducted a survey of 381 Net
users to determine what they thought about online privacy. The
study found that 58 percent of respondents would be more likely to
give a Web site their e-mail addresses if the site had a privacy
policy and a privacy seal. But the survey responses also suggested
that even the consumers who are most familiar with the Web do not
completely understand how the seal programs work.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the seals, proponents of the programs say, is to
increase consumers' comfort levels with electronic commerce. ``If a
seal program's agreement with a site contains basic elements that
establish trust between a consumer and a Web business, I expect
that consumers will see the seal and say, OK, this site is OK to do
business with,'' said Pittman, president of media for
Brightstreet.com, a start-up company that develops online
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   To earn any of the three seals, Web sites must meet the
following basic criteria:
</P>
<P>
   _ They must have a privacy policy and must make it easily
accessible online.
</P>
<P>
   _ They must disclose what personal information they collect and
how they use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ They must provide consumers with a chance to opt out of
programs that request personal information.
</P>
<P>
   _ They must secure their Web sites and databases to prevent
public exposure of personal information or raids by hackers to get
access to that information.
</P>
<P>
   The BBB Online program includes one other requirement: Sites
that earn the seal must allow customers to view the information
that the site has collected about them, if the company has a way to
provide that data easily.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that want to display the Truste or BBB Online seals
are required to fill out applications and pay annual license fees,
which range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars,
depending on the company's annual revenue. If the Web site's
privacy policy is approved, the site earns the right to post the
seal, which is designed to link users directly to a verification
page on the seal program's Web site when clicked. A seal that does
not connect to the program's Web site is an illegitimate copy.
About 600 sites now carry the Truste seal and about 450 sites have
inquired about applying for the mark of BBB Online.
</P>
<P>
   The CPA Webtrust seal signifies a site that has submitted to a
more rigorous review _ and has also been willing to shell out a
larger sum of money for the privilege. A company's Web site is
eligible for the Webtrust seal only after it has been examined by a
certified public accountant who has been trained to audit computer
systems and scrutinize a company's electronic processes for
gathering data. The examinations can cost companies a few thousand
dollars or even several hundred thousand dollars, depending on the
company's size. CPA Webtrust has certified 20 sites so far.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing the principles behind the seals is also part of the
package. Officials for Truste and BBB Online say that they
constantly monitor, review and investigate their certified sites.
If they find an infraction, they say, they will withdraw their
seals from the Web site. With the CPA Webtrust seals, auditors are
required to visit the Web site's company headquarters every three
months for reviews. If the site is not up to snuff, Webtrust
officials say, the seal is removed. So far, none of the companies
has pulled a seal off a site.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the seals, however, indicates privacy, not
secrecy. No seal guarantees that a Web site will not sell or trade
your e-mail address, name or phone number, or records of your
purchases and online surfing habits. And Web sites with the same
privacy seal may have widely different privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the seal programs say they are not trying to
dictate specific practices; they do not want to start micromanaging
how companies use information that they have gathered legally, with
a customer's informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates counter that companies have very broad notions
of what constitutes ``informed consent.'' Are you ``informed''
simply because a policy is posted somewhere online? And is it
considered ``consent'' if you have to actively seek a way to stop a
company from making information about you available to third
parties, or should consent mean that you must agree ahead of time
to allow a company to disseminate your personal information?
</P>
<P>
   Determining the degree of control that customers should wield
over information about them is one of the major sticking points in
current negotiations between the European Union and the United
States over privacy protection. The European Union requires that
companies receive ``unambiguous'' consent from customers before
making their personal information available and that customers have
open access to the data that are being collected about them.
</P>
<P>
   The law also forbids companies in European countries from
disclosing personal data to companies in countries whose laws do
not provide the same protections. The United States is one of those
countries. In fact, most United States companies want to do
everything they can to keep such laws from being drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the privacy seals. Company executives say the seals are
proof that online businesses can regulate themselves without
interference from the government. The sponsors of Truste include
some of the Net's largest companies, like America Online, Microsoft
and Netscape. Several of those companies have offered to provide
financial support to BBB Online, too.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those sponsors have also earned privacy seals from
Truste or BBB Online, causing some consumer groups to dismiss the
programs as riddled with conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seals are completely meaningless,'' said Russ Smith, a
privacy advocate who has built a watchdog site called Consumer.net.
He said the seal programs were beholden to their sponsors and had
little incentive to go after companies that violated their own
posted privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   That was disputed by Anne Jennings, a spokeswoman for Truste,
who said, ``We treat our sponsors with more rigor in the
investigative process than we do anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute got specific a month ago, when a watchdog group
called Junkbusters complained to Truste about problems with
Microsoft's Windows 98. An identifying number in the software's
operating system was linked to data gathered about Windows 98 users
without their knowledge. (Microsoft has since said that it will fix
the problem.) The Microsoft Web site carries the Truste seal on a
page that carries the site's privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Truste put out a statement agreeing that the Microsoft practice
``compromised consumer trust,'' but it dismissed the complaint
anyway. It said it did not have jurisdiction over Windows 98
because the Truste seal covers only Web-site interactions.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning does not satisfy Rotenberg, of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center. To him, the privacy seals are less
about providing customers with privacy rights and more about
protecting companies from charges that they are not being fair to
their customers. The privacy seals simply signify disclosure about
what the companies might do with the information they collect about
Web-site visitors, he said. ``That's not protection _ that's just a
disclaimer,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But people who believe in privacy seals say consumers just need
to give them a chance. Customers have high expectations for privacy
on the Internet and want more control over their personal
information than they might have off line, said Pittman, the Truste
board member. ``I think that's the way we're going,'' he said,
``but it will not happen overnight.''

<P>
   Computers continue to shrink successfully, but not their
keyboards. On the tiny keyboards of handheld computers, efficient
touch typing remains a distant dream.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Stanford University professor has a possible solution.
Both real and virtual keyboards may one day be replaced with an
ingenious, one-handed sign language that is the ultimate in touch
typing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it thumbing,'' said the inventor, Vaughan R. Pratt, 55,
a computer scientist at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Using Pratt's method, the computer user would type not just with
the hand, but on it, using the thumb and a variety of finger
positions. Pratt, who specializes in wearable computers, is
designing a glove and other devices to transmit the signals to a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   He has already shrunk a PC with a 340-megabyte hard drive for a
wearable computer to four cubic inches and a Web server to one
cubic inch (described at wearables.stanford.edu). ``I like
equipment you can slip into your pocket without a bulge,'' Pratt
said.
</P>
<P>
   His keyboardless typing system, which he calls thumbcode, is
designed to work with the matchbox-size computer one day. It
depends on a single hand _ not clapping, but quietly tapping with
the thumb on the other four fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To develop wearable computers, all the components must shrink
together, keyboard included,'' Pratt said. ``We achieved
scalability by using the hand itself as the keyboard, rather than
any particular device.''
</P>
<P>
   If thumbcode catches on, joggers may someday be able to answer
their e-mail as they trot along, and pedestrians will be able to
get in a few paragraphs of the great American novel as they wait
for traffic lights to change.
</P>
<P>
   To use the language, a person combines touching the thumb to the
top, middle or base of the index, middle, ring and pinky fingers
with changes in finger position _ from all open to all closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are using the 12 sections of the fingers _ tip, middle and
base of each of four fingers _ as though they formed a 3-by-4
keypad,'' Pratt explained. Holding some fingers together and some
apart expands the character set from 12 characters to 96.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to spell the word tea, a person holds the fingers
apart, then the thumb taps the tip of the ring finger (t), the tip
of the middle finger (e) and the tip of the index finger (a).
</P>
<P>
   Each position in thumbcode corresponds to a character in ASCII,
the plain vanilla language familiar to users of e-mail. ASCII is
designed so all machines in a network, from the simplest to the
most complex, can understand its stripped-down notations for such
essentials as carriage returns, backspaces, the Enter command, the
letters of the alphabet and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes thumbcode digital,'' Pratt said,
distinguishing between his signing language and American Sign
Language. ``Thumbcode is a keyboard replacement and is purely
character-oriented.'' Thumbcode accounts for all 128 seven-bit
ASCII characters as well as other standard computer functions, like
the cursor and the Alt key.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Sign Language is designed to be recognized by people,
not computers,'' Pratt said. ``ASL uses finger spelling for
uncommon words and about 6,000 gestures for common words. It's
complicated to explain gestures to computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thumbcode requires explaining only the 12 positions on the
fingers and the three gaps between fingers. ``This is the sort of
yes-no information computers can handle right now,'' Pratt added.
</P>
<P>
   Thad Starner, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology
who has worked on a wearable computer capable of understanding ASL,
agrees. ``A.S.L. is complex,'' he said. ``It presents challenges to
the computer as complicated as those posed by speech recognition.
Thumbcode is a lot simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt said the characters in thumbcode were quite easy to learn.
And unlike pen-based systems, thumbcode lets you look up while
you're entering data. Pratt estimated that top speed would be about
30 words per minute.
</P>
<P>
   To make thumbcode work as rapidly as possible, the most commonly
used letters have been assigned to easier positions, like the tips
of the fingers. Touching the base of the fingers is slightly more
difficult, Pratt said, so that maneuver is saved for letters used
more infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-to-execute finger positions are modified in other ways. For
instance, the pinky is moved toward the palm rather than trying to
separate it upright from the ring finger, a gesture that is
difficult for some people.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt is busy perfecting his matchbox computer right now, so he
has postponed work on the data glove that will transmit thumbcode,
at least for this semester. He emphasized, however, that he had not
designed thumbcode with a particular mechanism for transmitting it
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I designed it around the hand, not a device,'' he said.
``There are many ways to identify the thumb's location _ a
touch-sensitive glove or a camera perhaps. The beauty of the scheme
is that the basic concept is independent of the hardware you use
for recognition to the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, many people who want to communicate with their
wearable computers use a device called a Handykey Twiddler
(www.handykey.com), a keyboard that fits into the hand. To use the
Twiddler, one or more keys are pressed to form a character, word or
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Starner wrote his entire PhD dissertation using a Twiddler. ``By
now I'm up to 60 words a minute,'' he said. ``But I have many, many
hours of practice and lots of macros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pratt's system of dispensing with the keyboard and using the
hand itself may, like the Twiddler, be better for the body. With a
desktop keyboard, you are bending your wrist, leading to all sorts
of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto and a
pioneer in the field of wearable computers, has different ideas for
the keyboardless future. ``Why not interact with things directly?''
he asked. ``For instance, you can look at something as a means of
selecting it. Keyboards force us to think in terms of syntax.
Visual thinking is more powerful. I would call into question the
entire metaphor of the keyboard.''

SMILE! IT'S DIGITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent visit to an amusement park in Florida, where he was
supposed to be having fun, poor little Taylor was in agony.
``Taylor, take a bite of your hot dog,'' his father coached.
``Smile! That's it! Taylor, turn around and walk toward the roller
coaster. No, walk the other way. Taylor, look over here. Over here!
Wave to your grandpa. Say, `Hi, Grandpa!' Show him your new
T-shirt. Come on, Taylor, smile!''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's father had a video camcorder attached to his face and
was determined, apparently, to let no moment of this vacation go
undocumented. Taylor riding the carousel. Taylor drinking from a
fountain. Taylor looking miserable as he is hugged by some garishly
costumed theme park employee.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Taylor, his father did not have access to one of
Sony's new Digital 8 Handycam camcorders with up to 10 hours of
battery life and the capability to shoot video in the dark.
Otherwise, his entire day might have been directed and
choreographed by his video-crazed dad.
</P>
<P>
   The new Handycam, in the right hands, is actually a delightful
piece of technology. It has many of the best features of digital
camcorders, including superior picture quality, near CD-quality
sound, the ability to snap digital still photographs, to make exact
digital copies of tapes, to add special effects and to transfer
images easily to a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   It can also record on and play back from older, less expensive
and more widely available 8-mm and Hi-8 video cassettes. Most
digital camcorders use a special digital video (DV) cassette, which
is smaller than an 8-mm cassette, and of course they are
incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   So the new Handycam is an ideal bridge between digital and
analog video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also makes DV-only camcorders, for those who are willing to
make a clean break with the past. But the new line of Digital 8
video cameras _ three models ranging from $699 to $1,399 (suggested
retail prices), offer a smart compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason to get a digital video camera is picture
quality. With a horizontal resolution of more than 500 lines, a
digital video camera can create very sharp pictures, much better
than analogue camcorders. By contrast, Super VHS and Hi-8 formats
record 400 lines, standard television is 330 lines, and
8-millimeter and VHS camcorders record only 250 lines.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing the top-of-the-line Digital 8 model, the
DCR-TRV510. It is larger and heavier than most DV camcorders, but
about the same size and heft as analog 8-mm cameras. Although it
records onto Hi-8 tapes with exactly the same high resolution and
clarity of digital camcorders that use DV tape, it does so at the
expense of recording time.
</P>
<P>
   A 120-minute Hi-8 tape in a Digital 8 camcorder yields just 60
minutes of recorded video, while a 120-minute DV tape in a DV
digital camcorder yields the full two hours.
</P>
<P>
   At $1,399, the DCR-TRV510 is more expensive than most 8-mm
camcorders, yet less expensive than some DV models, which charge a
premium for miniaturization. Still, it comes loaded with digital
camera features.
</P>
<P>
   The DCR-TRV510 has a color viewfinder and a flip-out, four-inch
color display screen that is among the best I've seen. The screen
image still washes out in bright sunlight, as they all seem to do,
but it is impressive indoors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Sony Digital 8 models come with a 20X optical zoom
lens that can be boosted to 360X magnification via digital zooming.
Digital zooming is overrated. It does not add anything to picture
quality, but merely enlarges the size of the digital picture
elements (pixels) in the center of the image.
</P>
<P>
   Zooming in too tightly creates a blocky, mosaic effect that one
often sees on television when one of Jerry Springer's guests
decides to reveal an intimate tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The camera is also equipped with image stabilization technology
that reduces the normal shakes and jitters that plague hand-held
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has video and audio ports, which means that it can be
hooked up to an older video camera, a VCR or a television set to
make digital copies of older analog tapes or even TV broadcasts.
With analog tapes, every time a copy is made, the picture is
degraded just a little. When both the image and the soundtrack are
made of 1s and 0s, digital copies are identical to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may want to transfer their older analog tapes to
newer digital tapes, to preserve picture quality and memories for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing features of the DCR-TRV510 is called
I-Link, which is Sony's brand name for an IEEE 1394 digital
interface. IEEE 1394, also known as Firewire, is a high-speed data
transfer port that is popular on newer personal computers and
digital peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Link port is bidirectional, which means that it can send
not only video to a PC _ because it is digital, there is no need
for a separate PC video capture board _ but also easily transfer
edited video from a PC back to the camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Once the video is in the PC, a creative videographer might wish
to add a CD soundtrack, edit out the 99 percent of most videos that
are uninteresting except to parents and grandparents, and add fancy
scene transitions with fades, wipes, old-time movie and other
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Another snazzy feature is Laser Link, which uses infrared waves
to transfer images. When an optional ($70) infrared receiver is
attached to a television, you can beam video directly to the
television set without wires, cables or gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared waves have other interesting properties, like the
ability to invisibly illuminate things at night. The Sony I tested
has a feature called Nightshot, which functions much like the night
vision scopes used by spies. It works over short distances in
almost complete darkness (zero lux), although the image is a
washed-out monochrome with an eerie green tint.
</P>
<P>
   Sony suggests that Nightshot is handy during camping trips,
perhaps for tracking and videotaping wily nocturnal creatures like
foxes or teen-agers. Another possible use, Sony suggests, is for
keeping an infrared eye on the baby at night without turning on the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed feelings about using the video camera as a digital
still camera. The Sony can store hundreds of snapshots on a tape.
Its ability to capture both video and still images is a harbinger
of the eventual convergence of digital cameras with digital
camcorders. But transferring the pictures off the tape is somewhat
awkward, and I still prefer a true digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   But I liked the Sony's ability to capture a single frame from a
video tape. The image can be transferred to a PC and perhaps sent
as e-mail or posted to a Web site. The software to allow the PC to
receive and manipulate the images is included.
</P>
<P>
   Another clever touch is the use of an ``Info-Lithium'' battery.
Lithium ion batteries are far superior to the older nickel cadmium
batteries (NiCads), because they do not have the so-called memory
effect that required the owner to worry about discharging the
battery completely before recharging. Lithium batteries can be
recharged whenever the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   The ``info'' part of the battery is very handy. It tells, via a
digital meter in the camera's viewfinder and on its side control
panel, exactly how many minutes are left before the battery goes
kaput.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely got 30 minutes of active use from the battery that came
with the camera. For $60 to $150 more, Sony offers optional Stamina
batteries that promise up to 10 hours of uninterrupted recording
time. Sorry, Taylor.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no

wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of

A PERFECTIONIST TRIES TO MAKE A FISH STORY TITANIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday May 2)  
(rk) 
 By BRUCE NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ He has spent the morning polishing his shark as if
he were someone detailing a car _ meticulously examining the
gleaming grillwork of its mouth, the coldness of its eyes, the
rakish tilt of its dorsal fin _ and now Renny Harlin must face the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Not the theme music that the shark in Steven Spielberg's
``Jaws'' was always humming. Dum-dum. Dum-dum. How did people in
the water not hear that? No, Harlin's shark movie is of a different
kind.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Deep Blue Sea,'' the director has assembled more than 300
tracks of recorded sounds, so that this essentially noiseless
creature can chew through metal and flesh _ and, with any luck, the
summer box office after the film's July 30 release _ in deafening
Dolby digital.
</P>
<P>
   It is actually possible to trace the evolution of the summer
action movie over the last quarter-century by examining the chum
line of plot contrivances and special effects that leads from
``Jaws'' to ``Deep Blue Sea.'' In his 1975 classic, Spielberg made
do with a single, peckish shark that was rarely seen and _ except
for the humming _ never heard.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlin's far frothier film, research scientists have
genetically altered the DNA of an entire fleet of mako sharks, and
are on the verge of finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, when
something goes horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the scientists are being stalked by their own coldblooded
creations, which have overrun the floating laboratory Aquatica, a
place that was considered the last word in mad-scientist housing
until it started to sink in a tropical storm so big, you half
expect to see cows flying through the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, just when you thought it was safe to go back in
the multiplex: ``Jurassic Shark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has seen sharks in living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens
before,'' declares Harlin, to whom such auteurist flourishes just
seem to come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, he has come to an editing room on the Warner
Brothers lot to study an action sequence, which lasts several
minutes and in which the longest speech delivered by anyone not
breathing through gills is ``Oh, my God!'' Harlin has used his own
boat to get the sound of an idling motor just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spend so much time making all these little decisions to
try to make it perfect,'' he says. ``And in the end, if the movie
doesn't work, if people watch it and say it wasn't any good, you
feel like, `What fools we were for all that work.' Because it just
means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Any conversation with Harlin about his new water movie must
eventually wash up on ``Cutthroat Island,'' the submersible bomb
that nearly destroyed his career. When it detonated in 1995 _
``Cutthroat Island'' was the film industry's first $100 million
flop, making back only $10 million _ all he could think about were
the thousands of custom-made costumes, the hundreds of swords and
pistols whose details he had agonized over getting just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depressed me, of course,'' he says of the debacle,
``because we had chosen every pirate hat and sword with great
care.''
</P>
<P>
   In the editing room, his eye is on the 25-foot, 8,000-pound
mechanical shark that the studio built for him. With its
thousand-horsepower hydraulic engine, the shark was capable of
doing 35 miles an hour, though speed was less the point than the
relentless need to keep moving forward, a need that it shares with
the director.
</P>
<P>
   During one scene in which the shark was making its way through a
half-flooded living room, a glitch in the beast's software suddenly
launched it straight up through the ceiling. ``It went through the
two-by-four beams there like they were cheese,'' Harlin says
proudly. ``It gave everybody a good idea of the power of the
shark.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a power Harlin knows very well, having spent the last
decade swimming with the sharks in Hollywood, before being nearly
devoured by them. In the early '90s, he quickly moved to the front
rank of action-movie directors with the consecutive box-office
successes ``Die Hard 2'' and ``Cliffhanger.'' Harlin is a
6-foot-4-inch Finn with flowing blond hair and a great bronze slab
of a face.
</P>
<P>
   When he was living large, Harlin took no prisoners, though every
night he was visited by the nightmares that have haunted him since
he was a little boy. ``It's always the same,'' he says. ``Being
chased, being guilty of something, losing everything. I'm in the
middle of a movie, and all of a sudden the police come and accuse
me of murder. They're taking me to jail and I'm looking at the set,
thinking: `Oh, my God, I've lost it all. It's over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harlin blinks. ``It does make for a life without very many happy
moments,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He had waited his whole life for happiness. Now he was hungry
for it, and at any price. When he married the Oscar-winning actress
Geena Davis in 1993, their guests' feet rarely touched the ground
during a wedding weekend of elephant and hot-air balloon rides.
Overhead, a skywriter painted interlocking hearts across the sky.
The budget for this diorama was reportedly $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up costing an insane amount of money, yes,'' Harlin
says. ``I was afraid to get married and have kids because I thought
it would ruin my career, so I had waited until I was 34. I took it
very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the wedding worth it? ``I don't know,'' he says. ``We just
tried to make it as beautiful and romantic and memorable as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that same impulse, oddly, that guided Harlin as he walked
down the plank on ``Cutthroat Island.'' That epic shipwreck became
emblematic of a kind of wretched excess associated with Hollywood
egos run amok, and Harlin's directorial swagger seemed particularly
evident in his determination to make his wife an action-movie star.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted it first on the pirate picture, though it cost him
the film's only bankable star, Michael Douglas. Douglas felt Ms.
Davis' role was being beefed up at the expense of his own, and quit
after Harlin declined to do anything about it. (The director
insists now that Douglas was merely ``exhausted'' and didn't want
to go to Malta for several months.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he cast Ms. Davis as a platinum blond assassin in ``The
Long Kiss Goodnight,'' which also failed to make money.
</P>
<P>
   He was reviled for all this. ``Hollywood people love to gossip
and snicker about other people's failure,'' he says. But the sin
for which Harlin suffered _ and for which he was willing to risk
everything _ was the pride that he obviously took in showing off
his wife to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Was he blinded by love? ``I can't deny that in some ways it
played a part in everything falling apart,'' he says. ``People
think: `Oh, this is too much, you're so in love and you're doing
everything together. It's unbearable. What do you think, that
you're going to be the king and queen of the world?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The royal pain of divorce came swiftly enough, in 1998, but
while it lasted their relationship seemed to be based not so much
on hubris as happiness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unaccustomed as he was to that, Harlin felt unfettered in a way
he never had, as if unconstrained by the normal rules.
</P>
<P>
   When he was hired in 1997 to make ``Deep Blue Sea,'' he was sent
to sprinkle himself in the same holy waters used by Hollywood's
last self-proclaimed king of the world: the 17 million-gallon tank
near Rosarito, Mexico, that was constructed for the making of
``Titanic'' by the director James Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that sending the only director in the history of
the film industry ever to lose $100 million on a water picture into
the tank used by the only director in history ever to make him look
like a piker doing it _ Cameron is believed to have spent closer to
$200 million _ would have given Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the Warner
Brothers production chief, pause. It did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to protect ourselves, and be certain that Renny
would be fiscally responsible, so I think we were careful about
getting into business with him,'' says di Bonaventura.
</P>
<P>
   The studio counted on Harlin's determination to prove he wasn't
a wild-eyed profligate. And it kept him on a very short leash, with
a budget of less than $80 million. ``We went through a long period
of analyzing every element in the movie with him,'' says di
Bonaventura. ``So in terms of what we were going to try to do and
how we were going to do it, we were 100 percent confident that he
would follow what essentially we had worked out as a partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio brought in veteran writer and producer Akiva
Goldsman, possibly as its proxy in this ``partnership'' with
Harlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard tales galore,'' Goldsman says of the director. ``I
just heard that Renny drove forward with an intensity that was all
about getting the movie made without necessarily embracing the
emotions of the people making the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsman pauses, probably exhausted. ``In our business, personal
growth is not a prerequisite,'' he adds, ``and it makes you really
admire those who do it. There's a force of imagination in remaking
one's life that dwarfs the imagination required to make a movie. I
had a sense that this was a man who decided he had to change. And
not just superficially.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Harlin is now able to view his life as
narrative, with its inevitable ups and downs. ``I was shy and
insecure when I first came from Finland,'' he says, ``and I tried
to cover that by being tough and strong. After `Cliffhanger,' I
thought I had really figured it out, that I had found the key.
Really, it was the Hollywood dream. It was just as one could have
imagined. Then I was humbled, and now I have sort of come full
circle, being who I am but able to listen to people more, and
relate to people in a better way. It's the most humbling thing to
totally fail.''
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's third reel, Harlin will find out if he is
heroically redeemed by success, or if he is the devil in ``Deep
Blue Sea.'' Either way, his passion for action impressed one of the
film's young stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his bad days and his good days, it's all about getting
the good stuff,'' says Thomas Jane, the virtual unknown Harlin cast
in the picture's biggest role, as the shark expert Carter Blake,
``making it a little scarier, a little faster, a little more
dangerous than you've seen before. He eats, breathes and sleeps
getting the good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he sleeps, Harlin still dreams that the good stuff
might all be taken away some day. ``The worst feeling is when the
film is completely finished and you're just on your own,'' he says.
``It's a very empty feeling, like you're completely unnecessary.
It's incredible to have all these people come to work and look at
you, and they'll do what you tell them to do. Pulling it all
together, making something happen.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than that?''
</P>
<P>
   His voice gets very small, like a little boy's. ``The scariest
moments are when you are just with yourself,'' he says. ``Then you
don't know what to do.''
</P>

recently for Arts and Leisure about the television show, ``It's

HOMELESS GET SHOPPING CARTS AS CITY MOVES AGAINST VAGRANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John White is homeless, but he is also the proud
owner of his very own shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   White was one of five homeless people Tuesday to receive a cart,
along with a certification of ownership courtesy of the Homeless
Coalition and POOR magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But hours after White received his cart to tote around all his
wordly possessions, the San Francisco Shopping Cart Task Force
moved to make it tougher for homeless people to have carts.
</P>
<P>
   On an 8-3 vote, the task force sent to the Board of Supervisors
a proposal to require businesses to work to keep the carts on their
premises. It also would require businesses to attach signs to their
shopping carts identifying ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will be assigned to a Board of Supervisors'
committee before going before the full board for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by the task force, led by Supervisor Amos Brown,
and the shopping cart giveaway are the latest in a tension-filled
chess match between advocates for homeless people and the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, who has become the homeless advocates' symbol for
what they say are mean-spirited objectives for dealing with
homelessness, said that this proposal reflected only his interest
in eliminating clutter on San Francisco streets. The proposal was
not aimed at homeless people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidewalks were made to walk on, not for storage of carts and
people's belongings,'' Brown said. The proposal, he said, is aimed
at removing unattended and empty shopping carts, ``the same as we'd
remove anything left that poses safety hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mara Raider of the Homeless Coalition, also a member of the
task force, said proposals, such as Brown's latest, ``criminalize
homeless people.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the city has started a war on homelessness that
includes confiscating carts and possessions by the police and the
Department of Public Works, and rousting vagabonds from parks and
tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a full frontal attack on homeless people, their
property and their rights,'' Raider said, referring in part to
crackdowns on homeless people in public places and on panhandlers
who use median strips and freeway ramps to beg for money.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping cart giveaway by the Homeless Coalition and the
magazine is an effort to break down the legal obstacles that stand
in the way of homeless people owning shopping carts, said Judy
Appel of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   She promised that more free carts, which were donated to the
organization, would be given away.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown accused the homeless advocates of staging the
giveaway. ``They knew we were having a hearing tonight. So they
used props and strategies to dramatize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Raider proposed having the city establish a
program to give carts to homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Raider also asked that people whose carts and possessions are to
be confiscated be given 24-hour notice and that a grievance
procedure be put in place for people who believe a cart was
confiscated unlawfully.
</P>
<P>
   Those proposals were defeated 7-4.

INFIDELITY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Wash., N.C.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH HOOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the course of his 12-year marriage, Bob M., a 40-year-old
executive from Annapolis, Md., had racked up a considerable
extramarital track record. One night in bed, his wife, Bernadette,
39, asked him whether he had ever strayed, and Bob, sick of the
deception, confirmed her worst suspicions. Two months later, their
marriage held together with prayer and Scotch tape, Bob and
Bernadette, who, to protect their privacy, spoke on the condition
that their full names not be used, went to their first session with
Frederick DiBlasio, a therapist and professor of social work at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look your spouse in the eye,'' Bob said, describing the
session, ``and you itemize everything you did. `I fornicated with
this woman. I had oral sex with that woman.' And then you ask for
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie,'' Bernadette said. ``It was a
heart-piercing thing to hear. Infidelity takes away every ounce of
trust in a marriage. If I didn't have all the details addressed
early on, I would have thrown it back in his face. In order to
forgive, you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBlasio says he believes forgiveness can be asked for, and
received, in an instant. For people who have been on the receiving
end of infidelity, that may fly in the face of what they think they
know about the human heart. But it's just one, and probably the
most radical one, of many infidelity strategies and theories that
have begun making the therapeutic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable evidence exists that Americans are cheating more now
on their spouses than they ever did. A highly-regarded 1994
University of Chicago survey, Sex in America, conservatively put
the figure at 25 percent for men, 12 percent for women. But
whatever the actual incidence, most experts think it is unlikely
that infidelity is more popular today than it was in the 1950s and
1960s, when men often enjoyed the advantages of a sexual double
standard, or in the swinging '70s, when open marriage had its
vogue. But if psychologists and therapists have anything to say
about it, we are entering a Golden Age of thinking about
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that the nation has learned more than it ever
wanted to know about its president's extramarital sex life,
therapists are churning out popular books about affairs and how to
survive them. The past two months alone saw two new volumes, ``When
Your Lover Is a Liar'' by Susan Forward (HarperCollins, $24) and
``Women Who Stay With Men Who Stray'' by Debbie Then (Hyperion,
$23.95). At the same time, therapists' counterparts in academia are
receiving grants to study how and why married people cheat and what
can be done to repair the damage. Infidelity, of all things, has
come out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I started 20 years ago, you couldn't even find
infidelity mentioned in the classic family-therapy texts,'' said
Don-David Lusterman, a couples therapist in Baldwin, N.Y., and
author of ``Infidelity: A Survival Guide'' (New Harbinger
Publications, 1998, $12.95). Now, Neil Jacobson, a much-published
professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is
starting a pilot study, which he hopes to expand into
government-funded clinical trials. His goal: to find out who cheats
and why and what can be done in therapy to salvage their marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of eight studies of his own, Jacobson has found
that only half the married couples who go into marital therapy
derive any significant long-term benefit from it. Late last year,
at the annual convention of the Association for Advancement of
Behavior Therapy in Washington, he dared a packed hotel ballroom of
psychologists to put aside ``techniques for taking out the
garbage'' in order to address ``a primitive, dark underbelly'' of
couple relationships. ``We're going to make rapid progress,'' he
declared. ``Long live extramarital-affair research.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can agree, however, what direction that research
should take. Jacobson and most of his colleagues see themselves as
scrupulous scientists of the unrulier passions. But the new
interest in infidelity has opened the door for academic mavericks
who believe that morality and spirituality have a role, a
scientifically measurable role, in treating troubled couples.
DiBlasio travels the couples-therapy conference circuit challenging
the therapeutic wisdom that a betrayed spouse must traverse a long,
torturous path to forgive the betrayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee-jerk reaction is, you can't do it in a day,''
DiBlasio said. He counters the skeptics with a double faith: a
Christian belief in the power of forgiveness and a cognitive
therapist's confidence in the power of the directed mind to
overrule emotional impulse. ``For years, the research has shown
that expressing anger doesn't cure it,'' he said. ``What cures it
is finding a connection with faith, inner peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Bob and Bernadette share DiBlasio's
Christian belief _ in fact, credit it as the ultimate guarantor of
their marital salvation. But the therapist says that his approach
isn't only for Christians. He says that forgiveness as something
given and not earned is common to many of the world's religions.
</P>
<P>
   During their first session with DiBlasio, a couple will also
draw up a contract of behavior designed to prevent future
infidelities, and the offending partner may sign up a same-sex
``accountability'' partner, like an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor,
to help him or her live up to the terms. Not even DiBlasio believes
that one session cures all unhappiness, but, he argues, the initial
commitment to forgive takes much of the sting, and the longevity,
out of the recrimination that inevitably follows the discovery of
an affair. He is now putting these ideas to the secular test in an
ambitious study that compares outcomes in a large group of couples
receiving his forgiveness therapy with a group receiving more
standard couples counseling and a control group that gets no help
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson has heard enough about forgiveness for one lifetime.
``It makes me cringe,'' he said from his Seattle office. ``Why
should we assume that the person who needs forgiveness is the
perpetrator of the extramarital affair?'' he said. (Actually, most
therapists would make that assumption, but Jacobson is being
provocatively neutral.)
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of his ``acceptance based'' therapy model is the
idea, untested, that opportunity has more to do with affairs than
moral values. ``It's easy for a 300-pound man to say he's never had
an affair in 30 years of marriage, but how much has he been
tested?'' Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   As for forgiveness, Jacobson says he thinks it may indeed occur
after an infidelity but only according to its own logic and
timetable. The best thing the therapist can do, he argues, is to
provide a safe haven for the angry betrayed spouse and the guilty
betraying spouse to work through their emotions. ``For a
relationship to survive an affair,'' he said, ``a perpetrator has
to accept the possibility that he may never be forgiven.''

STATISTICS SHOW HOW NEW DEAL TACTICS PROLONG DEPRESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No economist is suggesting it will take East Asia 10 years to
recover from the Crash of '97. Our own Depression, however, lasted
for a full decade, and economists have never agreed why.
</P>
<P>
   A new view is offered by economists Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian
for the Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
(available at www.mpls.frb.org).
</P>
<P>
   They ask: Given how deep the U.S. economy fell by 1933, how fast
should it have bounced back? Their model, called neoclassical
growth theory, says the Depression should have been over by 1936.
Actually, it lasted until about 1940, when America began arming for
war.
</P>
<P>
   What held things back? It wasn't the decline in foreign trade,
because trade didn't amount to that much. It wasn't bank failures,
which had stopped by then. Nor was it credit; bank loan rates had
fallen below 3 percent by 1936 and stayed low for the rest of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   One culprit: Marginal tax rates went up in the 1930s, from 3.5
percent to 8.3 percent on labor income, and from 29.5 percent to
42.9 percent on capital. But these changes explain only about
one-fifth of the weak recovery, Cole and Ohanian say.
</P>
<P>
   Digging through statistics, they find a more likely candidate: a
rise in factory wages. To an economist, wages should have fallen.
Profits were down, investment was way down and a reserve army of
the unemployed stood to take any job. In South Korea, average
manufacturing wages have fallen 20 percent in the past year and a
half. In the United States from 1929 to 1939, real factory wages
went up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Explain that, Cole and Ohanian write, and you might explain why
the Depression lasted 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Edward Prescott of the University of Chicago reviews
their paper and comments, ``There must have been a fundamental
change in labor market institutions and industrial policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers are surely fidgeting. Can these economists be ignorant
of what that was? No, but they are economists, bound by statistics.
</P>
<P>
   History, which tells more colorful tales, records that America
fought the Depression with policies to keep prices and wages up.
President Hoover did it by jawboning; President Roosevelt did it by
regulation and law.
</P>
<P>
   From 1934 to 1935, under the banner of the Blue Eagle, the
federal government allowed industries to set minimum prices. In New
Jersey, a tailor was arrested for pressing a suit for 35 cents, a
nickel under the tailors' code. On the farm, Agriculture Secretary
Henry Wallace was ordering the slaughter of little pigs, to raise
the price of pork. In the factories, unions were being given the
power to organize by majority vote, strengthening their power to
raise wages.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Eagle was declared unconstitutional. However, its labor
provisions were re-enacted in the National Labor Relations Act.
Millions of Americans joined unions. They staged the famous
sit-down strikes and organized General Motors, U.S. Steel and
thousands of other employers.
</P>
<P>
   These were real gains for union workers, and are celebrated
still. But they must have been jarring for owners, and not only in
terms of new projects that didn't pencil out. Businessmen
complained of a ``lack of confidence.'' What they meant, says
Edmonds historian Robert Higgs, author of ``Crisis and Leviathan,''
is that the rules of business were shifting against them, and
owners and managers feared the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This story, that the New Deal prolonged the Depression, is the
opposite of the story I learned in school, which was that it saved
the nation. A lot of Americans believe that. But the economists
writing for the Minneapolis Fed don't, nor do most of those working
for the international development agencies or, I'd bet, those
advising our Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   That's clear from their advice to Asia. Except for financial
disclosure, their recommendations to Asia are nothing like the New
Deal. They told Korea to weaken the protection for workers so that
companies could lay them off. They told China, Korea and Indonesia
to adopt bankruptcy laws that allow companies to fail. Everywhere
they have recommended competitive markets and the separation of
commerce from politics.
</P>
<P>
   They did grant Asia's central banks large loans. But for Asia's
commercial banks and industry, our advice has been that if it can't
survive on its own, let it die. If it's inflated, mark it down. Let
prices and wages sink to their natural levels, where they can be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a particularly compassionate policy, and may have
little value in winning elections. But then again, it might
actually work.

 UNDATED: be forgiven.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Jacobson is intrigued about the prospects of an infidelity
therapy developed by three Southern psychologists who use the idea
of forgiveness in an entirely secular, pragmatic way. Drs. Don
Baucom and Kristina Coop Gordon from the University of North
Carolina and Dr. Doug Snyder from Texas A&AMP;M call the therapy
forgiveness-based marital intervention. ``We don't talk about
forgiveness overtly until the very end of therapy,'' Dr. Gordon
said. ``At the beginning, the couple are throwing things at each
other, and we figure forgiveness is the last thing they want to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   From his office in Chapel Hill, Baucom explained that his group
was attempting to take forgiveness ``out of the mystical realm and
into the psychological as we understand it.'' His team has studied
eight couples in the aftermath of an affair. They believe that if
they can precisely chart the emotional roller coaster that follows,
they can come up with a more effective therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Baucom said the cheated-upon spouse first goes through an
``out-of-control'' stage, akin to the posttraumatic stress that
victims of war and violent crime are thought to experience.
Emotional numbing and, conversely, ``hyperarousal'' and anxiety are
often observed. ``What turns a garden-variety negative event into a
trauma,'' he said, ``is when people have a basic assumption about
life and that's violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Baucom said, the betrayed spouse passes into a
second, ``giving meaning'' stage. He added: ``The spouse needs to
understand, `How could you do this to me, to us, to the kids?'
You're looking for explanations but you may discover that you're
married to someone you don't want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Baucom calls the final stage ``moving on,'' with or without the
errant spouse. He labels the whole process ``forgiveness,'' whether
or not any of the world's great religions would recognize it as
such.
</P>
<P>
   In the burgeoning field of infidelity research, everyone has his
or her own program to peddle. But underneath the debate lies a
consensus that has emerged in only the last decade or so _
infidelity matters. A generation ago, longtime therapists say, the
classic response to infidelity in marriage therapy was to ignore it
whenever possible. The affair itself was seen as only a symptom of
underlying problems in the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   This line came under sustained attack in the 1980s with a
best-selling book, ``Private Lies: Infidelity and the Betrayal of
Intimacy'' (Norton) by Dr. Frank Pittman, a psychiatrist who argues
that men's affairs are more often driven by their own psychological
failings than by any marital shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men especially are afraid of intimacy,'' Pittman said from his
home in Atlanta, ``and infidelity is primarily an escape from
intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman's pithy moralizing has made him both an admired and
controversial figure in the infidelity field. But in his central
mission of keeping the straying male on the therapeutic hot seat,
he has been joined by a feminist generation of women infidelity
experts. Dr. Janis Abrahms Spring, author of ``After the Affair,''
(HarperCollins, 1997), and Peggy Vaughan, author of ``The Monogamy
Myth'' (Newmarket Press, 1998), believe that therapists, in their
haste to minimize the disruption of an affair, often end up
retraumatizing the betrayed partner _ in effect, blaming the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, Dr. Shirley Glass, a Baltimore therapist,
has been the godmother of infidelity research, generating the data
that clinicians like Drs. Spring and Pittman have used to paint a
portrait of mostly masculine deception. (The latest research
suggests that the gender gap is narrowing but that men are still
more likely to be the cheating partner in a marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on her research, much of it generated by her clinical
practice, Dr. Glass says that men's affairs in particular are often
the cause of troubled marriages and not the effect. According to
her data, 56 percent of men who entered into affairs said they had
``happy'' or ``very happy'' marriages compared with 30 percent of
women. ``For men, the strongest predictor for having an affair is
their attitudes and values about monogamy,'' she said. ``For women,
it's marital unhappiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glass and her clinical partner, Dr. Tom Wright, an associate
professor of psychology at Catholic University, feel so strongly
about the betrayed partner's need to regain a sense of trust in the
face of their partner's bad behavior that they have sometimes
recommended creating a family fund that the betrayed spouse can use
to hire a private detective. ``How can you know your spouse is
telling the truth after they've looked you in the face and lied?''
Dr. Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into therapy with Drs. Glass and Wright, Dina, a
mother and housewife, who spoke on the condition that her full name
not be used, and her husband are a success story, by their own and
their therapists' estimation. The affair has been exhaustively
worked through, as a betrayal that demands special atonement and as
part of a larger marital tapestry of evasions and unexpressed
resentments. ``I'm not glad it happened,'' Dina said of her
husband's affair, ``but a part of me says that without it, we
wouldn't be where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a price Dina continues to pay for this more
honest relationship. ``He doesn't leave the office without calling
me,'' she said. ``There will never be a time when my husband is an
hour late and the affair won't be the first thing I think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Bernadette have a similar story. ``Most men can go out
and play basketball, have two beers, and that's fine,'' Bob said.
``It's not with us. There will always be that doubt no matter how
wonderful we say things are.''

 &HT;    What Laura Bush wants
 &HT;    EDITORS: WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's a speech Laura Bush has been giving
around Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Texas first lady, a former schoolteacher and
children's librarian, begins by recounting letters from a class of
fourth-graders about what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   `Nine-year-old Josh learned that you don't give a goldfish milk.
</P>
<P>
   `Jacob learned that when you have four girlfriends, you get 28
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   `Megan learned that when you get a new baby in the house, you
get no attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And `Craig learned that there are usually disadvantages in
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something to Craig's theory.
</P>
<P>
   When you're first lady of Texas, people pay attention to
projects you care about; money gets channeled to libraries, to
literacy programs and to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go, whether it's a poor El Paso neighborhood or the
country club, the waters part when you appear. People pay attention
to what you have to say; someone even paints your name on a
Harley-Davidson, emblazoning it alongside the state of Texas and of
course, bluebonnets.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're the wife of a presidential candidate, the media
throng gets thicker; the questions get meaner. On a brisk spring
day, the wind is blowing through the shade trees on the lawn at the
Governor's Mansion and you are sitting next to your husband,
beaming in a mint-green suit.
</P>
<P>
   From the horseshoe-shaped swarm of reporters and photographers
that surrounds the two of you, someone yells out: `Are there
skeletons in your closet?'' Friends from around the country
occasionally call to report rumors about your husband that they've
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, but straightforward and no-nonsense, like your favorite
grade-school teacher, dressed and polished like the future U.S.
first lady she may yet be, Laura Bush has acknowledged there are
disadvantages as well as advantages to being married to a probable
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   `I know what the ugly side of politics is,'' she says. `The '92
race (then-President George Bush's unsuccessful re-election bid)
was miserable. It's very difficult to have bad things said about
the people you love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woman Who Dared to be Publicly Hesitant is roundly described
by friends and family as someone with inner strength, someone who
takes things in stride.
</P>
<P>
   `Rock of Gibraltar,'' says her father-in-law .
</P>
<P>
   Unflappable, says mother-in-law Barbara Bush, `in contrast to
our family, which is anything but calm.''
</P>
<P>
   In troubling times, this Texas first lady has been known to cope
by putting things in order, particularly the books she so loves. In
the coming months, as the national media circus pokes and prods her
family onto center stage, one imagines her firm presence -- rooms
full of exceedingly tidy bookshelves in her wake. Fear of lack of
freedom
</P>
<P>
   She'd been warned the creek was high.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Bush had plans to visit El Paso writers Lee and Bobby
Byrd at Paisano Ranch in southwest Travis County, where Lee Byrd
was on fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   And when she came face to face with the swirling waters of a
swollen Barton Creek, she `may have hesitated for about three
seconds,'' says friend Adair Margo, who was with her.
</P>
<P>
   `Then it was like, plop. All the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Your Texas first lady had plunged into the creek, a big grin on
her face. Just behind her, a panicked Department of Public Safety
officer in charge of protecting her was struggling to keep up and
to keep his gun dry.
</P>
<P>
   Unprogrammed, unscheduled moments are getting to be more and
more of a rarity in Laura Bush's already busy life.
</P>
<P>
   When she talks about why she wasn't the first to dive into her
husband's all-but-officially-announced presidential bid, losing
`the freedom of being able to move around without starting up a
motorcade'' is at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Though her anonymity is waning, she can still go for lunch at
Las Manitas without attracting a lot of attention. She can, on a
moment's notice, hop in a car with a long-time friend to see what
people are doing to their homes in Travis Heights or other Austin
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, there she was in the checkout line at Wal-Mart
(yes, Wal-Mart), with her twin daughters. The woman she was
chatting with, so sure she'd met this nice lady somewhere before,
finally had to say, no, sorry, her name just did not ring a bell.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, she says, are folks starting to recognize her
when she flies around the state on Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the company she keeps is rarefied.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in-laws -- the former president and one of the
nation's most beloved first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The woman behind the popular Texas Book Festival not only has
helped to raise nearly $600,000 for Texas libraries, she's been
able to meet dozens of famous authors, a bibliophile's dream. Lyle
Lovett, a favorite musician, entertained at a Christmas party at
the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   And during a spring break getaway to New York City with her
daughters, she took in the St. Patrick's Day parade with the
archbishop of New York , and met Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in a downtown El Paso neighborhood, Laura Bush
sweeps into the crowded lobby followed by a trail of television
cameras. An elderly woman, watching, says of her, `Muy bien. She
thinks and cares about the poor.'' Someone else says, `I want to
see if she's as beautiful as she is on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, balloons and banners decorate a parking lot adjoining
the clinic where Laura Bush and Texas Commissioner of Health
William cq''Reyn'' Archer talk about the importance of childhood
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest advantage of being Texas' first lady, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   `I've had the opportunity to champion causes that I'm interested
in, I've had an opportunity to make an impact in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Laura Bush has been asking people to support programs
that focus on nurturing kids from birth to age 3. ``We want to
level the playing field so that every child arrives (at school)
ready to learn,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At the country club luncheon that follows her clinic visit,
women whose husbands are affiliated with factories on either side
of the border have gathered at dozens of tables to hear her speak.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in a salmon-colored suit nods approvingly at the notion
of Laura Bush as the nation's first lady .
</P>
<P>
   `Hillary's problem,'' she snips, `was getting involved in sticky
issues like abortion and a national health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's focus on literacy and children may be a safe bet
politically, but her interest comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna Ramirez, the wife of El Paso's Democratic Mayor Carlos
Ramirez, became a fan after seeing the former teacher linger in
classrooms at a school she was visiting, long after the TV cameras
had left.
</P>
<P>
   `She was there for two hours. The media was gone. Her schedule
was tight, but she still took the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush is a book club member, an avid reader who always
has a book or two at her bedside -- last month she finished books
by two University of Texas professors: Jim Magnuson's `Windfall''
and Laura Furman's `Tuxedo Park.'' As a girl, she loved `Little
Women'' and `Little House on the Prairie,'' with its brown-haired
heroine named Laura. A fix-up with George W.
</P>
<P>
   An only child, she started school in Midland with all the
advantages she wishes for other children.
</P>
<P>
   Father Harold Welch, who died in 1995, was a homebuilder. Her
mother Jenna, who still lives in Midland, kept the books.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' future first lady, now 52, crossed paths for years with
the man she'd eventually marry. They attended different elementary
schools in Midland, but went to the same junior high for a year. In
the '60s, when she was a teacher and he was flying fighter jets for
the Texas Air National Guard, they lived in the same apartment
complex in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1977, when she was working as the librarian
at Dawson Elementary School in Austin, that friends Jan and Joey
O'Neill got the two of them together at a barbecue in Midland when
Laura was home visiting her parents.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been trying to do it for some time, recalls Jan O'Neill.
Laura, who'd had plenty of boyfriends, `wasn't particularly anxious
to be fixed up,'' says O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   `I thought he was someone who was interested in politics and
that he would be someone I wouldn't be interested in because I was
so uninterested in politics at that time,'' Laura Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love anyway.
</P>
<P>
   `I think I was struck by her beauty and her charm,'' Gov. George
W. Bush says. `She was an intriguing personality to me. . . . We
had a whirlwind courtship and it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their romance came on the heels of that period which has invited
so much speculation about the governor's past. It's as if his life
is split neatly in two sections, with the pre-Laura Bush era
comprising the years when, as Bush has said, he was `young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she the good woman who tamed him, as so many have suggested?
</P>
<P>
   `Barbara and I were talking about that yesterday,'' says the
senior George Bush. `We don't remember George as this kind of wild
thing. I don't understand the needless speculation that he needed
somebody to quiet him down.
</P>
<P>
   `On the other hand,'' he concedes, `Laura has been a very
stabilizing influence on our whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush says: `He may have been a playboy and had a lot of
fun. . . . She laughed at his jokes. He has enormous admiration for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Gov. Bush: `I think marriage and children settle people
down, particularly if you take your vows seriously. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   They were both 31. They married three months after they met.
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush immediately met two challenges: campaigning
across the Panhandle with her husband, who was making his first run
for office (he lost a race for Congress); and fitting into the
extended Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Regan Gammon recalls talking with Laura Bush
about the turn her life had taken.
</P>
<P>
   `We discussed the fact that his father was thinking about
running for president and what that might mean,'' she says. `How
bizarre that was. . . . It seemed a little unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush never seemed intimidated by her new extended family,
Gammon says.
</P>
<P>
   But the family she was marrying into was a huge, competitive
clan (she had no siblings and only two first cousins). The elder
George Bush's mother, in particular, was perhaps `the most athletic
human being living,'' Barbara Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   One day, inevitably, the matriarch asked the future Laura Bush,
`'What do you do?''' To which she replied, `I read.''
</P>
<P>
   `Mrs. Bush couldn't believe her ears,'' Barbara Bush recalls.
Trouble with the twins
</P>
<P>
   They were a family first, before they became a public entity,
before everyone from The New York Times to Vogue wanted to tell
their story.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge he and Laura have faced, George W. Bush
says, was not the '94 governor's race nobody thought he would win.
It was the birth of their children, after Laura was ordered to bed
with toxemia late in her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Midland and she was hospitalized in Dallas when he got
the call from her doctor: `Your children will be born tomorrow;
either that or your wife's kidneys will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves our daughters more than anything,'' he says, `would
lay her life down for them. And nearly did at birth. . . . She was
absolutely determined to do whatever she could to make sure those
little girls came into the world healthy and safe. And she did.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the story later.
</P>
<P>
   `That was Laura at her best, kind of hanging on with the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   She has warm memories of their early years as a family in
Midland, of wheeling the twin baby girls around in a stroller on
hot summer afternoons as the cicadas trilled loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Jenna, 17, are juniors at Austin High School now,
and Laura Bush talks a little wistfully about the days when she
could throw her arms around them so easily. Now they're busy
teen-agers with their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   `It is very natural for them at this age to want to spread their
wings, and George and I are certainly aware of that,'' she says.
`We are aware of how much less relevant we are in our children's
lives each day as they grow up and want to be with their own
friends and are starting to think about where they want to go to
college and where they want to be when they move away.''-
</P>
<P>
   A normal life in the public eye
</P>
<P>
   She says her daughters are not overly concerned with their
father's political plans.
</P>
<P>
   `Just like every teen-ager, they are mainly concerned about what
they're going to be doing this weekend. At the same time they are
very proud of their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their lives, when their grandfather was
vice-president, then president, and when their father first became
governor in 1994, the Bushes have `tried to make a normal life for
our daughters,'' Laura Bush says. They keep evening events to a
minimum, and despite their schedules, one or the other tries to be
home by 4 p.m. each day, she says. They all have dinner together
most nights.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a presidential campaign, Laura Bush says she
plans to follow the lead of her in-laws, who always reserved
Sundays for family.
</P>
<P>
   Both the former president and Barbara Bush say they're feeling a
protective surge as Texas' first family moves into the national
political arena. But neither has offered any guidance on how to
survive a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I awaken every morning with advice,'' Barbara Bush
jokes, `but I don't give it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about how his candidacy might affect their daughters
(they would be in college if Bush took office) worry George W. and
Laura Bush. They say they appreciate the hands-off policy of the
Texas press and are encouraged by the way the national media have
treated Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things the girls can't be shielded from. At
the last Texas Book Festival, hecklers shouted down former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   `Jenna walked out of (there) and burst into tears,'' Laura Bush
says. `It's hard for a teen-ager when they yell mean things at your
grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, too, to hear things said about your husband.
</P>
<P>
   `I feel like that's what I dread the most, the criticism, but
also the totally unfounded rumors which we've heard,'' Laura Bush
says.
</P>
<P>
   `Friends will call us from somewhere, and tell us something
they've heard somewhere. There's no way to refute it because
they're so totally made up.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, not known for keeping his cool when his father
was the target of criticism during his last presidential race, says
he is also concerned about what his wife may have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   `It's a lot easier to be the candidate where people say ugly
things about you than the person who loves the person about which
ugly things are said. I know first-hand,'' he says, pausing. `I
know first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Laura Bush sat beside her husband at a
press conference and said she was `reluctant, absolutely,'' to get
involved in a presidential race. about the prospect of becoming
engaged in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Now she says she is simply a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone today knows that any person who was considering this
job would have certain reservations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TRANS. And that's been Laura Bush's role throughout their
marriage, to be her husband's sounding board on issues big and
small. Their contrasting personalities -- his high-energy
temperament and her laid-back style -- have provided `a good check
and balance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   She's always been `a very positive influence on me . . . in
terms of forcing me to ask the right questions,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   `On the occasions where I drank too much she reminded me I was
drinking too much. And I listened.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, when everyone else was urging him to run for
governor, Laura Bush was one of the last people to get behind the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded him he was `living a dream'' as an owner of the
Texas Rangers, he says. Both of them had enjoyed their time
together watching games, the Florida Gulf Coast vacations that
centered on spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura's not the first to say, Oh boy, let's go do that, sort
of shovin' me into the limelight,'' the governor says.
</P>
<P>
   `She's the opposite of that. She says, Wait a minute, buddy, are
you sure? Are you sure you're going to ask our family to make a
life change? Are you sure that this is something you really want to
do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the decision about a presidential campaign has all but
been made, the candidate is putting a positive spin on how a heated
political campaign might affect their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   `We grew close during the baseball games because of the amount
of time we spent with each other,'' Bush says. `We could think
about things and talk. We grew very close during the (1994)
campaign because it was like we were in combat to a certain extent,
fellow warriors.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't really fear failure, and one of the reasons I don't
fear failure is because I know that I've got a wife who loves me.
And she doesn't fear failure either.'' Her politic decision
</P>
<P>
   When somebody asks me about life with George W. Bush I have to
resist using that old clich: There is never a dull moment.
</P>
<P>
   I have to resist being sentimental and saying that when I was in
class in elementary school I never dreamed that there was a boy
named George Bush who was also sitting in class across town at our
rival school, and that one day I would grow up to marry him . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have to resist saying that according to my children, life with
their dad is like being a private under the direct command of a
general. And that according to George, war is hell.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when someone asks me about George W. Bush I say
marrying him apparently was the smartest political move I ever
made. Not bad for somebody who knows nothing about politics.'' --
Laura Bush, introducing her husband at the Texas Women's Hall of
Fame gala.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' first lady never planned to give speeches.
</P>
<P>
   `I always think of myself as basically reserved and shy,'' she
says. `I wouldn't have thought of this before I started giving
speeches, but reading over the top of a book like I did millions of
time as a children's librarian is great practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who put off meeting her future husband because of his
political aspirations has said the idea of occupying the White
House is `sort of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   `I could just as soon, you know, hang around and work in the
yard,'' she told The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages. Disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush `is in a life that I don't think she ever
envisioned,'' George W. Bush says. `But she has seized the
opportunity and made a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, Barbara Bush says, `a sort of catalyst in our family.
She brings out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the elder George Bush: `When she greets Barbara and me,
when we come over to the house, there she is with her arms open for
a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush can't throw her arms around all the children of
Texas, but that's her goal, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   `I would most like to be known as an advocate for children,''
she says. `I would like to help parents be very informed so they
can make great decisions for their young children. I think being a
parent is the most important job any of us will ever have and our
relationships with our families and our children are our most
important relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   And her work to empower other families would be expanded if her
own were to occupy the White House. Barbara Bush can see her there,
reveling in the history and `majesty'' of her former home at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, the self-assured successor to lightning rod
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   `She's a good little nester,'' her mother-in-law says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever a campaign brings, family ties will bind them, the
Bushes say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that like any other family George and I have had
our share of fun and frustration in our 22 years of marriage.
Overall, though, I think we are both pleased with our success.
We've managed to raise two smart daughters and a half-dozen of
their animals. I consider myself doubly blessed to be a part of his
family and a partner of his in life. Ladies and gentlemen, my
husband, Governor Bush.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's a speech Laura Bush has been giving
around Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Texas first lady, a former schoolteacher and
children's librarian, begins by recounting letters from a class of
fourth-graders about what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
   `Nine-year-old Josh learned that you don't give a goldfish milk.
</P>
<P>
   `Jacob learned that when you have four girlfriends, you get 28
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   `Megan learned that when you get a new baby in the house, you
get no attention.''
</P>
<P>
   And `Craig learned that there are usually disadvantages in
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something to Craig's theory.
</P>
<P>
   When you're first lady of Texas, people pay attention to
projects you care about; money gets channeled to libraries, to
literacy programs and to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go, whether it's a poor El Paso neighborhood or the
country club, the waters part when you appear. People pay attention
to what you have to say; someone even paints your name on a
Harley-Davidson, emblazoning it alongside the state of Texas and of
course, bluebonnets.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're the wife of a presidential candidate, the media
throng gets thicker; the questions get meaner. On a brisk spring
day, the wind is blowing through the shade trees on the lawn at the
Governor's Mansion and you are sitting next to your husband,
beaming in a mint-green suit.
</P>
<P>
   From the horseshoe-shaped swarm of reporters and photographers
that surrounds the two of you, someone yells out: `Are there
skeletons in your closet?'' Friends from around the country
occasionally call to report rumors about your husband that they've
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, but straightforward and no-nonsense, like your favorite
grade-school teacher, dressed and polished like the future U.S.
first lady she may yet be, Laura Bush has acknowledged there are
disadvantages as well as advantages to being married to a probable
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   `I know what the ugly side of politics is,'' she says. `The '92
race (then-President George Bush's unsuccessful re-election bid)
was miserable. It's very difficult to have bad things said about
the people you love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woman Who Dared to be Publicly Hesitant is roundly described
by friends and family as someone with inner strength, someone who
takes things in stride.
</P>
<P>
   `Rock of Gibraltar,'' says her father-in-law .
</P>
<P>
   Unflappable, says mother-in-law Barbara Bush, `in contrast to
our family, which is anything but calm.''
</P>
<P>
   In troubling times, this Texas first lady has been known to cope
by putting things in order, particularly the books she so loves. In
the coming months, as the national media circus pokes and prods her
family onto center stage, one imagines her firm presence -- rooms
full of exceedingly tidy bookshelves in her wake. Fear of lack of
freedom
</P>
<P>
   She'd been warned the creek was high.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Bush had plans to visit El Paso writers Lee and Bobby
Byrd at Paisano Ranch in southwest Travis County, where Lee Byrd
was on fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   And when she came face to face with the swirling waters of a
swollen Barton Creek, she `may have hesitated for about three
seconds,'' says friend Adair Margo, who was with her.
</P>
<P>
   `Then it was like, plop. All the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Your Texas first lady had plunged into the creek, a big grin on
her face. Just behind her, a panicked Department of Public Safety
officer in charge of protecting her was struggling to keep up and
to keep his gun dry.
</P>
<P>
   Unprogrammed, unscheduled moments are getting to be more and
more of a rarity in Laura Bush's already busy life.
</P>
<P>
   When she talks about why she wasn't the first to dive into her
husband's all-but-officially-announced presidential bid, losing
`the freedom of being able to move around without starting up a
motorcade'' is at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Though her anonymity is waning, she can still go for lunch at
Las Manitas without attracting a lot of attention. She can, on a
moment's notice, hop in a car with a long-time friend to see what
people are doing to their homes in Travis Heights or other Austin
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, there she was in the checkout line at Wal-Mart
(yes, Wal-Mart), with her twin daughters. The woman she was
chatting with, so sure she'd met this nice lady somewhere before,
finally had to say, no, sorry, her name just did not ring a bell.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, she says, are folks starting to recognize her
when she flies around the state on Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the company she keeps is rarefied.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in-laws -- the former president and one of the
nation's most beloved first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The woman behind the popular Texas Book Festival not only has
helped to raise nearly $600,000 for Texas libraries, she's been
able to meet dozens of famous authors, a bibliophile's dream. Lyle
Lovett, a favorite musician, entertained at a Christmas party at
the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   And during a spring break getaway to New York City with her
daughters, she took in the St. Patrick's Day parade with the
archbishop of New York , and met Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in a downtown El Paso neighborhood, Laura Bush
sweeps into the crowded lobby followed by a trail of television
cameras. An elderly woman, watching, says of her, `Muy bien. She
thinks and cares about the poor.'' Someone else says, `I want to
see if she's as beautiful as she is on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, balloons and banners decorate a parking lot adjoining
the clinic where Laura Bush and Texas Commissioner of Health
William cq''Reyn'' Archer talk about the importance of childhood
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest advantage of being Texas' first lady, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   `I've had the opportunity to champion causes that I'm interested
in, I've had an opportunity to make an impact in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Laura Bush has been asking people to support programs
that focus on nurturing kids from birth to age 3. ``We want to
level the playing field so that every child arrives (at school)
ready to learn,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At the country club luncheon that follows her clinic visit,
women whose husbands are affiliated with factories on either side
of the border have gathered at dozens of tables to hear her speak.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in a salmon-colored suit nods approvingly at the notion
of Laura Bush as the nation's first lady .
</P>
<P>
   `Hillary's problem,'' she snips, `was getting involved in sticky
issues like abortion and a national health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's focus on literacy and children may be a safe bet
politically, but her interest comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna Ramirez, the wife of El Paso's Democratic Mayor Carlos
Ramirez, became a fan after seeing the former teacher linger in
classrooms at a school she was visiting, long after the TV cameras
had left.
</P>
<P>
   `She was there for two hours. The media was gone. Her schedule
was tight, but she still took the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush is a book club member, an avid reader who always
has a book or two at her bedside -- last month she finished books
by two University of Texas professors: Jim Magnuson's `Windfall''
and Laura Furman's `Tuxedo Park.'' As a girl, she loved `Little
Women'' and `Little House on the Prairie,'' with its brown-haired
heroine named Laura. A fix-up with George W.
</P>
<P>
   An only child, she started school in Midland with all the
advantages she wishes for other children.
</P>
<P>
   Father Harold Welch, who died in 1995, was a homebuilder. Her
mother Jenna, who still lives in Midland, kept the books.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' future first lady, now 52, crossed paths for years with
the man she'd eventually marry. They attended different elementary
schools in Midland, but went to the same junior high for a year. In
the '60s, when she was a teacher and he was flying fighter jets for
the Texas Air National Guard, they lived in the same apartment
complex in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1977, when she was working as the librarian
at Dawson Elementary School in Austin, that friends Jan and Joey
O'Neill got the two of them together at a barbecue in Midland when
Laura was home visiting her parents.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been trying to do it for some time, recalls Jan O'Neill.
Laura, who'd had plenty of boyfriends, `wasn't particularly anxious
to be fixed up,'' says O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   `I thought he was someone who was interested in politics and
that he would be someone I wouldn't be interested in because I was
so uninterested in politics at that time,'' Laura Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love anyway.
</P>
<P>
   `I think I was struck by her beauty and her charm,'' Gov. George
W. Bush says. `She was an intriguing personality to me. . . . We
had a whirlwind courtship and it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Their romance came on the heels of that period which has invited
so much speculation about the governor's past. It's as if his life
is split neatly in two sections, with the pre-Laura Bush era
comprising the years when, as Bush has said, he was `young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she the good woman who tamed him, as so many have suggested?
</P>
<P>
   `Barbara and I were talking about that yesterday,'' says the
senior George Bush. `We don't remember George as this kind of wild
thing. I don't understand the needless speculation that he needed
somebody to quiet him down.
</P>
<P>
   `On the other hand,'' he concedes, `Laura has been a very
stabilizing influence on our whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush says: `He may have been a playboy and had a lot of
fun. . . . She laughed at his jokes. He has enormous admiration for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Gov. Bush: `I think marriage and children settle people
down, particularly if you take your vows seriously. I did.''
</P>
<P>
   They were both 31. They married three months after they met.
</P>
<P>
   And Laura Bush immediately met two challenges: campaigning
across the Panhandle with her husband, who was making his first run
for office (he lost a race for Congress); and fitting into the
extended Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Regan Gammon recalls talking with Laura Bush
about the turn her life had taken.
</P>
<P>
   `We discussed the fact that his father was thinking about
running for president and what that might mean,'' she says. `How
bizarre that was. . . . It seemed a little unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush never seemed intimidated by her new extended family,
Gammon says.
</P>
<P>
   But the family she was marrying into was a huge, competitive
clan (she had no siblings and only two first cousins). The elder
George Bush's mother, in particular, was perhaps `the most athletic
human being living,'' Barbara Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   One day, inevitably, the matriarch asked the future Laura Bush,
`'What do you do?''' To which she replied, `I read.''
</P>
<P>
   `Mrs. Bush couldn't believe her ears,'' Barbara Bush recalls.
Trouble with the twins
</P>
<P>
   They were a family first, before they became a public entity,
before everyone from The New York Times to Vogue wanted to tell
their story.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge he and Laura have faced, George W. Bush
says, was not the '94 governor's race nobody thought he would win.
It was the birth of their children, after Laura was ordered to bed
with toxemia late in her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Midland and she was hospitalized in Dallas when he got
the call from her doctor: `Your children will be born tomorrow;
either that or your wife's kidneys will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   He got on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves our daughters more than anything,'' he says, `would
lay her life down for them. And nearly did at birth. . . . She was
absolutely determined to do whatever she could to make sure those
little girls came into the world healthy and safe. And she did.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the story later.
</P>
<P>
   `That was Laura at her best, kind of hanging on with the
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   She has warm memories of their early years as a family in
Midland, of wheeling the twin baby girls around in a stroller on
hot summer afternoons as the cicadas trilled loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Jenna, 17, are juniors at Austin High School now,
and Laura Bush talks a little wistfully about the days when she
could throw her arms around them so easily. Now they're busy
teen-agers with their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   `It is very natural for them at this age to want to spread their
wings, and George and I are certainly aware of that,'' she says.
`We are aware of how much less relevant we are in our children's
lives each day as they grow up and want to be with their own
friends and are starting to think about where they want to go to
college and where they want to be when they move away.''-
</P>
<P>
   A normal life in the public eye
</P>
<P>
   She says her daughters are not overly concerned with their
father's political plans.
</P>
<P>
   `Just like every teen-ager, they are mainly concerned about what
they're going to be doing this weekend. At the same time they are
very proud of their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their lives, when their grandfather was
vice-president, then president, and when their father first became
governor in 1994, the Bushes have `tried to make a normal life for
our daughters,'' Laura Bush says. They keep evening events to a
minimum, and despite their schedules, one or the other tries to be
home by 4 p.m. each day, she says. They all have dinner together
most nights.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a presidential campaign, Laura Bush says she
plans to follow the lead of her in-laws, who always reserved
Sundays for family.
</P>
<P>
   Both the former president and Barbara Bush say they're feeling a
protective surge as Texas' first family moves into the national
political arena. But neither has offered any guidance on how to
survive a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I awaken every morning with advice,'' Barbara Bush
jokes, `but I don't give it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about how his candidacy might affect their daughters
(they would be in college if Bush took office) worry George W. and
Laura Bush. They say they appreciate the hands-off policy of the
Texas press and are encouraged by the way the national media have
treated Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some things the girls can't be shielded from. At
the last Texas Book Festival, hecklers shouted down former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   `Jenna walked out of (there) and burst into tears,'' Laura Bush
says. `It's hard for a teen-ager when they yell mean things at your
grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, too, to hear things said about your husband.
</P>
<P>
   `I feel like that's what I dread the most, the criticism, but
also the totally unfounded rumors which we've heard,'' Laura Bush
says.
</P>
<P>
   `Friends will call us from somewhere, and tell us something
they've heard somewhere. There's no way to refute it because
they're so totally made up.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, not known for keeping his cool when his father
was the target of criticism during his last presidential race, says
he is also concerned about what his wife may have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   `It's a lot easier to be the candidate where people say ugly
things about you than the person who loves the person about which
ugly things are said. I know first-hand,'' he says, pausing. `I
know first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Laura Bush sat beside her husband at a
press conference and said she was `reluctant, absolutely,'' to get
involved in a presidential race. about the prospect of becoming
engaged in a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Now she says she is simply a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone today knows that any person who was considering this
job would have certain reservations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   TRANS. And that's been Laura Bush's role throughout their
marriage, to be her husband's sounding board on issues big and
small. Their contrasting personalities -- his high-energy
temperament and her laid-back style -- have provided `a good check
and balance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   She's always been `a very positive influence on me . . . in
terms of forcing me to ask the right questions,'' Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   `On the occasions where I drank too much she reminded me I was
drinking too much. And I listened.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, when everyone else was urging him to run for
governor, Laura Bush was one of the last people to get behind the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   She reminded him he was `living a dream'' as an owner of the
Texas Rangers, he says. Both of them had enjoyed their time
together watching games, the Florida Gulf Coast vacations that
centered on spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura's not the first to say, Oh boy, let's go do that, sort
of shovin' me into the limelight,'' the governor says.
</P>
<P>
   `She's the opposite of that. She says, Wait a minute, buddy, are
you sure? Are you sure you're going to ask our family to make a
life change? Are you sure that this is something you really want to
do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the decision about a presidential campaign has all but
been made, the candidate is putting a positive spin on how a heated
political campaign might affect their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   `We grew close during the baseball games because of the amount
of time we spent with each other,'' Bush says. `We could think
about things and talk. We grew very close during the (1994)
campaign because it was like we were in combat to a certain extent,
fellow warriors.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't really fear failure, and one of the reasons I don't
fear failure is because I know that I've got a wife who loves me.
And she doesn't fear failure either.'' Her politic decision
</P>
<P>
   When somebody asks me about life with George W. Bush I have to
resist using that old clich: There is never a dull moment.
</P>
<P>
   I have to resist being sentimental and saying that when I was in
class in elementary school I never dreamed that there was a boy
named George Bush who was also sitting in class across town at our
rival school, and that one day I would grow up to marry him . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have to resist saying that according to my children, life with
their dad is like being a private under the direct command of a
general. And that according to George, war is hell.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when someone asks me about George W. Bush I say
marrying him apparently was the smartest political move I ever
made. Not bad for somebody who knows nothing about politics.'' --
Laura Bush, introducing her husband at the Texas Women's Hall of
Fame gala.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' first lady never planned to give speeches.
</P>
<P>
   `I always think of myself as basically reserved and shy,'' she
says. `I wouldn't have thought of this before I started giving
speeches, but reading over the top of a book like I did millions of
time as a children's librarian is great practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who put off meeting her future husband because of his
political aspirations has said the idea of occupying the White
House is `sort of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   `I could just as soon, you know, hang around and work in the
yard,'' she told The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages. Disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush `is in a life that I don't think she ever
envisioned,'' George W. Bush says. `But she has seized the
opportunity and made a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, Barbara Bush says, `a sort of catalyst in our family.
She brings out the best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the elder George Bush: `When she greets Barbara and me,
when we come over to the house, there she is with her arms open for
a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush can't throw her arms around all the children of
Texas, but that's her goal, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   `I would most like to be known as an advocate for children,''
she says. `I would like to help parents be very informed so they
can make great decisions for their young children. I think being a
parent is the most important job any of us will ever have and our
relationships with our families and our children are our most
important relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   And her work to empower other families would be expanded if her
own were to occupy the White House. Barbara Bush can see her there,
reveling in the history and `majesty'' of her former home at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, the self-assured successor to lightning rod
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   `She's a good little nester,'' her mother-in-law says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever a campaign brings, family ties will bind them, the
Bushes say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that like any other family George and I have had
our share of fun and frustration in our 22 years of marriage.
Overall, though, I think we are both pleased with our success.
We've managed to raise two smart daughters and a half-dozen of
their animals. I consider myself doubly blessed to be a part of his
family and a partner of his in life. Ladies and gentlemen, my
husband, Governor Bush.''

ORTHODOX JEWISH WORLD FROM A FRESH, YOUNG VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan Englander shrugs when asked to account for his celebrity
status. Even with amber curls framing his head in shining
abundance, he looks momentarily old.
</P>
<P>
   On tour following the publication of his first book of short
stories, ``For the Relief of Unbearable Urges,'' (Alfred A. Knopf,
205 pages, $22), he seems for a second tired of trying to charm the
latest in a long line of interviewing strangers who greet him armed
with microphone and camera, pen and notepad.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's too polite to say so, a flash of light in his
large brown eyes and a slight tightening of his generous mouth
suggests he's not pleased by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd,'' he said. ``I'm thrilled, of course, and
startled. I feel as if people are thinking, `He's a sly one, that
Englander boy.' As if I were sitting on a gold mine when I was
staying home without a job to write short, literary fiction about
Orthodox Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   A barely published writer of short fiction is lucky to see a
first collection printed at all, but Englander's stories won him an
unprecedented advance of $350,000, which includes a 30,000-book
first printing and a commitment to publish a yet unfinished novel.
Before ``Unbearable Urges,'' he had published only four short
stories, three in Story magazine and one in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone moving quickly from obscurity to fame risks a backlash,
and this is especially true of a short-story writer. The market is
tight to the point of constriction. Most of the best can't make
even a modest living from sales. They teach, lecture, rely on
spouses, luck, stints of manual labor, grants and stipends.
</P>
<P>
   Englander, 29, won't be needing to teach any time soon and won't
be seeing a backlash from his peers. They love him. They compare
him to Chekhov and Singer, and not without reason. His work is
transparently lucid, with the profundity and ambition of an elder
and the jaunty wit of a youth. Lois Rosenthal, editor of Story
magazine, gave him the label everybody likes: ``Isaac Bashevis
Singer on crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaudits pour in, causing him to feel a mixture of elation and
dread. As a woman in ``The Wig'' observes to a friend, ``I can't
face Nava now. I'm too weak for her compliments. She'll praise me
into the grave today.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of his work is the first reason for his amazing
debut, but he's willing to admit there are other reasons having
nothing to do with talent.
</P>
<P>
   Youth and good looks don't hurt, and he's got both. More
importantly in an age of identity politics, he's a strong new voice
from the world of Orthodox Judaism, growing up as an insider and
achieving distance as a secular adult. To invent characters and
place them in environments, detachment is essential. The insider
who can, like Englander, see his world as outsiders see it is free
to make art from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Englander raises his hands, as if in surrender, and says he
doesn't spend time pondering why he is where he is. ``I'm doing my
best to maintain my place in the food chain,'' he says. ``My job is
to find the rhythms and phrasings to create characters in the
stories that are right for them. Talking about myself or selling
books is not my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is I'm playing catch-up,'' he continues. ``I'm
poorly educated. Comparisons with great writers scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Englander grew up in an Orthodox community on Long Island,
receiving what he calls a ``right-wing, xenophobic,
anti-intellectual, fire-and-brimstone, free-thought-free,
shtetl-mentality, substandard education.''
</P>
<P>
   His questioning mind, for which he credits his mother, was
constantly thwarted. ``My mother loved art. She dropped out of
school at 18 to get married. When I wanted to be a writer, she
encouraged me. That was vital. It's hard enough to do it without
people at home calling you a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``The Pugilist at Rest'' is Thom Jones' masterpiece
short story, ``The Twenty-seventh Man'' is Englander's. He got the
idea when he was 19 and thought, someone should write that story.
``I didn't think I would, but it stayed with me and eventually I
began to try.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 23, a friend whose mother was a children's book
editor _ Deborah Brodie _ asked to see a story. The only one he had
was ``The Twenty-seventh Man,'' in a far different form from its
present one. ``From her I learned that there was hope, if I kept
working I'd find a story in my material.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodie talked him into applying for the Iowa Writer's Workshop,
where he continued to revise his story and start others. ``Writers
were always coming through,'' he says. ``Meeting them and seeing
that they were human beings was huge for me. I had two years to
write in a community in which there is nothing more important than
writing. If you're asked why you weren't at your brother's funeral
and you say, `I was writing,' it's an acceptable excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, he also made the contacts that led to being published,
including Rosenthal of Story magazine. Two years ago, he moved to
Jerusalem to forge his new identity as a secular Jew and learn to
speak Hebrew. ``You'd think I would have learned Hebrew from an
Orthodox school, but no. What can I tell you? They failed us. I got
the Hebrew prize and knew nothing. I have no bone to pick with
anybody, but a school has a contract with children to teach them
and not waste their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he believe in God? ``It isn't the right question,'' he
says. ``Most of my characters believe in God. God exists in my
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Englander writes in drafts, endlessly revising. When does he
know he's finished? ``When someone pries a story out of my
fingers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Twenty-seventh Man'' describes the last days of a group of
Jewish writers rounded up at Stalin's orders to be shot, because as
Jews they were thought insufficiently loyal to the State.
</P>
<P>
   Surely a grim theme, but each writer in the story has his own
light, his own despair or delusion, his own purity and humor. If we
are flies to the gods who kill us for their sport, we are in
Englander's story flies capable of making urgent and necessary art
even in our last hours.
</P>
<P>
   Englander hesitates when asked why he moved to Jerusalem.
``Nothing I can say sounds right. I visited and came back. Now I've
made myself part of something very complicated. Living there has
made me a flag-waving fan of democracy. I ask people, do you
believe in equal rights for all citizens? If they even pause, I
know I'll have a problem. We're closer to tragedy in Israel. We
feel it and know its possibilities. There's nothing remote about
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's surprised when people assume his Orthodox family
must have shunned him. ``Not even close to the truth. My family
keeps me honest. They and the community at home support me.'' Their
lives, abstracted into fiction, are the basis of his work, and
sometimes they make suggestions that result in stories.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting his sister, one of her friends teasingly suggested his
bountiful locks would make a good wig. Hence, ``The Wig'' starring
his hair, which becomes a symbol of lost sexual power for a
middle-age woman willing to pay to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a mane of curls the color of toasted bamboo that runs
down to the middle of his back and ends in a deep, blunt ridge. The
curls are singular, full and moist, and they stack well. A head of
hair with personality. She is obsessed, she knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the passage, he blushes. ``I wasn't describing my
own hair,'' he protests weakly. ``It isn't that direct.'' Clearly
it is. An artist can use anything, even what he sees in the mirror.

BITTERSWEET TIMES FOR COLLECTORS OF LASERDISC MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they outgrew the shelves, he put them in crates, and
finally in stacks on the floor of his home. Bill Griffin estimates
that he has amassed about 4,000 titles since he began collecting
movies in 1983. ``I generally have a sense of what I own,'' he
said, ``but locating it is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes? Hardly. Griffin, of Ridgewood, N.J., is part of a
small but proud group, the faithful followers of a technology that
has been the quiet state of the art in home theater for two
decades: the laserdisc.
</P>
<P>
   ``My absolute worst addiction is for the Disney laserdiscs,'' he
said. ``I champ at the bit for those.'' He rhapsodizes about a
boxed set of ``Alice in Wonderland'' with television show excerpts,
radio broadcasts on the audio track and hundreds of animation
stills. ``You could sit there for hours and become absolutely
immersed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True, few Americans have ever bought a laserdisc player, or even
held one of the thin, 12-inch laserdisc platters, with their
silvery, iridescent sheen. Their owners have been limited to a
niche that is about 2 percent of the size of the VHS market; they
are the movie buffs who are willing to pay a little more for the
best picture available without a projector.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other worthy but outfoxed technologies, like Betamax, the
laserdisc has remained in the background for 20 years, supported by
fanatics with a yen for the director's cut of ``Brazil'' or a boxed
set of D.W. Griffith's early films.
</P>
<P>
   But these are bittersweet times for collectors. With DVD being
hailed as a conquering hero by the entertainment industry, the big
laserdiscs may be closed to spinning their last movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD has pushed it out of all the local stores here,'' said
Robert Niland, of Fort Collins, Colo., who has written about
laserdiscs and maintains on his Web site a
frequently-asked-questions page on the technology,
www.frii.com/rjn/laser/default.htm. He predicts that the production
of laserdiscs will stop within a year. ``As nice as it was, it's
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laser video first came on the retail market in 1978. It is a
cousin to the audio compact disc, with the data for the picture
image recorded as a series of pits on a reflective layer (usually
aluminum) in the disk, but unlike CDs and DVDs, which are digital,
the laserdisc is an analog system, with the data for the picture
image recorded as a series of pits on  reflective layer (usually
aluminum) in the disc. A laser reads the pits (about 30 billion of
them) as the disc spins in the player at up to 1,800 rpm. Because
only laser light comes in contact with the disc surface, it
theoretically does not wear out. Niland said it could provide a
picture as clear as 16-mm film.
</P>
<P>
   So why did VHS win out? The first laserdisc players cost about
$200 more than VCRs, and the VCR's ability to record turned out to
be a big draw with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Laserdiscs were also the victims of poor marketing. They got a
bad name from a competing videodisc system, Selectavision, marketed
around the same time by RCA. Selectavision used a stylus-in-groove
format, similar to a record; it died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, observers declared that laserdiscs would make a
resurgence, prompted by the popularity of big-screen televisions
and audio compact discs. But even at its height in the 1990s, it
never reached more than 2 million players in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   DVD is a touchy subject on the alt.video.laserdisc newsgroup,
where flame wars have broken out between DVD and laserdisc
adherents. ``Your LD players will officially become boat anchors,''
one visitor taunted. But laserdisc stalwarts are skeptical that DVD
will provide the range of titles and extras they have grown
accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people that I observe buying DVD are really
into showing off their system: `Look how big my subwoofer is,'''
Griffin said. ``It becomes less a focus on the movie itself and
more `look at the great explosion, feel how the house rumbles.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too many people that are raging that you have to
see `Casablanca' on DVD,'' he said. ``They're like, `You have to
see `Lost in Space.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's sour grapes, said John Higdon, a collector from San Jose,
Calif. ``That is standard whenever a new technology comes out,'' he
said. ``You always have people who just can't possibly move on.''
He has already supplemented his 2,000 laserdiscs with several
hundred DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Another collector, Dan Balogh, admits that his ``Music Man'' DVD
is sharper than his laserdisc version, but he still has
reservations. ``It's like a Sunday morning cartoon,'' he said. ``I
can see that it is a sound stage. I thought, Do I really want to
see how fake the set looks?'' He likened it to the restoration of
the Sistine Chapel. ``People were questioning whether Michelangelo
wanted the colors to be so bright,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The laserdisc's glossy packaging with sometimes lavish cover art
and liner notes evokes nostalgia in some, ``especially people in
their 40s, who grew up with long-playing records,'' said Mon Ayash,
a collector from Fall River, Mass. Laserdiscs look like an LP gone
platinum, while DVDs are the size of CDs. ``DVD,'' he said, ``is
dinky.''
</P>
<P>
   The nit-picking is endless, but laserdisc fans were the first on
the waiting list to order DVD players. Pioneer Electronics, the
only remaining manufacturer of laserdisc players, expects many
collectors to hedge their bets by purchasing its combi-players,
which play both DVDs and laserdiscs. It said it would stop
producing players for laserdiscs alone in one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some may say laserdiscs are following the ignoble footsteps of
the eight-track tape, but Ayash pointed to a laserdisc legacy.
Manufacturers kept digging deeper into the movie vaults to find
more obscure titles, unseen footage and the best film prints for
transfers to laserdiscs, which set a higher standard. Laserdiscs,
like DVDs, tend to offer much more than the average videotape, like
actors' biographies, directors' commentaries and outtakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never saw wide-screen videotapes,'' said Ayash, until
laserdiscs began to present movies in the same width-to-height
ratio as on the theater screen, using a technique called
letterboxing. ``They remastered the films, they fixed the picture
quality, they fixed the sound. The laserdisc gave a little more
impetus to the archeologists of film to get the best quality of
prints.''
</P>
<P>
   Balogh, who runs a laserdisc boxed-set tribute page,
www.openix.com/danb/lds/boxsets.shtml, said he wondered if that
attention to detail would fade as DVD aimed for the mainstream
market. ``Most people really don't care about the correct aspect
ratio,'' he said. ``Most people don't care about horizontal lines
of resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   While prices seem to be dropping on most used discs, rare discs
are fetching higher prices. Griffin is optimistic that there will
always be a collector out there to trade with because ``these discs
are probably going to outlast us all.'' Hundreds are auctioned on
the Internet each day, he added.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always Japan, where an estimated 10 percent of
homes have laserdisc players and DVDs have been slow to catch on.
With the right connections, and a bank that does international
money transfers, you can find yourself the proud owner of a Pioneer
HLD-X9 player and a complete season of the ``X-Files'' in a boxed
set, with Japanese subtitles. (American television shows are
popular laserdisc productions overseas.)
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, at least, is not planning to give up his laser
collection anytime soon, not unless all 11 of his players break
down. ``You mourn the passing,'' he said, ``but you celebrate the
life.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The double hung windows in my house leak badly, so I was
thinking of having completely new replacement windows installed _
until I found out what this would cost. A friend told me that I
could leave the old window frame in place and buy special kits that
would include new double-pane window sash and matching vinyl tracks
that come complete with weather stripping; then these can be
installed inside the existing window frames. I was also told that a
handy homeowner could install these himself, thus cutting costs
even further. What do you think of this idea?
</P>
<P>
   A: These kits do work. They come with complete instructions, and
can be installed by a do-it-yourselfer if he is handy and familiar
with using tools. You leave the old window frames in place, so you
will still have to paint and maintain the trim, but there is no
doubt that when properly installed the new sash and weather
stripping will definitely be a lot more efficient and energy saving
than old wooden windows are.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My basement walls are brick, and there is considerable
seepage in very wet weather, although there are no actual puddles
forming on the floor. Is there some kind of waterproofing paint I
can apply that will stop this seepage?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of ``waterproofing'' paints available that
are claimed to effectively seal masonry basement walls. They will
stop minor seepage through poured concrete and cement block
foundation walls, but I am not sure how effective they will be on a
brick basement wall, especially if the seepage is due to defective
mortar joints. At any rate, before applying such a coating I would
strongly recommend checking all mortar joints and replacing any
mortar that seems to be crumbling or is cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of years ago I had insulation blown into the outside
walls to cut down on heating costs. This year the outside paint
started blistering and peeling. I was told that this is because
there is no vapor barrier in the walls with this insulation. Is
this true, and what can I do to add a vapor barrier without having
to rip the walls open?
</P>
<P>
   A: Adding blown-in insulation into the walls sometimes does
cause condensation problems which can lead to peeling of paint
because moisture vapor from inside the house gets partially trapped
by the insulation. Condensation then forms on the back of the
exterior siding, causing the paint to peel. To solve this problem
you need to install a vapor barrier on the warm side of the
insulation in order to keep moisture vapor from penetrating. You
can accomplish this with a coat of vapor barrier paint (such as
Insul-Aid, made by Glidden) applied to each wall inside the house
or by hanging a vinyl wallcovering that will also serve as a vapor
barrier to prevent moisture vapor from inside the house entering
the hollow spaces inside the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We removed the carpet from our hardwood floor after 12 years.
However, we found that the padding under the rug is sticking to the
wood flooring and practically falls apart when we try to pull it
up. How can we get this padding off without damaging the beautiful
parquet floor underneath?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds as though an adhesive was used to cement the pad to
the floor, or it may have simply deteriorated and is now sticking
to the wood floor's old finish. The only way to remove this now is
to start by first scraping off as much as you can, using a
long-handled scraper or stiff putty knife. Then you will have to
sand the floor to clean off any residue that remains. Before
sanding, however, make sure the parquet is solid wood, not just a
veneer (sanding could damage the veneer).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 3 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, and Carla Arellano was
sitting in front of her computer in her off-campus apartment,
trying to keep her eyes open. In just a few hours, her resume was
due at Georgetown University's career center.
</P>
<P>
   At that late hour, her main concern was making sure that her
resume had the right keywords. ``I was trying to put certain words
at the beginning of a sentence, so that a computer might catch it
more easily,'' Ms. Arellano said, recalling that sleepless night.
```Analytical' _ that was one of my words. And `qualitative
skills.' And `consulting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arellano, a senior at Georgetown, was having her first
encounter with a high-tech job search. She was building an
electronic resume that, once planted in a prospective employer's
computerized database, could easily be found. She was also scouring
the Internet for Web sites with resume-writing advice and
bookmarking job boards. But she wasn't finding the experience to be
everything she expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said that the Internet would help,'' she said, ``but
it was not as easy as everyone said it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, job searches were done in person. College
career offices were nerve centers on campus, as places where
students would leaf through binders full of career information and
sign up for interviews with employers who came to campus. Job fairs
required attendance. The firm handshake and clear gaze were the
order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now most students visit career centers online first. They post
resumes and search for job information on the Internet. They may
close the deal in person, but they often start in front of the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   New York University, for example, has developed an in-house
system called Careernet that gives students online access to job
postings aimed at NYU students. Georgetown has developed a
Web-based scheduling system, through which students find out if
they have been selected for interviews with employers coming to
campus and then sign up for time slots. Columbia University uses a
similar system that requires students to send their resumes to the
career center electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Most students in the job market are intimately familiar with
their campus' career center Web site, even if they have never
visited the office in person.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Syrdahl, an NYU junior, said she had had more luck with
her university's Careernet than with nationwide job boards. She
spent her winter break using her home computer to search for a
summer job or internship. She found not one but two. She also found
her current part-time job through the Careernet.
</P>
<P>
   But many students feel the same ambivalence about electronic job
hunting that Ms. Arellano did. They love the Internet's speed and
its breadth of information. Some students said they checked online
job postings whenever they found themselves near a computer. But
many of the same students are not hopeful about finding a job
online. And they are wary about technology _ instead of humans _
making decisions about which jobs they might be qualified for.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a good year to experiment with ways to find jobs,
since there seem to be quite a few jobs out there. Employers who
participated in a survey last fall by the National Association of
Colleges and Employers forecasted a 10 percent increase in the
number of openings this year. While the job market is not as flush
as it was for 1998 graduates _ who benefited from the best year
this decade for job seekers _ it is still quite strong, said
Camille Luckenbaugh, the association's employment information
manager.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, jobs in information technology are some of
the easiest to find, and as with many other high-tech positions,
most of them are posted online. Some companies have devoted
sections of their Web sites to recruitment, announcing job openings
and requesting resumes. National online job boards like Monster.com
and Careerpath list thousands of openings every day _ many of which
are in telecommunications, software and technical consulting
industries. Job seekers can simply skim the job postings, or they
may post digital versions of their resumes and fill out online
forms that are compiled in databases viewed by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs for college grads without computer-science backgrounds,
however, are harder to find using online job boards. Monster.com
has a ``campus zone'' and Career Mosaic has a ``college
connection'' section. Both offer advice, but most of their listings
are not aimed at people fresh out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online searching wasn't very helpful,'' said Tony Oliver, a
English major at Georgetown who was looking for a consulting job.
``On Monster.com, I would get four to five e-mail messages a day,
but they were geared to people with a lot of computer-programming
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Esianor, a graduate student in public administration at
New York University, said she had ``been searching basically
everything'' but had not had much success online either. She posted
her resume on the Job Direct Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the feedback I've received has been for things I don't
want to do, in places I don't want to go,'' she said. She wondered
if a real human being was even reading her resume. ``It seems as if
a computer is reading it,'' she said. ``It's too impersonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such setbacks, most students still seem to visit online
job boards when starting their search. They are also putting a lot
of energy into creating the perfect electronic resume, sometimes
called a ``scannable'' resume, one without any special formatting
or graphics that might trip up an optical scanner.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most electronic resumes never even make it into
print. They are simply sent via e-mail or pasted into online forms.
College career centers devote entire workshops to electronic
resumes, teaching students how to send them as e-mail attachments
or create text-only versions without tabs or line breaks that get
garbled in transmission.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies simply print out these resumes once they have
arrived electronically. But some large corporations like
Hewlett-Packard and Kaiser-Permanente feed them into resume
management databases. Many of the databases organize the resumes by
matching words in them with a list of keywords that the companies
are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Seeding a resume with the right keywords can become a full-time
obsession for some college seniors _ particularly those business or
computer science majors who hope to work for large companies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   George Tarnopolsky, a business management and marketing major at
Cornell University, said he had even seen students add a section
called ``keywords'' at the bottom of their resumes, right under
``experience'' and ``education.'' Once the section is added,
Tarnopolsky said, the number of times employers look at your resume
increases from ``something like three times a week to five times a
day.'' (People using Monster.com, for example, can check how many
employers have looked at their resumes.)
</P>
<P>
   Liberal arts students do not usually spend as much time focusing
on keywords because their target employers are less likely to have
large, automated resume-management systems. And in general, these
students may find the Web less useful. Many liberal arts students
search for jobs in the nonprofit arena or at government agencies _
positions that are often the hardest to find. Those employers do
not often rely as heavily on national online job boards, like
Careerpath. Also, nonprofit employers rarely have the resources to
visit campuses for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, such employers are starting to send job listings to
college career centers, for posting on their online job boards. Or
they send information about the positions to an online service
called Jobtrak. Jobtrak maintains a database of job openings for
use by college career centers only. Employers send their job
postings to Jobtrak and designate the colleges they would like to
target. They pay $18 per listing per college, or less if they are
posting to more than one. More than 800 campuses use the service.
</P>
<P>
   To give employers yet another way to narrow their recruiting,
the Ivy League schools, along with Stanford University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served as hosts of an ``Ivy+
Virtual Career Fair'' two weeks ago. The one-week ``fair'' took
place on the Web. Only students from the 10 elite colleges could
enter. Once they logged in, they were required to add their resumes
to an electronic book, which was open to potential employers.
Students could browse job openings and ask employers questions via
e-mail or online bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Arts and Culture, in Washington, was one of the
150 participating employers. Malissa Bennett, programs and
operations manager for the center, said that the fair was the
center's first chance to actively recruit students online. She
added that she was impressed with what she saw.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was not ready to go completely digital.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to accepting resumes, ``I specifically asked for a
paper submission,'' Ms. Bennett said. ``Some applicants, those who
seemed more serious about the job, took the time to send in a
complete paper application with cover letter, resume and writing
sample.''
</P>
<P>
   An awareness of that perception hounds today's college grads.
``E-mailing my resume didn't get the same results as going to the
career center and meeting companies,'' said Ms. Arellano, the
Georgetown senior. ``It seemed that e-mail wasn't taken as
seriously by employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arellano did get a job she wanted, as an
information-technology analyst for Chase Manhattan Bank. But she
landed it by meeting her employers face-to-face at an old-fashioned
campus interview, with a paper resume in hand.
</P>
<P>
   She had mixed feelings looking back at those frenzied weeks she
spent online. Although she was able to do more research on the Web
than would have been possible otherwise, she didn't like the
impersonal nature of applying for jobs over a computer.
</P>
<P>
   But she couldn't be happier about one use of the technology:
When Chase decided to let her know that she would soon get a formal
job offer, the bank sent her a quick note via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors for college students offer this advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ List any software skills you may have on your resume, even if
you are not looking for a high-tech job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't include your Internet home page address on your resume
unless you have groomed the site for a business audience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do include your e-mail address _ and check for messages often.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't expect companies to open your e-mail attachments. Always
send another copy of your resume and cover letter as a text
message, via fax, or via postal mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before going to an interview, make sure to visit the
employer's Web site. Know what's on it.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the most part, getting your foot in the door still entails
getting your foot in the door. Try to conduct interviews in person
as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start an online job search is the Web page of
your college career center. These sites may also help:

TAMING THAT ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL SLIPCOVER

 By STEVEN J. STARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The slipcover probably made its appearance during
prehistoric times, when a cave dweller threw an animal skin over a
rock. Even back then, the slipcover slipped. Frescoes show that
recumbent Romans preferred to cover their pallets with layers of
cloth, which puddled on the mosaic floors. (Tailoring was hardly
expected.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, Europeans resolved the slipcover conundrum
with tapestry coverings made in two parts, to fit over the backs
and seats of chairs. (Anyone who had tapestries also had teams of
servants to keep the covers neatly in place.)
</P>
<P>
   Americans, during the 1930s and '40s, rose to the slip-off
challenge with custom-made coverups for old chairs. In the early
'90s, slipcover sales surged with the advent of the ``English
country-house'' look _ a loose cover made in universal-fit sizes
and sold to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The universal-fit slipcover market grew to what today is an $80
million a year business, said Warren Shoulberg, the editor of Home
Textiles Today, a Manhattan-based trade publication. But returns
were high, he said, around 30 percent in the early '90s. Universal
slipcovers have, in fact, a universal tendency to slip off and
bunch up.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Paula Riley, 50, invented Fitting Pretty, which
promised to keep slipcovers in place without constant retucking.
She hoped that her device _ plastic holding rods and clips _ would
take advantage of a niche that was becoming increasingly popular.
Unfortunately, her rivals had the same idea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ms. Riley, a business consultant in fashion and
retailing in New York, enlisted Ken Stevens, a New York industrial
designer, to design her product. She envisioned ribbed, V-shaped
plastic rods, the size of windshield wipers, that when pushed
around the seat cushions would keep slipcovers from sliding. It was
the equivalent of shoulder pads in a woman's dress _ something to
stabilize the fit _ and it hit stores just as consumers were
returning their slipcovers in droves. The rods were packaged with a
tucking tool and clips for pleating _ $30 for a sofa, $25 for a
love seat and $20 for a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Riley applied for a patent in July of 1994 and the kits
began turning up in catalogs six months later. Domestications, a
home furnishings catalog company in Weehawken, N.J., initially
ordered 600 kits, said Gunter Siemon, a senior buyer for the
catalog, and sold all 600 within two days. Domestications ordered
15,000 more. Not bad for a one-woman company run out of a
two-bedroom apartment on West 57th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in Fitting Pretty history, Ms. Riley sought a tie-in
with a slipcover manufacturer. Who better, she thought, than Sure
Fit Inc. of Allentown, Pa., the largest manufacturer in the
country. ``It seemed so hand-in-glove,'' she said, sitting in her
home office.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1994, Ms. Riley met with Bert Shlensky, the
president of Sure Fit, at his Manhattan office. From 1991 through
1994, Sure Fit sold $80 million to $90 million worth of slipcovers.
But, Shlensky explained recently, the company suffered the same
plight as the rest of the industry _ high returns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Riley said Shlensky signed a confidentiality agreement
saying he would not reveal information about Fitting Pretty _
including making or selling any version of it. But after examining
her product and being told how it worked, Shlensky said that Sure
Fit wasn't interested. So, Ms. Riley decided to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been the last she saw of Sure Fit executives,
except that in April, 1995, she and her designer, Stevens, ducked
into a Bed, Bath and Beyond at 18th Street and Sixth Avenue in
Manhattan and discovered a product like their own being marketed by
Sure Fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't breathe for a second,'' she said, describing
her reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Ms. Riley and Stevens were on their way to her
patent attorney's office to sign a patent application for another
component of Fitting Pretty, the pleating clips. Their attorney
fired off a letter to Sure Fit reminding the company of its
confidentiality agreement. Sure Fit's lawyers replied, denying that
it had copied her invention. In August of 1996, when Ms. Riley's
patent on Fitting Pretty was approved, her lawyer notified Sure Fit
of the patent infringement. Sure Fit didn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Riley's lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1996. According to her suit, Sure Fit declined
to license her invention, then knocked it off with what it called
Stayputs, plastic slipcover stabilizers similar to Ms. Riley's
product.
</P>
<P>
   It was a David and Goliath clash between Ms. Riley (annual sales
of $195,000) and Sure Fit (annual sales of about $50 million).
Although Sure Fit's lawyers would not comment on the lawsuit, court
papers show the company denied Ms. Riley's accusations, but agreed
to stop selling their product while it continued. As it dragged on,
Sure Fit went through a series of corporate mergers that saw it
acquired by Pillowtex as a part of Fieldcrest Cannon, and then spun
off to private investors in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, 1998 _ Ms. Riley's 50th birthday _ the two sides
settled without assessing blame. The settlement is confidential,
and both sides agreed to destroy all documents related to it. Ms.
Riley said only that her settlement was at least $1 million over
the cost of the lawsuit and that her legal bills totaled about $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Sure Fit no longer sells its Stayputs. Shlensky,
while he would not talk about the lawsuit, did say that Sure Fit
now sells a one-piece slipcover that looks like a big shower cap,
and does not need anchors. ``It's not form-fitting, so it will
move, but it generally stays in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the settlement, Ms. Riley has signed an agreement with
Value Quest, a distributor in Canton, Ohio, to sell Fitting Pretty
to American retail chains. ``We have not found any product remotely
similar,'' said Mike Clark, the vice president for marketing of
Value Quest. ``It almost defies logic why it works, but it really
does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This month, distribution of Fitting Pretty began in Europe. And
Ms. Riley has gone into partnership with Pottery Barn, which is
selling her product in the store's new catalog as the Loose-Fit
Tailoring Set.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Alber, the vice president of the Pottery Barn Catalog
Division, said the device ``enhances slipcovers and allows the
customers to achieve the look we have in the catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit on the sofa,'' she said, ``it stays tucked in.
They do exactly what they say they will do. It's cut down on
returns of loose-fit slipcovers substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL SIDEBAR BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   When people started having babies, that's when everyone began
buying slipcovers,'' said Nana Colgrove, a television producer in
New York with two small children. But universal-fit slipcovers have
to be constantly retucked, especially after Arnie the Airedale has
slept on the sofa and the children have used it as a trampoline.
Paula Riley's Fitting Pretty kit of plastic rods and clips ($30)
promises to keep ``casual slipcovers secure and looking picture
perfect.'' Do they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture perfect'' may be aiming a little high, but the device
does help. The target sofa, a chocolate-brown velvet number that
had already endured one child, needed some serious freshening for
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two novice slipcoverers tackled two do-it-yourself cover-ups,
one a luxurious cotton velvet from Classic Slipcovers (about $300),
the other a washable cotton and polyester slipcover by
Fieldcrest/Sure Fit from Bed, Bath and Beyond ($129.99). The
Fieldcrest slipcover was meant to stay in place with an elastic
band that runs under the cushions. Wrestling it on was a two-person
job, and although it looked satisfactory, especially after the
corner straps were tied, the fit was hardly tailored. (Does anyone
seriously believe one size fits all?)
</P>
<P>
   So, it was on to the Fitting Pretty plastic rods, which were
easy to install. (Pushing the rods deep into the crevice around the
seating area seemed to do the trick.) Thankfully, none of the
accompanying fancy clips and elastic bands were needed; using them
seemed to require the perseverance of a committed decorator. With
the Fitting Pretty Tuck-Once Grips the fit was more crisp and
tailored. Over an active weekend, nothing required retucking.
</P>
<P>
   The fit of the luxe Classic slipcover, made without the elastic
band under the cushions, was actually quite good. But even here,
the plastic Fitting Pretty grips added tension, making for a
cleaner edge. The cover looked almost custom-made and would have
been a keeper, if it hadn't clashed with the walls.

 &HT;    GLENN ACCEPTS 'MISSION' OF OPPOSING FLAG DESECRATION AMENDMENT
 &HT;    640&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making his first visit to Capitol Hill since his
retirement from the Senate, John Glenn urged his former colleagues
Wednesday to reject a constitutional amendment giving Congress the
power to outlaw flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Such an amendment would ``protect the symbol while risking
chipping away at the freedoms it symbolizes,'' Glenn warned the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine pilot in World War II before he became an astronaut and
politician, Glenn appeared along with current senators united by
their distinguished combat records. But the senators, even members
of the same party, differed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost a foot and
earned a Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War, spoke against the
amendment. But Max Cleland of Georgia, who lost his legs in the
Vietnam War, is a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island, a combat veteran
of World War II and the Korean War, was passionate in his
disapproval, while John McCain of Arizona, who survived years
torture as a prisoner of war in North Vietnamese, was eloquent in
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The only senator who saw combat in Vietnam as an enlisted
soldier, Nebraska Republican Chuck Hagel, conceded that ``there are
legitimate questions about this,'' but said he would vote for the
amendment. ``Freedom of speech is not unlimited,'' he said.
``Symbolism is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Supported by most Americans in public opinion polls and by
powerful veterans groups, the proposed amendment would give
Congress ``the power to prohibit'' any ``physical desecration'' of
the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has ruled that state and federal statutes
outlawing burning or otherwise abusing the flag are
unconstitutional abridgements to the right of free expression
guaranteed by the First Amendment. Thus, supporters have concluded
that an constitutional amendment is needed to give Congress
authority to pass a flag protection measure.
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved the amendment twice before and is
expected to do so again in this Congress. Even opponents believe
that the Senate is nearing the two-thirds majority needed to
approve it as well.
</P>
<P>
   The president has no say in the matter, and if the measure
clears Congress, more than the required three-fourths of the state
legislatures have made clear they would quickly ratify it as the
28th amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very close, ... two votes one way or the other'' in the
Senate, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who asked Glenn to testify
before the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the former Democratic senator from Ohio _ the first
American to orbit the Earth and a ``mythic figure'' in the space
program who undertook a shuttle mission at the age of 77 _ is still
revered in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank him for accepting this latest mission'' of testifying
against the popular amendment, said Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love the flag and are dedicated to it and to what it
stands for,'' Glenn told the committee. But it would ``tear the
fabric of the country'' to ``retreat from the principles that our
flag stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly an epidemic of flag desecration, he pointed out,
and asked, ``is this really a solution looking for a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, McCain told how one of his comrades in the POW
camp stitched the Stars and Stripes on the inside of his prison
garb. With this shirt stuck to the wall, the Americans would say
the pledge of allegiance to the flag each day.
</P>
<P>
   But their captors discovered the flag and severely beat its
creator, McCain recalled. Afterward, while still bruised and
bleeding, the punished POW was back sewing another flag from scraps
of cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into a constitutional debate,'' McCain
said quietly. ``I feel very strongly about the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Chafee told the panel, ``I strongly oppose the amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It trivializes the Constitution,'' he said. Would the law
punish college professors for burning a flag in protest, he asked,
but not Boy Scouts for reverently burning a worn or soiled flag,
the recommended means of disposal? What about someone who burned a
worn or soiled flag in protest?
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that the unintended consequences (of the measure) will
be far worse'' than ``the isolated instances of desecration,'' said
Kerrey. ``Real patriotism cannot be coerced.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland said the flag is ``the one unifying symbol of our
country'' and deserves protection. Soldiers have been awarded the
Medal of Honor, often posthumously, for protecting the flag, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's opposition to the amendment was
explained by Randolph Moss, acting assistant attorney general in
the office of legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amendment, if passed, would for the first time in our
history limit the individual freedoms protected by the Bill of
Rights, adopted over two centuries ago,'' Moss testified.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, however, the opponents were criticized by
Butch Miller, the national commander of the American Legion, a
veterans group with 2.8 million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Various polls conducted over 10 years have shown consistently
that 80 percent of the American people support the amendment.
Forty-nine state legislatures have passed resolutions supporting
the amendment,'' Miller said in a prepared statement. ``It is time
for those we have elected to represent us in Washington to do the
right thing.''

A PLACE FOR TRADITION: INMATES BUILD SWEAT LODGE IN COMANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMANCHE, Texas _ The sight of a sweat lodge in Comanche County
probably wouldn't have been unusual back in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   But since few Native Americans are left in the region, and its
location is inside the grounds of the Comanche County Jail, the
lodge now is a little out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Located behind the jail's auto repair shop and surrounded by the
barren soil that is a byproduct of a recent jail expansion, the
sweat lodge is surrounded by a chain-link fence and razor wire. But
it is sacred to the eight Native American inmates from Wisconsin
who were allowed to build and use it in Comanche County after being
denied the right while they were housed in other Texas jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought it was kind of ironic that we would end up in a
town named Comanche,'' said Randy Denny, 42, who spent most of his
life on the Oneida Reservation in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of joke about it, that the Indians have returned,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a town where high school mascot is ``The Indians'' and the
annual arts and crafts festival is called a ``Pow Wow,'' the
inmates have been a little surprised at their reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a little bit of a novelty, but we've been
well-received'' said Denny, who is serving time on an arson
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed the county was procrastinating for a while but we
got it built and we've been treated well here,'' Denny said. ``We
call it the mom-and-pop jail because it's so laid-back around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Comanche County Sheriff Billy Works said the sweat lodge
ceremonies have posed no problems and have helped morale in the
jail, 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what they've done here,'' said Works, who
acknowledged that it took a while to find a site for the sweat
lodge. ``Every time we picked a site we had a county commissioner
saying we couldn't build it there,'' he said. ``But I think
everyone's happy with the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday a month, stones are heated in a pit and the inmates
_ two Oneidas, two Menominis, two Chippewas, one Ponca and one
Aztec _ shed their clothes and crawl into the sweat lodge to begin
their prayers and songs. Two remain outside, heating stones in a
fire pit.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which is for purification, lasts about three
hours. It includes four sessions, with seven hot stones used for
each stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door faces east, representing rebirth,'' Denny said. ``If
my mother or sister were giving birth, for example, we would pray
for the newborns.''
</P>
<P>
   The men then pray to the west, north and south, which represent
the stages of life. There are ribbons, which signify each
direction, and the ends of the ribbons are filled with a mixture of
tobacco, cedar, sage and sweet grass.
</P>
<P>
   Between the lodge's entrance and the pit where stones are heated
is a staff topped with feathers and deer antlers, representing
birds and hooved animals.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are satisfied that they finally have a sweat lodge,
Denny said the Native American inmates were frustrated by the
amount of time it took for it to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 740 Wisconsin inmates housed in eight Texas
jails. In other Texas counties, the inmates said, they felt they
were never taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never a priority,'' Denny said. ``We were made fun of
and taunted for our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Hood County Sheriff Rodney Jeanis, head of Wis-Tex, the
company that finds jail space for Wisconsin inmates, said he
immediately thought of Comanche County as the place for the Native
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their religion is different than anything some people have
been around _ that's one of the reasons I thought of Comanche,''
Jeanis said. ``It was Indian country. I don't think they liked the
idea initially, but they got behind it. The support this has
received from the community has been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   To show their appreciation, the inmates have made Indian crafts
and given them to guards and residents who helped them obtain
materials for the sweat lodge. Now that the lodge is built, Works
hopes the Indian crafts made by the inmates can be sold at a flea
market outside the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates also are planning a Ghost Feast for June 12, where
they will honor their ancestors with a daylong celebration of
drumming, singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try and have some traditional foods but, who knows, we
may end up having hot dogs,'' Denny said. ``It just kind of depends
on what kind of support and donations come in. We hope we'll get
the support and attention of other Indian groups in Texas to help
us out.''

SOFTWARE FOR CREATING GREETING CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Alice Keim, a teacher, is the technology coordinator for the Horace
Mann Lower School in the Bronx.  
 By ALICE KEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never been a big fan of store-bought greeting cards. I've
always preferred to pull out some markers or watercolors and create
my own disaster. I like my cards to sound like me, not like a
Hallmark professional.
</P>
<P>
   But I am marrying into a family of big-time card givers so I
have started going to card stores in search of thoughts or feelings
to send to my fiance's relatives. I have discovered, however, that
I can spend hours and never find a true expression of myself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it doesn't matter whether you like card stores or
not: Mother's Day is around the corner, and the pressure is on. One
answer is software that allows you to combine your personal style
with computer-assisted production: graphics, phrases and more.
</P>
<P>
   The programs allow you to be as creative or inventive as you
wish, providing preformatted options for the timid and creative
tools for the bold.
</P>
<P>
   Most home-publishing products have a card option. There are
also, however, many programs that are specifically geared toward
cards and other simple printed products for the consumer who does
not want all the publishing options.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft Graphics Studio Home Publishing 99 is a
comprehensive publishing program, but Microsoft's Greetings 99
includes everything you need for cards and other small projects.
Similarly, Sierra Home's Print Artist Platinum is a wonderful
program, but if you just want to make some cards and invitations,
Print Artist Cards Plus is more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   The packages of most home publishing programs promote huge
collections of clip art, phrases and more. The numbers are truly
remarkable _ 14,000 designs, 6,000 greeting cards, 80,000 graphics
_ but also relatively unimportant when choosing a program.
</P>
<P>
   If a program, no matter how large, doesn't include the type and
style you want, then it's a waste of money. I was amazed by the
collection of 5,000 quotations in one product, yet disappointed by
the 6,000 greeting cards available in another program. While there
may be a huge number of cards, they may not correspond to your
style and needs, and you probably won't know that until you open
the box.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the programs also offer different project types and
often include calendar reminders that help keep you informed of
forthcoming holidays and other celebrations that might warrant a
card. Most have electronic greetings that allow you to send cards,
often animated, through a Web site or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some products are geared to children, but I was disappointed by
them. For example, I looked at IBM's Crayola Print Factory, for
ages 5 to 10. The tools were easy to understand but hard to use.
The graphics were cute, but most children _ certainly the ones I
teach _ would expect a bigger and better selection.
</P>
<P>
   For children, a general classic art program, like Broderbund's
Kid Pix or Art Dabbler by Metacreations, is a better bet than the
programs specifically for cards. Many adult programs are friendly
enough for children to use with just a little help. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRINT ARTIST CARDS PLUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Home; $29.95; Windows 95 and 98.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cards Plus is in many ways the solution to basic card-making
needs. Graphically appealing and simple to use, it caters to the
user who wants to make cards, things like scrapbooks and calendars,
and little else.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is familiar and comfortable, similar to most word
processing programs but with slightly different buttons and
functions. The opening screen offers 11 different project types,
each represented by a picture button. There are several different
types of cards as well as stationery, scrapbooks, banners,
calendars and party and gift sets to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on Holiday Cards brought up another picture window that
let me choose a season of the year or other options. After I picked
Spring, I was able to select from holidays ranging from National
Nurse Day to Easter. The design choices vary by format; I found a
simple flower card.
</P>
<P>
   Before making my final decision, I was able to preview the
inside and back of the card in addition to the front design. After
I made my selection, the card appeared on the screen with an
editing button bar.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the program, you can alter the card. I changed
the background colors on the front cover, then moved inside and
clicked on a button with a picture of a camera to get access to a
library of compatible graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows you to search by keyword or by category, an
essential function when searching through 20,000 pictures. The
search pulls up related subject matter, not just graphics with
matching titles. For example, using the keyword ``mom'' pulled up
graphics titled Family 1 and Mother With Baby. For a picture of a
flower, I could search by category in either the Flora or the
Flowers and Plants categories, or I could type in the name of my
mother's favorite flower.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once you select a graphic, it appears on your editing screen
with handles. I moved it around, made it bigger and rotated it to
an appealing angle.
</P>
<P>
   When I clicked on the Insert Text Object button, a screen
appeared where I could either write my own message or choose from a
catalog of quotations. This is a remarkable section that includes
words of wisdom, philosophy and humor from most every source you
can think of, like Dr. Spock, Phyllis Diller and Friedrich
Nietzsche. A selection of 300 fonts also provides wonderful
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   If you are happy with this program's graphics collection and are
looking for a program that is easy to use, Cards Plus is an
excellent choice. But the program does not do a good job of
importing the user's own graphics or artwork. That requires a more
sophisticated program. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COREL PRINT HOUSE MAGIC 4 PREMIUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Corel; $39; Windows 95 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While I try to stay away from programs that seem too ambitious,
I truly enjoyed using Print House Magic 4. It is a a sophisticated
program designed for the novice user, thanks to a wonderful
built-in tutorial.
</P>
<P>
   The opening screen is a simple interface with a blank page to
the right and options to the left: no cute icons or enticing
sounds. You can choose to work from a ``sample,'' from ``scratch''
or from a saved document.
</P>
<P>
   I also liked the ability to jump immediately from the opening
screen to the last project you worked on. Clicking on Sample or
Scratch calls up project types to choose from. There are banners,
brochures, calendars, certificates, cards and others.
</P>
<P>
   To choose cards, I selected Birthday as my occasion and Family
as my recipient. A list appeared with sample birthday cards to
various family members. I also looked in the humor section but, as
is the case in just about every card store, I wasn't too thrilled
by the selection. All the cards can be previewed while you are
considering the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with six CDs. It is both a blessing and a
nuisance to have such a large selection of photos, phrases, borders
and clip art. There are two CDs labeled Photos, two labeled Clip
Art Images, more clip art images combined with picture frames and
borders on another CD and the main program CD, which offers a
sample of everything.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself switching CDs in search of an image from the
instruction book or an image that would complement my project. The
program will tell you if you make an error by inserting a CD that
doesn't contain what you are looking for, but it does not specify
which is the correct disk to use.
</P>
<P>
   I changed my card by switching the message and adding a
personalized opening. Then I decided to import a photo. It is in
this area that Corel excels beyond the other home publishing
products. Print House Premium includes a copy of Photo House 3,
which offers many tools similar to those offered by Adobe Workshop.
It is easy to toggle between the programs to create a fantastic
personalized card.
</P>
<P>
   I opened a family photograph from my desktop folder and started
to play with Photo House 3. I was able to repair red eye, adjust
the color and contrast and replace colors in my photograph. I took
a photograph with poor lighting and shadows and made it
presentable. I was particularly impressed by the program's ability
to let a user take several steps backward when a mistake is made.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful inclusion is the cloning tool, which lets you
copy one part of a photo into another. I took a picture of my
2-year-old nephew, cut him out, pasted him into a jungle scene and
then cloned the bushes to make the setting seem natural. The
drawing tools are also impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Photo House 3 also has unusual special effects that allow you to
warp and swirl your photograph and add texture. It combines the
sophistication of Photoshop with the user-friendly tools of Kai's
Power Goo. If you want to import your own images into your cards,
the results with this program are wonderful. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN GREETINGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CREATE-A-CARD GOLD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Mindscape; $49.99; Windows 95 and 98.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of this program is its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the opening screen, the program features a
graphics-based interface with friendly icons and limited choices.
This program will not answer every home publishing need, but it
provides an easy way to create some home print projects.
</P>
<P>
   To create a Mother's Day card, I started simply. The screen let
me narrow my search by picking from specific People and Format
categories. For example, I could have chosen ``flowery thoughts,''
which steers you to an extensive collection of sentimental cards,
or ``new mother.'' I chose ``for grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The next screen shows a mock-up of the actual cards and a check
box for you to select a tone for your card.
</P>
<P>
   The choices were disappointing. For a funny card for my
grandmother, I had only one option. Double clicking brought the
card to full size, and additional tools appeared on the screen.
From here, you can preview the different front covers available and
select from a few other messages that go with the same card design.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Change Text option that allows the user to
personalize the message. I changed Grandma to Grammy and
substituted in my name where appropriate. On the back of the card,
I gave myself creative credit right above the large American
Greetings logo.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I could have printed the card and called it done.
Instead, however, I chose to click the Creative Workshop link to
personalize my card further. This section provides more phrases and
drawing tools and the ability to add photos or art from the file. I
was able to find words more appropriate for my own grandmother and
add a few graphics to spice up the card.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics selection is enormous and a bit overwhelming. I
found myself scrolling through the pages trying to remember where I
had seen certain pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The print menu allowed me to choose a paper format and provided
helpful animated instructions for how to fold your card once it is
printed. It also provided ways to create a self-mailer or an
envelope. The card can be sent via e-mail, or if you send the card
to American Greetings through e-mail, it will print and mail it for
you for a small fee.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good program to use with your children. You can enable
a child guard, which makes potentially inappropriate adult-oriented
material available only to users with the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Any child who knows how to use computers could create a card _
or invitations, announcements, multimedia cards, signs,
certificates, stickers, stationery and more. The program includes a
calendar, which can be personalized to help remind you of occasions
for sending cards, and a special screen saver program. The software
comes with locked files containing additional graphic collections
that can be opened for additional fees.
</P>
<P>
   But I would not recommend this program for people with extensive
experience with desktop publishing or photo editing. While the
tools are adequate for the novice, they will prove frustrating for
more experienced users.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing and painting tools are extremely limited so it's a
poor program for those wanting to create original artwork. You
could create the artwork in another program and import it as you
would a photo, but that would seem to speak volumes about the
inadequacy of this program for such uses. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT GRAPHICS STUDIO GREETINGS 99 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Microsoft; $29.95; Windows 95 and 98.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to design the card of your dreams on a Microsoft
program, you face a decision. Microsoft Graphics Studio Home
Publishing 99 has card-making components. The Greetings 99 program
includes Hallmark materials.
</P>
<P>
   If you just want to make cards, the Greetings program makes the
most sense. The program is user-friendly and allows you to choose
from sections called Paper Projects, E-Mail Projects, Occasions and
Blank Projects (for starting from scratch).
</P>
<P>
   I found that I could make a Mother's Day card in any of these
areas. On the Paper menu, I could choose from seven options,
including Greeting Cards, Stationery and Announcements. When I
clicked on Greeting Cards, the computer prompted me to either use
one of the predesigned cards or start with a blank page.
</P>
<P>
   The first option includes thumbnails of card designs and lets
you pick a mood: cute, funny or serious. I found it frustrating
that I was able to see only one mood at a time. After choosing a
card, you can edit, add and alter to your heart's content.
</P>
<P>
   I changed the border, altered the colors, added some clip art
and came up with a fairly original card with the Hallmark look, yet
my own personal touch. I was impressed by the selection of art and
phrases but frustrated by the way it was organized.
</P>
<P>
   The images are divided into 51 subject areas with 60 pictures in
each section. These sections are rather overwhelming. The program
does, however, have a search engine. I typed in ``chicken'' and was
shown an astounding 24 images and borders either showing or
relating to chickens.
</P>
<P>
   I next tried to make a photo card using a photograph that I had
saved from the modified version of the program Picture It Express,
which comes with the Greetings program. But if you are serious
about photos, I would suggest purchasing the full version of
Picture It or going with a different card program. This
mini-version is fun and useful but just did not do enough.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful aspect of this program is that it enables you to
reduce red eye with a click of a button. The program also allows
you to alter the color, brightness and contrast of any photo and
includes a cropping tool that cuts out a piece of the picture in
cookie-cutter shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The editing is very limited, however, so you will be most
successful if you start off with a high-quality photo.

PRIVACY SEALS FOR CHILDREN'S WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CIR-PRIVACY) 
(mk) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truste and the Better Business Bureau have created privacy seals
specifically for children's Web sites. In addition to meeting the
requirements for the regular privacy seals, the sites must not ask
children for more information than necessary or coax them into
providing data in exchange for gifts or toys.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the children's seals is a requirement that
the sites must get verifiable parental consent before obtaining
information from children under 13. Parental consent is a tricky
notion online. An eager 10-year-old, for instance, could simply
check a box that says consent is given.
</P>
<P>
   To close those loopholes, the Better Business Bureau and Truste
will give its children's seals only to Web sites that get parental
permission by fax, phone or mail, or that get credit card numbers
from parents online to verify that a parent is on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission proposed new regulations this month
that would require all commercial Web sites to get parental consent
for children under 13. Privacy advocates and developers of
children's Web sites are grappling with the question of what
technological tools would be used for that verification.

SOUND DESIGN: SMOG GETS IN YOUR EARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 BY PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzanne Ciani lives in seclusion at the end of a dirt road in
Marin County, Calif., but her most famous piece of music is heard
about 280 million times every day. In 1988, balancing commercial
work with her career as a composer, she created what may be the
world's best-known audio signature: the miniature chordal flourish
that introduces every AT&AMP;T call.
</P>
<P>
   Known within the company as the sparkle tone, that one-second
chime was the first concerted foray into sonic branding in what
might be called, with apologies to the Internet, ``phonespace.''
After that humble beginning, the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the competition, the wires are now clogged with audio
logos and announcements for new services and pay-per-use features.
If a line is busy in the Bell Atlantic calling area, for instance,
a voice will intrude for a moment to offer the company's new
call-back service. If you use AT&AMP;T to call another time zone from
your home phone, you may hear their new feature: a quick ``It's
(insert time here) where you're calling'' before the ringing
starts.
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky enough to find a working Bell Atlantic pay
phone in the New York subway, you then have to wait out an
interminable commercial greeting: ``Thank you for riding New York
Transit.'' Similar messages accost you when you make pay calls at
Marriott or Hilton hotels. And AT&AMP;T has entered what seems like
very dangerous terrain, injecting promotional messages about
discounts and frequent flier miles, at the beginning of some
overseas calls.
</P>
<P>
   All of this new line noise naturally raises the specter of
disenchanted customers. And as in the real world, the quality of
the design determines the quality of the experience. When Bell
Atlantic introduced its new information service, it came with a
bassy greeting by James Earl Jones: ``Welcome to Bell Atlantic
local and national four-one-one.'' To keep people from pulling out
their hair during the almost four seconds it took the message to
run, designers condensed it digitally by 20 percent. Jim Smith, a
Bell Atlantic spokesman, said: ``You want to brand the service, but
you don't want to annoy the customers, and you sure as heck don't
want to slow them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound designers at AT&AMP;T are also quick to point out that their
chimes and stamps won't cause delays. Because they take place
during the few seconds it still takes to connect a call, it is
really a sort of found promotional space. Brad Burns, a spokesman
for MCI Worldcom, was just as quick to claim that his company's
``seamless'' network didn't offer even that tiny window of
opportunity. ``When it comes to these types of messages,'' he said
haughtily, ``we've found that less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   David Shenk, the author of ``Data Smog: Surviving the
Information Glut'' (Harper San Francisco, 1997), sees parallels
between telephone branding and the digital overload he decried in
his book. More information, he points out, always comes at a cost:
``You have to ask, `What are we giving up?' '' But he is hopeful
that the once pristine phonescape can be reclaimed. ``Generally
speaking, the people who make this mess can be counted on to clean
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people include Jim Farber and his team of sound designers
at AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham Park, N.J. One of their current projects is
to improve the audio cues that callers encounter as they navigate
through modern communication's least loved bramble: automated
answering services. The team has recently developed a palette of 12
two-note tones _ fuller melodies, they say, flunked the focus
groups _ that could be used to identify specific ``locations'' in a
complex system. Callers will learn that each sound designates a
certain spot in the menu. ``To make it good and attractive requires
the kind of production skills that a small radio drama would,''
Farber said.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful design may be able to keep people from getting lost
in phonespace, but it is unlikely to make the commercials go away.
The future may be the Free For All Phone Club, a service that takes
on-phone advertising to its logical conclusion: free long-distance
calls in exchange for the pleasure of having your conversations
interrupted every few minutes by sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all this money about to change hands, where is Suzanne
Ciani, whose elegant chime first raised the bar for telephone audio
design? She asked herself the same thing. ``Believe me, I tried to
get a royalty,'' she said. ``All I wanted was about one-billionth
of a cent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A lone sousaphone, unamplified, was all it took to
rock the house at the Maple Leaf, a New Orleans club that was
packed at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. With the Rebirth Brass Band onstage,
the tin-ceilinged room was full of happy feet, dancing to Rebirth's
euphoric, recklessly improvisational medleys of its own rowdy
call-and-response chants and songs from Marvin Gaye and TLC. The
chunky stomp of funk was married to a rolling, sputtering
carnival-parade backbeat that's at least a century old; the band
played and sang without microphones. All the crowd cared about was
that it made them dance.
</P>
<P>
   Rebirth's set, like countless performances in and around the New
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival over the last week, wasn't a
self-conscious fusion trying to prove some thesis about musical
history. It was simply bar-band business as usual in a city where
that history is a common language, a lexicon of tunes and rhythms
and inflections that's maintained, mostly, because it feels good.
</P>
<P>
   The survival of old styles, which are cherished not as creaky
old relics but as sure things, is a homegrown musical miracle. And
while that persistence seems absolutely natural to local musicians,
it's still no more likely than finding a metropolis where men still
regularly wear hats and women have not only held on to their
flapper dresses but feel free to wear them with running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, New Orleans music is different because New Orleans
has been different. West African slaves held on to drumming
traditions with regular gatherings in Congo Square and found New
World guises for old parade traditions in Mardi Gras. Under French
and Spanish rule, and then as a major port, the city took in
cosmopolitan influences, while its natural moat _ the Mississippi
on one side, Lake Pontchartrain on the other _ isolated it from the
rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz innovators found regular work in the red-light district of
Storyville, inaugurating an enduring fondness for live music. The
city's distinctive racial history, from Creolization through Jim
Crow through integration, has also left traces. Yet New Orleans
isn't isolated anymore; like any other American city, it has cable
television and chain stores. But somehow _ through stubbornness,
through memory, through institutions like the Jazz and Heritage
Festival and through some mysterious grace _ its music hasn't
assimilated.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, musicians can make careers playing sousaphone or
clarinet; elsewhere those instruments are hardly heard outside high
school bands. In New Orleans young musicians don't feel corny
playing ``When the Saints Go Marching In'' or ``Basin Street
Blues,'' while audiences happily sing along with songs like ``Iko
Iko'' or ``I'm Walking.'' It's not nostalgia or some kind of cute
revival, because the music was never lost or forgotten. Musicians
love to swing, but they wear T-shirts not vintage suits.
</P>
<P>
   Purism doesn't appeal to Louisiana musicians. Brass bands and
zydeco bands (which arrived in New Orleans from the neighboring
Cajun and Creole bayous) not only find regular club engagements,
but freely combine the old instrumentation with tactics lifted from
rock, modern jazz and, in self-described ``brass-hop'' bands like
Coolbone and All That, from hip-hop. Lil' Band o' Gold, a band of
bayou rockers that performed at the festival and in clubs, knocks
together rockabilly guitar, country pedal steel guitar, Cajun
accordion and a rhythm-and-blues saxophone section that happened to
include Richard Landry of the Philip Glass Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Working primarily for live audiences _ instead of trying to hone
potential hits for an invisible mass public _ New Orleans musicians
survive by performing. Many musicians are members of two or three
or four groups at once, piecing together a living from club fees
and tips. The better ones work so often that they don't have to
leave town to get by. Yet even if New Orleans musicians didn't make
a virtue of necessity, they would probably pride themselves on
their versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know who's going to be on the other end of that
phone call,'' said Roger Lewis between club sets by the Dirty Dozen
Brass Band, which revolutionized brass-band music in the 1970s by
adapting be-bop tunes, funk and anything else it wanted. Lewis can
anchor the band or play dizzying swirls of modern jazz; last
Thursday and Sunday, he also punched out brawny baritone-saxophone
riffs as part of Fats Domino's horn section.
</P>
<P>
   Working in multiple contexts, New Orleans musicians recharge old
connections. As the music moves through generation after generation
and hybrid after hybrid, some features keep coming back, the way
great-grandpa's nose is still recognizable on a distant nephew. The
second-line parade beat, one of the wellsprings of 20th-century
music, turns up in gospel, jazz and rhythm-and-blues; the
instrumentation of traditional jazz bands echoes through later
styles.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night the Jazz and Heritage Festival's annual Dew
Drop Inn Revisited concert _ a tribute to New Orleans' equivalent
of the Cotton Club _ brought together four rhythm-and-blues singers
in a memorial to Johnny Adams, a hero to local singers. Big Al
Carson sounded like a trombone; Marva Wright's gospelly belting
could have come from a trumpet; Irma Thomas was an urbane alto
saxophone, and Aaron Neville had the delicacy of a clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans jazz musicians aren't too serious to dip into
traditional jazz or to sing. Kermit Ruffins, who leads one of the
city's most popular jazz groups, alternates genial trumpet solos
with homey vocals on songs like ``Ain't Misbehavin''' or his own
``Hide the Reefer.'' At club dates, he also cooks barbecue for his
fans.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that New Orleans is a tourist delight, drawing
people who want to experience the city's legendary music in its old
forms. But the city's musicians regularly give ignorant (or
drunken) audiences more nuance and passion than they necessarily
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   The virtuoso guitarist and singer Snooks Eaglin, who rarely
leaves New Orleans, honored a request for ``Happy Birthday'' when
he played late on Monday night at the Mid-City Lanes bowling alley
with a jocular, rolling treatment that harked back to the heyday of
New Orleans rhythm-and-blues. His scratchy voice sounded like a wry
reflection on getting older, with raffish personality and vivid
roots; every hip in the room was swaying.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance _ perhaps when the birthday boy leaves town _ it
could seem like a magnificent, improbable mirage. But in New
Orleans, it's just another night's work.

   PANAMA:
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   Area: 29,208 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Location: The Central American republic is located between Costa
Rica and Colombia. It is an S-shaped isthmus that joins the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
</P>
<P>
   President: Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Religion: Overwhelmingly Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Economy: Service-oriented, with most of its income derived from
the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   History: Christopher Columbus landed here in 1502. Panama was
joined to Colombia in 1821. The U.S. flag has flown in Panama since
1903, when President Theodore Roosevelt engineered Panama's
separation from Colombia so that the ``big ditch'' could be built.
The United States began building the 50-mile-long Panama Canal in
1904 and completed it in 1914. Under the Panama Canal treaties,
signed by Gen. Omar Torrijos and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter
in 1977, Panama is to take complete control of the canal and all
surrounding property by high noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Politics: Presidential elections are scheduled May 2. They pit
the son of a ruling-party strongman against the widow of the man
his father overthrew. Martin Torrijos, son of Gen. Omar Torrijos,
who signed the Panama Canal treaties along with former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, will go up against Mireya Moscoso, widow of
former President Arnulfo Arias. Omar Torrijos headed a coup in 1968
that deposed Arias 11 days after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   TWO MAIN CANDIDATES IN THE MAY 2 RACE:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Martin Torrijos, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University with degrees in political
science and economics. He served as vice minister of the interior
under President Ernesto Perez Balladares. He is the son of the late
dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mireya Moscoso, 54.
</P>
<P>
   Widow of former President Arnulfo Arias, who was overthrown by
Gen. Omar Torrijos in 1968. She has no government experience, but
made a strong showing in 1994 when she ran against the current
president, Ernesto Perez Balladares. She's known as a left-leaning
populist who has opposed many of the government's market reforms.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Even from the grave, Panama's cigar-chomping former
dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos, surely must be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos had called the U.S. presence in Panama a ``colonialist
tumor'' before negotiating the Panama Canal treaties with his
friend, former President Jimmy Carter, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Now his son, Martin Torrijos, 35, has a good shot at winning
Panama's presidential election on Sunday(5/2) and leading the
country as it takes official custody of the 50-mile-long waterway
at high noon on Dec. 31 under the terms of those treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it would be a remarkable twist of fate for the young
Torrijos to preside over the fulfillment of his father's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But his political ascension is far from being a sure thing as
several polls this week predict a neck-and-neck contest with the
leader of Panama's largest opposition party, Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, both candidates have played up their
famous relations more than their stands on domestic issues such as
jobs and education.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Torrijos headed a military coup that deposed former
President Arnulfo Arias 11 days after he took office in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful general remained in power until he died in a 1981
airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Moscoso is the widow of Arias, a famous three-time
president and the country's most popular civilian politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin is obviously getting a lift from Omar's continued
popularity,'' said Robert Pastor, a Latin America expert at
Atlanta's Emory University who helped negotiate the Panama Canal
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Running third in Sunday's race is Alberto Vallarino, chief
executive of one of Panama's leading banks. A political newcomer,
he lacks the big party support of the two leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Although Omar Torrijos has been criticized for ushering in 21
years of military rule, he still has a massive following of ardent
supporters who praise him for providing housing and employment for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the former strongman is viewed as a national hero by
many of his countrymen for negotiating the return of the Panama
Canal, which for decades had been a Yankee thorn in the side of
Panama's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos was a mere 14 years old when the canal treaties
were negotiated, and was 18 when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University with degrees
in economics and political science, and his first job was slinging
hamburgers at a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed to oversee a kinder, gentler government that's in
touch with the needs of all segments of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found him to be very intelligent and very charismatic,
just like his father was,'' said Ambler Moss, former U.S.
ambassador to Panama. ``I think he'd be a good leader and represent
continuity in the U.S.-Panama relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, 54, is a left-leaning populist who has opposed many of
the government's economic reforms -- including privatizations of
state-owned businesses -- worrying some business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But she is a tireless campaigner who made a surprisingly strong
showing in the 1994 election, when she was narrowly defeated by
President Ernesto Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has seen with her own eyes the poverty that neo-liberal
economic policies have brought to Panama,'' said Guillermo Endara,
a former president who supports Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
   Panama struggles with widespread poverty and a high unemployment
rate of 12.8 percent, despite $100 million in profits annually from
canal tolls and another $300 million derived from the U.S. military
presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Besides blasting his economic policies, Moscoso and other
critics have often accused Balladares, as well as his party, the
Democratic Revolutionary Party, of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   That party, founded by Omar Torrijos, today supports Martin
Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the criticism has hurt Martin Torrijos, who has
served the last four years as a deputy minister in the Balladares
administration, which is also viewed by many in Panama as being
riddled with nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, voters expressed their dissatisfaction with
Balladares by overwhelmingly defeating a referendum to change the
constitution allowing Balladares to run for a second consecutive
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, since neither of the two leading candidates has a lot
of government experience under their belts, it's the names of their
well-known relations they often invoke when stumping for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Torrijos' campaign headquarters is blanketed with posters
of his father, and even his campaign's theme song is an
enthusiastic tribute to the former dictator entitled ``Omar
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, who dresses casually and is praised for her ``common
touch,'' leads a party that's named for her late husband -- the
Arnulfista Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor insists that Martin Torrijos has a certain charisma
all his own.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that he defeated two opponents with the same
famous last name in last year's presidential primary: his
half-brother, Omar Torrijos Jr., and his cousin, Hugo Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the charisma in the world, Martin Torrijos
faces a major challenge if elected: He must ensure the canal runs
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, critics in the United States have expressed
misgivings that a small country of only 2.8 million people with no
military can successfully manage one of the world's most important
transportation lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think there will be mismanagement of the canal,''
said John Sweeney, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government will be tempted to milk the canal for
resources because the economy will take a big hit when the U.S.
military leaves,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the U.S. troops will cost Panama's economy some $300
million a year, or up to 15 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian government officials say they will more than make up
for that, though, with an expected boom in tourism and new
business.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates promise to run the canal professionally and
to maintain good relations with the United States following the
canal's transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very symbolic if Martin Torrijos wins and oversees
the canal's return, but it will also be a challenge for whoever
wins,'' said Jennifer McCoy, director of the Atlanta-based Carter
Center's Latin America and Caribbean Program. ``All eyes are going
to be on Panama as it takes over the canal.''

FLYING TOASTERS THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was a technological problem: computers
would burn permanent patterns onto their screens if they were left
on. Like most technological problems, this was solved.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: an ingenious piece of software we call the screen
saver. After a specified number of minutes, the desktop would
disappear and voila: tropical fish, mesmerizing geometric patterns,
colorful bouncing balls, fireworks and flying toasters.
</P>
<P>
   After a number of years, the problem went away. Low-emission
monitors have been in widespread use since the mid-'90s. We haven't
needed screen savers for years. But they persist, despite their
obsolescence, because we enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who uses a computer has experienced that moment when
the screen saver turns itself on and you don't resume typing. You
don't reach for the mouse. You just sit there for a minute,
glassy-eyed, exhausted and brain-fried, staring at the screen,
contemplating ... flying toasters. The meditation of cubicle
existence:
</P>
<P>
   The flying toasters
</P>
<P>
   Migrating to better jobs
</P>
<P>
   This memo is late
</P>
<P>
   It's appropriate somehow that these familiar images should find
their way into other forms of procrastination that foster the same
serene, zoned-out state of mind. To wit: After Dark Games, a candy
box of games and puzzles starring characters who have traipsed
across our screens for years: Hula Girl, Mowing Man, the tropical
fish and yes, the flying toasters.
</P>
<P>
   These are not complicated games. There are no hidden doors.
There are no secret combination moves. It's just solitaire, or
jumbles of alphabet letters (tattooed on the fish), or trivia
questions, or vest-pocket Pac-Man variations, or matching and
memory games, or puzzles, all of which take less than 10 minutes.
They're miniature experiences, simple to pick up and put down.
</P>
<P>
   But these vest-pocket video games are, in their own way, as
engaging and addictive as the mega-selling 40-hour sagas with
souped-up 3-D sound and state-of-the-art computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their appeal is sheer simplicity. Word puzzles are not a
high-octane mental experience. So it's easy to relax. It's just a
hand of solitaire, and there is always another. No pressure.
</P>
<P>
   You take deeper breaths. Your heart rate slows down. You blink
less. And pretty soon you're in a complete state of flow, immersed
in a pursuit whose only purpose and consequence is to bring about
this very state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   For nonsmokers, an easy puzzle is the closest you can get to
having a cigarette. It's like doodling while you talk on the
telephone. Like scribbling hatch marks on scratch paper, it's a way
of slowing time. It puts a damper on the cacophony. It fosters a
sense of privacy. If you're playing solitaire, the mental office
door is closed.
</P>
<P>
   That's why people spend so much time with the Macintosh logo
puzzle or Windows Solitaire. It's not that the games are so
exciting, it's that they're not. They function as mild mental
sedatives, just as action games function as mental stimulants. Kids
like action games because they're looking for all the stimulation
they can get their hands on. Seeking stimulation is a child's job
in life.
</P>
<P>
   But in a workplace suffused with politics and deadlines and
other people's demands, adults are not looking for more
stimulation. They're looking for stress relief. And a low-key
computer game is a cheap and convenient way to cool out.
</P>
<P>
   Screen saver images are doubly appropriate in this context _
their animation sequences have been looping as visual Muzak for
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   They're recognizable. Like great advertising icons, they are
bold, two-dimensional graphics that don't relate to the images
around them. They float freely in their own visual context. They're
memorable, but we don't have any specific memories attached to
them.
</P>
<P>
   They're familiar, and yet our relationship to them is entirely
superficial. They skip lightly from a passive experience to an
interactive experience and back into non-interactivity (if you stop
playing After Dark Games, the anthology itself becomes a screen
saver, looping through animated snippets of different games in
auto-play mode).
</P>
<P>
   Screen saver images translate seamlessly from one medium to
another because they have no narrative baggage. And when we watch
them, or play with them, neither do we. So they never look out of
place.
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder, as screens proliferate in all shapes and
sizes, whether the flying toasters will follow suit. It's entirely
possible that in 10 years, we'll be watching flying toasters on
wireless toasters as we wait for the bread to pop. If we had
tropical fish to entertain us during downloads, we wouldn't find
the World Wide Web so itchy and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need screen savers for our computer monitors anymore.
We need screen savers for our brains, to keep us from glaring at
incomplete information, to keep us from becoming needlessly
agitated. To keep us from burning in.
</P>
<P>
   Where technology is concerned, a little Zen never hurts.

IN CASE THINGS GO VERY WRONG, A PARACHUTE FOR THE PLANE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It works for pilots and passengers, so why not for whole
airplanes? Next month, a company in Duluth, Minn., plans to market
a single-engine plane with a parachute for the plane itself.
</P>
<P>
   The SR-20, from the Cirrus Design Corp., is one of only two new
American designs for single-engine private planes approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration in the past 15 years and will be
the first plane to have a parachute as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The parachute is stowed on the roof; when an occupant pulls an
overhead handle, the parachute is deployed by a rocket that shoots
toward the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good you are as a pilot,'' said Chris L. Maddy,
a spokesman for the company, ``there are some circumstances, like a
midair collision, or where the pilot becomes incapacitated, or
you're flying over the woods of northern Minnesota at night and you
can't see the runway to land, and you're going to pull the chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Parachutes have already been included in ultralights and hang
gliders. The company that builds parachutes for Cirrus, Ballistic
Recovery Systems of St. Paul, Minn., also designed one as an add-on
for two small Cessnas, but they did not catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy said his company had orders for 272 planes, which cost
$165,000 to $175,000 each _ $10,000 of that for the parachute. But
an owner might recoup some of that cost if insurance companies see
a reduction in claims as a result of the parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The parachute attaches at the plane's center of gravity and thus
can hold it level and give it a steady rate of descent, but using
the parachute would still be an act of desperation. The plane is
likely to be damaged beyond repair by the impact, the company said,
but the occupants will be able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a bumpy ride and not going to be any fun,''
Maddy said, ``but you're going to walk away from it, most likely.''
The extent of injuries could also depend on whether the plane came
down in a flat spot or in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parachute is a dramatic feature, the airplane, one
of the few models developed after microchips became commonplace,
also makes heavy use of computers. The cockpit is equipped with
full-color flat-panel computer displays, something found only on
newer jets. These show the function of various aircraft systems and
navigation information, incorporating data from the Global
Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has several other innovations intended to make it
simpler to fly. One is a lever that adjusts both the throttle and
the angle at which the propeller blades dig into the air. On most
planes those controls are separate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cirrus has not had smooth sailing. The first one off the
production line crashed on March 23, killing the pilot, Maj. Scott
Anderson of the Minnesota Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who had 1,000 hours of experience in F-16s, may have
had control problems. The accident is still under investigation by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Anderson was flying did not have a parachute, which
was not available when it was built.

HANDING OVER THE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, May 6)  
(mk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We just sold our house in Florida, an unassuming ranch on a
woodsy lot in Plant City that my husband and I moved into when I
was six months pregnant with our first baby.
</P>
<P>
   Since our family has lived in our new home in suburban Atlanta
for nearly eight months, I was relieved that we now have only one
mortgage payment and one place to hang our hats.
</P>
<P>
   But my first question, since we did the closing long distance,
was to ask my husband, ``So, do they have any children?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Jim, who is often puzzled when
information is requested that is neither relevant nor essential to
the transaction at hand. ``Does it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I'm of the ``everything matters, if only in some
tangential, ephemeral, metaphysical way'' school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of COURSE it matters,'' I say. ``You didn't ASK?''
</P>
<P>
   So I called the realtor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, do you know if the couple who's buying our house has
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, no, I don't, I didn't think to ask,'' she said, blowing
my theory that all women would consider this not only interesting,
but also vital information. ``I can find out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, great. And I'd like to know how many and how old they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, sure,'' she said, sounding increasingly hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, Adam, our 8-year-old, would like to write a letter to
their kids, if they're old enough, to tell them some cool stuff
about the house and the woods and the neighborhood and school,
stuff like that,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   But, in all honesty, this was only part of my reason for asking.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, I wanted to know more about these people who would be
moving into the place we called home for close to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Were they bibliophiles who would appreciate our built-in,
floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in the fireplace room?
</P>
<P>
   Would they understand the magic of the huge, wooden ``Gate to
Adventure'' in the back yard that Jim had built for Adam when he
was 4 and could go exploring in the woods?
</P>
<P>
   Did they have young kids who could clamber over the swingset we
left because its feet were buried in concrete so it wouldn't shake?
</P>
<P>
   Can these newcomers sense the memories contained inside those
block walls?
</P>
<P>
   The first night home with our son, when he lay blindfolded in an
ultraviolet light box, too sleepy from the jaundice to cry, and we
put up a sign that said, ``Adam's tanning salon.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Sarah's arrival, with much fanfare, when her older brother
gladly moved from the pale yellow nursery to his ``big boy room''
filled with dinosaur posters and Star Wars figurines.
</P>
<P>
   So much of our life played out in those six rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Our realtor told us not to worry about attending the closing,
that all the papers could be mailed up to us and we could overnight
them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do most people believe that they have to fly back for the
closing, then?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, just tradition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But I think I know.
</P>
<P>
   They want to pass on the home with a handshake. Show them where
the sprinklers turn on. Mention the great produce stand just up the
road. And size up their replacements.

   Back Button On the Blink?
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I was surfing the Web, I noticed that the Back button on
my browser was ``grayed out,'' and when I closed that window, I saw
that several more windows were open underneath. Is something wrong
with my software?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing is wrong with your browser _ it's just doing what it
is told by the HTML code in some of the Web pages you have been
looking at. As you click on a link you wish to see, the new window
may seem to be replacing the previous one, but in fact, the new
window is opening right on top of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   So why are some pages encoded with instructions to open a new
browser window on top of your first one? Usually it is because the
Web page you have just looked at wants to keep you there, even
while showing you a page from a link it has. Many online merchants
use this tactic, which can be helpful if you just want to take a
quick look at a product and then click on the main page to return
to it. The Back button on the second window is grayed out because
the browser considers it a new window and thinks there is no place
to go back to.
</P>
<P>
   On some pages, however, the extra windows can be highly
annoying, especially the smaller pop-up windows that are there to
display only advertising. If you've had enough of the
interruptions, check your favorite shareware archive for a browser
utility that can help filter out Web page excesses, like the
freeware program called Pop Off, at www.davecentral.com/7670.html.
Or try the $20 program at www.intermute.com that promises to help
stop the popping.

&HT;    _ AUTHENTIC ETHNIC FARE, VIA THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 
ARLINGTON, Texas: $3 drink.'' 
 &HT;    Noe has been on the money with his read of consumer habits for
more than a decade. In 1998, 108 million Americans, or 47 percent
of the population, drank espresso, cappuccino, latte or a cold
coffee drink during the year. In 1997, it was 35 percent.
 &HT;    Hazelnut creme was a speciality coffee when Noe opened in the
1980s. Today, that flavor is one of 7-Eleven's regular offerings.
 &HT;    But it's not just the product that is appealing to consumers. It
appears that coffeehouses may become THE meeting places in the next
decade.
 &HT;    ``Coffee bars have become friendly places to hang out,'' Noe
says. ``We'll sometimes have 10 people at one of our big tables
going over blueprints. At a coffee bar, you can tie up a table for
an hour or two and no one will get upset. You do that in a
restaurant and you're expected to buy a meal. We even get families
in here who in another time would have been meeting over the dinner
table.''
 &HT;    Noe does not expect to see the coffee craze die. The only thing
he sees cooling off in the future is the temperature of the coffee.
 &HT;    ``Ten years ago we couldn't give away iced or frozen coffee
drinks,'' Noe says. ``Today those drinks are a very important part
of our overall business. Even people who don't drink coffee like
frozen drinks like our Eskimocha.''
 &HT;    And those iced and frozen drinks will further fuel the growth of
the coffee market.
 &HT;    ``When it's 140 degrees outside, that African heat, people are
going to skip their afternoon coffee,'' Noe says. ``But they will
buy an iced coffee drink.''By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ

   SOUTHLAKE, Texas _ Scarcely two months since opening her
business, Inga Bowyer suspects she may have struck gold. And the
thing is, her idea is both brilliant and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Bowyer, a Southlake resident who spent much of her formative
years in Germany, has opened an online German grocery store. Anyone
lusting for a package of teewurst, Bavarian potato dumplings or
sauerbraten gravy just has to log onto www.GermanDeli.com.
</P>
<P>
   She and her sister, Gina Green, knew there were thousands of
military brats like themselves who hungered for the rich foods of
their childhood. Deciding to forsake their event
management/promotion business, they put their energy and resources
into their passion _ German food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at what wasn't being served and decided it was just
too hard to drive to this deli and that one and not find the foods
we wanted,'' Bowyer says. ``So we set up shop on the Internet, and
people are finding us in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Once their site was carried by larger search engines like
Yahoo!, the e-mail inquiries began flooding in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Germans who came to the United States for
their jobs, and they're looking for ingredients, for instance, for
baking,'' Bowyer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll find the mixes they want, or the ready-made tart
bottoms, and then they'll discover the `brat herings' (pickled,
fried herrings) and `blutwurst' (blood sausage), too.''
</P>
<P>
   One customer in Cuba called the GermanDeli.com toll-free number
and offered to trade cigars for German sausages, but Bowyer decided
to steer clear of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Customers going to the GermanDeli.com site find a home page
simply decorated with the yellow, red and black colors of the
German flag. Down the left margin are more than two dozen
selections, ranging from baking aids, dairy, chocolates and
liverwurst to pates, soups and teas. Want a jar of Lowensenf hot
mustard? A large one is $3.49. How about a half-pound package of
``greisinger schinkenspeck'' (paper-thin sliced, smoked pork leg)?
That's $7.49.
</P>
<P>
   GermanDeli.com shoppers can even click on ``U.S. Military
Brats'' and order T-shirts or ``greeting cards,'' and add pretty
cards written in German for birthdays, Mother's Day, weddings and
anniversaries to their virtual shopping carts.
</P>
<P>
   Bowyer _ noting that ``Germans love convenience'' _ says most
customers order online, using the secure system. Orders are shipped
within hours, Bowyer says, and the perishable items are shipped in
ice packs for one- or two-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there's just a staff of two, working out of a small
Southlake office that has a storage room with food-laden shelves,
refrigerators and freezers. Bowyer says they want to grow slowly,
adding staff and opening a warehouse as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many pages we want to add to the site, featuring
old photos of Germany, for instance,'' Bowyer says. ``The objective
is to become the largest Internet German food store in the U.S.''

 &HT;    It's no longer your grandmother's grocery list.
 &HT;    As the century ends, we're just as likely to find our meals via
fax, computer or telephone. And nourishment is no longer simply
meat and two vegetables. We want exotic food, we want premium
coffee, we want convenience. And we don't want the hassle of
trekking through football-field-size supermarkets.
 &HT;    Three entrepreneurs are hearing your needs and jumping into the
fray. One is cooking up premium meals to go and delivering them to
where harried mothers and fathers congregate: preschools. Another
is pampering us with gourmet java. And a third is offering Old
World food in a new world venue: the Internet.
 &HT;    _ AFTERSCHOOL SPECIALS PARENTS WILL LOVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It never fails. The air conditioning has
gone out in the car, the traffic leaving work in north Dallas is
awful, and Junior awaits chauffeur service.
</P>
<P>
   And when you finally make it to the preschool, what are the Next
Generation's words of greeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's for dinner, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   If Mom is lucky, Junior's preschool is on one of the routes
serviced by Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   This nascent home-meal replacement operation, based in Fort
Worth, cooks meals like Mom would make if Mom had the time. But
instead of delivering the meals individually, a la Domino's, the
firm delivers weekly to each of 49 preschools.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the brainchild of Fred Kirby, the former
president of Mrs. Crockett's Kitchens, a refrigerated-food
manufacturer that makes all the refrigerated potato salad sold at
Sam's and the potato salad served nationwide at KFC.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, Kirby's food is more eatZi's than
McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the kind of food you'd make at home if you only
had the time,'' says Kirby. ``When we came up with this idea, we
wanted to have high-quality food with real convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   And convenient it is. Easy Street provides each of the
preschools with a menu for the month. One week's offerings may
include beef burgundy with noodles, chicken con queso, chicken
piccata, and spaghetti and meatballs. As parents sign their child
in for school, they also see the month's Easy Street options.
</P>
<P>
   The order forms are faxed to Easy Street, along with the
parents' names, and the food is delivered to the schools for
pickup. It's one-stop shopping _ pick up dinner and your child at
the same time. A traditional family meal around the kitchen table
is just a microwave away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the selections feed a family of four and range from
green beans and new potatoes with herb butter for $5 to a 2-pound
chuck roast with mashed potatoes for $14. Some of the items are
definitely targeted toward children (cheeseburger macaroni is $5,
macaroni and cheese is $4), while others are more adult
(herb-crusted pork roast sauced with apricots and a hint of
habanero peppers is $10).
</P>
<P>
   In business since January, Easy Street is selling about 1,000
entrees a week. Kirby expects that amount to quadruple within the
next few months. He's also working on deals to open kiosks in
downtown office buildings so workers can pick up dinner to go as
they head for their cars and home.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's convenient.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Easy Street on the Internet at
www.easystreetfoods.com or phone it at (817) 232-3563.

   _ COFFEEHOUSE CHAIN KNOWS VALUE OF TURNING DAILY GRIND INTO A
TREAT &QL; 
By BEVERLY BUNDY &QC; 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ If there were a contest to name the
definitive food of the 1990s, a lot of votes would have to go to
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry figures, there were fewer than 500
coffeehouses in 1991. In 1998, there were nearly 7,000. By 2000,
there could be almost 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Don Noe was doing coffee before coffee was cool. Or iced or
frozen, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, before Starbucks became the Sears of the java world,
Noe opened the Coffee Haus in Arlington's Lincoln Square. Noe
morphed that hill of roasted beans into an empire, including
locations in Sundance Square and one near Southern Methodist
University in Dallas. Tack that on to six locations at Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport and we're talking about a perking enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And for every coffeehouse, there appears to be a different sort
of customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened,'' says Noe, ``I thought the profile of our
customers was predominantly female, middle-aged, white-collar,
probably a Junior Leaguer. But, guess what, the profile is
incredibly broad. We're just as likely to have someone drive up in
a beaten-up Chevrolet and run in to buy a pound of kona for $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee is a luxury that everyone can afford. You might not
have the money to buy a new yacht, but you can drink great coffee
at home. It's a very affordable way to pamper yourself,'' Noe says.
``Or you can give yourself a perk, no pun intended, with a $3
drink.''

THE TEACHER AND THE PULITZER: READ IT AND WEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 602nd-bestselling book among the 2 million offered by
Internet bookstore Amazon.com is currently out of stock; anyone who
wants to buy Margaret Edson's ``Wit'' is warned it will take up to
five weeks to get one.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Faber and Faber, publishers of the $12 paperback,
printed only a few thousand copies. Play scripts recycled as books
never sell particularly well, and, until the middle of April,
``Wit'' was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pulitzer Prize for drama changed that; so did subsequent
media coverage of Edson, a 37-year-old Atlanta kindergarten teacher
who never wrote a play before ``Wit'' and who insists she isn't
going to write one after it, either. She got word of her Pulitzer
win while cleaning up her classroom after a messy lecture on bugs;
after ordering a pizza to celebrate, she went back to working on
lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   But it required a unique playwright to craft a unique play.
Currently running at New York's Union Square Theatre, in a low-rent
area politely termed ``off-Broadway,'' ``Wit'' is a fascinating
study of one woman's confrontation with terminal illness. College
professor Vivian Bearing, 50, is dying of ovarian cancer. Her
doctor has asked her to undertake excruciating chemotherapy
treatments which, though they won't save her life, might offer some
informative results to shape future treatment of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intention to give away the plot,'' Vivian informs
the audience soon after the curtain rises. ``But I think I die at
the end.'' She does, in horrible pain. Though ``Wit'' offers its
share of laughter, there are a lot more tears. Vivian, whose chief
accomplishment in life has been writing a series of books about the
works of John Donne, can't wisecrack her way past death _ but she
tries.
</P>
<P>
   Before its Pulitzer laurels, ``Wit'' struggled. Edson wrote the
play in 1991 after a stint volunteering as a hospital clerk/social
worker. Her play received the same attention most plays by unknown
authors get: No theater company was interested in producing it.
Finally, in 1995, South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa,
Calif., brought Vivian from the printed page to the boards. The
national theater community took gradual notice. By 1997, ``Wit''
was being produced in Connecticut. From there, it moved to
``off-off Broadway,'' and finally just ``off,'' a designation
meaning any theater within walking distance of the Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   New York critics loved ``Wit'' so much that a few weeks before
the Pulitzer announcements, Playbill magazine's Web site was
describing ``Wit'' as ``certainly a front-runner, if not a foregone
conclusion for the award.'' Even after its big moment, ``Wit''
retains its modest dimensions; tickets are available at Union
Square Theatre, priced from $20 to $49.50. A few blocks away on
Broadway, it costs $80 to see ``The Lion King'' and $100 to enjoy
Kevin Spacey in Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who can't get to New York will have to settle for reading
the script; Faber and Faber's skinny paperback is just 80 pages.
Scripts, of course, are written to be heard rather than read.
Italicized stage directions detract from the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book/script is undeniably moving. Without other written
work for use in comparison, it's impossible to tell whether Edson
is a word wizard in the traditional sense. There are no long
descriptive passages to showcase her skills with adjectives and
adverbs. What is very clear from ``Wit,'' however, is the
playwright's rock-solid sense of dialogue. Her characters talk like
real people, especially a hospital resident who once took Vivian's
college class and hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived Bearing's course,'' he tells a nurse. ``No problem.
Heh. Yeah, John Donne, those metaphysical poets, that metaphysical
wit. Hardest poetry in the English department. Like to see ``them''
try biochemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far too early to tell if ``Wit'' will become one of those
rare theatrical icons like ``Death of a Salesman'' or ``The
Mousetrap,'' to name two that apparently will be produced forever
and ever. Edson is currently getting as much attention as her play;
if she changes her mind and writes a second script, it will be hard
to top her first.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Wit'' will be enough all by itself; clumsy as scripts are
when published as books, this one still made me cry a little. I
suspect it will have the same effect on just about everyone else.
It's so sad, but it's so ``good.''

 &HT;    At Monticello, the delicious ironies of America's first foodie
come to life
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey Illustrations by Walter Cumming

<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ When Thomas Jefferson returned from Paris
after five years as envoy, his fellow Virginian Patrick Henry
scoffed that he was ``so Frenchified that he abjured his native
victuals.'' Though more than two centuries have passed, the
Jeffersons haven't forgotten the slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Henry,'' says the man with the long strawberry locks
and fair, freckled complexion. ``I believe he liked to go out in
the woods and eat bear meat.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would ever accuse Rob Coles of abjuring his native
victuals. A fifth great-grandson of Jefferson, through his daughter
Martha, the 47-year-old actor grew up eating hot dogs and prefers
Brunswick stew and corn bread to fancy Continental cooking. Like
his famous forebear, whom he impersonates in 150 appearances a
year, Coles eats his vegetables. But there are limits to his
enthusiasm. ``Jefferson grew 16 varieties of peas,'' he says. ``I
love peas, but, I mean, come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson is many things to many people: president,
author of the Declaration of Independence, architect, naturalist,
farmer, slaveholder. To anyone who loves food and wine, he is
another kind of founding father as well. He was America's first
great gourmet. ``I want to improve the tastes of my countrymen,''
he wrote. (Had he envisioned weiner-scarfing progeny, he might have
added, ``All palates are not created equal.'')
</P>
<P>
   In food as in other matters, Jefferson poses contradictions. As
epicurious as he was, he apparently did not cook. Though he was a
tireless champion of the New World, he fell for French cuisine as
hard as any tourist sipping wine for the first time at a sidewalk
cafe on the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The ironies take shape at Monticello, the neoclassical mansion
he built atop a small mountain on the edge of Virginia's Blue Ridge
country. Everyone who visits these days wants to hear about Sally
Hemings, the comely slave who is said to have been Jefferson's
concubine. Guides openly discuss the relationship and the latest
DNA evidence, which very nearly proves the old rumor that she bore
children by her widowed master. But tourists rarely ask about
another Hemings, Sally's brother James, who toiled in the service
of another Jeffersonian passion. He was a cook.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson took James Hemings along to Paris and instructed him
to learn everything he could about French cooking. They returned to
Virginia with a wealth of European delights: vanilla, almonds,
pomegranates, Lombardy rice, a Dutch waffle iron, an Italian pasta
maker, a French ice cream churn. Some had never before been seen in
America. One of Jefferson's dinner guests mistook a strange new
dish for a pie made of shallots; he'd never encountered macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   Two meals a day were served at Monticello: breakfast at 9 and
dinner at 4, followed by wine. Unfortunately, no menus survive, and
the only known cookbook _ including eight recipes in Jefferson's
hand _ is frustratingly incomplete. Much of what is known about his
gastronomical explorations comes from the garden journal he kept
for six decades, recording the 170 fruits and 250 vegetables from
both sides of the Atlantic that he planted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an Ellis Island for immigrant plants,'' says Peter
J. Hatch, the bushy-haired director of gardens and grounds at
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson clearly cherished his vegetables. He stored seeds in a
cabinet in his study, with his precious books. And he secured the
garden, a long terrace carved into the side of the mountain, with a
wooden fence and locked gate.
</P>
<P>
   On the slope below the garden, Jefferson cultivated a fruit
orchard and two vineyards where he attempted, with little success,
to transplant grapes from France and Italy. The vineyards are
flourishing today and until recently were pressed for wine. There
was just one problem: Monticello doesn't have a license to produce
commercial quantities of alcoholic beverage, and state authorities
got wind of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us pour out 700 bottles like it was moonshine,''
Hatch laments.
</P>
<P>
   According to slave accounts, Jefferson himself would get his
hands dirty working the garden. There is no evidence, however, that
he ever shelled peas, chopped carrots or otherwise prepared his
food. The kitchen was for ``servants,'' as he euphemistically
called slaves, and his design for Monticello kept most of their
scullery work out of sight. The kitchen, smokehouse and wine cellar
are located beneath promenades that flank the main house and are
joined below it by a tunnel. Bottles were lifted by dumbwaiter from
the subterranean quarters into the dining room, and food was
delivered through a revolving door with shelves that allowed
service with a minimum of interruption. Jefferson didn't like
servants hanging around while he conversed with guests; he thought
it fed gossip.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, the private foundation that runs
Monticello has undertaken an oral history project to record the
stories of the plantation's slave descendants. Cooks have figured
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson freed James Hemings on the condition that he train
someone else to become chef. Out on his own, Hemings traveled
widely and took a job cooking at a Baltimore tavern. He died a
young man in 1801.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appears to have committed suicide,'' says Lucia Stanton,
Monticello's senior research historian. ``We think he had a
drinking problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemings trained his younger brother Peter as his replacement. He
was joined in the kitchen by Edith Fossett, who went to the White
House with Jefferson and returned to Monticello after he retired.
She was still there when he died on July 4, 1826, and was sold,
along with eight of her children, at an estate auction.
</P>
<P>
   There's a happier postscript. The Fossetts eventually purchased
their freedom and moved west to Cincinnati, where they assisted
runaway slaves on the Underground Railroad. One of those eight
children, Peter Fossett, became a caterer and minister who helped
found the black Baptist church in Ohio. Many years later, on his
85th birthday, his congregation asked him if there was any gift he
longed for. There was; he wanted to visit Monticello. Despite
everything, he still regarded it as home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 100 descendants of Jefferson's slaves
gathered for a reunion at Monticello. There was no dinner on the
grounds; they had to go off-site to a restaurant for lunch. The
only foods to be had at Monticello these days are gift shop snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, on Jefferson's 256th birthday, Monticello observed
the occasion with the usual wreath-laying ceremony at his grave
under a shady grove on the side of the mountain. The real
celebration took place that night down the road at the Clifton Inn,
a 1790s house that once belonged to Jefferson's son-in-law. Chef
Rachel Greenberg prepared a five-course Jeffersonian feast with
paired Virginia wines that had one couple blithely singing ``happy
birthday, dear Thomas'' over dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner, there was a surprise. ``Ladies and gentlemen,''
Greenberg announced, ``I give you Thomas Jefferson.'' And in walked
his kinsman Coles, looking as bright as a spring morning with his
red hair, white ruffled shirt and green frock coat with gold
piping.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's soliloquy included an anecdote that could have come
from the papers of Jerry Clower. Jefferson recalls a boyhood meal
for eight at which nine pork chops were served. Everyone had a pork
chop, leaving one in the middle of the table. No one dared take it;
they all begged off, saying they were full. Just then, the candles
flickered and young Thomas reached for the chop and felt the
stabbing of eight forks.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote didn't taste right. Jefferson always told people
that he ate meat sparingly, usually as a condiment to flavor
vegetables. He doesn't seem a pork chop kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Coles readily confessed. ``My great uncle used to tell that
story. It never happened to Jefferson. I just like to tell it. I'd
rather be entertaining than authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia ham, this Jefferson.

`PHYSICS IN THE 20TH CENTURY': AN ART BOOK, WITH THE DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with grasping modern physics is that in the quantum
world, objects have properties for which there are no physical
counterparts that you can see. And as knowledge of both the
microcosm and the macrocosm has advanced, cosmology has become
inseparable from particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   One understands and accepts this, especially after too many
fruitless attempts to get a grip on quantum physics and the theory
of relativity through metaphor. All the same, when a lushly
illustrated, oversize book like Curt Suplee's ``Physics in the 20th
Century'' comes along _ an art book about physics, really _ you
can't help being attracted and thinking that this has just got to
make things clearer.
</P>
<P>
   At first you are disappointed, maybe inevitably. The text is
lucid enough. A longtime science writer and editor at The
Washington Post, Suplee is practiced at making the abstract appear
concrete. Beginning with the atom, logically enough, he explains
how various turn-of-the-century scientists discovered the electron.
</P>
<P>
   But among the first illustrations is a photo captioned ``the
device built and used by Robert Millikan in 1913 to determine the
electrical charge of the electron.'' This tells you absolutely
nothing other than that the man was not compulsively neat. What the
picture shows might as well be a workbench full of the parts of a
disassembled lawn mower, with fog coming from somewhere. It could
measure the charge of an electron? So what?
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem with many of the volume's early photographs.
They depict machines like a particle detector, a synchrotron (for
accelerating particles) and a molecular beam system that allows
atoms and molecules to be studied individually. But aside from
showing you how impressively large and stunningly complicated these
contraptions are, they tell you little.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the text proceeds, you notice a faintly
disconcerting pattern. As each new discovery is explained, the
discussion ends with some practical application of the concept.
Thus, ``the critical insight . . . that particles have an intrinsic
`spin''' leads to an account of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   And Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect
eventually produces ``the photocell sensors that turn lights on at
night or open doors automatically,'' as well as the charge-coupled
device, or CCD, the basis for television cameras, home camcorders
and highly sensitive astronomical recording devices.
</P>
<P>
   Now all these are unquestionably invaluable inventions. What's
more, their introduction into the discussion lends useful
concreteness to a dauntingly abstract subject. Still, you sometimes
get a sense that the whole point of 20th-century physics was not
simply to extend the frontiers of knowledge but, like Du Pont in
the old commercial, to produce better things for better living
through chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these mild drawbacks, ``Physics in the 20th
Century'' turns out to be worth reading. The illustrations improve.
One photo illustrating how the transistor revolutionized
electronics shows the near roomful of pretransistor wired
components that would be replaced by a single Texas Instruments
hand-held calculator. Others show the microdevices built with what
is known as nanotechnology, because their scale reaches into the
billionths of meters. Still others present the fantastic colored
images of materials revealed by a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) and the eerie otherworldly forms seen with the Hubble Space
Telescope. Some of these photos are breathtaking in their beauty.
</P>
<P>
   And for all its practical bent, Suplee's text makes a lot of
difficult abstract ideas a little clearer, particularly
superconductivity, chaos theory and Einstein's theory of special
relativity. Explaining the latter, he writes that, ``for example, a
sound wave traveling at 1,000 feet per second toward an observer
who is approaching at 500 feet per second has a speed of 1,500 feet
per second relative to the observer.'' How could light behave
differently?
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Einstein's leap of insight explained how it
could. He postulated that the speed of light is always the same to
any observer in any reference frame. The price to be paid for this
constancy is that space and time _ the two factors that determine
speed _ turn out to be relative to the way the observer is moving.
. . . Thus, if your friend were to take off in an accelerating
rocket, and you could somehow watch as she approached the speed of
light, you would see two odd things happen. A clock moving with her
would appear to slow down, and she and the objects around her would
shrink in her direction of motion. (Also, her mass would approach
infinity as she neared light speed _ a speed that is unattainable
for any object that has mass.)''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of accounts of this idea I've read before, none
have seemed quite so clear and succinct.
</P>
<P>
   Of course no visual image is offered to illustrate the point. In
relatively few cases do the pictures elaborate the text, with the
possible exceptions of the colored bands of different wavelengths
that make up the spectrum and various computer-generated images of
subatomic events.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all in all the contiguity of text and illustrations seems to
have the intended effect. Although the difficult concepts of modern
physics can't be visualized, the presence of so many pictures
somehow helps you to see both the microcosm and the macrocosm a
little more distinctly.

   NEW YORK _ Turning certain plays from French into English is
like dragging vampires into the sunlight. They shriek, they curdle,
they shrivel, while shedding the elegant, arrogant authority they
display in their natural element. There is in particular a French
brand of theatrical whimsy, extensively practiced around the middle
of this century, that usually turns into dust in the mouths of
American actors, however capable.
</P>
<P>
   Such a metamorphosis can be witnessed firsthand at the Belasco
Theater, where the Lincoln Center production of Jean Anouilh's
``Ring Round the Moon'' (``L'Invitation au Chateau'') opened last
night. This 1947 play, the story of one perversely enchanted
evening of a grand ball, is an uneasy example of those Gallic
fantasias, equal parts preciousness and cynicism, in which Anouilh
specialized. It is the sort of work that makes you say, if you're
feeling charitable, ``Oh, those worldly, romantic French.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of the new revival isn't that it doesn't come off,
but that anyone thought it might in the first place. When the work
was first seen in New York in 1950, after a widely praised
production by the young Peter Brook in London, its title had an
explanatory appendage: ``a charade with music,'' not words to
inspire confidence in Broadway theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Atkinson, while finding much to like about the play in
his review in The New York Times, also wrote, ``It gives an
impression of being enervated at the source.'' The production
closed after 69 performances and has seldom been seen on these
shores since.
</P>
<P>
   The current incarnation, directed by Gerald Gutierrez, uses the
original and still creditable adaptation by Christopher Fry, the
eminent British playwright and a natural soul mate to Anouilh and
Giraudoux. Fry gave Anouilh's sententious declarations on the
mysteries of love and life a Wildean ring, and the play's presiding
grande dame (played here by Marian Seldes) can indeed come across
as a worldlier version of Lady Bracknell.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Characters aren't all that fixed in ``Ring Round
the Moon,'' and Anouilh lets the wind of allegory and fancy blow
them where it will. To work, the whole enterprise has to register
as a sustained magician's illusion, a trick of the light. The
straightforward, farcical approach brought to bear on this latest
interpretation, which features opulent but too, too solid sets and
costumes by John Lee Beatty and John David Ridge respectively,
suggests someone stepping on a soap bubble in hobnailed boots.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the winter garden of a chateau in the spring of 1912,
``Ring Round the Moon'' has only a trifle of a plot, but what there
is defies easy summary. At its center is a patrician pair of
identical twins (both played by the dapper English actor Toby
Stephens). One, Frederic, is sweet and innocent, while the other,
Hugo, is sour and devious.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic is engaged to the rich and ravishing Diana (Haviland
Morris), who really loves Hugo, who in turn decides to save his
brother from a loveless marriage by smuggling Isabelle, a poor but
honest young ballet dancer (Gretchen Egolf), into the party given
by his aristocratic aunt, Mme. Desmermortes (Ms. Seldes). . . . Oh,
never mind.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing you need to know is that ``Ring,'' like much of
Anouilh's work, pits the forces of innocence, embodied by a girl of
great purity, against those of an iniquitous and sophisticated
society. However, unlike similarly themed Anouilh works
(``Antigone,'' ``The Rehearsal''), this one lets love triumph,
though not before introducing some chilly currents of sadism and
social oppression, including a bizarre premonition of the Holocaust
to come.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Ring'' is, by the standards of American
theater, neither fish nor fowl, and its ambiguities seem to have
stymied Gutierrez, who was so good at bringing out the complexities
of ``The Heiress'' and elucidating those of Edward Albee's
``Delicate Balance.'' As one often felt with his production of
``Ivanov'' recently, Gutierrez seems to have given up on achieving
an all-embracing tone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has given his greatest attention to self-contained
broadly comic sequences, like a leadenly erotic tango between two
illicit lovers played by Candy Buckley and Derek Smith. Mostly the
actors, who include such worthy performers as Frances Conroy, Joyce
Van Patten, Fritz Weaver and Simon Jones, have been left to find
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conroy, who at least seems to be enjoying herself, provides
a few smile-making sparks as Capulat, the romanticizing spinster
companion to Mme. Desmermortes. Jones, as the ballerina's stuffy,
nervous patron, brings a naturalistic centeredness to his role,
which definitely puts him in a minority. And Ms. Van Patten, as
Isabelle's absurdly affected mother, appears to be channeling
Shelly Winters, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense here.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, a rising star in London, cuts an undeniable swath
through the evening, and you always know which twin he is supposed
to be. But the actor, who brings to mind a Hugh Grant without
humor, is so intensely mannered here that he starts to seem
grotesque in ways more appropriate to the M.C. role in ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle is one of those roles that was made for the young
Audrey Hepburn or Claire Bloom, or possibly Julie Harris, who did
well by Anouilh in the 1950's. (Ms. Bloom in fact created the role
in London.) The character must positively shimmer with profound,
otherworldly simplicity, or else the play has no center. And Ms.
Egolf, while she has a swan-necked look that does recall Hepburn,
is also very obviously of this world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seldes, who was originally to play Mme. Desmermortes only at
matinee performances, assumed her role full time after Irene Worth
suffered a stroke. (Ms. Worth is expected to return to the part.)
She plays her imperious character with an augerlike sharpness and a
surprising restraint, and the show's funniest moments come when she
is barking orders about the manipulation of her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Ms. Seldes is perfectly comfortable delivering arch
epigrams about the ways of the upper crust, she exasperatedly
switches on the automatic pilot when her character turns into a
benevolent, Olympian matchmaker at the play's end. Who can blame
her? An air of uncertainty pervades the production. Even the
ethereal, spell-casting music of Francis Poulenc seems to wander in
at random.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Ring'' was first seen on Broadway, Atkinson wrote that
there was ``something incomplete'' about the play, as though its
author ``only half believes in it.'' Nearly half a century later,
no one in this production has come close to finding the faith to
make ``Ring Round the Moon'' whole.

CHINA BANS FILMMAKER FOR ELUDING CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese authorities have banned actress
Joan Chen from working in the country because she directed a film
in a remote rural area that was shot without official permission.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl,'' was filmed last year
in western China, where Ms. Chen was able to evade close scrutiny
from local officials. Although the movie's political content is
relatively mild, Ms. Chen, who grew up in China and has built a
substantial Hollywood career, irritated government officials by
sidestepping their regulations, making a film that was later
acclaimed in Taiwan and then speaking openly about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used abominable means to deceive the government,'' said
Zhou Jiandong, a senior official of the country's Film Bureau.
``She knows what she did was illegal, so she was deliberately
violating regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu'' is a tale of youthful innocence lost to corrupt men
whose currency is sex. Xiu Xiu (pronounced `show show') is a
teen-age girl who is sent to a mountainous backwater in the 1960s,
when the fanatical politics of the Cultural Revolution forced
millions of urban residents to relocate to the countryside with
tragic results.
</P>
<P>
   The film, Ms. Chen's first effort as a director, is scheduled to
open in New York on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   China's Film Bureau requires every filmmaker who wants to shoot
a movie here to submit a script for approval, follow changes that
are requested and screen the finished product to officials before
the film can be shown publicly. No deviation from this path is
ordinarily allowed, and if an unauthorized film attracts attention,
it will probably incur government wrath.
</P>
<P>
   As punishment, Zhou said, the Film Bureau issued an official
document in March that banned Ms. Chen indefinitely from any film
or television work in China and fined her $50,000. Such a black
mark is also likely to discourage Chinese movie theaters and
television stations from showing earlier films starring Ms. Chen.
The actress is best known for her roles as the principal wife of Pu
Yi, the last emperor of China, in the 1987 film ``The Last
Emperor''; Jocelyn Packard in David Lynch's early '90s television
series ``Twin Peaks,'' and a young Vietnamese peasant in Oliver
Stone's 1993 film ``Heaven and Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Zhou said simply, ``All imported films have to
apply for a license.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou denounced ``Xiu Xiu'' as a film that ``traces the dark side
of life, does not conform with history and has a negative effect on
the socialist system and the reputation of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen, who immigrated to the United States in 1981 and lives
in San Francisco, had planned to act in a film in Shanghai this
spring, but withdrew from that project in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a price,'' Ms. Chen said. ``I don't regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, based on the novel ``Tian Yu'' by Yan Gelin, a
Chinese-born woman living in the United States, attracted only mild
attention from officials at China's Film Bureau after it was first
screened, at the Berlin Film Festival in February 1998. But the
officials were irritated when ``Xiu Xiu'' won seven of Taiwan's
Golden Horse awards in December.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou, who took part in an investigation of Ms. Chen's case, said
the authorities were particularly angered when Taiwan newspapers
reported that she had evaded regulations and improperly used a
license that had been granted for shooting another director's
television drama.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen said she had apologized to the Film Bureau for evading
the regulations but that she had been determined to shoot her film
regardless of the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applied the normal way,'' said Ms. Chen, 38. ``But they
wanted me to make revisions to the script and I didn't want to. If
they had revisions that would make it a better movie, fine. But I
wasn't going to make revisions that made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen said officials had requested that sexual and
pessimistic scenes be removed from the film, which would have
seriously altered the result.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese directors have made films underground. Yet
distributing such a film within China is virtually impossible, so
filmmakers who have shot without permission often negotiate a
solution with the Film Bureau that involves a measure of groveling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen chose to appeal to the international market with an
uncensored version of her film even though that prevents her from
releasing it in China. Yet movies are commonly pirated in China,
and Ms. Chen's film has been widely available on China's video
market since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   During six weeks of shooting on location, Ms. Chen said, she
smuggled film out of China almost every day because she feared that
the authorities might confiscate all of it if they discovered what
she was doing. That prevented her from watching playbacks, and
often meant hurried filming that left her movie with a rough,
seam-showing edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A first-time director, without seeing the dailies, it was
crazy,'' Ms. Chen said. ``Every day that was a fear, that they
would find us and take away the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with a crew of 60, Ms. Chen ventured into western
Sichuan province, mostly populated by Tibetans, and acted as though
she had full permission. Local officials, thrilled to play host to
such a celebrity, did not challenge her papers.
</P>
<P>
   A local official accompanied the crew at all times, so Ms. Chen
sometimes split the crew in two, sending half, with the official,
to shoot something innocuous while the other half secretly shot a
more sensitive scene undetected. Ms. Chen filmed additional scenes
at a movie studio in Shanghai, working at night to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars two previously unknown actors: 17-year-old Lu Lu
as Xiu Xiu, and Lopsang, who uses only one name as many Tibetans
do, as the Tibetan herder whom Xiu Xiu joins in his rural hut in
the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen calls her film a love story, though it is clearly more.
She said she chose to direct ``Xiu Xiu'' because it reflects the
time she grew up, although she was not ``sent down'' to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was 9 or 10, it was what we all talked about,
how to keep out of getting `sent down,''' said Ms. Chen, the
daughter of two doctors who was reared in Shanghai. ``My parents
talked about it all the time. We were obsessed by it. I always
heard stories, with horror but also with some fascination, about
people who went to the countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen's experience may highlight the sometimes arbitrary
nature of China's system of censorship and control over filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   She said she regretted that the local officials where the movie
was shot would probably be criticized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' she said. ``I don't think anything serious will
happen to them, but I wasn't straight with them.'' As for her crew
members, mostly Chinese, she believes none were punished.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou said that local officials had been punished, but he was not
specific. Because they did not collude with Ms. Chen and did not
know that she was filming without permission, it is unlikely that
they received more than a perfunctory reprimand.

 &HT;    SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMMON IN MOVIES AND MUSIC, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug agencies reported Wednesday that the nation's
teens are being exposed to high levels of drug and substance use in
movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   In 200 popular movies and 1,000 popular songs from 1996 and
1997, investigators found that 98 percent of the movies and 27
percent of the songs contained references to use of tobacco,
alcohol, illegal drugs or medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first to precisely quantify such references, was
conducted by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

   ``The entertainment media can have an enormous impact on
society, and the findings show that drug references and messages
are part of our children's lives,'' said Nelba Chavez,
administrator of the substance abuse agency.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on how often movies and songs depicted the use
of illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and over-the-counter and
prescription medicines. The study looked at what substances were
used, who used them, how often the substances were used or
mentioned and the consequences of the use.
</P>
<P>
   Persons age 12 to 20 make up 26 percent of movie admissions, and
63 percent of children ages 9 to 17 watch at least one rented video
per week. The music industry estimates that teens listen to music
an average of four to five hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   According to the drug policy office, use of illicit drugs among
10th graders has doubled since 1992, to 23.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no clear evidence that entertainment content is
linked to drug use, ``our children's rate of exposure to substance
use has increased,'' said Barry McCaffrey, director of the office.
</P>
<P>
   The study of the entertainment industry found that alcohol was
depicted in 93 percent of the movies studied, tobacco was shown in
89 percent, and illicit drugs in 22 percent. The study also showed
that consequences of substance use were portrayed in only 49
percent of the movies studied.
</P>
<P>
   In movies rated G, the study found, tobacco use was depicted in
79 percent and alcohol use in 76 percent. No G- or PG-rated movies
showed illicit drug use. Of PG-13 movies, tobacco was depicted in
82 percent, alcohol use in 97 percent, and illicit drugs in 17
percent. In R-rated selections, tobacco use was found in 92
percent, alcohol use in 94 percent, and illicit drug use in 20
percent. Only five movies out of the 200 studied depicted no
substance use.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Roberts, a professor of communication at Stanford
University and a researcher for the study, noted that ``with the
exception of hard drugs, there was no difference between the rated
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that illicit drug use was depicted in 18
percent of dramas, in 13 percent of the comedies, and only in 10
percent of the action adventure movies.
</P>
<P>
   In musical lyrics, the study showed, 17 percent referred to
alcohol use, 3 percent to tobacco use, and 18 percent to illicit
drugs. Only 19 percent of song lyrics depicted the consequences of
substance use.
</P>
<P>
   Among various musical genres, rap music most often referred to
substance use. Illicit drugs were mentioned in 63 percent of rap
songs and alcohol use in 47 percent. Country and Western music had
the lowest levels, with illicit drug use mentioned in 1 percent of
the songs and alcohol use in 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some good news to report,'' said McCaffrey. ``The
entertainment industry is already working on a variety of fronts,
with government and private organizations to develop
solution-orientated initiatives and programs with more accurate
messages and images.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said government and private agencies have met with
groups in the film industry and the music industry to discuss some
changes. Some of the suggestions offered by McCaffrey and others
were to stop portraying drug use humorously, to show realistic
consequences of substance use and to remember that drug use is
abnormal.

manager's office. Yeah, a Red Sox T-shirt. OK, so he's with the

slugged 30 homers and drove in 112 runs as Boston's regular third
baseman in 1977 _ and an even longer way from the glory days when
he was Bear Bryant's quarterback at Alabama. But that's how it goes

   FBC-AUBURN _ AUBURN, Ala. _Tommy Tuberville's first spring as
Auburn's head coach has not been an easy one. The former Ole Miss
coach has pushed his players through the most physically-demanding
period they have ever experienced. Tuberville has admitted to
friends that he pushed Auburn's players to find out how many of
them really wanted to stay in the program. It's the kind of
discipline that will be necessary, said Tuberville, if Auburn wants
to get back in the hunt for the SEC's Western Division anytime
soon. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   HORSE RACING
</P>
<P>
   RAC-BISHER-DERBY _ On the 100th birthday of the Kentucky Derby,
23 horses were allowed to squeeze into the starting gate. Anybody
who owned anything with four legs that could whinny wanted to get
his animal on the track. Ten horses spilled over into the betting
field _ that's for those commoners not considered threat enough to
have their own betting slot _ and one of them finished second. It
was more a stampede than a race, and amazing that through all that
traffic a favorite named Cannonade was able to find a way to the
finish line first. Not since the Kentucky Racing Commission limited
the starting slots to 20 has there been a cast more befuddling than
the one going into the gate this weekend. (Bisher, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-ARCHDEACON-DERBY _ LOUISVILLE _ Akiko Gothard is most
colorful trainer at the Kentucky Derby. She's a grandmotherly
68-year-old Japanese woman who is the trainer for K One King. Only
eight other women in 125 years of the Kentucky Derby have trained a
Derby horse. None have won. Gothard was born in Tokyo during the
war. Her neighnorhood was bombed. She eventually earned a degree in
English literature, married a U.S. serviceman and moved to
Kentucky. She earned a masters in Psychology at the University of
Kentucky and later served as an interpretor for Japanese horse
buyers who came to Kentucky to buy race horses. In 1976 she bought
yearling John Henry for $1,100. She sold him, but the horse went on
to win $6.6 million. Four years ago she began to train horses.

disintegrate. (Stoda, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FBC-AUBURN _ AUBURN, Ala. _Tommy Tuberville's first spring as
Auburn's head coach has not been an easy one. The former Ole Miss
coach has pushed his players through the most physically-demanding
period they have ever experienced. Tuberville has admitted to
friends that he pushed Auburn's players to find out how many of
them really wanted to stay in the program. It's the kind of
discipline that will be necessary, said Tuberville, if Auburn wants
to get back in the hunt for the SEC's Western Division anytime
soon. (Barnhart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   HORSE RACING
</P>
<P>
   RAC-BISHER-DERBY _ On the 100th birthday of the Kentucky Derby,
23 horses were allowed to squeeze into the starting gate. Anybody
who owned anything with four legs that could whinny wanted to get
his animal on the track. Ten horses spilled over into the betting
field _ that's for those commoners not considered threat enough to
have their own betting slot _ and one of them finished second. It
was more a stampede than a race, and amazing that through all that
traffic a favorite named Cannonade was able to find a way to the
finish line first. Not since the Kentucky Racing Commission limited
the starting slots to 20 has there been a cast more befuddling than
the one going into the gate this weekend. (Bisher, Atlanta

   RAC-ARCHDEACON-DERBY _ LOUISVILLE _ Akiko Gothard is most
colorful trainer at the Kentucky Derby. She's a grandmotherly
68-year-old Japanese woman who is the trainer for K One King. Only
eight other women in 125 years of the Kentucky Derby have trained a
Derby horse. None have won. Gothard was born in Tokyo during the
war. Her neighnorhood was bombed. She eventually earned a degree in
English literature, married a U.S. serviceman and moved to
Kentucky. She earned a masters in Psychology at the University of
Kentucky and later served as an interpretor for Japanese horse
buyers who came to Kentucky to buy race horses. In 1976 she bought
yearling John Henry for $1,100. She sold him, but the horse went on
to win $6.6 million. Four years ago she began to train horses.

MAKING BOOK: NOT BY ITS COVER, BUT BY ITS TITLE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you walked into a bookstore and saw the title ``Trimalchio in
West Egg'' would you be seduced into grabbing it off the shelf? How
about ``The High-Bouncing Lover''? Perhaps a bit more alluring and
at least fathomable. Or ``Gold-Hatted Gatsby.'' Closer maybe, but
it doesn't sing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after much anguish, it became ``The Great Gatsby.'' But
according to a book about book titles, ``Now All We Need Is a
Title'' (W.W. Norton) by Andre Bernard, Fitzgerald was still
lamenting after ``Gatsby'' was published that he had allowed
himself to be talked out of ``Trimalchio'' (borrowed from
Petronius' ``Cena Trimalchionis,'' a satire about a man of newly
acquired wealth and his vulgar displays of it).
</P>
<P>
   The example shows that of all the tyrannical problems that go
into writing a book, often the one that most hectors the author is
contriving the fitting title. How important is the title anyhow? It
is certainly a consequential part of the sales and marketing
package required to publish a book successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Graham, editor in chief of Scribner, said, ``I'm perfectly
capable of buying a book because it has a great title.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that really ups the stake beyond marketing. Still, there is
no formula for that great title that will reach out from the
bookstalls and bewitch the browser. Generally a title for a
nonfiction book should be as clear as the tapping of a fingernail
on a table top. ``The Majors'' (Little, Brown), the title of John
Feinstein's best seller on golf's four major tournaments, says it
all, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But fiction, particularly literary fiction, has no rules that
anyone adheres to. Sometimes poetry alone carries the day. What,
for instance, does ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' (Harcourt Brace, by
David Guterson) mean or ``Cold Mountain'' (Atlantic Monthly Press,
by Charles Frazier)? Nothing really. There's a poetry and an
atmosphere about the first and a starkness about the second that's
rather like a punch in the stomach. Both titles evoked a certain
classiness, and both books were huge best sellers, though neither
title indicated much of what was going on between the book's
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Bewildering titles. How about ``An Instance of the Fingerpost''
(Riverhead), Iain Pears' murder mystery set in the 17th century? It
too was a best seller. Hindsight or great creative gamble? Julie
Grau, co-editorial director of Riverhead, said that the title was
``so odd and mysterious that we thought it actually was a selling
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if people didn't get it all, they got enough of it,'' she
said. ``It was part of the intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calculated risk. The idea is to get a title that piques
interest, whether it's ironic, alluringly mysterious, funny, or
musical. After it works, you're a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't, it's a quick journey to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon &AMP; Schuster's trade division,
said ``the title should be memorable and descriptive. As sharp as a
headline; as direct as possible, with as few words as possible. It
can mean the difference between a book being reviewed and bought
and a book you're going to find on the remainder table.'' Still,
who knows if a book failed because its title didn't allow it a
chance? Did the title send the wrong signal? Was it too sad, too
vague?
</P>
<P>
   The naming of a book is often a collaborative effort, starting
with the author but including the editor, the publisher and the
agent. The ``sales rep'' _ that is, the person who must sell the
book to the bookstores _ at times has a say. Unhappy sales reps
make for authors' bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Newburg, a literary agent, said that even writers of
``commercial books gravitate toward literary titles. But the best
title is one in which you know exactly what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cited ``Difficult Conversations: How to
Discuss What Matters Most,'' saying: ``When the book was being
sold, all the publishers involved not only loved the proposal, but
the title also and that made it so much easier to sell. The sales
rep going into the store with 30 books liked this one.'' (Ms.
Newburg sold the book, by Douglas F. Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila
Heen, to Viking.)
</P>
<P>
   Generally there is no copyright on a title, so books can have
very similar titles _ something no one wants _ and when there is a
dispute over a title the author usually prevails, particularly with
literary fiction. As Ms. Graham said: ``You can't publish a book
with a title the author doesn't like. You can't start making the
author miserable with this _ there are too many other opportunities
for the author to be made miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal says he tries to use ``gentle persuasion'' to get a
title change, ``but if that fails you bring in the marketing person
who tells the author, `Everything's great about the book but the
title, and that will cost you 20,000 copies.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough and precarious business tampering with an author's
title. Many writers look upon the titling of their book as they do
the naming of a child. The title defines the book for its life and,
unlike a child's name, cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lemann (``The Fiery Pantheon,'' Scribner), who is now
working on her fifth novel, ``Malaise,'' said that she settles on a
title right from the beginning. ``It sets the tone for the book
from the start, so it is important for me to have the title in my
head.'' She said she gets feedback from her editor and her agent
and from some friends because ``in the title lies the whole point
of the book; it wraps up the mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other authors look upon titles differently. E.L.
Doctorow, for instance, has what he calls ``working titles. They
usually get used up during the course of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that these temporary titles give his work ``a propulsive
capacity. They supply little bursts of inspiration and excitement.
They exhaust themselves and are replaced by others. The last one is
the one that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctorow will deliver a new novel to Random House in June, but
he declined to reveal its last driving force.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hamlet, Prince of Denmark' is really a lousy title, so I
don't speculate anymore on titles,'' Doctorow said.
</P>
<P>
   But let us speculate. What if their covers read, ``Prejudice and
Pride,'' ``Sensibility and Sense,'' ``Peace and War.'' Would they
be as well read this way as vice versa?

`IN SEARCH OF KUNDUN WITH MARTIN SCORSESE': PROFILING THE DALAI
LAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm not one for causes unless it's film preservation,'' Martin
Scorsese observes dryly near the end of Michael Henry Wilson's
documentary film, ``In Search of Kundun With Martin Scorsese.''
Then he hesitantly adds: ``But compassion and love are the only way
to go. The other way is violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The director's remarks illustrate the degree to which the making
of ``Kundun,'' his empathetic biography of the early life of the
14th Dalai Lama, was a labor of devotion and perhaps a kind of
atonement for some of the more brutal imagery in movies like ``Mean
Streets'' and ``Goodfellas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Search of Kundun'' is a valuable and informative footnote
to ``Kundun,'' a visually enthralling film of few words and many
magnificent images conveying the color, mood and spirit of Tibetan
Buddhism. The documentary clarifies the aim of Scorsese's film,
which was not to be a historical epic but to try to capture the
Dalai Lama's spirit of kindness and nonviolence in the face of his
exile and the continuing destruction of Tibetan culture by the
Chinese absorption of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, which includes interviews with several of the
creative participants in the earlier film (notably missing is
composer Philip Glass), reveals the nuts and bolts of a project
that was filmed in Morocco on some of the same locations Scorsese
used for ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' with matte background
drawings of the Himalayas evoking the mountainous terrain.
Interspersed with scenes of Scorsese at work are comments by the
Dalai Lama, filmed at his residence in India, and by several
Tibetan cast members.
</P>
<P>
   The film is unapologetically puffy, both in its portrait of the
director as a twinkly avuncular presence on the set and in its
portrait of the Dalai Lama as a kind of living saint. Speaking the
film's final words, the Dalai Lama expresses his wish that people
embrace ``humanity rather than my nation or our nation.'' Yes, but.

TROPICANA PRODUCTS TASTE TESTERS; NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MATTHEW SAUER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ So they've made the juice, now what do they
do?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Tropicana Products Inc., they bring in a bunch of
people to taste it.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Tropicana recruited its first panel of tasters
from outside the company. Before that, the juice producer ran
various blends and new products by its employees. That contribution
proved too taxing on some employees with other duties, so Tropicana
reached out to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Through newspaper advertising and canvassing area events, the
company found nearly 80 applicants who were then put through a
screening process. The company, which is based in Bradenton, was
interested in how well applicants could taste things, how well they
communicated and how much time they had available.
</P>
<P>
   The company ended up with a group of 13 women and two men who
come in about four times a week and taste juice for two hours at a
time. The pay is modest _ one panelist said he uses the cash to
take his wife out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Most have become adept at identifying particular flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Stafford, 61, a retired high school social studies teacher
from Cooperstown, N.Y., has learned to taste for different
attributes on different parts of his tongue: sweetness with the tip
and sourness with the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, whose wife works for Tropicana, said his confidence in
his tasting abilities has grown over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have self-doubt as I try to apply the standards. I think
everyone in the group does,'' Stafford said. ``You debate a lot
with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   All but one member of the group live in Bradenton and, not
surprisingly for a retirement area, most are over 50. The age of
the tasters was originally thought to be problematic because older
people tend to have reduced senses of smell and taste, but testing
proved that most members of the group have average or
better-than-average tasting capabilities, said Jennifer DiCicco,
the sensory scientist in charge of the tasting panel.
</P>
<P>
   Over two months, panel members got more than 80 hours of
training on how to be tasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them couldn't believe that it could take 80 hours of
training,'' DiCicco said. ``But really, 80 hours isn't enough
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasters identify 21 attributes of juice _ such as sweetness,
bitterness or a cooked taste _ and make observations on a scaled
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to teach them how to taste analytically and describe
the flavors in a uniform manner,'' DiCicco said. ``We needed to
make sure they all are using the same words.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasters are not sampling juices to make sure a batch
produced in Tropicana's mammoth plant meets quality standards. That
is accomplished by a separate quality control division.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists taste new blends and formulations such as
Tropicana Pure Premium Tropical Orange, the company's
vitamin-enriched products and Tropicana Twister. The batches are
generally produced at a ``pilot plant'' in Tropicana's technical
center, where juice can be formulated and mixed in small batches
without affecting overall production.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the taste testers sample ``Brand X,'' meaning
Coca-Cola Co.-owned Minute Maid, the No. 2 juice company behind
Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the panel's work coincides with larger samplings
performed by the company in national tastings. But ``the taste
panel can break it down further'' than the national studies,
DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a jury, Tropicana wants impartial and objective
reporting from each member of the panel. ``We wanted people that
were outgoing but not overbearing where they started influencing
other members of the group,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no give-and-take between panelists as they taste.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists taste about a dozen 3-ounce samples over two hours. So
the most any particular panelist consumes would be 36 ounces of
juice _ the equivalent of more than four 8-ounce glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Some panelists choose to spit out the juice after a tasting,
much like a wine taster.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists file into a tasting area in half-hour sessions. The
individual juice cups are labeled with numbers. The tasters enter
their findings in a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour of tasting, panelists take a 30-minute break,
during which they may cleanse their palates with unsalted crackers
and water.
</P>
<P>
   That's similar to what wine tasters do when they seek to keep
their palates sensitive to the more than 98 attributes of wine,
including one called ``wet dog,'' said Kristine Nickel, a Tropicana
spokeswoman and wine connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   Before they come in at either 9:30 or 10 a.m. for a tasting
session, panelists are asked not to use colognes or brush their
teeth an hour before they arrive. Smoking, which deadens taste, is
not an issue because smokers were eliminated from the initial
applicants.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   So far, 35 inches of snow have fallen in Flagstaff, Ariz.,
during April, which is about 25 inches above normal for the month.
The snowy trend will continue at Flagstaff and the adjacent
mountains of northern Arizona and Nevada on Thursday as a sluggish
low pressure system and its associated cool pocket of air aloft
traverse the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a strong pressure difference between the Nevada low
and high pressure over the eastern Pacific will promote gusty winds
over much of the West on Thursday. Indeed, winds will exceed 30
miles an hour in many locations across California and Oregon. At
the same time, strengthening breezes from the southeast will
transport moist air northward though the western Plains and Front
Range of the Rockies, setting the stage for numerous showers and
isolated thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The ascending air currents associated with a jet stream
disturbance will cause a cold area of rain to fall over the
southern Appalachians and Southeast coast Thursday. Daytime
temperatures will average more than 20 degrees below normal beneath
the thick cloud cover and precipitation. Brisk winds from the east
will add to the day's chill. Farther south, Florida will remain
partly sunny and humid with isolated thunderstorms erupting in the
sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A large high pressure system over Ontario, Canada, will promote
dry and sunny weather over the Great Lakes and Northeast on
Thursday. An exception will be over eastern New England where moist
air spiraling westward around low pressure near Nova Scotia
produces scattered clouds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Breaking Away
</P>
<P>
   Huge chunks of ice threatened to break away from the shores of
northeastern Alaska on Thursday. This potentially dangerous
situation was caused by strong and persistent winds from the east
associated with the clockwise circulation of air around a high
pressure system building into northwestern Alaska. Such ``polar
easterlies'' are a common feature of the system of winds that blow
over high latitudes. These winds owe their existence to recurrent
high pressure systems that form over the Arctic in response to
heavy cold air near the earth's surface and the weighty convergence
of air overhead. &QL;

 &HT;    ARTS AND HUMANITIES FUNDING FINDS MORE PATRONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peace broke out Wednesday in the culture wars of
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting amiably with the folksy new chairmen of the
national endowments of the arts and humanities, Republican members
of a key House subcommittee seemed willing to not only continue
funding the agencies but to also boost their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all be encouraged by the progress that has obviously
been made,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., at a hearing of the
Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, conservative critics have sought to abolish the
National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the
Humanities. The agencies were haunted politically by their support
for a handful of controversial projects and attacked by legislators
philosophically opposed to taxpayers funding the arts and
humanities. In their third decade of existence, the agencies' very
survival has been at stake in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Clinton has diffused much of the opposition
with his appointments of two folklorists from the heartland to head
the agencies, which critics long contended were elitist and out of
touch with mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   William Ivey, former director of the Country Music Foundation in
Nashville, has been chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts
for 11 months. William Ferris, former director of the Center for
the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, was
named chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The ``two Bills'' were warmly received by the subcommittee that
has the initial review of their requested budget increases from
about $100 million apiece this year to $150 million for each agency
in fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that we have unfairly cut their agencies back
and they need to have some growth,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks,
D-Wash. A budget increase ``is overdue for the two endowments,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivey and Ferris said the endowments' programs have
suffered since their budgets were cut by over a third in 1996 and
kept at about that same level since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of that reduction, the (humanities) endowment was
forced to close down many of its core grant programs, lay off a
quarter of its employees and downsize many of the agency's
functions,'' Ferris testified.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts has
made dramatic changes, said Ivey. Grants are more equitably
distributed among the states. Grants to individual artists have
been largely stopped. Seasonal support and subgrants were also
eliminated to give the National Endowment for the Arts control of
exactly what performances and artists the agency funded.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he hoped to move the agency ``to a place of strong
bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policies -- and budget cuts -- have resulted in the
average National Endowment for the Arts grant decreasing from
around $59,000 three years ago to about $28,000 this year, Ivey
said.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having to defend their budget requests against a
hostile panel, the chairmen on Wednesday fielded softball questions
and engaged in conversations about Studs Terkel, blues music, cable
TV's History Channel and the need for a museum about First Ladies
-- a project of the wife of subcommittee chairman Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp even offered advice on how he wanted to be lobbied. ``I'd
rather hear from a dobro player or a quiltmaker than from a
Hollywood star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the new era of good feelings, though, Congress is
restrained by spending caps, Regula cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen said they have contingency plans for continuing
flat budgets or smaller increases than they have requested.

 &HT;    ARTS AND HUMANITIES FUNDING FINDS MORE PATRONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peace broke out Wednesday in the culture wars of
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting amiably with the folksy new chairmen of the
national endowments of the arts and humanities, Republican members
of a key House subcommittee seemed willing to not only continue
funding the agencies but to also boost their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all be encouraged by the progress that has obviously
been made,'' said Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., at a hearing of the
Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, conservative critics have sought to abolish the
National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the
Humanities. The agencies were haunted politically by their support
for a handful of controversial projects and attacked by legislators
philosophically opposed to taxpayers funding the arts and
humanities. In their third decade of existence, the agencies' very
survival has been at stake in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Clinton has diffused much of the opposition
with his appointments of two folklorists from the heartland to head
the agencies, which critics long contended were elitist and out of
touch with mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   William Ivey, former director of the Country Music Foundation in
Nashville, has been chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts
for 11 months. William Ferris, former director of the Center for
the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, was
named chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The ``two Bills'' were warmly received by the subcommittee that
has the initial review of their requested budget increases from
about $100 million apiece this year to $150 million for each agency
in fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that we have unfairly cut their agencies back
and they need to have some growth,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks,
D-Wash. A budget increase ``is overdue for the two endowments,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivey and Ferris said the endowments' programs have
suffered since their budgets were cut by over a third in 1996 and
kept at about that same level since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of that reduction, the (humanities) endowment was
forced to close down many of its core grant programs, lay off a
quarter of its employees and downsize many of the agency's
functions,'' Ferris testified.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Congress, the National Endowment for the Arts has
made dramatic changes, said Ivey. Grants are more equitably
distributed among the states. Grants to individual artists have
been largely stopped. Seasonal support and subgrants were also
eliminated to give the National Endowment for the Arts control of
exactly what performances and artists the agency funded.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he hoped to move the agency ``to a place of strong
bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policies -- and budget cuts -- have resulted in the
average National Endowment for the Arts grant decreasing from
around $59,000 three years ago to about $28,000 this year, Ivey
said.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having to defend their budget requests against a
hostile panel, the chairmen on Wednesday fielded softball questions
and engaged in conversations about Studs Terkel, blues music, cable
TV's History Channel and the need for a museum about First Ladies
-- a project of the wife of subcommittee chairman Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp even offered advice on how he wanted to be lobbied. ``I'd
rather hear from a dobro player or a quiltmaker than from a
Hollywood star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the new era of good feelings, though, Congress is
restrained by spending caps, Regula cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen said they have contingency plans for continuing
flat budgets or smaller increases than they have requested.

 &HT;    Town meeting called on Colorado tragedy
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN's Jeff Greenfield was on vacation when the shots rang out in
Columbine High School, but he was far from removed. He's the single
father of a 16-year-old son, David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really relieved when I went in to see how he was doing
and he was playing the new Major League Baseball (computer) game,''
Greenfield says. ``I think any parent is aware. My son is not the
sort who wanders around in black dressed as a Goth, (but) I'm more
conscious of what he's up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, CNN's senior analyst, will moderate a 90-minute town
meeting tonight in Champaign-Urbana, Ill. He was chosen not because
he has an adolescent son, but because he's CNN's go-to guy in
situations like this, a pundit who can think on his feet and avoids
easy answers. Champaign-Urbana was chosen not only because it's
home to the University of Illinois (the alma mater of CNN-U.S.
President Richard Kaplan), but because it was not Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine has been done,'' Greenfield says. ``Champaign-Urbana
is not a place where anything has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he says, was to get away from the specifics of
Columbine and to get away from the parade of experts who have been
all over television in the last 10 days. Instead, the town meeting
will focus on teenagers and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 10 days since it happened,'' Greenfield says. ``Now that
there's a certain amount of calm, let's see if we can just talk
with some adolescents and hear what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're talking about a broader kind of conversation.
Anybody who's been through adolescence knows it can be a tough
time. Maybe some parents can share with us if they managed to break
through that distance that, particularly, young boys establish with
their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The town meeting will feature teen-on-teen interviews from CNN's
Student Bureau, a recent venture by CNN that allows promising young
people to learn reporting. (Little usually ends up on CNN, but it
does happen.)
</P>
<P>
   While the 90-minute show won't be completely expert-free,
Greenfield says, ``the idea is to get away from the usual
suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening After Littleton''
</P>
<P>
   7:30 tonight on CNN

OBUCHI PREPARES FOR U.S. VISIT THAT WILL INCLUDE POLITICS AND
BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi prepared Wednesday for a
meeting with President Clinton, working on his economic policy and
on his pitching arm.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, who is to leave on Thursday for the first official visit
by a Japanese prime minister to the United States in 12 years, is
expected to throw out the first ball at a Cubs game at Wrigley
Field in Chicago on Saturday. So Obuchi, 61, who said he last threw
a pitch about 50 years ago, spent part of the afternoon in his
backyard with a baseball glove and a former pro pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really worried whether the ball will reach home plate or
not,'' Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the practice session, which Obuchi good-naturedly
allowed reporters to watch, he has good form but not much
consistency. All in all, he seems to have a strong chance of
getting the ball to home plate _ at least by the third bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Other prime ministers have made working trips to Washington, but
this is a more formal official visit and includes stays in Los
Angeles on Thursday night and in Chicago on Friday and Saturday
nights. Then Obuchi is to travel to Washington for talks on Monday
with President Clinton and a White House dinner that evening.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time of relative harmony in American-Japanese
relations, and officials say the main purpose of the summit meeting
is to reaffirm and strengthen the relationship rather than to
resolve any particular disputes. But the backdrop will be Japan's
faltering economy and American insistence that Japan do more to
revive it.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven major industrial nations issued a communique
on Monday calling on Japan to ``implement stimulus measures until
growth is restored, using all available tools.'' But in a meeting
Wednesday with American reporters, Obuchi did not seem to take the
hint; he suggested that Japan has already taken enough action for
now and needs to allow time for results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've adopted numerous measures,'' he said, pointing to
various economic legislation passed in the last year. ``I trust
that favorable effects will emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically whether Japan would consider a supplementary
budget to provide a stronger fiscal stimulus if current steps
proved inadequate, Obuchi poured cold water on the idea, saying,
``At this stage, we have no intention of drawing up a supplementary
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that government spending is only a modest part of
the economy and suggested that there may be only so much that he or
any official can do to revive the economy, which has been in an
on-again-off-again slump since the early 1990s. He noted that the
greatest part of the economy is private consumption, and added,
``We are somewhat concerned that personal consumption so far has
not yet shown a rising curve.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are some areas where the government can help, like
promoting the housing industry and deregulating the economy. But he
gave no indication that he was planning any dramatic program.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and Clinton are also to discuss American military bases
on Okinawa, where bases are concentrated and the opposition to them
has traditionally been strongest. But the anti-bases movement in
Japan has lost steam in the last few years, and public support for
the bases and for the military alliance with the United States now
seems stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relations with the United States are the very foundation
of Japanese foreign policy,'' Obuchi said Wednesday. ``My own
perception of Japan-U.S. relations is that they are at their best
and most stable since Japan opened its doors to the outside
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has long been friendly to America, and Wednesday he
recounted how as a college student in 1963, he visited the United
States for the first time, staying in Washington at the YMCA. The
son of a member of Parliament, Obuchi won a meeting with Robert F.
Kennedy, who was then attorney general, and was given a 1960
Kennedy-for-President tie clip showing a PT-109, the boat John F.
Kennedy commanded when fighting Japan in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by that example, Obuchi said, he has used tie clips in
his own campaigns in Japan. He said he was thinking about wearing
the PT-109 clip on this trip but was afraid he might lose it.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip to Washington, Obuchi will enjoy fancier
accommodation, at Blair House, the official guest residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, the YMCA was the cheapest place in
Washington, $1.50 a night,'' Obuchi said. ``But this time will be
even cheaper. Blair House _ no charge!''

TECHNICAL ADVICE IS EASY TO FIND WHEN THE ROAD BECKONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term travelers can easily get information about gaining
access to the Internet and posting their travels from the road.
There are probably hundreds of travelogues on line, and at least
one guidebook publisher, Lonely Planet, also maintains an extensive
message board, the Thorn Tree, at its site (www.lonelyplanet.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many seasoned travelers also like the broad range of information
that is offered at sites like www.travel-library.com, and the
www.roadnews.com site is geared toward people traveling with
laptops. Many people who post tales of their journeys on Web sites
include a ``how we did it'' section that lists technological
information. For a list of Internet cafes abroad, see the
www.netcafeguide.com site.
</P>
<P>
   A site called www.photo.net is useful for both improving photo
skills and building personal Web pages. Another site at
www.microship.com/technomads is filled with travelogues.
</P>
<P>
   What about lugging a computer on the road? Marc Brosius, a
former long-term traveler who runs the popular Round-the-World
Guide on line (www.travel-library &QC; .com/rtw/html), recommends that
travelers stick to a laptop that weighs no more than two or three
pounds, like the Sony Vaio.
</P>
<P>
   While smaller machines can often run on AA batteries, travelers
who want to use a digital camera and edit their photos should
choose machines with relatively large screens, of at least 10
inches, to insure that they can see enough of each picture to edit
properly, Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other long-term travelers, Brosius recommends taking a
digital camera on the road, to avoid photo development hassles on
the road and to be able to post pictures quickly and easily at Web
sites. To avoid problems like blurry action shots, he recommends
that travelers stick to machines with at least one million pixels
of resolution.
</P>
<P>
   What about software? Brosius advises that beginners, in
particular, should keep it simple. For travelers who want to write
Web pages with interesting layouts and who do not want to have to
do their own HTML coding _ the common computer language of the Web
_ he recommends sticking to a product like Adobe's Page Mill. He
likes Photodeluxe, also made by Adobe, for photo editing.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone hardware abroad is still a problem. Travelers still
complain about ancient phone lines and phones that are hard-wired
to the wall without phone jacks. Many travelers carry adapter kits
like those made by Road Warrior International (www.warrior.com) or
Teleadapt (www.teleadapt.com).
</P>
<P>
   Internet access from around the world has improved significantly
lately, as companies like America Online and International Business
Machines have set up global networks. AOL offers access in more
than 100 countries, while IBM offers access in 53 countries,
through more than 1,300 access numbers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 of those numbers operate at modem speeds of 56K,
unlike the 33K speeds that are more common through other Internet
service providers, a company spokesman said. Most AOL numbers, a
spokeswoman said, operate at 56K.
</P>
<P>
   A company in Mountain View, Calif., called iPass says it has
some 3,200 access points in 150 countries (www.ipass.com). The
iPass company tries to provide Internet access through local
telephone calls wherever possible. But travelers have to sign up
with an ISP to get access to iPass.
</P>
<P>
   The iPass service is not available in Vietnam or North Korea,
and some travelers have reported access problems in countries like
Thailand and France.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Chakmakian, an iPass co-founder, said her company was
trying to iron out access problems, especially in Thailand, China
and India. Some computer users may have modems that are
incompatible with some countries' phone systems, Ms. Chakmakian
said, and iPass, like many ISPs, is trying to alert its users to
potential modem problems. A 56K modem, for example, may not connect
through a slower access number.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius recommends thorough planning for a trip. ``I see a lot
of people who at the last minute buy their equipment and who have
no idea of the full range of it,'' he said. ``Also, you have to
work the bugs out.''

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To many people in the theater, the decisions seemed
unjust. ``Wit,'' this year's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, was ruled
ineligible for Tony Award nominations because after vainly trying
to move to a Broadway theater, it could only be performed
off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.,'' which received strong reviews, was
also deemed ineligible because it was mounted in an off-Broadway
theater, the same one that housed ``Cabaret'' last year when it won
four Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Franz was viewed as so critical to the current revival
of ``Death of a Salesman'' that her name is listed above the title.
But to improve her chances for an award, the producers successfully
petitioned to have her moved from the leading-actress to featured
category. Still, when the producers of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown'' tried to have two cast members elevated to the
leading-actor category, they were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Things get touchy at Tony time.
</P>
<P>
   When producing on Broadway has become increasingly expensive,
and a Tony for best play or musical can mean the difference between
a show's long life or quick death, the theater world is already
awash in award controversy, even before Monday's announcement of
the Tony nominees. Perhaps this is an inevitable byproduct of weeks
of special pleading and jockeying for position, with investments
hanging heavily in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But each year dissatisfaction with the eligibility rulings seems
rampant, raising basic questions: Is it outmoded to restrict the
awards to Broadway productions? Are the awards essentially
acknowledgments of artistic quality or marketing tools? Do
favoritism and conflict of interest come into play when the awards
committee makes critical decisions about shows like ``Wit'' and
``Salesman''?
</P>
<P>
   Despite having its petition denied, ``Wit'' may be awarded a
special Tony. But whatever the outcome, some people in the theater,
seeing such thorny conflicts arise each year, feel strongly that
the Tonys, which will be presented June 6 at the Gershwin Theater
in a ceremony broadcast on CBS, need some serious rethinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that an award that was devised to encourage
excellence in the American theater when the American theater was
bounded by 42nd Street and 52nd Street is now out of date with what
is called the American play,'' said Doug Hughes, the artistic
director of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn.,
co-producer, with MCC Theater, of ``Wit.'' ``I think petitions like
ours are going to become a regular feature of every season, and I
believe the definition of what is Tony-eligible will be
broadened.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging some illogic in rulings like those on
``Wit'' and ``T.O.B.A.,'' Tony officials say they walk a fine line
between adhering to long-held standards and responding to changing
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater doesn't stand still, so we have to have a certain
amount of flexibility,'' said Roy Somlyo, the president of the
American Theater Wing, a nonprofit group that encourages the
theater and jointly presents the awards with the League of American
Theaters and Producers, a trade group. ``By the same token we have
to retain our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years the Tony Awards ceremony was presented in a
Broadway theater by the theatrical producer Alexander Cohen and his
wife, Hildy Parks. But the Tony event has become increasingly
glitzy in recent years: presented at Radio City Music Hall,
presided over by Rosie O'Donnell, fueling tension between the
Theater Wing and the producers' league.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, producers lobby for their properties and try to
negotiate a constellation of rules and seemingly idiosyncratic
decisions. Just two days before this year's deadline for
nominations, for example, the producers of ``It Ain't Nothin' but
the Blues'' moved their revue from the ineligible New Victory
Theater to the Tony-eligible Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Stone's revised book of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' was
deemed Tony-eligible at the administration committee's April 1
meeting, the producers of ``Charlie Brown'' followed with an April
19 letter asking for the same consideration for their updated book.
(There is no award for best book of a revival, so Stone's script
will compete against those for new shows.) The ``Charlie Brown''
producers lost that bid as well as their effort to follow the
example of the producers of ``Salesman,'' who managed to win
consideration of Ms. Franz as a featured actress rather than in the
lead category, in which her competition would have been Judi Dench
and Zoe Wanamaker.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony logic can be hard to follow. ``Swan Lake'' was ruled
ineligible for consideration as best play or best musical this
year, yet individual performances will be eligible as will the
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives attribute apparent inconsistencies to
the makeup of the 24-member Tony administration committee:
representatives from the league, the wing and the unions who, some
suggest, may be more motivated by self-interest than fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably is not the best idea to have the people
administering the Tony Awards who often have a built-in conflict of
interest in some of the issues,'' said Todd Haimes, the artistic
director of the Roundabout Theater Company and Livent Inc.,
``because even if they behave with great objectivity, and I have to
assume that they do, there still can be an appearance of a conflict
of interest, which is sometimes just as bad.''

HEALTH AGENCY ACCUSED OF WITHHOLDING VITAL INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Armed with a public-records request, an
anti-nuclear group recently began sifting through file cabinets of
the state Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   What the group found has created a fissure between the
Legislature and state health officials, who are being accused of
conspiring with corporate interests and withholding crucial health
information from the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee to Bridge the Gap uncovered a survey showing
higher-than-normal rates of lung cancer in an area around a
Rocketdyne Corp. plant near Simi Valley outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne builds propulsion systems for NASA space shuttles,
and has been under intense scrutiny over health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the cancer study, which health officials dismissed
as incomplete and flawed, has nevertheless enraged some lawmakers
and added fuel to another debate over whether Health Services tried
to manipulate the Legislature on a tobacco-related issue.
</P>
<P>
   The National Smokers Alliance, which is funded mainly by the
cigarette industry, is wondering why a Field Poll commissioned by
Health Services was kept secret as the Legislature was debating a
ban on smoking in bars.
</P>
<P>
   Health Services paid $80,000 for two March 1998 polls from the
respected, San Francisco-based Field Research Corp. But state
officials released only the poll showing overwhelming public
support for the bar smoking ban.
</P>
<P>
   The second, less-favorable poll of bar owners and workers was
not released _ until it was accidentally mailed to the
Virginia-based National Smokers Alliance, which quickly cranked up
its public relations machine after reading it.
</P>
<P>
   The two controversies have prompted an investigation by the
Joint Legislative Audit Committee and spurred the administration of
Gov. Gray Davis to appoint Ed Lowry, director of Toxic Substances
Control, to examine the allegations about Rocketdyne.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just more examples of what we perceive to be a real
problem within the department,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman,
D-Los Angeles, chairman of the audit committee, ``a department that
has put more obstacles in the way of making legislation rather than
making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after his inauguration, Davis still hasn't appointed
a director for the Department of Health Services, one of the
state's largest agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the governor said Davis was interviewing
candidates but had no date set for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Career health officials have been left to defend their
department and practices that took shape under two Republican
governors. They say they're under fire from two special interests
trying to influence policies within the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``One group is saying we've been too cozy with Rocketdyne and
have not gone after them and the other side is saying we've been
far too tough on a legitimate business, the tobacco industry,''
said Dr. Jim Stratton, deputy director for prevention. ``The
Department of Health Services plays it straight down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Legislature isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Lou Papan, D-Millbrae, said he wanted an
investigation into whether Health Services deliberately withheld
the critical tobacco poll and released the more favorable one just
two days before a legislative hearing last year on overturning the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned if we have state agencies that are not being
objective,'' said Papan, who supports giving bars the choice of
whether to ban smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But Stratton and Donald Lyman, chief of the chronic diseases
division, said the poll of bar and tavern owners was for internal
use, so field workers and health officials could better understand
their views as they explained the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman said releasing the first poll came in connection with a
new series of television advertising promoting the law, which
coincidentally, he said, came the same day of the legislative
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of stuff we do,'' Lyman said. ``There are piles
and piles of data, and we release in a formal sense a small part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the more comprehensive Rocketdyne investigation, the audit
committee will look at more than just the shelved cancer study.
</P>
<P>
   Recently released electronic mail messages and memos suggest
that Rocketdyne was trying to influence the make-up of an advisory
panel created in the early 1990s to examine worker safety at its
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Health Services officials say they wanted to start looking at
potential health problems in the community, not just among workers,
and they began talking with Rocketdyne about which scientists and
community members should be on the reconstructed board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommended that DHS form a new group of limited scope and
time duration,'' Rocketdyne consultant Susan Santos wrote in a Dec.
18, 1997, memo that recommends the state play a leadership role in
any future studies and not use the old advisory board, which had a
contentious relationship with Rocketdyne.
</P>
<P>
   Santos, who works for Massachusetts-based Focus Group, suggested
contacting local homeowners associations that might want to
nominate someone to the advisory panel and inviting people to a
Rocketdyne-sponsored workshop on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Health Services officials admit wanting to control the
scientific review and budget of any future health studies, as it
did in a previous Rocketdyne study.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said they want to add better-suited scientists to
the advisory panel, specialists in water tables and air quality,
not kick off the old members.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no evidence uncovered showing a direct response,
favorable or otherwise, from Health Services to Rocketdyne
regarding the Santos memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them verbally, `Thank you for your opinion,' and
that's it,'' said Dr. Raymond Neutra, chief of the department's
Environmental and Occupational Disease Control division.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, and members of
the advisory board believe the department and Rocketdyne have a
suspiciously cozy relationship. Kuehl wants three top Health
Services officials fired because of their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketdyne, for example, was given copies of two comprehensive
studies conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles on
illness and cancer rates near its Simi Hills plant. When the most
recent study was released two weeks ago, the company was prepared
that day with a detailed rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   And Kuehl said she phoned Davis' secretary of Health and
Welfare, Grantland Johnson, two weeks ago and told him she was
about to release the cancer study uncovered by the anti-nuclear
group in Emeryville. The next day, during her press conference,
Rocketdyne again was ready with a response, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuehl said the department should have been alarmed at
the cancer study that was filed away in Emeryville. Although
everyone involved believes it wasn't substantial enough to reach
any conclusions, it contained one red flag.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer rates were going up, according to the review, but
bladder cancer rates were not, suggesting something other than
tobacco was causing the spike in lung cancer. (Studies have shown
that lung cancer caused by tobacco is often associated with bladder
cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of the evidence points to a kind of collusion
between DHS and Rocketdyne,'' Kuehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Neutra, however, said the cancer study wasn't worth pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was based on about six hours worth of work and didn't
take into account smoking rates or other data from the community
besides who has cancer and where they live.
</P>
<P>
   And Stratton said it was common practice for state agencies to
share scientific studies. Indeed, the state auditor always lets
groups or individuals under scrutiny review its reports and offer
rebuttal letters. Stratton said it helps make the science better,
but that Health Services is never under any obligation to change
anything.

 NEW YORK: beyond reproach.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashton Springer, who produced ``T.O.B.A.,'' said he was baffled
by the committee's decision not to consider his show about the
heyday of black vaudeville, which closed three days after its
petition was rejected. ``Cabaret'' was ruled eligible in the same
theater last season, the Kit Kat Klub, formerly Henry Miller's
Theater, on West 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make up new rules as they go along,'' Springer said. ``If
it's something they want to do, it will happen. If it's something
they don't want to do, it won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony officials said the reason for the ``T.O.B.A.'' decision was
that the Kit Kat Klub failed to apply for Tony status in the year
since ``Cabaret.'' They said that the Roundabout, producer of
``Cabaret,'' simply used the Kit Kat Klub for its authentic
nightclub environment, although it has a Tony-eligible theater of
its own, Stage Right at the Criterion Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right decision,'' Somlyo said. ``On the surface it
looks horrendous. But you have to go just a quarter of an inch
deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Wit'' petition, Hughes argued that the producers tried
hard to find a home on Broadway last fall and had raised a million
dollars for such a move yet were rebuffed because the play deals
with a woman dying of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found ourselves with more than adequate capitalization, a
sheaf of unanimous raves and the doors to every available Broadway
theater slamming in our faces as we listened to a refrain of `Too
depressing,''' Hughes wrote in the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Gabay, the general manager of ``Wit,'' said he knew the deck
was stacked against the show when he and Hughes faced the
administration committee. ``Why would the majority of people in
that room, who had other plays represented on Broadway that would
be in direct competition, want `Wit' to be eligible?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The committee includes producers with competing shows and
members of the Actors' Equity Association. There are also people
like Stone, who left the room when the committee voted on
eligibility for his rewrite of ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tony rules specify that committee members must abstain from
votes in which they have an interest, although they may participate
in discussions of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members said personal concerns were set aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee, despite having agenda after agenda, has
functioned fairly well,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, one of the
producers of ``The Iceman Cometh.'' ``They vote almost always with
some logic.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic at work in the case of ``Wit,'' several committee
members said, was clear-cut: Only Broadway shows are eligible, and
``Wit'' is off-Broadway, at the Union Square Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Robert Whitehead, a longtime producer, the administration
committee is scheduled to meet Thursday to consider his proposal to
give ``Wit'' a special commendation at the Tony ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the theater say ``Wit'' is no special case. Other
acclaimed off-Broadway plays have been ineligible for Tony
consideration, like ``How I Learned to Drive'' and ``Three Tall
Women,'' both of which won Pulitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of shows that can't find Broadway theaters,''
said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the league. ``So the idea
that you would be eligible for Tonys because you  &UR; want &LR;  to be on
Broadway, that seems sort of odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether off-Broadway productions should be included for Tony
consideration raises questions about the cost to off-Broadway
producers and the logistical difficulty of having Tony voters see
all the shows. Some off-Broadway producers have argued against
their own inclusion on grounds that already meager potential
profits would be considerably reduced if they had to pay union
scale or give free seats to Tony voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the administration committee said they might
someday consider the possibility of creating a special Tony Award
for off-Broadway, the way they created one for regional theater in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   But others are adamant about keeping off-Broadway out of the
Tony mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very expensive to mount a Broadway musical; it
might cost $10 million,'' said Rocco Landesman president of
Jujamcyn Theaters who sits on the administration committee and
unsuccessfully argued against the Roundabout becoming Tony eligible
in 1991. ``I don't see why someone who puts up a musical for $1.98
gets the same privileges automatically. We've been handing out Tony
eligibility like candy, and as far as I'm concerned it has to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question has to do with Tony Award voters themselves.
More than 800 producers, general managers, theater owners and
others are eligible to vote. Many of them have not been active in
the theater for years, yet as long as they pay dues to the league,
$1,000 a year, they retain their voting status. Proponents of
stricter membership rules call it the cheapest theater subscription
in town, given that each voter gets two tickets to every show on
Broadway: a $5,000 value, one producer estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg said it was costing him $150,00 in free tickets for
``Iceman'' alone. ``You have to maintain the qualifications,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters sign their ballots pledging to have voted only for plays
after having seen all the nominees in a given category, but many in
the theater are skeptical. ``What it is is a freebie list,'' said
one producer.
</P>
<P>
   Azenberg said the management committee was considering more
stringent criteria for voter eligibility, although this could cut
into the membership fees that support the league.

OFFICIAL CHINESE PRESS OFFERS FIRST CRITICISM OF RECENT PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ The official Chinese press broke its silence
Wednesday on the recent demonstration in Beijing by more than
10,000 followers of a spiritual movement, calling the gathering
``completely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the New China News Agency, carried in several
newspapers and broadcast on state television and radio,
acknowledged that the protest by members of the Buddhist Law group
had occurred and seemed to warn other potential protesters not to
try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of gathering affected the Communist Party's Central
Committee and State Council as well as the life of the masses, and
was completely wrong,'' the report said. ``Actions endangering
social stability under the pretext of practicing qigong must be
punished according to law.''
</P>
<P>
   Qigong is a broad category of traditional Chinese teaching that
says that human energy can be channeled to improve physical and
mental health, to heal illness and, when mastered, to achieve
supernatural powers. Buddhist Law is a particular school of qigong,
led by Li Hongzhi, a qigong master whose following became so large
that he left China two years ago under pressure from the
authorities and now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's relatively mild statement reflected the ambiguous
and wary position of China's government toward qigong followers,
who represent a potential, though amorphous, threat to Communist
Party control, and who are generally peaceful and orderly except
when suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``government officials have never banned people from practicing
in various kinds of qigong,'' the report said. ``People are allowed
to voice different voices and opinions, but they should express
their views and opinions through normal channels rather than
gathering around Zhongnanhai.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai is a compound in central Beijing where China's
leaders live and work. Followers of Buddhist Law surprised the
authorities by surrounding the compound on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report said that the gathering had been prompted by
``rumors,'' without specifying what they were.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that government officials, on orders from senior
leaders, ``listened earnestly'' to complaints by the demonstrators.
The report did not confirm or deny that Prime Minster Zhu Rongji
had personally met with representatives of the group, as many
followers had claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the report's intent appeared to be to urge calm and
deter future protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining social stability and unity conforms with the
fundamental interests of broad masses of people,'' the report
concluded. ``People should treasure the positive situation and
conscientiously safeguard social stability.''

THIS WEEK'S BRIGHT IDEA IN PARENTING: `SMART LOVE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget potty training and letting your newborn cry himself to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Forget timeouts and spankings.
</P>
<P>
   And for heaven's sake, forget tough love.
</P>
<P>
   Want happier and more caring children? Forget discipline
altogether and apply smart love, a new and controversial
alternative to rigid discipline and the unstructured permissiveness
that has dominated child-rearing since the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of parenting uses your head but allows you to trust
your heart,'' said Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper, co-author of the new
book ``Smart Love: The Compassionate Alternative to Discipline That
Will Make You a Better Parent and Your Child a Better Person.''
``It saves parents from the discipline trap which makes children
and parents miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart love doesn't mean parents shouldn't regulate their
children's behavior, but rather they should model for them a way to
settle disputes without showing anger or aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Pieper and her husband, Dr. William Pieper, have been using the
smart love concept in their therapy practice for years. They began
work on it a few years ago after deciding that prevailing clinical
theories and parenting books were not helpful, and could even be
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Smart-loved children, Pieper said, become happy and easy to be
with. Those without the benefit of this type of nurturing, who are
disciplined often, can become unhappy and difficult, believing
that's what their parents want.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of disciplining children, Pieper said parents should
apply what she and her husband call loving regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline means that you attach unpleasant consequences _
disapproval, time out, restriction of privileges and even
spanking,'' said Pieper. ``Loving regulation allows you to control
behavior that needs to be controlled without adding unpleasant
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a parent discovers her 10-year-old breaking the
rules and riding her bike in the street, Pieper suggests that
instead of taking away the privilege, insist that for a given
period of time she may ride her bike only when you are with her.
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to popular wisdom that says you should let a baby
cry himself to sleep, Pieper said parents should always respond to
their infants' cries immediately, gently and positively. To do
otherwise teaches the infant to respond to discomfort by crying
more intensely.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Pieper said, parents have always assumed that they
had to discipline, and the only alternative to discipline was
permissiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But based on our research, we said you can separate discipline
from regulation. Discipline causes children to learn to treat
themselves and others harshly when there's a disagreement, and
taken to the extreme you can end up with a tragedy like that in
Littleton, Colo.''
</P>
<P>
   Two students _ 17-year-old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric
Harris _ went on a four-hour rampage at Columbine High School last
week, killing 13 people before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Pieper said that an unfortunate result of such a tragedy is that
people will respond by saying that we're letting our kids have too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who reach for a gun to solve problems are kids who have
been come down on harshly when adults didn't like their behavior,''
she said. ``It would be really tragic if we come down harder on
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieper said that children are more unhappy and troubled nowadays
because parents have ``gotten really bad parenting advice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're producing child after child who needs to be unhappy
because parents are told to come down hard on behavior that is
really age-appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, expecting babies to sleep through the night or
getting upset when a 1-year-old clings to your leg is
counterproductive, because all these behaviors are normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say you always offer a child a positive relationship,''
Pieper said. ``Sometimes unconditional love gets defined as
permissiveness, but you can always love a child and feel close to a
child. This really is the middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE `SMART' WAY TO LOVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To raise happy and resilient children, Martha Pieper offers
these tips:
</P>
<P>
   _You cannot spoil your children with too much love and
affection.
</P>
<P>
   _Your children will grow up happier and more caring if you never
discipline them.
</P>
<P>
   _Whenever possible, give your child what your child wants. The
child will copy you and become generous, not selfish and
narcissistic.
</P>
<P>
   _Babies and young children cannot fake unhappiness, and they are
never manipulating you. If they cry, try to respond to them.

COMPETITION WILL IMPROVE EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of well-heeled American businessmen are adding a huge
competitive dimension to the public education market that shows
promise of evolving into a significant spur to the school-choice
movement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their recently launched effort is creating 40,000 four-year
scholarships for mostly inner-city kids from disadvantaged families
to pay for educations at schools of their choice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Forstmann, a billionaire investor, and John Walton, of the
Wal-Mart dynasty, contributed $50 million apiece of their own money
and have raised $70 million more from other sources to finance
their Children's Scholarship Fund. The program's initial
beneficiaries are winners of what amounted to a lottery because
1.25 million families applied for scholarships. The overwhelming
response occurred even though the families must supplement the
grants with $1,000 of their own money each year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of these parents to share the cost is seen by
school-choice proponents as strong evidence of broad-based
socioeconomic support for alternatives to public education. They
say it counters claims that poor families are leery of school
choice because it favors the privileged and affluent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Forstmann-Walton initiative is the most recent of several
such efforts since the early '90s. Whereas many businesses have
tried to improve public education working within the established
system, ventures such as the Forstmann-Walton undertaking are
examples of thinking and acting outside the box. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in The Wall Street Journal recently estimated there
were some 60 similar private scholarship programs in place
throughout the country. Two of the most well-known have been those
started by prominent Indianapolis businessman Pat Rooney and Robert
Wegman in New York. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The editorial also recounted recent developments in Milwaukee,
where Bradley Foundation support has helped send 5,000 children to
private schools. Meanwhile, a recent school board election resulted
in the ouster of several strong advocates of the teachers union and
the election in their place of school-choice supporters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, a Democrat, was quoted as saying
the choice alternative provides ``the political climate that
prompts the public schools to finally change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is the way competition works. Education in its
own way is a business like any other delivering a public good.
Whenever any enterprise has a monopoly, the result will probably be
a system resistant to change and improvement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the U.S. auto industry in the late '70s and early '80s?
Its long monopoly-induced complacency brought a quality decline
that boosted the popularity of imports. The industry's survival was
in doubt for a while. Foreign competition then became the incentive
for the Big Three and its union workers to build vehicles able to
turn back the competitive threat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The situation in public education is somewhat analogous because
of monopoly power and the unions' ability to preserve that power.
Change has been achieved only slowly, but increasing competition
will no doubt shape the future of American education. As it does,
every stakeholder will be better off for it. &QL;

A GORE PROBLEM: WARTIME VICTORY DOES NOT PRODUCE TRIUMPH AT POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 2)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Armed conflict in the Balkans has compounded the
problems that Vice President Al Gore faces in seeking to become
Bill Clinton's White House successor.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply his risk in being loyal to a president
and a policy that could be in disrepute with a majority of
Americans by the time voters journey to the polls in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the danger that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
will outlast the determination of the NATO allies and emerge
victorious from the confrontation over Kosovo, thus boosting the
presidential hopes of such Republicans as Dan Quayle, Patrick
Buchanan and Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes, who have been fiercely
critical of Clinton's Balkans policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most dangerous curse may be his service to a president in
a time of armed conflict abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Whether America and NATO win or lose in their drive to provide a
safe haven for hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
the Democrat who seeks to follow Clinton as president must overcome
a powerful 20th century precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, it is that war _ with two major exceptions _ has
not benefited the political party of the presidents who have
presided over lengthy military engagements abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One exception came in the aftermath of World War II. Franklin D.
Roosevelt was at the beginning of his fourth term, and victory over
Nazi Germany was at hand when he died at Warm Springs, Ga., in
April 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the Democrats lost control of Congress. But
FDR's successor, Harry Truman, in serving three years and nine
months of Roosevelt's unexpired four-year term, had stamped his own
brand on the presidency and in 1948 won the most amazing upset
victory in the history of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The other exception came in 1972, when President Richard Nixon,
who had expanded the Vietnam War into Cambodia and Laos, won
re-election by carrying 49 of the 50 states over Democrat George
McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the party of the president prosecuting a war has lost
the White House in the succeeding election.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim of that trend was Republican George Bush, who
had poll ratings of around 90 percent early in 1991 when U.S.-led
allied forces routed Iraq's Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should have been helped also by the fact that he was in the
Oval Office when the Cold War, which had occupied every president
from Truman to Ronald Reagan, finally ended with the collapse of
communist regimes in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania
and even the Soviet Union itself.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his enlightened leadership in foreign affairs, Bush
lost his 1992 reelection bid to Clinton. The Democrat understood
that old-fashioned bread-and-butter issues still were vital to
Americans, and he focused his campaign on criticizing Bush for the
faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   An additional problem for Gore is that millions of Americans
find it difficult to see him as anything other than a No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bush in 1988 was the first candidate since Martin Van Buren in
1836 to be elected president directly from the vice presidency, and
his success may have owed more to the feeble campaign run by
Democrat Michael Dukakis than to Bush's own efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Nixon served as vice president before becoming
president. But he failed in his first try in 1960 and had to wait
eight years to achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
   The political parties that controlled the White House in World
War I, the early part of the Vietnam War and the conflicts in Korea
and the Persian Gulf all lost the presidency either while
hostilities were in progress or after they had ceased. It made
little difference that in some instances, the defeated candidate
was more qualified for the presidency than his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A week before World War I ended victoriously for America and its
allies in November 1918, voters rejected President Woodrow Wilson's
public appeal for reelection of a Democratic Senate, which would
determine the fate of agreements emanating from the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they handed the GOP a one-vote margin in that body.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Wilson sailed to Europe to take part in the peace
negotiations that produced the Treaty of Versailles and Wilson's
most treasured dream, the League of Nations. After returning to
America, the president embarked on a nationwide speaking campaign
on behalf of the League. But he was felled by a paralytic stroke
and eventually witnessed the defeat of the League in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, voters elected Ohio Republican Sen. Warren G. Harding
to the presidency over Ohio Democratic Gov. James Cox, who
supported American participation in the League.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1952 presidential election rolled around, Truman was
ending his presidential tenure, and Americans were in the midst of
the Korean conflict. Although peace talks were under way, the
fighting had not ended and the Democratic presidential nominee,
Adlai Stevenson, was overwhelmingly defeated by the GOP standard
bearer, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a beloved World War II hero.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam situation in 1968 was similar for the Democrats.
Like Truman, Lyndon Johnson had taken himself out of the
presidential race and launched negotiations to end the war. But the
nation was bitterly divided over the continuing conflict, and Nixon
defeated Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Nixon finally withdrew American combat troops from
Vietnam in 1973, the war did not end until North Vietnam overran
South Vietnam in 1975. Nixon, meanwhile, had resigned in 1974,
disgraced by the Watergate scandal. Vice President Gerald Ford, who
succeeded him as president, pardoned him for his Watergate
offenses. Then, a year after America's loss in Vietnam, Ford was
defeated by Democrat Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Vietnam had been a U.S. triumph, Ford might have lost
anyway. As other presidents learned, winning has to be the goal in
waging war against a foreign foe, but victory on the battlefield
does not guarantee victory for the wartime party the next time
voters go the polls.

LAWMAKERS, LEGAL EXPERTS QUESTION CLINTON'S GUN PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   One week after the Colorado high school
shootings, President Clinton proposed gun-control legislation that
would hold negligent parents liable when their children commit
crimes with guns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Clinton's suggestion brought questions and criticism in
Kansas and Missouri among prosecutors, politicians and law
professors. Legislatures in both states have no plans to pursue
similar state laws.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his omnibus crime package announced Tuesday, Clinton
pushed numerous proposals, including mandatory prison sentences of
three to 10 years and $10,000 fines for adults, including parents,
who allow children access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   The adult could be held liable whenever a juvenile crime was
committed and the adult ``knowingly or recklessly allowed it to
occur,'' a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's parental liability proposal amounts to a
``political gesture'' and a knee-jerk response to a high-profile
crime, said Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal judicial system is already overwhelmed,'' he said.
``It's hard for me to imagine they'll be able to handle a lot of
those cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, prosecutors face a high burden of proof, Morrison
said. ``The raging negligent parent is what you'd be looking for,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compassion for the shooter's parents combined with that high
legal standard would make prosecutors hesitant to file cases, said
University of Kansas law professor Roscoe Howard, a former federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for cops and prosecutors to walk in there and
say: `You're under indictment,' '' Howard said. ``In this
situation, everyone seems like a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than drafting laws that blame parents, Jackson County
Prosecutor Bob Beaird said, the focus should be on violence
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be getting to kids before they reach this point,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal system already can penalize parents of lawbreakers.
Civil law provides ways to make parents pay damages or fines when
their children commit crimes, said Mary Kisthardt, a law professor
at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Civil cases are easier
to prove than criminal ones, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional questions also surround a proposal that could
jail people for a crime someone else committed, Kisthardt said. The
proposal ``might satisfy politicians and the public, but it might
not be held up by the courts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides addressing parental responsibility, the president's
proposal would raise the legal age for possession of a handgun from
18 to 21 and treat sales of explosives, such as dynamite and
blasting caps, the same as guns under the Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democratic leaders are counting on outrage over last
week's shooting rampage at Columbine High School that left 15 dead
to help push the proposal through this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri and Kansas, state lawmakers have shown little
interest this year in passing bills similar to the president's
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Key Kansas lawmakers said no measure like Clinton's had been
introduced or considered. With only days left in this year's
legislative session, they said, it is doubtful the issue will even
come up.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Tim Emert, an Independence Republican,
said passing such legislation would be ``extremely difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Carmody, an Overland Park Republican and vice chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, said criminal law was based on
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the bare fact of giving a gun to a child shouldn't be
criminal,'' he said. ``Intent is everything. To say that someone
else should be criminally responsible for the evil act of another
is kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, legislation was introduced earlier that would have
allowed prosecutors to charge gun owners with a felony if a minor
obtained the gun and killed or seriously injured someone. That
proposal got little support at a public hearing and has languished
in committee since February.
</P>
<P>
   Although a home environment is often the easiest place to point
fingers after a child commits an unthinkable crime, it isn't the
parents who pulled the trigger, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make your children even-tempered people. But you
are kind of scared, because your kids are their own people. They
make decisions on their own,'' said Howard, himself the father of
two young boys. ``But folks now want some kind of punishment. They
are all grabbing for their pound of flesh.''

COMPETENCE OF OLDER DRIVERS A TOUCHY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evelyn White, 84, had driven her car for 68 years without an
accident _ until one chilly day last December when she hit a pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a minor fender bender. But the crash jolted her into
reassessing her own driving skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I couldn't hear so good anymore and, well, little
things are going wrong with my body,'' she said. ``It's time for me
to stop driving.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't renew her license when it expires in June.
</P>
<P>
   Although White decided to stop driving on her own, many of this
country's aging drivers stay behind the wheel long after it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the problem, Missouri in January enacted a new law
that is being hailed as a national model for how to tackle this
sensitive safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's law, which relies on impairment rather than age, has
won support from advocates for the elderly, from AARP to the
Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, which may have been reluctant to yank the licenses
of impaired drivers whose skills have deteriorated over the years,
have contacted Missouri about its new law.
</P>
<P>
   Under Missouri's law, anyone can confidentially report an
impaired driver and the state will determine whether they should
keep driving. Those who file reports are also granted immunity from
prosecution, and the law provides penalties for fraudulent reports.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, 293 Missourians have filled out the forms, now
available at all driver's license offices.
</P>
<P>
   Once a claim is filed, the state can require the driver to
re-take the driver's license exam, including the road test. Drivers
who fail the test can opt to retake it later.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, residents can write the state a letter about an
impaired driver, then a doctor must determine whether a person is
competent to drive. But doctors are sometimes loath to report a
patient because they are not shielded from prosecution, according
to some advocates for the elderly.  &LR; brk:Numbers growing  &LR; tx:Getting
unsafe older drivers to give up their licenses has long been a
delicate subject. And the ranks of older drivers will only grow in
coming years. Within the next two decades, the number of licensed
drivers age 75 or older will zoom from 17 million to 50 million,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, traffic fatalities increase sharply after age 70,
and drivers age 75 years or older are involved in more fatal
crashes per mile driven than any other age group except teens,
according to a 1996 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   As persons age, their vision and hearing often dim. Reflexes
slow. Arthritis can make looking over the shoulder a painful
experience. The rate of metabolism decreases, extending the effects
of many medications. All of these problems can make driving more
precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior drivers aren't aware of the physical changes. Some
suffer dementia and other mental illnesses that affect their
judgment. For those people, driving could be a death sentence for
themselves or anyone they encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, family members could do little except take away
the car keys from a loved one or dismantle the car itself. Just
bringing up the topic to a spouse, a parent or grandparent can be
painful for families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving is often people's last bit of independence,'' said Kim
Collins, executive director of the Alzheimer's Association
Heartland Chapter in Kansas City. ``It's especially hard for a man
to give up his license. Families don't want to be evil or mean, but
they go through torture worrying about what could happen, and what
they should do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Missouri enacted its law, doctors were reluctant to
report a patient because of possible repercussions, said Martin
Zehr, a neuropsychologist at Research Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors were also afraid they'd be sued for libel,'' he
said. ``With the old law, when doctors did call about a patient,
they'd get the local Department of Revenue's assurances that it
would do something and it would promise to follow up. But the
patients would usually keep driving.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new law, the forms are confidential. Zehr, who helped
lobby for the Missouri bill, reported a difficult patient with
dementia in February. Within days, his patient was notified to
retake his driving test. After failing the test twice, the patient
decided on his own to give up driving. His family was ecstatic,
Zehr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dementia cases, doctors always try to reason first with
their patient and then with the family,'' he said. ``But that
doesn't work in hard cases where the patient sees nothing wrong
with themselves. I feel better now about seeing the information on
paper and I know it's being followed up. Plus, a doctor can now
help the family by being the `bad guy,' without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon and Karen Suroff pushed for the Missouri law after their
son died in a 1993 wreck caused by a 91-year-old man with senile
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The man had driven the wrong way down Interstate 70. When police
caught up with him some 250 miles later, he and his wife were
sitting on the roadside, with no memory of the accident.  &LR; brk:More
than just age  &LR; tx:The Missouri law has won support from AARP
because people can't lose their driving privileges based on age.
Age advocates praise the law for giving people the chance to regain
their licenses if their medical condition improves or if they learn
how to compensate for it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the Rehabilitation Institute in Kansas City
therapists find adaptive driving devices like a left-foot
accelerator pedal or a hand-control on a steering wheel to help
people with visual, physical or cognitive impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes as people age they start having more medical
complications like strokes or amputations, but that doesn't mean
they have to stop driving,'' said Mary Schwartz, an occupational
therapist at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The real difficulty with curbing any at-risk driver is that
states do not have adequate driving tests, said Audrey Straight of
AARP.
</P>
<P>
   License testing only screens the most obvious problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, on the vision tests, people with 200 eyesight
won't pass, but if they have some sort of problem with peripheral
vision or depth perception the tests won't necessarily pick that
up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And fewer states do on-the-road testing for renewals, she said,
to save money and shorten lines in the license bureaus. In
Missouri, people renew their licenses every three years _ and the
state may decide before May 14 to extend that to every six years.
Kansans renew their licenses every six years.  &LR; brk:Classes
available  &LR; tx:Seniors can learn to compensate for diminishing
abilities through driving refresher courses, like AARP's ``55
Alive//Mature Driving'' program. The class costs $8 and can earn
graduates a lower rate from their insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent class in Sugar Creek, instructor Ed Moran talked to
33 seniors about seat belts and airbags, grandchildren and
left-turns, and how to set limits on driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things we did in our younger years that's not
logical to attempt today,'' he said to the class. ``But you can
still keep driving if you know your limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday there will be a time when you'll decide it's time to
quit,'' he continued. ``Start making plans now, so you'll be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Evelyn White did. She gathered information on bus
routes and carpools and talked to her family about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a hard decision to stop and I'm sure that I'm
going to miss it,'' she admitted. ``But I'm doing it before I
actually have to, so that my son won't have to go through that
worry.''
SIDEBAR Driving tips for seniors
</P>
<P>
   Michael Seaton, of Washington D.C., and the creator of AARP's
``55-Alive/Mature Driving'' class offers the following suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Take a driver re-training or refresher class. Driving laws have
changed quite a bit since most seniors first became licensed to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   See an eye doctor regularly. If night vision is a problem, limit
driving to daytime only.
</P>
<P>
   Because age cause declining depth perception and peripheral
vision, make left hand turns and lane changes a group project.
</P>
<P>
   Plan your route ahead of time to avoid confusion; drivers
frequently have less than a one-half second to avoid a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a bigger car. Size offers more protection in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Always wear your seatbelt, and remember that grandchildren in
carseats sit in the back.
</P>

CALCULATORS THAT OFFER MORE THAN THE SOLUTION 
WHEN THE MODEM HOGS THE PHONE LINE 
IF YOU CAN STAND THE ADS, THE VOICE MAIL IS FREE  
GAME MAKERS ON THE DEFENSIVE 
LATEST HANDHELD ELECTRONIC ORGANIZER
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as handheld calculators appeared in classrooms,
educators warned that the devices would undermine the learning of
mathematics. Now at least one major calculator maker, Casio,
acknowledges that the doomsayers were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calculators in general have become a crutch,'' said Jim Gross,
director of marketing for Casio's educational products unit. ``Some
students are just spitting out answers but not getting a grasp of
the concepts behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Casio's proposal for solving the problem is, well, a
calculator. The Casio Algebra FX 2.0 promises to teach while it is
crunching numbers by offering two types of tutoring. The first uses
graphs to display each of the calculations the machine is making to
solve the algebraic problem punched into its keyboard. The other
allows students to work out the solution step by step and corrects
their efforts along the way.
</P>
<P>
   While the calculator, which costs $149, is designed for students
in grades 7 to 12, Gross said he expected that it would also be
welcomed by mathematically challenged parents who were not able to
help with their children's homework.

   Answering Calls Online
</P>
<P>
   Each Internet user with a single telephone line is always
plagued by the suspicion that an important caller is trying to get
through while the modem is hogging the phone connection. Now such
surfers can develop a special form of multitasking anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Call Manager _ a service developed by Infointeractive,
based in Halifax, Nova Scotia _ is offering a pop-up menu that
identifies incoming callers and offers a chance to complete the
voice connection through the Net itself.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which costs between $4 and $7 a month, diverts
incoming voice calls to a special Internet server that in turn
sends caller ID messages to the user's computer screen. A user can
then instruct the server to ignore the call, take a voice-mail
message or disconnect the modem and put the caller through to a
conventional phone almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Infointeractive introduced a fourth option:
Recipients can take calls over the Net, using the speakers and
microphones on their computers. Given the problems that plague
voice transmission over Internet calls through dial-up PC modems,
Infointeractive's president, Bill McMullin, isn't promising much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that most people will still revert to the
phone,'' he said.

   Patience Rewarded
</P>
<P>
   A free voice-mail system is now available to anyone with the
patience to listen to advertising spots over the phone. The system,
called Echobuzz, is aimed at teen-agers _ a market that just might
be willing to endure the advertising in exchange for a place to
leave messages that can't be heard by Mom or Dad.
</P>
<P>
   People who want to register for the service go to
www.echobuzz.com, where they fill out forms asking for contact
information and details about their favorite music, sports and
hobbies. The advertisements _ which last from two to 10 seconds _
will be tailored to users' interests. ``A guy, for example, won't
get an ad for the newest, coolest shade of lipstick,'' said
Kimberly Goolsby, an Echobuzz spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   After signing up for Echobuzz, users will receive e-mail
messages containing personal identification numbers that give them
access to their accounts. To leave or receive messages, members
must dial in to the toll-free number _ (877) 324-6289. Messages may
be left only for other Echobuzz members.
</P>
<P>
   A start-up company called Blue Diamond Software, based in
Irvine, Calif., developed Echobuzz. Although the system is designed
to earn revenue from advertisers, it was also developed to be a way
to test Blue Diamond's speech-recognition software, said the
company's president and chief executive, Blaine Ung.

   In the Aftermath of Littleton
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the killings of 12 students and a teacher in
Littleton, Colo., last week, many commentators and some parents are
wondering aloud about what influence _ if any _ video games may
have had on the actions of the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold. Not surprisingly, video game manufacturers are reluctant
to be drawn into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no comment on it at all,'' said John Carmack, the
co-founder of Id Software, which makes the games Quake and Doom, in
which the object is to use an array of weapons to kill and blow up
as many enemies as possible. Harris was known not only to play Doom
but to program levels for it. A profile Harris may have written for
his America Online account lists Doom as one of his hobbies. And on
a Web site attributed to him, a diatribe ends with the ominous
words, ``Doom will become reality!''
</P>
<P>
   Other game makers and industry observers said video games should
not be held responsible for violence. Rob Legg, marketing manager
for Ion Storm, a company started by John Romero, the co-creator of
Doom, said the game industry was getting a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play these games and they do not make me take a sawed-off
shotgun to somebody,'' Legg said, adding that Ion Storm also
planned to make vivid first-person shooter games.
</P>
<P>
   While game industry observers have said Doom is being unfairly
blamed for the Colorado incident, one did acknowledge an eerie
similarity between the attack last week and the game play itself,
which puts the player in the role of a first-person shooter on a
rampant attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that when that guy is there going down the hall with
a gun, it looks pretty much like the view he has when he's playing
Doom or Quake,'' said Vince Broady, the editorial director of
Gamespot, an online gaming publication based in San Francisco.

   Aiming at the Younger Set
</P>
<P>
   The success of high-end handheld devices like the Palm
organizers and the various flavors of Windows CE has inspired a
number of imitators. The latest, and the one most likely to have an
impact outside the world of business gadget freaks, is the Helio
from Vtech. If the name Vtech doesn't register, go to any toy store
and look at the electronic toys in the educational section. Vtech
makes 60 percent of all the electronic devices for children sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Helio, which was introduced last week is aimed at those who
lust after a Palm V or a Compaq Aero but can't afford the $500
price tag. The company will start shipping it on June 15. The Helio
sells for $199 and is only available, for now, on Vtech's Web site
(thunder.kelly.com/vtech.storefront). Taking a cue from the success
of the Apple iMac, the Helio comes in a rainbow of eight colors.
</P>
<P>
   Vtech culled the best from the Palm and Windows CE devices; it
has all the standard functions of both the Palms and CE _ phone
book, calendar, to-do list, memo pad, calculator and an e-mail
reader. It has a Windows personal information manager that allows
you to enter data on the PC and then synchronize it with the Helio
via a cradle, which is supplied. For handwriting recognition, it
uses Jot from Communication Intelligence Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the Helio doesn't have yet is the support of
large numbers of third-party developers who are writing programs
for the device. If teen-agers start buying the Helio, that will
change.

   Encyclopedia Prequel

   In another example of the Internet turning academic publishing
on its head, MacMillan Reference is pre-releasing parts of its
massive Encyclopedia of Life Sciences on the Web. The encyclopedia
won't be completed until 2001, but in September 1999, MacMillan
will begin previewing more than 700 articles in an electronic
version, the Embryonic ELS (www.macmillan-reference.co.uk). That
will let academics and scientists participate in the evolution of
what MacMillan is calling ``the most ambitious reference source
ever to be published in the biological sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming Higher
</P>
<P>
   Is technology education in decline in the United States? It
might seem so after a glance at a recent report from the American
Electronics Association that found a 5 percent drop in the number
of math, physics, engineering and computer science degrees from
1990 to 1996. A closer look, however, reveals many signs of good
health. Most of the decline is due to a drop in associate and
bachelor degrees: Master's degrees are up 10 percent and Ph.D.s up
29 percent. The report also found an increase in the number of
advanced high school technology courses. So what happened to those
undergraduate dropouts? The report didn't speculate, but a few of
them may be software millionaires by now.

U.S. OFFICIALS SEEK TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS FOR APACHE HELICOPTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the much-touted Apache helicopter gunships
poised for action against Yugoslav forces Wednesday, military
officials and members of Congress sought to lower public
expectations that the high-tech aircraft would rapidly produce
dramatic war-ending results.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three weeks of anticipation, 24 Apaches, each
armed with as many as 16 tank-killing Hellfire missiles, 70mm
rockets and a 30mm cannon that can fire 625 rounds per minute,
arrived in northern Albania from bases in Germany ready for combat
in the embattled province of Kosovo. One of the gunships crashed
Monday in a training accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the soaring expectations for the Apaches have been
inspired by remarks by British Prime Minister Tony Blair's defense
staff and NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen has warned earlier this week
that ``the role of the Apaches should not be overestimated,''
adding, ``Do not look for the Apache to be some sort of a miracle
solution or a silver bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't try to exaggerate ... what it can do in terms of
carrying out its missions,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, senior Democrat on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said the American public shouldn't be led to
believe ``that there's going to be a sudden shift in the war
because the Apaches are arriving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they can operate in large areas in Kosovo, the Apaches
must proceed on a gradual basis,'' said Levin. ``To put it bluntly,
do not expect substantial results from the Apaches for quite some
time, perhaps months,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NATO officials asserted Wednesday that Apache missions
against Yugoslav forces were imminent, U.S. air crews faced a
formidable air defense system still in place around Yugoslavia _
despite more than a month of air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of NATO's top officials, German Gen. Klaus Naumann, head of
the alliance's military committee, said Yugoslavia's air defense
network of anti-aircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles and hundreds
of shoulder-fired missiles is prompting the alliance to move slowly
before dispatching the Apache gunships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have to cope with is we still have a rather
dense air defense environment,'' Naumann said. ``That is presumably
the reason why they are very, very cautiously approaching the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their armaments, the gunships are capable of
surprise attacks against enemy targets because of their ability to
fly only a few feet off the ground and suddenly appear from behind
trees or hills.
</P>
<P>
   But the helicopter's low-altitude operations also make it
vulnerable to air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst with the independent
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said another advantage
of the Apache is that it can attack in bad weather, unlike NATO's
high-flying jets that are hampered by cloud cover.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said O'Hanlon, simple math suggests that the relatively
small number of Apaches in the Balkans won't be able to rapidly
destroy 300-plus well-hidden and dug-in Yugoslav tanks and hundreds
of artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the Apaches can attack armor maybe twice as many days as
fixed-wing aircraft at high altitude _ that's not a big deal,
especially when you're adding 24 to 48 Apaches to a force that's
already numbering 700 planes,'' O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no reason to think the Apaches are going to be a
decisive difference,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO
commander, President Clinton on April 3 approved the deployment of
the Apaches to Albania. But it wasn't until Monday that the
aircraft arrived in Tirana, Albania, where they are protected and
maintained by 5,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign against Yugoslavia enters a second month
with no sign that President Slobodan Milosevic plans to withdraw
his forces from Kosovo, expectations for the Apaches were fueled
over the weekend when NATO spokesman Shea boasted that the
firepower of the Apaches, coupled with ground-based Multiple Launch
Rocket Systems to suppress enemy fire, would quickly cause
Milosevic to cry uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Serbs, with their armor, in Kosovo to feel the
heat, quite frankly, to come under the kind of intensive pressure
which will give them absolutely no option but to pack up and leave
as rapidly as they possibly can, because we don't want this to go
on indefinitely,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to end this as quickly as we can,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, the British prime minister, expected ``big results'' from
the Apaches, according to the Times of London, quoting members of
Blair's national security team.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported, ``There was a conviction (among Blair's
inner circle) that the American Apache attack helicopters that
arrived in Albania will cause such devastation among the Serb
forces in Kosovo that after four or five weeks of close-quarter
action, NATO ground troops would be able to move in and occupy
territory in the province with the minimum of opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph of London editorialized that Blair
``continues to expect too much of high-tech weaponry.''

 &HT;    SHAW, ARCHER OFFER GOP SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bucking the reluctance of their own congressional
leaders to tackle the Social Security issue, two key Republicans
offered a plan Wednesday to save the retirement program through
private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly that we can work in a bipartisan manner to
save Social Security now, in this Congress,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and
prime sponsor of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who chairs the
Social Security subcommittee and drafted the plan with Archer, said
Social Security must be reformed now. ``It can't be allowed to go
on the ash heap of indecision and political chicanery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, House GOP leaders disputed reports that they planned
to abandon Social Security reform before the 2000 elections, but on
Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he didn't expect
reforms to be considered during this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both House Democrats and conservative groups gave the new
proposal a cool reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Archer-Shaw plan may be cloaked in the rhetoric of reform,
but a closer look reveals a risky scheme that would end Social
Security and put millions of American seniors in jeopardy,'' said
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``Ultimately, the Archer-Shaw proposal
would eliminate all surpluses, force the federal government to
increase taxes, and cut spending elsewhere in the budget. It's
irresponsible and unworkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research
center, called the proposal ``seriously flawed and deeply
disappointing. ... This is not a serious attempt to reform Social
Security, it is simply an attempt to bail out the current system
using taxpayer money.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House response was muted. Spokesman Joe Lockhart said,
``We've always been willing to work with those who want to work
constructively to get a solution to this, and that remains the
same.'' Clinton has proposed creating private investment accounts
in addition to _ rather than in place of _ current Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Shaw proposal would use the projected federal surplus
to finance a 2 percent tax credit on wages subject to Social
Security payroll taxes. This year, the maximum credit would be
$1,452 on income of $72,600 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would be required to invest the money in one of about 50
funds _ made up 60 percent of stocks and 40 percent of bonds _
approved by the government but selected by the worker.
</P>
<P>
   Workers and employers also would continue paying the 12.4
percent Social Security payroll tax. Archer said that tax could be
reduced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When a worker decided to retire, the money in the investment
account would be paid out as an annuity, based on actuarial
estimates of the worker's remaining lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   If the amount in the account was enough to pay benefits at least
as high as what Social Security would pay under current law, the
benefit would come solely from the investment account. That would
relieve financial pressure on Social Security, which is expected to
run out of reserves by 2034.
</P>
<P>
   If the amount in the account was not enough to match the level
of benefits under current law, the difference would be paid from
reserves in the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the plan would guarantee existing benefits to current
retirees and at least that amount _ and likely more _ to future
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to defuse what is actually a ticking time bomb
that will go off in the lifetime of our grandchildren,'' Shaw said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A pair of monumental wire columns filled with oranges
stand sentry at the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show
House. They are the latest indication that the American home has
become a place for navel-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   It's show house time again, that riotous seasonal decorating
ritual in which angst takes a holiday and rooms by decorators and
architects _ over half of them new to the show house _ reveal the
annual ``state of the nation'' of interior design.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kips Bay's traditional cast of stodgy chintz-loving
characters had been supplanted by a jaunty group of young Turks.
This year, they're at it again. The show house, which opens on
Tuesday at 2 E. 82nd Street in Manhattan includes confident young
alumni from the offices of Parish-Hadley, Peter Marino, Mario
Buatta and Ralph Lauren, as well as the daughters of two Kips Bay
stalwarts, Janet Ackerley and the late Mark Hampton. Like their
mentors, they throw around the word ``timeless'' a bit too much but
nevertheless seem poised for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This year, darling, it's Nietzsche: this is doubtlessly the
first show house in history with two rooms inspired by Nietzsche
and Proust _ grab those Cliffs Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the earnest Dakota Jackson actually recited Chapter 3
of Proust's novel ``Jean Santeuil.'' Jackson described his room,
which is filled with art, music, books and objects from his own
home, as ``a reflection of my relationship with my wife.'' While
there are nearly as many themes as design firms in the show house
(17), there was a general feeling of introspection. The froufrou
index is at an all-time low. At the end of the century, Jackson
said, ``it's a moment of self-renewal, of coming clean.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only designer obsessed with cleanliness. It is
also the year of the tub potato, of gargantuan Roman bathrooms for
stressed-out Spartacuses.
</P>
<P>
   It was a direction that might be thought of as fusion design,
the traditional functions of rooms morphing to form new hybrids _ a
bathroom-library-media room, for instance, and a living
room-conference center. The once-discrete disciplines of decoration
and architecture have converged.
</P>
<P>
   New materials, including silicon sheeting, cotton-and-rubber
weaves and titanium-dipped glass, have been enlisted for the cause.
Lucite is the new Lalique. It is no coincidence that the
five-story, 12,000-square-foot town house contains only one
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Brien of Aero Studios designed a soothing and elegant
white-tiled sanctuary in two parts: a sitting room with a tiled
daybed and a bathroom with a double shower large enough for
shampooing a baby elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs the circus was Roman. Eric D.W. Cohler calls the
bathtub ``the New Age hearth.'' His is raised on a stepped
limestone platform set off by mosaics. He's surrounded the tub with
walnut bookshelves holding weighty tomes encased in plastic and
overhead, a study by John Singer Sargent. ``In the original
millennium, as men evolved from the ape, people sat around the
fire,'' Cohler said. Now, they can exfoliate while reading the
stock tables.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful metaphor of the new spatial fluidity may be a
pivoting steel screen on casters, wrapped in sheets of stretched
silicon, in a salon by Catherine S. Kim and Leyden Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Designed with rotating art collections in mind, the screen
recalls the movement of a sail that can come about when the owner's
tastes change course. The silicon screen captures light like
alabaster: a contemporary shoji screen for the Silicon Valley era.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the furniture designer and former magician, uses
theatrical scrims set in brushed aluminum frames to manipulate
light. Arranged along two walls like a backlighted cityscape, the
screens are an ingenious solution to the problem of unsightly
views. Venetian plaster walls with a subtle colored-pencil grid
inspired by Agnes Martin, soften the urban feeling of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has perfected the art of curating himself:
autobiographical details abound, from galleys of a new book by his
wife, Roselee Goldberg, to suspiciously unfolksy family
photographs, which upon closer inspection turn out to have been
taken by his friend Arthur Elgort, a fashion photographer.
Furniture by his heroes, including Frank Lloyd Wright and Pierre
Chareau, are joined by his own, like a macho ebony desk-for-success
that dominates the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much the way my wife and I live,'' Jackson
explained, with art by his friends Robert Longo, Cindy Sherman and
Lou Reed. ``It's about two people, as Proust said, `surrounded by
the instruments of their pleasures.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Jennifer Post, the muse is Nietzsche. A laser-printed
quotation, taken from her college philosophy textbook, is
prominently displayed in a white-on-white home office. ``It's about
believing each person can be his own hero,'' she said _ the perfect
attitude for nesting entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kips Bay is always a mirror of contemporary fantasies,
the biggest fantasy this year may be the dream of a quiet corner.
Ms. Post, whose clients include Matt Lauer, the ``Today'' show
host, fulfills that wish in a deeply calming space that includes
aural therapy: a murmuring water sculpture by Archie Held.
</P>
<P>
   The small room is alive with textures, from a bluish panel of
opaque glass dipped in titanium above a desk to walls covered in a
shimmery reptilian vinyl. Ms. Post also plays with scale, keeping
her Lucite-handled furniture low to the ground at a noncorporate 18
inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The show house was full of references to modernism, but the best
designers avoided slavish imitations, treating history like a rest
area, pausing to refresh but then moving on down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   This irreverent spirit was captured on Douglas Wilson's stairway
walls. Acting on every boy's desire, Wilson took colored pencils
and drew freehand along the town house's proper classical moldings.
He glamorized his swirls with convex rearview mirrors purchased at
Jack's 99-Cent Store.
</P>
<P>
   In a proper drawing room, the designer Mariette Himes Gomez
subtly defies conventional expectations of town house architecture.
Where once a crystal chandelier dripping with prisms would have
hung, there is a simple 1950s brass fixture with paper shades.
</P>
<P>
   Where gilt mirrors would have decorated the walls, there are
ethereal and mysterious Cibachrome photographs on plexiglass, fuzzy
room interiors by Seton Smith that animate the space. Beneath them,
where the gilt bombe chests would have been, fanciful gnarled root
consoles tweak the room.
</P>
<P>
   James Rixner recalls steamship interiors and 1920s cabinetry
without copying either. At the center of his handsome upstairs
landing is a faceted zebrawood fireplace, its horizontal and
vertical veneers juxtaposed for contrast. Light from a handblown
Venetian chandelier bounces off gold-leaf squares on the ceiling,
some tinted copper and green, enveloping the space with a luminous
sense of artisanry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vaughn takes his cue from the Lucite stacking cubes and
backgammon sets by Baron Alessandro Albrizzi, the late interior
designer and photographer whose work Vaughn reintroduced last year.
Fearlessly chartreuse, with ocelot-print cotton curtains, Vaughn's
room is like a bite into a lime.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces de resistance are perforated white screens made of 24
rubber doormats. ``You get creative when you get desperate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention is the name of the game at Kips Bay. This year's
most brazen attempt may be the one by Stephen Miller Siegel and
Nannette Brown, who designed George Stephanopoulos' New York
apartment and are now striving, as they put it, to ``recreate a new
Hillary.'' Stephanopoulos has obviously taught them something about
spin.
</P>
<P>
   For a future Senator Clinton's New York apartment, they aim for
urbane sophistication, with a whip-stitched blanketlike rug of
brown and gray wool felt and men's pin-striped suiting on the walls
and banquettes. The designers picture Mrs. Clinton living in
harmony in New York with the former president. How thick the walls
would be, they didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Also spotted around the show house:
</P>
<P>
   _ Best economic indicator: the herringbone leather floor in
Lewis' and Ms. Kim's salon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most obsessive detail: a tie between the toothpaste tube with
classical lettering in Aero Studios' bathroom and the artfully
arranged French baguette slices in the toaster in Christopher
Peacock's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Rethink This Idea in the Morning'' Award: The canvas
shower curtain that would need to be laundered weekly (Aero).
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``it'' plant: Contorted bamboo, $100 a stem (for both
Jackson and Vaughn, by the David Browne Flower Shop).
</P>
<P>
   _ Cognitive Dissonance Award: Aero's Zen bathroom abutting Ralph
Harvard's ode to Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Sweet Excess Award: Scott Salvator's topiary doors,
decorated with moss, artichokes, ostrich feathers and speckled
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last word on decorating and the influence of the stock
market: ``Everyone wants it finished quickly before something
horrible happens,'' Harvard said.

BEIJING TOUGHENS ITS POSITION IN WORLD TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China appears to have toughened its stance in
talks aimed at gaining entry to the World Trade Organization,
making U.S. negotiators pay for President Clinton's decision
earlier this month to delay a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest turn in China's long and complex path toward
membership in the group that makes the rules for global commerce,
Chinese negotiators have accused U.S. officials of making excessive
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some negotiators are reaching out for a yard after taking in
an inch,'' said Wu Yi, a state councillor and senior trade
official, in Beijing. ``They are demanding too high conditions that
are impractical and unacceptable for China.''
</P>
<P>
   China also seems to be trying to use international leverage with
European trade officials to put pressure on the United States to
agree to a WTO deal more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese negotiators Wednesday met for a third consecutive day in
Beijing with negotiators from the European Union, in preparation
for a visit by European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan, who is
scheduled to arrive in Beijing on May 5 and is expected to announce
an agreement that China should finally be allowed into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate groups of negotiators met about tariffs and on
trading services, the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator, was quoted by the agency
as saying that China was prepared to make extensive efforts to push
forward the negotiations, apparently appealing for international
support to counter U.S. demands in its trade talks with China.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's trip to the United
States early this month, China made a broad array of concessions
aimed at overcoming United States opposition for Chinese entry to
the WTO, which China has sought for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   China agreed to import more American beef, citrus products and
wheat, and to allow more openness in the telecommunications,
financial services and entertainment fields. Clinton rejected a
proposed agreement, though, apparently judging the anti-China mood
in Washington to be too strong to accept an accord.
</P>
<P>
   After vigorous protests from U.S. business leaders that a good
deal had been within reach, the Clinton administration authorized a
fresh round of negotiations aimed at preserving the momentum that
had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   With the Americans on the defensive for what is widely seen to
have been a lost opportunity during Zhu's visit, Chinese
negotiators seem to want to take advantage of a suddenly
strengthened negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials now say that their latest round of talks with
China, held last weekend, focused on financial services, an area
where they say the most obstacles remain. They have demanded full
rights for foreign banks operating in China to conduct business in
local and foreign currencies and to serve both local and foreign
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. negotiators say that China is insisting on too many
restrictions on U.S. banks, insurers and other financial companies
that want to enter the country. In response, Chinese officials
argue that equalizing market access for Chinese and foreign banks
could be disastrous for domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excessive growth of nonbank financial institutions could lead
to a financial crisis,'' The China Economic Times reported, quoting
a position paper from the State Development and Planning
Commission. ``Foreign-invested firms, supported by their banks,
could easily take over sectors of the market and monopolize
industries.''

DAIMLERCHRYSLER CITES STRONG EARNINGS GAIN FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Fueled by strong vehicle sales in the United States
and healthy heavy-truck sales, DaimlerChrysler AG on Wednesday
reported first-quarter profits increased by 23 percent, exceeding
some analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Net profits totaled 1.6 billion euros, or $1.75 billion; the
equivalent of $1.64 euros, or about $1.79 a share, vs. 1.43 euros,
or about $1.56 a share, for the same period in 1998. Revenues rose
10 percent to 35 billion euros, or about $38.28 billion. Profits
and revenues were up in every category in which DaimlerChrysler
competes.
</P>
<P>
   These comparisons, provided by DaimlerChrysler, are based on the
combined totals of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp., which merged
in November.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is riding the wave of strong U.S. vehicle sales,
which ran 10 percent above a year ago during the first quarter at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of nearly 17 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler products, such as the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and the
Dodge Durango sport utility, have been well received as Chrysler
has increased its market share. Profits from the sale of Chrysler
vehicles rose 12 percent to $1.5 billion in the quarter. More than
half of DaimlerChrysler's 2.8 billion euros, or $3.06 billion in
operating profits came from Chrysler, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrysler is selling what people want and selling what people
are willing to pay a premium for,'' said James Collins, an
automotive industry analyst with the London office of Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Chrysler's revenues were up slightly, but its
operating margins improved from 9 percent to 9.6 percent. It's
clearly a matter of the mix of vehicles Chrysler is selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Income from the sale of Mercedes-Benz and Smart vehicles, the
second largest contributor to DaimlerChrysler's operating profits,
rose 4 percent. Mercedes is being dragged down by slow sales of the
Smart car, a new minicar sold in Europe. Sluggish sales have led
the automaker to cut production by a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Mercedes saw a good quarter, but it was slightly hidden under
the continuing problems with the Smart car,'' said Collins. ``The
recent news of Smart sales has been better, but it's difficult to
see longer term if the car will be viable. In the meantime, the
Smart car is hurting the margins at Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins predicts the Mercedes margins will be hurt only
temporarily. The expected high profit margins of Mercedes' new
top-of-the-line S-Class, introduced in Europe late last year and on
sale since March in the United States, have yet to have an impact
on DaimlerChrysler's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales of Freightliner heavy trucks helped profits in the
commercial-truck segment increase by 12 percent to 1.63 billion
euros, or $1.78 billion. Profits from the company's aerospace unit
more than doubled, and income from financial services operations
also rose.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's strong first-quarter results suggest increased
revenues for the rest of the year, which now are expected to
surpass its initial revenue target of 137 billion euros, or $149.84
billion, said DaimlerChrysler chairman Jurgen Schrempp in a
statement. Strength in the United States should offset a possible
slowdown in sales in Europe during the second half of the year and
continued economic problems in Asia and Latin America, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed at $99.125, down $2.1875. European
auto stocks declined after Volkswagen AG reported
lower-than-expected profits, raising concerns about sales on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the $36 billion takeover of Chrysler by Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG, DaimlerChrysler, now the world's fifth largest
automaker, also continues cost-cutting that will help increase
operating profits at a rate greater than revenues over the year.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, DaimlerChrysler executives told auto
analysts that the cost-cutting benefits from the merger were
minimal in the first quarter but would total $1.4 billion in
savings for the full year.

NATO ACKNOWLEDGES MISSILE MISSED TARGET, HIT CIVILIAN HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged Wednesday that at least
one laser-guided bomb missed its intended military target Tuesday
afternoon and exploded in a neighborhood of civilian houses in
southern Serbia. Yugoslav authorities, who reported the incident
Tuesday night, said 20 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can confirm that one bomb went astray and impacted in an
area where there were civilians,'' a spokesman for the allied
military command, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani of Italy, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the attack had been aimed at a military garrison 200 to
300 yards away in the town of Surdulica, although reports from the
scene said that the barracks was at least 500 yards away. NATO
officials gave no estimate of their own of the number houses
destroyed or people killed. And they did not say what exactly had
caused the bomb to stray, though they have emphasized in the past
that bad weather or malfunction can send the weapons off target.
</P>
<P>
   Marani also indicated that more than one bomb may have missed
its target on Tuesday, and journalists who visited the site in
Yugoslavia on Wednesday reported seeing a second bomb crater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot exclude that another bomb could have been in the
same conditions and caused some collateral damage,'' the general
said, using the NATO military term for unintended destruction of
civilian life or property.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's swift if incomplete acknowledgment that Tuesday's
attack went wrong contrasted with the confusion of its initial
responses earlier this month to reports from Serbian officials that
about 70 people were killed when NATO bombs hit a column of ethnic
Albanian civilians near the town of Djakovica. It took days then
for the command to determine that allied planes had indeed fired on
the convoy, believing it contained only military vehicles, and then
explain the mistake publicly.
</P>
<P>
   This time, NATO officials reacted so quickly that when the
alliance's top civilian leader, Javier Solana, appeared before
reporters Wednesday afternoon he was not even asked about the
incident, and said nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, British Defense Minister George Robertson said in
London that Tuesday's attack destroyed the military barracks it was
aimed at and apologized in London for civilian casualties, which
NATO commanders say they are trying to keep to an absolute minimum
by picking targets carefully and using precision-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to express our regrets about any civilian casualties
which may have resulted from NATO's attack yesterday on the
Yugoslav Army training center at Surdulica,'' Robertson said. The
command here did not say which country's forces had carried out the
attack. Marani said NATO had no independent knowledge of how many
civilians might have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombing continued into its 36th day Wednesday, Marani
said that NATO planes had bombed anti-aircraft weapons sites,
fuel-storage areas, and roads and railways throughout Serbia. The
allies also tried to keep up pressure on the Serbian police and
military forces carrying out attacks against ethnic Albanian
civilians and soldiers of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army inside
the province, striking a multiple rocket launcher system, armored
vehicles, storage areas, and a police command post, Marani said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the top allied commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said at
a news briefing here that five weeks of bombing and bad weather had
not prevented the Serb forces from reinforcing and continuing
sweeps that have driven hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians &UR;  &LR; 
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's command said Wednesday that reinforcements that had kept
Serb military and police forces in the province at a strength of
about 40,000 since the bombing started were actually signs that the
allied air campaign was hurting the Serb forces in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some misinterpretation of this reinforcement,''
Marani said. ``Let me clarify its significance. It in fact
demonstrates two key points. First, the Serb military cannot make
good the losses the air campaign has inflicted on their forces in
Kosovo. The Serbs are unable to reconstitute their forces in Kosovo
and must rely on reinforcement with new units from outside
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Marani said, the reinforcements showed that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic had made a major miscalculation about
the length of time his forces would need to eliminate the Kosovo
Liberation Army and its challenge to Serbian rule over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could defeat the KLA with his existing forces on
the ground in a short five-to-seven-day operation,'' Marani said.
``This, as the reinforcement and duration of these operations in
Kosovo show, was completely wrong, and is further testimony to the
success of the air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The command reported Wednesday that, despite the bombing, Serb
forces were continuing attacks against the rebels in three general
areas around the province, southwest of Podujevo north of the
provincial capital of Pristina, east of Globocica near the border
with Macedonia, and northeast of the town of Suva Reka, near
Prizren in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla forces, Clark said Tuesday, had not been defeated
and were still able to put up stiff resistance to the Serbs. NATO
spokesman Jamie P. Shea said Wednesday that the rebels still had at
least 12,000 fighters inside Kosovo, although NATO has denied
having any contact with the KLA in the field and Shea did not give
any indication of the source of his estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying also to create two corridors from Albania into
Kosovo, which can be used of course not only as resupply circuits
but for the evacuation of refugees and displaced persons in the
safest circumstances,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb military and heavily armed police units fighting
against the rebels are also trying to cut their supply lines from
Albania along the western border of Kosovo near Djakovica,
according to the command.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Nancy Ramsey is out of the ``broom
closet,'' as she puts it, and studying witchcraft at the University
of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Florida native is a practicing witch and a
second-degree priestess in the Wicca faith, who believes in spirits
and spreading good magic. She is working on a Ph.D. at the
university's religious studies department.
</P>
<P>
   Her field of research centers on Wicca, a pagan religion
practiced by modern witches. The research focuses on how witches
view themselves and how that self-image is affected by the way
others, such as the media, fundamentalist Christians and Hollywood,
treat the ancient faith.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey and others in the department say little is known about
neo-paganism. Her work may shed light on an otherwise vague topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her research will yield some very interesting information,''
said UCSB religious studies professor Wade Clark Roof, who serves
as Ramsey's Ph.D. adviser. ``She will find out a great deal more
about who contemporary pagans and witches are. She will find out
about their networks and their views, their practices and beliefs.
All that will let us understand modern paganism a lot better than
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey is well suited to the task because she's felt a spiritual
link to the pagan culture since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not raised with a religious tradition,'' Ramsey said in
an interview at her Ventura home. ``But my father grew up in
Appalachia and his family believed in ghosts and spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey encountered a reappearing spirit she called ``the blue
lady'' during her youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She watched over me. She was the spirit I was most familiar
with,'' Ramsey said of the apparition.
</P>
<P>
   The mystic heritage made Ramsey a popular figure in grade
school. She traded amulets with friends and performed dream
interpretation for schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   Other families in her Daytona, Fla., neighborhood worried about
the young girl's strange ways and urged her to attend their church,
so Ramsey grew curious about religion at a very early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in how people make sense of the
world, and religion is a way we have done that from the
beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect, Ramsey's quaint home is loaded with various
totems. There's a wreath and a pentagram over the doorway that
leads to Ramsey's kitchen; a Buddha and a Ganesha, the Hindu deity
of learning, stand in her hallway. A knife, its blade side facing
upward for good luck, hangs over the front door. A statue of a
Chinese god of wealth adorns her living room. She also keeps a deck
of tarot cards on hand in case someone needs advice.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey is a witch who embraces all forms of religious energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a religious studies student, so I collect lots of
things,'' she said while her infant daughter, Dana, slept in a
nearby crib.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the tarot cards, which Ramsey consulted to select a
doctoral dissertation, there is nothing particularly unusual about
the Ph.D. student's life or academic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it is like being in an office with anyone else,''
said Josephine McMullen, a fellow religious studies scholar who
shares space with Ramsey at UCSB. ``She is a nice, friendly person.
I only found out a few months ago that she was a witch. She is just
like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the point Ramsey wants people to understand. Though
Hollywood often treats witches with contempt _ remember the
terrifying flying monkeys of the ``Wizard of Oz'' and their evil
mistress, the Wicked Witch of the West _ Ramsey's Ph.D. work seeks
to expose the ordinary face of modern pagans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pagans come to the religion because they like magic and loved
fantasy as children,'' Ramsey said. ``They are people who saw
themselves as outsiders, who found a community that celebrates
their uniqueness. We are like the Uncola, or the Unchristians.''
</P>
<P>
   That uniqueness has kept a lot of pagans ``in the broom
closet,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Her research indicates that there are a lot more witches about
than most people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for a lot of them to come out because many people
don't understand paganism,'' Ramsey said. ``Some people think we
are satanists who drink babies' blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey described Wicca as a European-based religion that
predates Christianity. Modern witches have a magical world view and
believe they can influence events with positive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind magic is that you can affect things,'' she
said. ``You might do a spell to get a job, but the spell is mostly
a way to generate positive thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ramsey, there is no such thing as a wicked witch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witches are healers who work to keep their lives in harmony
with nature,'' she said. ``They work for good and not harm. We are
ordinary people who believe in a serious and ethical religion.''

SERBIAN TOWN STUNNED AS NATO BOMBING KILLS 20 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURDULICA, Yugoslavia _ ``We grew up together,'' said Momir
Andjelkovic, his eyes veined and red, staring at the green,
encircling hills. ``He was my finest friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic stopped, dropping his clouded eyes to the mound of
rubble across narrow Zmaj Jovina Street, where Alexander Milic, 37,
died Tuesday afternoon. Milic's wife, Vesna, 35, also died. So did
his mother and his two children, Miljana, 15, and Vladimir, 11 _
all of them killed about noon Tuesday when an errant NATO bomb
obliterated their new house and the cellar in which they were
seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived together here for 32 years, for good and bad,''
Andjelkovic said. ``He was a great man, a great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He sobbed once, briefly. ``This was a completely new house,
three stories, with completely new furniture,'' he said, still
astonished at the jagged pile of refuse where it once stood. ``It
had a large basement. Everyone felt safe there. But the whole
family died.''
</P>
<P>
   Dying with them were at least two cousins _ Stanica Rasic, 21,
and Dragan Manoluv, 18. Altogether, Yugoslav officials said 20
civilians, half of them children, died in this town of 11,000
people 200 miles south of Belgrade, near the Bulgarian border. At
least six houses were completely destroyed and another 20 or so had
significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance from Milic's house, his father, Vojislav, head
bent, sat on a broken bit of wall, cupping an unlit cigarette in
his palm.
</P>
<P>
   He was in shock. Two women hovered, arms around his shoulders,
squeezing them through his black jacket as if he might otherwise
fall over. They urged him in steady whispers to stand up, to eat
something, to drink some water.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Milic rocked silently, oblivious, his head bobbing up
and down with the even beat of a human heart.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said that this was yet another
accident of war. At least one laser-guided bomb was apparently
``blinded'' by the smoke from a previous and accurate detonation,
the officials said, and fell 200 or 300 yards from its intended
target _ an army barracks and military depot that had previously
been bombed. In the past, officials have blamed clouds or hostile
fire for apparently interfering with a laser beamed from the plane
to the target to guide the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The barracks is at least 500 yards away. Only after Western
journalists saw another large crater a half-mile from Alexander
Milic's house did NATO officials then concede that they ``could not
exclude'' that another bomb might have gone astray. The other
crater _ a nearly perfect scoop in the earth, about 30 feet across
and 20 feet deep _ had blasted three houses away on muddy
Beogradska Street. The hole, slowly filling with ground water, was
scattered with the debris of human life: filthy clothes, exploded
sofa cushions, pill boxes, the back of an oven, the cracked circuit
board from a television set.
</P>
<P>
   No one died here, officials said, although at least five people
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's swift if incomplete acknowledgment of an attack
that went wrong contrasted with its initial responses earlier this
month to a NATO air attack that killed about 70 ethnic Albanian
civilians near the town of Djakovica. It took days then for the
command to determine that allied planes had indeed fired on the
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death can be a blessing, too,'' said Borica Novkovic. The
house of her son, Stanko, 35, was obliterated. Stanko, his wife
Tatjana and their 8-month-old daughter, Andrijana, were not in the
house. ``My son is not here,'' Mrs. Novkovic said, with pride.
``Stanko is in the army now.''
</P>
<P>
   The noise was indescribable, she said. ``The sound was like a
huge blow on my head. Everything turned over and rolled down the
hill. Radica was screaming, screaming, when we came to help her,''
Mrs. Novkovic said, bending to pull up her coarse woolen stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Radica Rastic's house was closest to the impact. ``She was taken
from the house all twisted and bent over,'' Mrs. Novkovic said.
``She was shaking and shaking, her hands were pressed tight over
her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Perica Jovanovic, a 44-year-old economist at the Narodni Bank,
said: ``I'll never forget the strange voice of the bomb. When the
plane is flying and drops the bomb the noise changes,'' he said.
``It's awful. It's like the static on the radio but so loud, and
then there is this awful crash and pressure and everything moves
and boils up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic was outside with his two children, Biljana, 13, and
Nemanje, 8. ``Somehow we stayed alive,'' he said quietly, with
care. ``But I think these NATO bastards will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped and glared. ``You should pass through that,'' he
said. ``Americans should have this experience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He softened then, to say: ``People think I'm very calm, but I'm
not, I'm very upset. Here you have 11,000 people who are crazy,
nervous. People died here and what was the aim? There is nothing
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw up his hands. ``We were very brave for 34 days, but
we've moved now,'' he said. ``I've moved the family now to a lake
in the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 yards from the crater, a half-finished house was badly
damaged. On the lintel above the door was a hand-painted sign:
``Kuca na prodaju'' _ house for sale _ ``Tel: 85-552.''
</P>
<P>
   On Zmaj Jovina Street, Slobodan Milosevic, 48, the bearer of a
common Serbian name, stood covered with dust in the ruins of his
own house, across the street from Milic's. Photographers had
scrambled up to the second floor, easily visible from the street
because the entire front of Milosevic's house had been ripped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is a ruin,'' he said. ``To build it I worked four
years in Africa _ two in Tunisia and two in Algeria.'' He laughed
sourly. ``Now I'll have to go there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, a civil engineer, was visiting relatives with his
wife, Sladjana, 45, son Sasa, 25, and daughter Suzana, 22, when the
bomb hit his street.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when I saw it all was that we were very lucky
not to be in the house, because we would have died,'' he said.
``We're alive, so we will build another house.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sure that NATO had aimed for the houses. ``It's
impossible for the pilot to make this mistake,'' he said. ``The sky
was clear. He couldn't miss. The barracks isn't even that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his neighbor, Alexander Milic, Milosevic said he
worked in a small factory, PES, that made components for Zastava,
the huge car and munitions factory in Kragujevac that NATO has
completely destroyed. Milic also owned two small convenience stores
in town, and it seemed he was returning home for lunch when the air
raid sirens sounded and he and his family and neighbors went down
to the basement of his house. ``But Momir,'' he said, ``was really
his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic described how he went down to his own basement with
his parents and emerged to see what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand what was going on,'' he said. ``There
was dust everywhere, and the houses existing two minutes before _
right in front of my house _ were just gone. I heard people
screaming, and one of the people down there was my uncle. We tried
to dig with our hands, I made him a small hole to breathe until
first aid could come.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncle, Stojanka Petkovic, 65, ``was the only one to survive
this house.'' He pointed to the elder Milic, still sitting frozen
on the wall. ``He came from somewhere else,'' Andjelkovic said.
``He lost everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked quietly if he thought that keeping foreign troops out of
Kosovo was worth this kind of price, Andjelkovic looked up,
stunned. ``I don't understand the question,'' he said. ``You
shouldn't ask me that now _ we can talk about that in 10 or 15
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``We haven't buried these people and you want
to ask me that?''

JUDGE DECIDES TO MOVE DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL OUT OF JASPER AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The capital murder trial of the second of three
white men accused in the brutal dragging death of a black man will
be moved out of Jasper County, a judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Monte Lawlis said he will issue a ruling by
May 14 naming where the trial of Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 32,
of Sulphur Springs, will be. He said he must discuss details of how
to handle the move with officials of other counties before deciding
just where the trial will be held. He said he expects to begin
picking a jury by July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers had earlier considered
Georgetown, just north of Austin, as a site for the trial. Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Wednesday that several
cities are being considered. He would not name the possible sites,
but Corpus Christi, Galveston, Kerrville and New Braunfels had
earlier been discussed as possible sites.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's order came less than a week after Lawlis had denied
a change of venue request by Brewer's lawyers. He said he granted
the change Wednesday after both sides agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he still believes that a Jasper County jury could give
Brewer, accused in the June 7 dragging death of 49-year-old James
Byrd Jr., a fair trial. He said the venue issue is the only matter
in the case he expects to offer any possible grounds for appeal,
and he didn't want to have to be repeatedly defending that issue in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, he didn't want the venue issue to become a
major part of the lengthy process of picking a jury for Brewer's
trial. ``I didn't want it to be turned into a side show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Barlow, Brewer's court-appointed attorney, said that
while prospective jurors in Jasper County may think they were being
fair, comments made after co-defendant John William King was
convicted and sentenced to death made it clear that many in Jasper
think guilty convictions help the reputation of their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care where it goes, just so it's outside of Jasper
County,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said it is significant that defense attorneys claim a white
defendant accused of the racial killing of a black man can't get a
fair trial in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have had 150 years with no Klansman having ever been
convicted of killing a black man in East Texas and then you have
Bill King being convicted in Jasper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have a Klansman who says he can't get a fair trial
in Jasper.''
</P>
<P>
   King and Brewer, who served prison sentences together in a Texas
prison, were identified as being members of a Ku Klux Klan offshoot
group.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order specifies only that the trial will be moved
beyond an adjoining county. Gray said he thinks it's important to
move the trial beyond the Beaumont media market.
</P>
<P>
   While many Jasper residents have said they wanted all three
trials held in their county, Gray said most have said they realize
that spending more money to move the trial would be better than to
risk having to try Brewer again.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the third suspect, Shawn Allen Berry, 24, of
Jasper, has said he wants to keep his trial in Jasper. That trial
will probably begin next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said moving Brewer's trial might cost the county $50,000
more than having it in Jasper. So far Jasper County has spent more
than $283,000 on the court cases related to Byrd's murder _ most of
it on King's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those trials and several other unrelated and
unexpected capital murder cases, Jasper County Commissioners
increased the county tax rate by 2 cents per $100 valuation. The
increase was expected to last for two or three years. Gray said
moving Brewer's trial may mean the increase will be in effect for
one additional year.

VOLATILE MIX OF PRESSURES FACES TEENS, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies the size of the video game market in 1997.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Ramsey remembers the first time he gave his son
Evan a popsicle. The boy laughed and chased it around the tray of
his highchair with his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey had a sleepless night Tuesday. The rampage at Columbine
High School, in Littleton, Colo., had him thinking about Evan, who
two years ago, as an acne-scarred teenager, marched into his high
school in rural Alaska and used a shotgun to kill the principal and
a popular sophomore basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flashback time, you know,'' said Ramsey, speaking by
telephone from Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey said he still finds it difficult to reconcile the
conflicting images of his son: the innocent toddler and the
16-year-old killer. Although the massacre this week at Columbine
seems equally impossible to comprehend, researchers say it exploded
from several disturbing changes that are occurring simultaneously
in the way children are growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than random events or even copycat crimes, the eight
school shootings since 1996, which have killed 33 and wounded at
least 70, are byproducts of a growing subculture of severely
troubled youth, many researchers say. Inside this mostly hidden
world, millions of teens suffer from serious, untreated mood
disorders _ particularly depression _ and see violence as the
primary means of handling conflict. Their desperate alienation has
been made potentially lethal by guns that now seem as easy to
obtain as a six-pack of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, many adults tend to view teenagers as children in the
midst of losing their innocence, their angst no different than what
they as children went through. Such assumptions are dangerous,
researchers say. ``There's no comparison,'' said Peter C. Scales, a
senior fellow at the Search Institute, a non-profit research
organization in Minneapolis that specializes in youth issues. ``It
was fantasyland 40 years ago. And that forces us into very
difficult questions today. I just hope we have the guts to have a
debate about some of these issues and not just pretend that putting
a metal detector up is the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Alan Unis, a psychiatrist and brain researcher at the
University of Washington, examined Barry Loukaitis, who committed
the first of the school shootings. Loukaitis, a wan 14-year-old,
opened the door of his algebra class at Moses Lake (Wash.) junior
high school, held up a .30-30 deer rifle and opened fire. He killed
two 14-year-old classmates and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Unis, who was asked by the prosecution to examine Loukaitis, was
stunned by what he found. Loukaitis was in the throes of depression
so severe he seemed almost catatonic. ``He was cold _ cold and
scary,'' Unis recalled. ``I can't begin to tell you how many times
since then I've thought about him.'' Behind eyes as blank as
marbles, Loukaitis showed no remorse. ``At one point I asked him
what should be done,'' said Unis. ``He told me, `True justice would
be to turn me over to the parents of the kids I killed and let them
do what they want to me.' He was still living by this credo of kill
and be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unis was unnerved, believing he had gotten a glimpse of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the beginning,'' he warned prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Unis said he believed that Loukaitis, who wore all black, like
the two Columbine killers, was an extreme example of trends he had
seen in his practice. Although there has been no systematic
analysis of the 10 boys who have committed the recent shootings,
they have shown similar characteristics: severe depression,
isolation, a fixation on death and violence, immersion in violent
video games and, perhaps most striking, an almost total absence of
empathy for their victims. Ramsey, shortly after committing two
murders in his rampage through the halls of Bethel Regional High,
calmly asked state troopers for a sandwich. Witnesses to the
Columbine shootings reported that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
the two apparent perpetrators, gleefully yelled, ``We've waited to
do this our whole lives!''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gorin, the executive director of the National Association
of School Psychologists, dismissed the theory that the boys were
inherently evil. ``They're not born with different violent
tendencies,'' she said. ``Any more so than kids ever were. It's all
environmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Scales said the difference in adolescence ``these days is the
cocktail that we've got is so much more explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Depression
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 1.5
million children under 18 suffer from serious depression. The
numbers may be much higher, many researchers say, given the
apparent obsession many teens seem to have with suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, conducted by the Centers
for Disease Control, more than 1 in 5 students said they had
seriously considered suicide the previous year; 7.7 percent said
they had actually made one or more attempts. Based on Department of
Education figures, the statistics indicate that more than 1 million
high school students attempted suicide last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Columbine shootings, in which the killers took their
own lives, most of the school shootings appear to have started as
elaborate plans by the shooters to end their lives in a blaze of
glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoot me,'' said 15-year-old Kip Kinkel, after he was
wrestled to the ground at the end of a shooting spree in
Springfield, Ore., last year.
</P>
<P>
   --Video games
</P>
<P>
   The $5.1 billion video-game market has grown larger than the
film industry. Although the vast majority of the games are
non-violent and even educational, some 5 percent are so-called
``point-and-shoot'' games in which the player employs a full
arsenal of weapons to wantonly kill. The systems are often similar
to those designed by the military to break down a soldier's natural
aversion to killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you actually play the point-and-shoot games you are
learning the motor skills to kill,'' said Colonel David Grossman, a
former West Point professor of behavioral sciences and the author
of a 1995 book on how people learn to kill. ``You are being
reinforced, you are being rewarded, not to passively accept the
violence of others, but to inflict the violence yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Immersion in the point-and-shoot games has been a thread
throughout the school shootings, and it surfaced again as a factor
in the Columbine killings. Eric Harris seems to have been an expert
at the so-called Doom series, in which the player's sole mission is
to kill, using everything from a pistol to a grenade launcher to
something called a B.F.G. 2000, which apparently stands for Big
(expletive) Gun.
</P>
<P>
   --Weapons
</P>
<P>
   According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 8.5 percent of
students reported they had carried a gun, knife, or club onto
school property at least once in the previous month. Based on
Department of Education estimates of 14.6 million high-school
students nationwide, the survey indicates that more than 1.2
million students have carried some kind of weapon onto school
property in any given month.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education reported that 6,093 students were
expelled during the 1996-97 school year for bringing a gun to
school. That number is believed to vastly underestimate the number
of guns in schools; by some estimates, 270,000 guns are taken into
schools each day.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel, the Springfield, Ore., killer, received a .22-caliber
semiautomatic Ruger rifle, then a .9 mm Glock pistol from his
father. When those were taken away, he bought another gun from a
classmate with $110 he had earned staining his parents' deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The access to guns is unconscionable,'' said Gorin. Referring
to Columbine, she said: ``You can't kill 13 people with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a first step to respond to the shootings, the Department of
Education issued a list of guidelines last year outlining how to
recognize potentially dangerous students. The guidelines were
issued to 190,000 school principals, but many researchers say the
measures fall woefully short of what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policymakers have shown an ability to wring their hands, then
tinker around the edges and not face the really difficult issues,''
said Scales.
</P>
<P>
   He and others argue that schools are ill-equipped to deal with
the growing mental health needs of students and should focus on
providing more counselors. But Bill Modzeleski, director of the
Department of Education's safe and drug-free schools program,
questioned whether that was feasible. ``If suddenly we could wave a
magic wand and hire 100,000 more counselors, that would be great,
but that's not how policy is made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Poland, who heads a crisis-management team that treated
traumatized students after shootings in West Paducah, Ky., and
Jonesboro, Ark., has argued that tensions in schools are so high
that students should no longer be left alone after school with so
much time on their hands. ``We may even have to lengthen the school
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reyne Athanas said answers will be difficult to find. A
former art teacher at Bethel Regional, she tried unsuccessfully to
get Evan Ramsey to give up his shotgun during his rampage through
the halls of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Athanas was sitting in a meeting when someone walked in
and said, ``It's happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas said she burst into tears. ``I just can't believe it,''
she said. ``It's unbelievable. I feel so, so sorry for those
people. I know what they're going to be going though the next
couple of years. You go through everything from extreme anger, and
then you think about what could have been done and the guilt sets
in. It really runs havoc in your personal relationships, working,
sleeping, and eating. And then everytime it happens, it all comes
back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanas said she believed it would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what it is: It's a mindset, and it's nationwide.
It comes from eveything that seems to be going on in our society
and continues to go on because we're all too apathetic to fix it.
And do I know how to fix it? No.''

U.N. RIGHTS COMMISSION VOTE CALLS FOR WORLDWIDE MORATORIUM ON
EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The U.N. Human Rights Commission voted overwhelmingly
Wednesday in favor of a worldwide moratorium on executions over the
objections of fewer than a dozen countries, including the United
States, China, Rwanda and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, sponsored by the European Union, is viewed by
human rights advocates as a step towards abolishing the death
penalty around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-member commission voted 30-11 in favor of the measure,
with 12 countries abstaining. Both the United States and China,
accused by human rights groups as the most frequent users of
capital punishment, voted against the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the American delegation, Nancy Rubin, defended the
practice in the United States, where 38 of the 50 states permit the
death penalty. ``A noticeable majority of our citizens support the
death penalty for particularly heinous crimes and our laws support
this,'' she told delegates attending the commission's annual
session.
</P>
<P>
   If the American public changes its view, Ms. Rubin said, ``there
is little question our laws will follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, American officials recognize that ``a
significant number of countries have abolished the death penalty,''
she noted. A report by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to the
commission found that 65 countries, including France and Germany,
have abolished capital punishment, while 88 countries retain it.
</P>
<P>
   The American vote put it in the company of Bangladesh, Botswana,
Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, South Korea, and Qatar as well as
Rwanda, China and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission voted in favor of similar resolutions in
past years, this is the first time the European Union as a whole
had sponsored a resolution on the topic. The EU text urged
countries ``to progressively restrict the number of offenses for
which the death penalty may be imposed and to establish a
moratorium on executions, with a view to completely abolishing the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the resolution asked countries not to permit
executions ``for any but the most serious crimes'' and then only
when a ``final judgment'' is ``rendered by an independent and
impartial competent court.'' The resolution also called on
governments not to execute anyone who was under 18 when the crime
was committed, pregnant women, or whenever any legal proceeding is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the resolution urged barring the execution of
people with ``any form of mental disorder'' and the extradition of
suspects who would face capital punishment in another country.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Italy has spearheaded the drive against the death
penalty. Capital punishment became a very public issue in Italy
last year when the country refused to extradite the Kurdish rebel
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, because Turkey has the death penalty for
convicted terrorists. Ocalan left Italy in January, and was
captured by Turkish commandoes in Kenya in February and is now
awaiting trial on charges of treason in Turkey. Prosecutors have
asked for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Germany introduced the resolution, arguing that its passage was
essential because ``there is the possibility of judicial error
anywhere.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Human rights groups have made abolishing capital punishment a
top priority. Amnesty International said that the United States had
executed more than 500 people since it reinstated the death penalty
in 1977. According to its latest statistics, more than 2,375 people
were executed in 40 countries in 1997, and 3,700 sentenced to death
in 69 countries.
</P>
<P>
   By far the greatest number of executions were carried out in
China _ approximately 1,644 in 1997, with Iran and Saudi Arabia
trailing with about 143 and 122 respectively. The United States had
74 executions that year. The London-based rights group said that it
had also received reports of hundreds of executions in Iraq that
year that it was unable to confirm.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 countries bar execution for juvenile offenders,
which is also prohibited under international human rights treaties.
However, six countries are known to have executed prisoners under
18 since 1990, including Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the
United States and Yemen, Amnesty International said.
</P>
<P>
   The country with the highest number of of such executions was
the United States, where six juvenile offenders have been put to
death since 1990, the advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.N. special investigator on such executions urged
that they be abolished. Her predecessor, Waly Bacre Ndiaye, issued
a report in 1997, based on an 18-day trip to the United States,
that said the death penalty was applied in an unfair,
discriminatory and arbitrary manner.

<P>
   PHOENIX - It's 12:36 a.m., my eyes fly wide open and I find
myself gasping for breath. I look at the clock and realize that
it's only been three minutes since the last time I've blown my
nose. I find my tissue and blow until I hear my ears pop.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sick.
</P>
<P>
   I have allergies.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1:07 a.m., my eyes fly open, I gasp for breath, it's been a
minute and a half since I've blown my nose. I feel for my tissue
and blow until I think I've dislodged an eye.
</P>
<P>
   I have bad allergies.
</P>
<P>
   It's 2:14 a.m., I'm awake, I can't breathe and I can't find my
tissue. I blow my nose on my T-shirt until I wake the dogs and my
husband rolls over and blindly bats his hands at me.
</P>
<P>
   I am dying.
</P>
<P>
   It's 2:15 a.m. I wander down the dark hallway, step in a pile of
fresh puppy doody and proceed to the bathroom, where I look into
the mirror and try to determine if either of my nostrils is large
enough to accept the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't slept in excess of an hour in almost three weeks,
since the morning when I woke up and thought that someone had
poured the foundation of a house into my nose. Every time I breathe
in, my sinuses sound like I'm about to complete a magic trick. If I
breathe out, my nose whistles and my mouth wheezes. I'm one big
histamine accordion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the unhealthiest person I know,'' my mother said over
the phone. ``That's what you get for eating nothing but sugar!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sick,'' I protested. ``I have allergies!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you listening to polka music?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not,'' I answered weakly. ``That's my respiratory
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I heard a drum roll,'' she mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be my left nostril,'' I added. ``My right one
sounds more like a tambourine.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm well into my 30s, have lived in Arizona since 1972 and have
never had this kind of reaction to my environment before. Ever.
I've had allergies for a day here and there, but nothing like this.
As a result, there is enough pressure in my head to cook a pot
roast, and I've taken to wearing two rolls of Charmin around my
wrists like bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   When I sneezed the day before last, something came out of my
head that was so big that I got scared and tried to put it back.
</P>
<P>
   Several days ago, my neighbor told me a joke and, as I started
to laugh, I felt my nose give birth to a snot bubble that grew to
the size of a tennis ball before it erupted and left a big shiny
mark on my cheek.
</P>
<P>
   I have taken more medication than Doris Duke, ingesting the
equivalent of an eight ball of TheraFlu, Afrin and Extra-Strength
Sudafed each day. I wondered why I was crying during ``Party of
Five'' until I understood that the tears were coming from my nose,
and it was at that point that I abandoned the rolls of Charmin and
started carrying a towel.
</P>
<P>
   Things were getting bad, and I didn't even know what I was
allergic``'' (begin ital) to. (end ital) It was just something
(begin ital) out there. (end ital) At least with a cold, I could
see a light at the end of the tunnel. But with this, there was no
salvation, and I couldn't even identify the enemy. It was just
going to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, I would have to live my life with a wad of toilet
paper planted in each nasal opening; the shiny red sheen above my
upper lip that had begun to develop from the excessive use of paper
towels; and in a constant antihistamine stupor that often left me
staring at the plaster on my walls, imagining that I saw freaky
little devil faces. The only other thing I could do was lie on the
couch and watch TV, flipping myself over every half-hour to let
each nostril drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Linus Sinus,'' my husband said tonight as we were getting
ready for bed. ``Get your Booger Blanket off my side. It's coming
dangerously close to my pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate you,'' I replied, pulling the Booger Blanket closer to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big words from a little lady with feminine hygiene products
shoved up her nose,'' he said as he laughed at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not tampons!'' I shouted. ``They're tissue plugs so I
don't drown in my own fluids!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, those things better not fall out at night!'' he
asserted. ``I don't want to get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sick!'' I yelled. ``I have allergies! Just look at me!
My eyes are so swollen I can't find my eyelids! I'm pretty sure
that I saw a chunk of my short-term memory in a wad of toilet
paper! I've become a MOUTH BREATHER. This is not sick! With sick
you can get better. Allergies are FOREVER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I roll over and see that you're letting your nose drip all
over my pillow, you're in big trouble,'' my husband said as he
pointed at me. ``And I don't want to wake up and find one of those
snot pellets next to my mouth or anything. Because I will freak
out.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:27 a.m., I wake from a dream that the nose tampons have
stretched my nostrils wide enough to accept the corner attachment
of the vacuum cleaner if I clip off most of the bristles.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when my husband calls out from the other end
of the house to ask me why the vacuum cleaner is in the bathroom, I
get out of bed to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' I say as I stand in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' he says, holding a nose tampon in one hand and
pointing to a wadded-up tissue in the wastebasket with the other.
``I think that's the part of your brain that stores phone numbers!
What have you done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' I reply, throwing up my hands. ``But listen to
this pair of clear nostrils!'' &QL;

SUPREME COURT HEARS MORE ARGUMENTS ON INTERPRETATION OF
DISABILITIES ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court continued an unusually intensive
review of the Americans with Disabilities Act Wednesday, as the
justices struggled to find a definition of disability that would be
faithful to the law without also sweeping everyone with a readily
correctable physical problem into its protective net.
</P>
<P>
   After an argument on Tuesday on whether to count as disabled a
truck driver whose severe hypertension was controlled by
medication, the court Wednesday heard two cases involving employees
with vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   Twin sisters, regional airline pilots whose vision is 20/20 with
their glasses on, were turned down for employment by United Air
Lines because their uncorrected vision was worse than the airline's
requirement of 20/100. The federal appeals court in Denver found
they did not have a disability and so could not sue for
discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who sees out of only one eye but whose brain has
compensated for the deficiency and given him normal vision in most
respects was dismissed by his employer on the ground that his
monocular vision did not meet safety standards. The federal appeals
court in San Francisco ruled that he was disabled, and was entitled
to a trial to show that he was nonetheless qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The central question in the cases is whether a condition should
be assessed in its corrected or uncorrected state for purposes of
determining whether a person is protected by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin S. Kneedler, a deputy solicitor general who presented the
government's position that courts should look at impairments in
their uncorrected state, said it was an ``anomaly'' for United Air
Lines to have ``made its decision not to hire precisely on the
basis of uncorrected vision'' and then to argue that the women
could not sue because their corrected vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines disability as an impairment that ``substantially
limits one or more of the major life activities.'' This use of the
``present indicative tense'' showed that Congress was concerned
only with conditions as they actually affect people, Roy T.
Englert, Jr., the airline's lawyer, told the court in arguing that
corrective devices should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   This answer did not satisfy Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who said
he was concerned that this definition would exclude ``the very
people the statute was aimed at,'' who might be the victims of
prejudice on the part of employers despite managing to function
well with their impairments. ``They wouldn't get in the door,''
Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether, if a nearsighted
person whose vision was corrected to 20/20 through laser surgery
would be considered for employment, the airline could exclude
someone who achieved the same result by wearing glasses. ``Isn't
what's really going on here is that the employer will not accept
the correction?'' she asked Englert.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's lawyer replied that ``it's not a matter of
rejecting the correction, but of saying here's what it takes to be
a safe pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Current Federal Aviation Administration standards permit
certification of pilots as long as their vision is correctable to
20/20. The question of whether United's higher standard is
reasonable is not at issue in this phase of the case, Sutton vs.
United Air Lines, No. 97-1943. If the sisters, Karen Sutton and
Kimberly Hinton, are found to be disabled, they will then have to
show that they are nonetheless qualified for the job they want.
</P>
<P>
   Van Aaron Hughes, the lawyer for the sisters, tried to assure
the justices that they did not need to adopt an all or nothing
approach to the definitional problem. ``It's never been our
position that the mere fact of wearing glasses, or any corrective
device, is itself a disability,'' he said. Rather, he continued,
each case had to be evaluated individually. ``The severity of the
impairment is critical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist sounded doubtful. ``What's
the difference between 20/40 and 20/200 if in their corrected state
they're both the same?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Hughes said the difference was similar to that between
two people, each of whom took a pill. ``It makes a difference
whether you swallow a pill for a mild headache in the afternoon or
to avoid an epileptic seizure,'' he said, adding that what mattered
was whether, without correction, the person faced a substantial
limitation on the ability to perform major life activities.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter said he felt himself ``at sea on what
the criterion for `substantial' should be. ``I have difficulty in
reading restaurant checks in a dim light,'' Souter said. ``I have a
limitation on the `life activity' of reading. Substantial?''
</P>
<P>
   The law would not treat such a limitation as substantial, Hughes
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Souter asked, adding: ``The waiter thinks so.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument in the case of the monocular truck driver,
Albertson's, Inc. vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591, focused on a
separate source of confusion, the statute's alternative definition
of disability. The law treats as disabled not only someone with a
substantial limitation but also someone who is ``regarded as''
having one. Because the court has never interpreted the ``regarded
as'' language, its utility as a form of back-up protection,
covering those who might not otherwise come within the statute, is
an important issue in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett Gordon, the lawyer for the supermarket chain that
dismissed the truck driver, Hallie Kirkingburg, said Albertson's
did not regard Kirkingburg as disabled because it offered him
another, lower-paying job as a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether a job offer as a floor
sweeper would have shown that the company did not regard
Kirkingburg as disabled. Possibly it would have, Ms. Gordon
replied, adding that the focus should be on the ``mental status of
the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how to figure it out,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument session Wednesday was the last one of the court's
current term. The justices now have roughly two months to complete
their unfinished business, which consists essentially of deciding
39 cases. That is a substantial number, given the fact that the
court has issued decisions in only 37 cases in the six months since
the term began.

   HOLLYWOOD _ A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there
might have been something like it. But even Mann's Chinese Theater,
the gaudy ground-zero of movie fandom, has never seen anything
quite like the global village that is snaking along its scarred old
sidewalk in the heart of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   They have been here for nearly three weeks now, this shifting
band of 30 hardy souls, camped in pup tents and equipped with
laptops, cell phones, digital video cameras and an Internet
connection that broadcasts their vigil live to the world. They have
just three more weeks until ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace'' opens on the Chinese's big screen, and they are determined
to be first in line. The Force is clearly with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw ``Star Wars,'' it was like a life-defining
moment,'' said Cecil Seaskull, 29, an aspiring singer-songwriter
and children's book author who collects vintage ``Star Wars''
action figures (especially broken ones) and now waits on the
sidewalk virtually 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ``It was the
first time I was conscious of stories and that they could be
powerful and that that's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seaskull's story is echoed by a dozen Gen-Xers up and down
the line, many others among them born too late to see the first
``Star Wars'' in theaters in 1977, or even its sequels, ``The
Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the Jedi'' (1983),
until all three were reissued in a 20th anniversary tour two years
ago. But they have watched the trilogy over and over on
videocassettes and have found in George Lucas' epic saga of good
and evil something like their system of belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond appeal, it's a cultural icon for us,'' said
Lincoln Gasking, a 22-year-old entrepreneur from Melbourne,
Australia, who organized the line here and others around the
country (including one scheduled to begin forming at the Ziegfeld
Theater in New York on May 1) on his Web site,
www.countingdown.com. Gasking continues to run his apartment rental
business over the Internet from a sidewalk computer. ``For a lot of
people here, it was one of the most enjoyable times in their
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasking is nothing if not organized. He obtained a permit from
the city and liability insurance to cover 250 sitters. He cadged
free computers and cell phones from corporations, borrowed power
from a neighboring souvenir stand and established general
headquarters across the street at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,
the site of the first Academy Awards ceremony, where members of the
group take turns showering. He has arranged for line-sitters to
enlist sponsors who pay at least 25 cents for each hour spent in
line, with the proceeds going to the Starlight Children's
Foundation, which grants wishes for ill children and is a favorite
charity of actor Mark Hamill, ``Luke Skywalker'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   Self-governance prevails on the street. Steve Cote, 28, a
freelance camera assistant in the movie business who comes down
from his home in the suburban San Fernando Valley to wait, oversees
a system in which sitters accumulate points on a sliding scale
depending on when they arrived and how many 4-hour shifts they sit,
with the first shifts April 7 worth 100 points and those in the
final week worth 5. Those with the most points will get first
chance at tickets whenever they go on sale, perhaps May 12, a week
before the nationwide opening May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Among the minutes of a recent meeting posted on a tent was this
injunction: ``Sleeping in hotel, watching a movie at the Chinese,
shower breaks longer than 1/2 hour and sit-down eating in a
restaurant are things that need to be signed out for.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a bit too bureaucratic for Daniel Alter, 17, a
recent high school graduate and aspiring film student who calls
``Star Wars'' ``modern American mythology that transcends every
race, religion, generation, class.'' Alter came from his home in
suburban Tarzana to set up a folding chair outside Mann's Village
Theater in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, a few miles miles,
on April 7, and dismisses Gasking as a self-promoter. He said some
of Gasking's troops at the Village had given up and joined his more
ad-hoc line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to wear name tags or have sign-in sheets or
get sponsors,'' said Alter, who has been plotting his own mission
for three years and is first in line for his favorite, acoustically
perfect seat at the Village, P107. ``They defected to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all the sort of publicity a studio cannot buy, but Tom
Sherak, chairman of the 20th Century Fox Domestic Film Group, which
is releasing the movie, said the studio had stayed away from the
line-sitters because it did not want to be accused of hyping a
grass-roots effort. ``This is their thing, not ours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherak has paid a couple of incognito visits to the lines
and called them ``an amazing phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that makes us so special as a people, I
believe,'' Sherak said, ``the fact that we can come together with
strangers for something like this.'' He said the studio was
considering how to do something to honor the line-sitters as the
release date approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't figured it out yet,'' he said. ``Maybe in a couple
of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kurt Volk, 25, an art student who quit his job as a bike
messenger in Chicago to come to the Chinese on April 8 with his
friend Chris Hrasky, 25, a graduate student in film at the
University of Texas, the line has been the source of firm new
friendships with people like Ms. Seaskull. ``I'll charge the whole
damn thing on my credit card,'' he said. ``I don't care. I'm going
back to Chicago financially ruined, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the movie opens, Gasking said, his gang plans a celebratory
trip to Disneyland, and then he is off to Sydney, London and Paris
for ``Star Wars'' premieres there. Will the group have reunions
when they're old and gray?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Volk said, noting that Lucas envisions at
least two more ``Star Wars'' tales. ``We'll probably just come back
for the next one.''

U.N. OFFICIALS SAY NEWEST REFUGEES TELL OF MASS EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ United Nations officials said Wednesday that
the latest group of refugees entering Albania from Kosovo _ almost
exclusively women, old men and children _ are giving consistent
reports of what appeared to be a mass execution near the city of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wilkenson, a U.N. official, said the first group of refugees
to cross the border on Tuesday said they were forced to leave their
homes in the villages of Meja and Oriza on Tuesday morning. Serbian
forces stopped the convoy and forced the young men to get out of
the wagons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who crossed the border a few hours later reported
seeing more than 100 bodies in a ditch and an open field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very ominous,'' Wilkenson said. ``If it is true, this
would be one of the single biggest atrocities'' committed by
Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees who crossed the border Wednesday told
international monitors that they, too, had seen a large number of
bodies in the center of Meja and throughout the village. Many of
the bodies had been burned, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees reported that the men had been killed in
retaliation for the deaths last week of four Serbian police
officers who had been shot by soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it, but I know the policemen were killed because
it happened just 300 feet from my house and I heard the shots,''
said Pashk Pnishi, 31, of Meja, who entered Albania by car
Wednesday afternoon with his mother, his wife and their three
children.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees heard
similar accounts of the killing of four or five police officers
from refugees on Wednesday.

MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF FOOD TOUTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If Americans need proof that medical professionals in
this country don't recognize the link between food and health, they
need only check out ``the abysmal foods served in hospitals,'' says
Andrew Weil, physician, author and guru of alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Weil appeared on a panel discussing the use of food as medicine
at the annual conference of the International Association of
Culinary Professionals held in Phoenix earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with Weil were cookbook author and authority on Chinese
cuisine Nina Simonds, and Madhur Jaffrey, cookbook author and
expert on Indian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Asian cultures long have recognized the health benefits of
eating certain foods, eating foods in the right seasons, and
treating and preventing illness with food, the panelists said.
Western medicine lags behind, leaving health professionals ignorant
of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has not changed substantially since I was out of medical
school,'' said Weil, a graduate of Harvard Medical School, who has
written such books as ``Spontaneous Healing'' and has hosted
television specials recommending ways to prevent disease through
diet.
</P>
<P>
   He is the director of interactive medicine at the University of
Arizona's College of Medicine in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In America, distinctions still are made between food and
medicine, Weil said, while the lines have blurred in Asia. Yet he
maintains that many foods have medicinal properties.
</P>
<P>
   Powdered ginger, for instance, can ``neutralize bad energies''
as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. It also soothes the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The spice turmeric also has anti-inflammatory properties.
</P>
<P>
   Lycopene, a pigment found in tomatoes, can help prevent some
forms of cancer, he said. Research finds it works best when the
tomatoes are cooked and accompanied by fat.
</P>
<P>
   Essential fatty acids, such as Omega-3, found in fish oils and
walnuts, help build cell membranes in the brain. Failing to eat
enough of these oils early in life may lead to such diseases as
Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease later in life, Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   A healthful diet needn't be a Spartan one, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating healthy doesn't mean giving up everything you enjoy,''
he said, dismayed recently when his pre-ordered airline vegetarian
meal was bland and had no dessert.
</P>
<P>
   The airline chefs seemed to believe, he said, that ``anyone who
orders a healthy meal doesn't want anything pleasureful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the public is confused, he said, by seemingly conflicting
reports about which foods are beneficial and which are harmful. So
they turn to the adage of ``everything in moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil insists that there are ``good'' and ``bad'' foods, and the
bad ones _ such as certain fats _ are to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of eating well to stay well is a topic that ``goes
beyond folk remedies,'' said Simonds, the Chinese cuisine
authority. In Asian philosophy, it involves the balance of yin and
yang, opposing yet complementary aspects of the universe. Food
plays a role in that balance.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to be yin, while men tend to be yang. Foods, too, are
classified as yin and yang.
</P>
<P>
   Yin foods have a calming effect, Simonds said. They include raw
fruits and vegetables and seafood. Yang foods, which energize and
stimulate the body, include eggs, meats and spicy foods. Neutral
foods include rice, peanuts and breads.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds details much of this information in her just-published
cookbook, ``A Spoonful of Ginger.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects those notions to appeal to adults eager to enhance
their health through diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are reaching an age when we want to prevent
disease,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffrey, who grew up in India, says Indians are raised with a
subliminal knowledge of food and its healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers pass along to their children advice for aiding
digestion: Chew food carefully, drink ginger juice and take a short
walk _ even 100 steps _ after eating.
</P>
<P>
   Eat opposite of the seasons _ cold foods in summer, hot foods in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Disease often comes as the seasons are changing, Jaffrey said.
Getting a massage at that time can relax the body and help ward off
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to follow a whole way of life to bring balance to the
body,'' Jaffrey said. &QL;

EXERCISING WITH OTHERS PAYS OFF IN MOTIVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Chic Older works out alone so people won't see him
cry.
</P>
<P>
   However, Older, who is executive director of the Arizona Medical
Association, admits there are significant advantages to working out
with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single greatest benefit I'm aware of is it's the best way
I know to get your butt out the door when you don't want to,''
Older said. ``Secondly, there's a rhythm to working out, and often
it's enhanced by two people.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts believe motivation is the single most important
reason for working out with others. Most people, they say, do not
have the discipline to work out solo over a long period. That, in
part, accounts for the success of health clubs and specialty
organizations where people with like interests get together to
bike, run or even walk.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ann Taylor, owner of The Walking Connection, said the need
for motivation is what brings new members to her 2,000-member
Valley club, which specializes in the mental, skeletal, muscular
and aerobic benefits of walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkers tend to want to walk with others,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a former runner-turned-power walker, is also more
inclined to work out with a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I can't depend on myself to exercise,''
Taylor said. ``In the summer when it's 110 degrees, you have to get
up real early in the morning to work out. If you have a friend on
the corner waiting for you at 5 a.m., you don't think twice. You
get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Steingard, an orthopedic surgeon trained in sports
medicine, believes working out with a partner is best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely better to work out with other people, provided
your goals are the same,'' Steingard said. ``I think just the peer
pressure alone will make you do the exercises, because it's hard to
say no to someone else who has the same goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Russell Chick of Phoenix said there are also benefits of
exercising alone. Chick, a runner and orthopedic surgeon, said many
people prefer to jog alone so they can go at their own pace and in
their own time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like to run certain distances, and they don't want
to worry about a partner not being able to run as far,'' Chick
said. ``Plus, I think a lot of people enjoy the privacy of being by
themselves so they can think and have that peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Older, of the Arizona Medical Association, agrees. A bicyclist
and weightlifter, he prefers going it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to pace myself at exactly my speed,'' Older said. ``I
don't want to feel like I'm either holding someone up or I have to
do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick said some people have a negative body image, which compels
them to work out away from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're embarrassed,'' Chick said. ``They don't think they're
very fit or look that good, so they buy those videotapes and work
out at home.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the problem with workout tapes is they often require
another person to help explain the details on how to do a
particular move in an exercise, Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   Steingard, the orthopedic surgeon, prefers that his patients
work out with a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I side with the camp that team efforts are better than
individual,'' Steingard said. ``If I go out and jog, my speed will
increase if I'm jogging with someone else. I also see fewer
injuries when people are looking out for each other, especially in
weight training. You just did 20 pounds and you're thinking of
trying 60. A partner will put it in perspective, tell you don't be
ridiculous. That's too much of an increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Steingard also believes partners are crucial if you're involved
in serious training. He relates it to playing the piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter offers an objective point of view when I'm hitting
the keys too hard. So I make adjustments based on her objectivity.
The results are bigger gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts say there are no definitive studies on health and
workout partners. Unless you're the kind of person who won't work
out without a partner, there is no right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nice thing about working out,'' said Chick, the
orthopedic surgeon. ``You can tailor it to whatever your
personality dictates.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Older of the medical association puts it, hope to heck
someone is around when you can't lift that 90-pound barbell from
your neck. &QL;

 &HT;    NEW KOSOVAR REFUGEE WAVES REPORT KILLINGS, EVICTIONS OF ENTIRE
VILLAGES
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ New bouts of ethnic cleansing
sent entire towns of refugees on the run out of Kosovo Wednesday,
bringing with them tales of killings and beatings and the targeting
of ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were so bad in Macedonia, where more than 4,000
refugees arrived Wednesday, that food fights broke out as people
scrambled to get loaves of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Albania, relief workers were hustling to put up more
tents for more than 2,500 new arrivals, scores of whom were still
sitting and waiting on roadsides and at the town square in Kukes by
7 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
   After a week of relative calm, in which only a few hundred
refugees a day crossed out of Kosovo, Serb forces were said to be
clearing out and torching villages again.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, military activity here along Albania's
northern border with Kosovo was intensifying. More than a dozen
Yugoslav shells were lobbed close to two Albanian towns northwest
of here overnight, and planes believed to be NATO bombers were
heard circling above this border crossing area all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1:15 p.m. a boom sounded and a dense black cloud of smoke
arose on the Yugoslav side. It could have been as close as 10 miles
from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians fleeing into Macedonia reported harassment and
beatings, and the BBC radio said a group of about 50 refugees ran
into a minefield as they tried to escape their homeland. It said
five of them died in explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees who crossed into Albania Wednesday said men
between 15 and 50 years of age had been separated from tractor
convoys and beaten, then allowed to continue. Most reported being
forced to give up money and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Families from the town of Hade said they had been trapped for at
least two weeks by Serb-led Yugoslav forces circling their village,
until Serb police arrived Wednesday morning at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came quarter by quarter. The Serbs put us on buses,''
said Alim Grajqevci, 67. Several villagers said 15 buses were
brought to take away the people, three of them driving to Albania
and the remainder to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Three other families from the town said four men had been
incinerated a week ago after paramilitary forces made an assault on
the village. The burned remains of two of them were found under the
charred body of a dead cow, said Aslan Merena, 61, who said he was
a distant relative of the dead men. More than half a dozen
villagers identified the people killed as belonging to the Merena
family.
</P>
<P>
   More refugees repeated variations of the story first heard late
Tuesday of 200 or more dead bodies seen in a field off the road at
a village called Meje, near the regional center of Dakovice.
</P>
<P>
   A group of women who arrived before this story was heard said
that about 300 men with them had been separated and taken by the
Serbs to sit in a field at the village of Meje. This happened in
late morning Tuesday, said Zenije Pajaziti, 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were around them in a circle. They had their guns
on them,'' she said. When interviewed in Kukes on Wednesday
morning, she said her family still had no idea what happened to the
men taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Later arrivals reported seeing a concentration of dead men, and
refugees crossing the border Wednesday gave similar accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Two cousins who had been heading on foot toward Albania came
over the border in tears Wednesday and told that they saw a group
of men around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday who appeared to be squatting in a
field off the road at Meje.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we left them 10 meters behind, the police stopped us and
asked for gold jewelry and money,'' said Valdeta Rama, 22. The
young women said they gave what they had, then were allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a lot of shots. We turned our heads a little and we
saw they fell face down. Their faces were covered with blood,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency,
said similar reports had been repeated by refugees who had come in
the early morning hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very ominous. The reports seem consistent,'' he said.
If it is found to be true, he said, this would be among the worst
massacres of the Kosovo ethnic cleansing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said that some of the women also reported they were
detained by the Serbs for several hours. They said younger women
were taken away for between 1 1/2 to 2 hours, and that they ``had
been touched'' by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, scores of people in cars and tractors arrived
from Meje, saying they had been ousted from their homes on Tuesday
night. Some reported seeing such a group of dead bodies, but others
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the town is leaving,'' said Gjon Prishi of Meje, who had
just driven a tractor over the border Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He and his son said they saw 80 to 100 mostly young men laying
dead in a field as they pulled out of town Tuesday evening. They
spent the night in a nearby village, then moved on toward the
border.

   KOSOVO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Showcasing the profound divisions
over the escalating NATO engagement in Kosovo, the House votes to
block President Clinton from widening the conflict to include
ground troops without prior approval from Congress. The bill,
approved 249-180, was the only measure to survive a day of
sometimes anguished debate over what several lawmakers described as
a set of bad choices on how to handle a deployment that has not run
according to plan. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   TERROR-SANCTIONS (Washington) _ The Clinton administration

MARILYN MANSON CURTAILS TOUR IN RESPONSE TO SCHOOL MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev., Ariz., Iowa, Minn., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marilyn Manson, the dark, cross-dressing rock
musician, said he was canceling the last five dates on a two-month
concert tour because of last week's shooting spree in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who is frequently criticized for the nihilistic strains
in his shock-rock music, described the cancellations as a show of
respect for those killed, but he also lashed out at the media for
suggesting in any way that his provocative music, or his fans,
incite violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have linked his music to the ``Goth'' rock culture
that some have claimed was favored by the two students who killed
13 people at Columbine High School last week. There were some
demonstrators at Manson's recent concert in Minneapolis, but no
hard evidence has emerged that the killers knew his music well or
were motivated by it.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Manson has been accused _ largely by the
Christian right and other conservative groups, but also by
politicians like Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. _ of depravity and
conveying negative messages in his songs. For instance, his 1994
album, ``Portrait of an American Family,'' has songs with names
like ``Cake and Sodomy,'' ``Dope Hat'' and ``Misery Machine.'' And
in concerts in past years, which were far more incendiary than the
current tour, he has led fans in chants like, ``We hate love. We
love hate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the suspension of his tour, Manson,
whose real name is Brian Warner, rejected assertions that his songs
or any other music had incited the tragic violence. His current
concerts, based on his latest album, ``Mechanical Animals,'' is
more in the glam rock tradition of the 1970s and is not as
sepulchral as some of his previous music. He acknowledged, though,
that it would be a show of respect to put off further performances
of his brand of hard rock for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great atmosphere to be out playing rock 'n' roll
shows, for us or the fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``The media has unfairly scapegoated the music
industry and so-called Goth kids, and has speculated, with no basis
in truth, that artists like myself are in some way to blame. This
tragedy was a product of ignorance, hatred and an access to guns. I
hope the media's irresponsible finger-pointing doesn't create more
discrimination against kids who look different.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson planned to proceed with a concert scheduled for Wednesday
night in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said his record company,
Nothing/Interscope. Then he will cancel scheduled stops in Reno,
Nev.; Fresno, Calif.; Las Vegas; Phoenix, Ariz., and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a radio station in Denver, KBPI, canceled a concert
scheduled for April 30 at which Manson's band was one of several
scheduled to play.
</P>
<P>
   Even some First Amendment groups supported the cancellations.
Nina Crowley, the director of Massmic, a group in Massachusetts
that fights music censorship, said she recently attended one of
Manson's concerts and that it was hardly the sort of shocking music
for which he had been known in years past. She added, ``From a
First Amendment perspective, I think he should go on. But I think
the cancellations are respectful. It acknowledges that he cares
about his fans and he realizes what the parents and the kids must
be going through.''

SHARP DROP IN TEEN BIRTH RATE PUSHES NATIONAL RATE TO 90-YEAR LOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Miss.)  (nk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The teen-age birth rate, which has been dropping
steadily for six years, has dipped so sharply that it has helped
push the nation's overall birth rate to the lowest point since the
government began keeping records in 1909, according to data made
public Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The birth rate, calculated as the number of births per 1,000
people in a given group, is one measure of how the native-born
population grows. The rate among girls 15 to 19 years old dropped
16 percent from 1991 to 1997, the most recent year for which
figures are available. From 1996 to 1997 alone, the rate dropped 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In absolute numbers, there were fewer babies born in 1997 _ 3.88
million, nearly 500,000 of them to teen-agers _ than in any year
since 1987, the center said. It cited the declining teen-age birth
rates, coupled with the aging of the general population, as the
reasons the overall birth rate in 1997 dropped to a low of 14.5
births per 1,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The previous low of 14.6 per 1,000 was recorded in 1975 and
1976, said Stephanie Ventura, a demographer with the health
statistics center. By comparison, Ms. Ventura said, the birth rate
in 1957, at the height of the baby boom, was 25.3 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dip does not forecast a decline in population, demographers
say, because it does not account for the influx of immigrants and
because American women are still having enough babies, about two
per couple, to replenish the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that births will make a smaller
contribution to our annual growth rate than they have in the
past,'' said Carl Haub, a demographer at the Population Reference
Bureau, a nonprofit research institution here.
</P>
<P>
   But the sustained declines in teen-age births were seen as good
news by the Clinton administration, which cited the new figures as
evidence that teen-age pregnancy prevention programs are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communities and parents all across America have joined with us
to help our young people understand that they should delay
parenthood until they are ready to nurture and support a child of
their own,'' said Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna
Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is scheduled to discuss the figures
on Thursday at the White House in a public discussion with
teen-agers, said in a statement, ``This good news shows us that
when Americans come together in support of our basic values we can
send a clear message that our children should not be having
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that teen-agers themselves, as much as their
parents or other adults, are responsible for the drop. Studies show
young people are delaying sex until they are older, having sex less
frequently and using birth control more often and more responsibly.
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization
that has analyzed the trends, cited teen-agers' use of Norplant,
the contraceptive implant, and Depo-Provera, an injectable
contraceptive that became available in the early 1990s, as
important reasons for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many groups want to take credit for the drop in teen-age
pregnancy, but the credit truly goes to the teen-agers,'' said
Jacqueline E. Darroch, the institute's vice president, in a
statement accompanying a study to be released Thursday. ``About 20
percent of the decrease since the late 1980s is because of
decreased sexual activity, and 80 percent of the decrease is
because of more effective contraceptive practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age birth rates dropped in all 50 states, although they
vary considerably from state to state, with Vermont having the
lowest rate, 26.9 births per 1,000, and Mississippi the highest,
73.7 per 1,000. There were declines in all racial and ethnic
groups, but the greatest dips were recorded among Puerto Rican and
non-Hispanic black teen-agers, for whom the rate dropped about 25
percent during the six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teen birth rate is the only age group where we have seen a
sustained decline in the birth rate since the early 1990s,'' said
Ms. Ventura, who co-authored the center's latest analysis of
state-by-state birth data, from which the statistics made public
Wednesday were drawn. ``The rates for women in their 20s have been
flat, and for women in their 30s, the rates are increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-wedlock births also declined for the third year in a row,
and the birth rate for unmarried black women is lower now than in
any year since 1969, when it was first calculated, the center
found. Births to unmarried women declined slightly in 1997, but
still accounted for 32 percent of overall births. Among teen-agers,
78 percent of new mothers were unwed.

LEGAL FEE CLAIM IN TOBACCO DEAL MAY LEAD TO CORNYN-MORALES
FACE-OFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn on Wednesday asked
for a possible courtroom face-off with his predecessor, Dan
Morales, over a claim by a Morales friend for about $260 million in
legal fees in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn told U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana that
the court could dismiss Houston lawyer Marc Murr's claim without
calling witnesses in a hearing scheduled for May 6.
</P>
<P>
   But if Murr is allowed to testify, Cornyn asked that Folsom also
allow the state to question Morales and Morales' former first
assistant, Jorge Vega, about the scope of Murr's work on the
tobacco suit.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn opposes Murr's claim for fees and is investigating his
involvement in the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Morales negotiated a $17.3 billion settlement from cigarette
makers last year, but the agreement also sparked a lengthy dispute
over fees paid to outside lawyers who also represented the state.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have agreed to pay $3.3 billion to five other
private lawyers hired by Morales on a contingency contract. Murr
had a separate agreement with Morales, and cigarette makers have
resisted paying him because other lawyers on both sides of the suit
have contended Murr did little work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who left office Dec. 31, was unavailable for comment
Wednesday. But he has repeatedly said Murr was an important adviser
who played a crucial role in planning and developing the tobacco
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The national arbitration panel awarded Murr only $1 million, and
that is all the tobacco industry is obligated to pay him under the
Texas settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A separate state arbitration panel of three retired judges
appointed by Murr and Morales awarded Murr $260 million last fall.
The difference between that amount and the $1 million awarded by
the national arbitrators represents a potential claim against the
state, but it must be enforced by Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom ordered the May 6 hearing for Murr to ``show cause'' why
the state panel's $260 million award should not be nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom said Murr and Morales had failed to comply with his order
for one of the three state arbitrators to be appointed by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Folsom, Murr's lawyer, Roy Minton of Austin,
defended the selection of the state arbitrators. Minton said he
didn't believe testimony was necessary but said Murr and other
witnesses, including former Texas Supreme Court Justice Bob
Gammage, one of the state arbitrators, would be available to
testify if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant Attorney General Andy Taylor, in a separate
letter to Folsom, pressed the state's motion to dismiss Murr's
claim outright. Cornyn contends that Murr's claim amounts to a suit
against the state, which is barred by the 11th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's position was supported by Austin attorney Pete
Schenkkan, who represents several state legislators in the case.

MADELINE ALBRIGHT: `DRIVEN BY HER OWN BIOGRAPHY'

   &UR; By A.O. SCOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The last few publishing seasons have produced a stream of books
about the major figures of postwar American foreign policy: James
Chace on Dean Acheson; Kai Bird on McGeorge and William Bundy;
William Bundy on Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger; Henry Kissinger
on himself, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   These books are all works of diplomatic history, thick with
policy analysis, institutional boilerplate, and unabashed
second-guessing. They focus, as one might expect, on the big issues
-- containment, detente, China, Vietnam -- and on the day-to-day
contingencies of democratic politics and imperial diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Personality is for the most part an analytic construct, of
interest only to the extent that it can help in the understanding
of historical events.
</P>
<P>
   The two new biographies of Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright do the opposite, using historical events to explain the
personality of their subject.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Blackman and Michael Dobbs, the authors, respectively, of
``Seasons of Her Life: A Biography of Madeleine Korbel Albright''
and ``Madeleine Albright: A Twentieth-Century Odyssey,'' are both
accomplished Washington journalists and experienced foreign
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   But, for all the light they shed on the substance and conduct of
U.S. foreign policy, they might as well be writing for the style
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine's story can be read as a personalized version of the
twentieth century,'' announces Dobbs, the Washington Post reporter
who first broke the story of Albright's Jewish background.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, a writer for Time who has served as both Washington
bureau chief and Moscow correspondent, sketches a virtually
identical biography, but her view of Albright is more personalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albright's greatest appeal,'' she declares, ``is that she is
just like us, only wealthier. She has had bad hair days and skirts
with spots, runs in her stockings, a dog that was skunked. ...
Americans see her as vulnerable, a wife rejected, a single mother
who went back to work, prevailed, and raised good kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing in this vein, Blackman titles her last chapter-about
the first year or so of Albright's tenure as the most visible
diplomat in the world -- ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Madeleine Albright is a ``celebrity,'' a word one
would hesitate to apply to Warren Christopher, Cyrus Vance, or Dean
Rusk. Of her predecessors, only Kissinger exercised a comparable
hold over the public imagination, but he achieved it by exploiting
the drama and mystique of his diplomatic undertakings. Albright's
celebrity is less a matter of what she has done than of who she is:
a candid, funny, and appealing woman with a life story rich in
human interest and historical resonance.
</P>
<P>
   She has also received the star treatment usually accorded
pioneers of diversity. As the first woman in charge of a department
that traditionally combines gentleman's-club exclusivity with macho
bluster, she has figured out how to present herself to the public,
to the media, and to other world leaders without the benefit of
role models.
</P>
<P>
   She has, for the most part, succeeded brilliantly, becoming the
most popular and visible member of Clinton's second-term Cabinet.
According to an anonymous State Department official quoted in the
Washington Post, ``Madeleine Albright, more than anyone else in
this administration, is driven by her own biography.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has used her life story -- even those aspects of it that
apparently took her by surprise -- in the service both of her
public image and of the policies she advocates. Her status as an
American who fled both Hitler and Stalin gives Albright a certain
moral authority, just as her success, against long odds, as a woman
in a man's world makes her an appealing figure.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreign policy of the world's superpower cannot be
explained by -- and should not be based upon -- the life experience
of a single person, no matter how tough, charming, or admirable
they might be. Albright's biographers offer an inspiring narrative
of how she succeeded in becoming secretary of state, but they offer
scant grounds for evaluating what has happened since. And neither,
so far, has she.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was born Marie Jana Korbelova (Madeleine is the
anglicized form of Madlenka, her childhood nickname) in Prague in
1937, the eldest child of Josef Korbel, a diplomat, and Mandula
Spiegel. Though Josef's birth certificate declared him ``Jewish and
legitimate,'' he habitually wrote ``no confession'' on official
forms that asked him his religion.
</P>
<P>
   His assimilation, like that of many Czechoslovakian Jews between
the wars, seems to have been motivated by a combination of fear,
ambition, and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nazis erased his country from the map, Korbel served
as an attache to its Belgrade embassy. During the war, the Korbels
fled to England. Many of their relatives, including Madeleine's
grandparents on both sides, died in the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel returned to Prague, and then to Belgrade, to serve his
government in the brief period between liberation from the Germans
and the Communist coup of 1948. The family ended up in Denver,
where Josef was a revered professor of international relations
until his retirement in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine and her sister and brother were raised as Roman
Catholics; no mention was ever made of the Korbels' Jewish origins.
Until Dobbs confronted her with evidence of her ancestry and of the
deaths of her relatives in the Holocaust, Albright seems to have
lived in a state of willed ignorance, declining to challenge her
parents' account of the past.
</P>
<P>
   If Albright's childhood is marked by the catastrophes of
20th-century European history, her early adulthood unfolded amid
the complacencies of the American '50s. She attended Wellesley on a
partial scholarship, and soon after graduation she married Joseph
Medill Patterson Albright, scion of two prominent newspaper
families.
</P>
<P>
   As she raised their three daughters and moved from Washington to
Long Island and back in the service of her husband's rather
lackluster career in journalism, Albright inched her way toward a
Ph.D. under Columbia University Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski. In
the meantime, she worked on the staff of Sen. Edmund Muskie,
D-Maine, and then, when Brzezinski became President Jimmy Carter's
National Security Adviser, as his liaison to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband left her for a younger woman, Albright's
professional ambition accelerated. In 1984 she was foreign policy
adviser to vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro. By 1988
she was advising presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. In the
course of that doomed crusade she met Bill Clinton and wrote him a
letter of recommendation to the Council on Foreign Relations. A few
years later, he named her ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's U.N. tenure is best remembered for two things: her
sandbagging of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and her
proclamation that Cuba's shooting down of planes flown by
anti-Castro exiles took ``not cojones'' but ``cowardice.'' Both of
these statements were calculated to play well at home and to
outrage the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming secretary of state in early 1997, Albright has
similarly done better on the domestic front than in the
international sphere, enjoying a long media honeymoon, holding
hands with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., persuading a recalcitrant
Congress to ratify the chemical weapons conventions, and pushing
for NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But halfway through her term in office, the Middle East peace
process is moribund, U.S. China policy is mired in incoherence, and
the Indian subcontinent is locked in a nuclear arms race. And this
is not to mention East Timor, Southern Sudan, or Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued in Albright's defense that international
affairs is no longer the grand chess match of the Cold War years --
it's more like a floating crap game. But the complexity and
instability of the world are hardly excuses for the muddle and
indirection of the world's only great power.
</P>
<P>
   It was Albright, after all, who titled a 1993 memo to Clinton
``Why America Must Take the Lead.'' The subject of that memo was
Bosnia, and while Ambassador Albright emerged as the
administration's leading hawk on a number of fronts, arguing for
intervention in Haiti and in Rwanda, she made the case for how the
United States should take the lead -- by threatening and, if
necessary, using force -- with special passion about the American
role in them Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration's approach to the unfolding disaster in
Yugoslavia might be characterized as inaction backed up by
indifference. Until last month, the Clinton administration
preferred calls for action backed up by indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the New York Review of Books, Mark Danner has argued
that the administration's predilection for tough talk, coupled with
its political timidity, did much to make matters worse in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton, urged on by Albright, rejected out of hand the
Vance-Owen plan for partition of the country, saying that it
rewarded Serb aggression. Two years later, after the massacres at
Srebrenica and Vukovar, the slaughter and displacement of tens of
thousands more Croats and Muslims, the decimation of Sarajevo, and
the Serb conquest of more territory, the administration pushed
through the Dayton Accords. This agreement, which gave the Serbs a
great deal more than Vance-Owen would have, was puffed as a
Nobel-worthy diplomatic accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Albright had promoted the United Nations'
disastrous ``Safe Havens'' policy, which placed masses of unarmed
Bosnian civilians under the ``protection'' of minuscule numbers of
U.N. (but no U.S.) troops--that is, left them at the mercy of Serb
paramilitaries, who systematically set about driving them from
their homes and killing them.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's failure to act effectively in Bosnia (or in
Rwanda) can't be blamed entirely, or even primarily, on Albright,
whose job at the time was peripheral to the making and implementing
of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Kosovo campaign be called ``Albright's war,'' even
though it was the utter failure of her attempted diplomacy at
Rambouillet (along with the failure of her one-time rival Richard
Holbrooke in Belgrade) that helped to precipitate the current
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But the NATO campaign against Milosevic is often, and rightly,
viewed as the victory of Albright's interventionist position over
the more cautious views of colleagues such as National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger and his predecessor Anthony Lake. The genesis
of that position, Albright has insisted, lies in her own life
story: Her view of the world, she repeats as though it were a
mantra, was formed not by Vietnam, but by Munich, by the failure of
the great powers to check totalitarian aggression in Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But as the war over Kosovo escalates, such analogies prove to be
of limited and rapidly diminishing use. It is likely that future
secretaries of state will say that the formative experience of
their lives was Kosovo. What they mean when they say that, rather
than how she got to be where she is, will determine Albright's
place in history.

CUOMO CALLS FOR FOCUS ON REGIONS, CITIES ECONOMY LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans have no right to gloat over the vibrant
U.S. economy while hard-luck cities and regions still suffer
unemployment, poverty and population drain, Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a success with your Dow-Jones breaking 10,000 if
one in five children sleeps in poverty tonight,'' he said in a
speech at the National Press Club here.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who heads the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, invoked an updated brand of liberalism with roots in
the philosophy of his father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and
his late father-in-law, former U.S. Attorney General and Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said record low unemployment and high-flying gains on Wall
Street can never be the measure of economic strength as long as the
depressed areas remain.
</P>
<P>
   He called the poverty in the midst of plenty ``the great
American paradox.'' While major cities such as New York and San
Francisco are riding the wave of prosperity, places like East St.
Louis, Ill.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Texas City, Texas, and Chico, Calif.,
have been left behind, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The HUD secretary released a report on the plight of 539 central
cities that found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventeen percent _ one in six _ have unemployment rates 50
percent or more above the national rate of 4.2 percent. Although
their rates are lower than they were during the recession of the
early 1990s, these areas have not seen the dramatic job growth of
other regions, he said. Yuma, Ariz., for instance, has an
unemployment rate of 18.8 percent. In Madera, Calif., it is 18.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-seven cities have lost at least 10 percent of their
population since 1980. East St. Louis lost more than 30 percent;
Gary, Ind., 27 percent, and Youngstown, Ohio, 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-two percent of the cities _ one in three _ have
persistently high poverty rates. Based on HUD's own estimates and
school system figures for free and reduced-price school lunches to
impoverished students, the report put the rate for Laredo, Texas,
at 36 percent and that of New Orleans at 34 percent. Rates were
also high in parts of the Appalachian Mountains stretching from
Kentucky through West Virginia. Hazard, Ky., for instance, has a
poverty rate of 27 percent. In some cities, poverty went up for a
couple of years even as the economy improved. In Beaumont, Texas,
for instance, the poverty rate went from 21.5 percent in 1993 to
22.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The ``worst conditions,'' Cuomo said, are on Indian
reservations. The high school dropout rate among the Oglala Sioux
in Pine Ridge, S.D., is 70 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo did not call for massive new government spending. Rather,
he said the solution lies partly in informing the American people
about conditions in these places. ``They don't see it on the way to
work; that's not where they live,'' he said. ``We have to expose
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington must convince people that government is not the enemy
and a number of government programs such as Medicare and Social
Security do work, he said, adding that government must learn from
the mistakes of past antipoverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, he said, government tried to insulate poor people
from the market place by substituting what he termed a ``government
subsistence market.'' With welfare, public housing and food stamps,
government inadvertently divorced poor people from the mainstream
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo insisted that HUD _ an agency with a long record of
mismanagement _ finally has cleaned up its act.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is spearheading an effort to link troubled areas with
the mainstream economy. Under HUD's $25.5 billion budget, the
agency is overseeing a $3.5 billion loan-guarantee program to
attract business to inner cities. So far, Cuomo said, there have
been ``no defaults that called for Uncle Sam to pay one dollar.''

ARCHER UNVEILS INVESTMENT PLAN TO SHORE UP SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite waning interest by the GOP leadership in
tackling Social Security, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer unveiled Wednesday the broad outlines of an
investment-based plan to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's plan would essentially divert a portion of the income
tax to create individual retirement accounts that would be invested
in a mix of stocks and bonds. Upon retirement, the accounts would
be paid out monthly, guaranteeing retirees a minimum income for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means staff members said that for most people, the
income from the private accounts would likely have to be
supplemented with Social Security funds to reach current benefit
levels.
</P>
<P>
   However, they noted that without the private accounts, Social
Security benefits are expected to drop eventually to about three
quarters of current levels because of the aging public's demands on
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, R-Texas, acknowledged the growing resistance to dealing
with the complex problem this year both from inside and outside the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there are plenty of politicians from both
parties who don't want to touch Social Security for all the wrong
reasons,'' he said. ``Our challenge is to put politics aside and
save Social Security for all the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he called President Clinton on Tuesday &UR;  &LR; to tell him
about the plan and ask for a meeting to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The president has proposed devoting most of the budget surplus
to shoring up the system. The White House proposal also calls for
government investment of Social Security funds in the private
market. It would create individual investment accounts for people
below certain incomes.
</P>
<P>
   There was little indication that the Archer plan would soon be
moving through the legislative process. The plan has not yet been
fleshed out in legislative language, nor have any hearings been set
to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It also has not yet received the blessing of the House
leadership, including Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP leaders fear that getting too far out front on Social
Security will only come back to haunt them in the 2000 election.
They distrust President Clinton's vows that he wants to work with
them to shore up the system and believe Democrats will demagogue
them on an issue regardless of what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as a trap,'' said an aide to a House GOP leader.
Republicans also are not convinced that privatizing Social Security
is a winner with the voters. A recent Republican poll found
skepticism for private investment except among young adults.
Disapproval of such investments were particularly strong among
women over 45, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being chairman of an influential committee, Archer's
proposal was not being treated as particularly special by the
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to be something that will be voted on the House
floor, I doubt it,'' the leadership aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also came under fire from conservatives and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic lawmakers questioned the wisdom of letting
individuals invest in the market if only a few people would reap
more benefits than they now get.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. described the plan's winners as ``high
fliers and early diers.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the more affluent and the families of those who
died before retirement age would come out ahead. Under Archer's
plan the accounts could be transferred to an individual's heirs if
that person died before reaching retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also criticized the proposal, saying it did not
truly privatize the system since the individual accounts would be
transferred into the Social Security system once an individual
reached retirement age rather than turned over to the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply using the income tax revenue to bail out the
current system,'' said Michael Tanner, a Social Security
privitization advocate at the libertarian Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner echoed Democrats' contention that the plan was not worth
the headaches it would take to administer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are are going to muck around with Social Security system
and in the end they are not going to give anybody anything they
don't have today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions to the retirement accounts would come from a
tax credit that amounted to 2 percent of wages up to $77,000 _ the
income limit to which Social Security payroll taxes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals could choose from a variety of government approved
funds, which would have a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan assumes that the return for the funds would be about
5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retirement the individual would receive monthly payments
from their funds. If those funds did not at least amount to the
benefit level now set for beneficiaries, beneficiaries would get
additional money from the Social Security trust fund. Social
Security would still collect the 12 percent payroll tax from
employees and employers. However, Ways and Means officials estimate
that eventually the payroll tax could be reduced.

NEW JERSEY PROBING POSSIBLE RACIAL PROFILING IN MOTELS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In an effort to catch drug smugglers who travel
through Newark International Airport, the New Jersey State Police
have quietly enlisted workers at dozens of motels to tip them off
about guests who pay for rooms in cash, receive a flurry of
telephone calls or, in some cases, simply speak Spanish, according
to people who have participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel-Motel Program, operated out of the State Police
special projects unit since the early 1990s, has recruited managers
and employees at an undisclosed number of places to act as
informers in their anti-drug initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel managers who participate in the program say they allow
troopers to routinely leaf through the credit card receipts and
registration forms of guests without a warrant, and to offer $1,000
rewards to hotel workers whose tips lead to arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the hotel and motel managers say, they are assured
that any searches or arrests will occur after the suspect leaves
the hotel premises, and their workers will never be required to
testify or have their names disclosed in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the program are the troopers' surveillance
seminars, which train front desk clerks, bell hops and porters to
scrutinize guests who fit the profile of drug traffickers by asking
for corner rooms, hauling trailers behind their cars or frequently
moving from room to room. Several hotel employees and union leaders
said troopers have also trained them to take racial characteristics
into account and pay particular attention to guests who speak
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   State Police officials, who have been besieged for years by
charges that troopers illegally target black and Hispanic
motorists, acknowledge that hotel personnel have been enlisted as
informers, but they vehemently deny that race plays any role. Lt.
Bruce Geleta, who commands the unit, declined to discuss what
factors troopers teach hotel employees to look for, saying that he
did not want to alert the drug traffickers to his tactics. But he
insisted race was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, these days, we're very careful not to do anything
like that,'' he said in an interview last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Clo Smith, a front desk clerk at a Holiday Inn near Newark
Airport, said she sat through the hour-long seminar three years ago
and was offended that the state police detective suggested that
Spanish-speaking guests should be treated with more suspicion than
those who speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say I found it somewhat insensitive,'' said Ms.
Smith, the union steward for Teamsters Local 819, which represents
front desk employees at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   David Feeback, president of Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local
69 in Secaucus, said some union members have also complained that
that troopers have pressured them to participate and report some of
the patrons at hotel restaurants who pay with large sums of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's racial profiling, plain and simple,'' Feeback said.
``They shouldn't be discriminating against people that way. And if
any of my members ask, I tell them to have nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one manager involved in the program, Fred Hartman, who runs
the Ramada Inn Newark Airport, said he never actually sat through a
training session, but was convinced that it did not involve race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no profiling whatsoever,'' said Hartman, who added
that said he frequently allowed troopers to check credit card
receipts and guest registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Geleta said he would not provide a racial breakdown of those
people stopped, searched or arrested as part of the Hotel-Motel
program. John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state police, also
declined to disclose the names or court case numbers of people who
were prosecuted after being arrested by troopers in the Hotel-Motel
Unit.

<P>
   WEIRTON, W.Va. _ It was a scene that summed up so much about
this quintessential steel town, here where the Alleghenies roll
seamlessly into Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a handwritten sign saying ``Buy America or Bye
America,'' Mark Glyptis, a union boss and proud of it, was
counseling two laid-off steelworkers at the union hall. Sunday hams
are now available, he told them, but yes, unemployment benefits for
Weirton Steel's idled workers were running dry.
</P>
<P>
   As an awkward silence filled the room, Glyptis broke it with a
vague but supportive message to the glum workers: ``You guys are
great. Don't give up the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   What they are fighting for, Glyptis says, is nothing less than
their jobs, their way of life and the fate of the American steel
industry. Weirton is still reeling from events that started last
year in places far away _ Asia, Russia and Latin America _ where
economic turmoil and sagging currencies sent cheap steel flooding
to American shores, pushing down prices here. For Weirton, this
meant dropping its prices, shutting one of the company's two blast
furnaces and, even though employees own a healthy chunk of the
stock, laying off 1,000 workers _ nearly a quarter of the work
force _ just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Now Weirton's workers, along with those of other big, old-line
steel companies, have taken their pain to Washington, going by the
busload to promote a measure that would impose quotas on imported
steel and roll back imports to pre-1998 levels. The quota bill
passed the House by an overwhelming majority in March, and is
before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics deride this legislation as dangerous, illegal and
unnecessary. Not only do they say that it would cost American
consumers an estimated $6 billion, but it would violate world trade
agreements and could lead to a trade war. Two weeks ago, the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, waded into the debate,
saying such protectionist efforts were both futile and harmful.
</P>
<P>
   For Big Steel, the plea for protection has come periodically for
a quarter-century. But, many say, this cry has an increasingly
hollow ring; these companies are simply at the wrong end of a
number of trends, mostly inevitable, mostly unfavorable. More
troubling than imports is the competition posed by lower-cost, more
efficient American minimill steel companies, which account for
nearly half the steel market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer need these giant facilities to make steel,'' said
Robert Crandall, a steel expert at the Brookings Institution.
``Minimills are building sheet plants and making life miserable for
the big guys. We're talking about a long, drawn out endgame for Big
Steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is a measure of the enduring power of Big Steel, which is
far from disappearing, that so much political effort is being
devoted to saving a shrinking industry. After all, today there are
only 160,000 steelworkers, compared with 400,000 as recently as
1980. And, in financial weight, steelmaking pales in comparison
with the technology sector: The stock market value of a single
Internet company, Amazon.com, is twice that of the entire steel
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Weirton, this changing reality carries painful
human costs.
</P>
<P>
   Big Steel _ consisting of integrated steel companies, like
Weirton _ is dependent on a process, more than century-old, of
turning iron ore, limestone and coal into finished steel. With huge
blast furnaces and oxygen furnaces, this is the same process used
by Ernest Weirton in 1909 when he founded the company and the town.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, there are two American steel industries, one
growing and the other not; one profitable, the other struggling.
Better times are had by steel minimills like Nucor Corp. in
Charlotte, N.C., turning cheap scrap metal into steel with
efficient electric-arc furnaces, largely nonunion work forces and
lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Output from minimills has surged in the 1990s, after the
development of a technique called thin-slab casting in 1989. The
technique enabled minimills to start making the flat-rolled steel
that only big integrated mills like Weirton, LTV Group and
Bethlehem Steel could produce before. As a result, minimills, which
had a fraction of domestic output when founded in the early 1980s,
now account for almost 50 percent of domestic steel output.
</P>
<P>
   The sad irony is that the pain felt in Weirton comes just as the
appetite for steel _ for the sport utility vehicles, washing
machines, shopping malls and office buildings Americans want _ is
at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, the American steel industry is doing quite
nicely. Driven by the booming economy, American steel consumption
reached a record 138 million tons in 1998, up from 96 million tons
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   This means that most American steel mills have been running
nearly flat out, at up to 95 percent of operating capacity _ easily
outpacing the rest of manufacturing. And that still is not enough
to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, for the last decade, steel imports have been
necessary to fill the gap between what American steelmakers are
producing and what Americans consume. Despite the role of foreign
steel in last year's short-term price plunge, throughout the 1990s,
steel imports accounted for more than 20 percent of the domestic
steel market. In fact, American steel companies themselves,
including Weirton, buy a quarter of this foreign steel _ mainly raw
slabs that become finished steel.
</P>
<P>
   American steelmakers have also made enormous strides in
increasing productivity and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What steel crisis?'' John Reilly, a steel industry consultant
at Nathan Associates in Arlington, Va., asked. ``There has been
some turmoil in the marketplace. But certainly, there is no crisis
in the steel industry. The demise of the steel industry is nowhere
on the near horizon.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO, Chile _ In 1988, Chile was barely stirring after a
decade and a half of dictatorship, when dissident Ricardo Lagos
rocked the nation like an earthquake. Appearing on a live national
TV program, he unexpectedly turned to the camera, pointed his
finger at General Augusto Pinochet and ripped into him for reneging
on his promise to step down before an upcoming simple yesno vote to
extend military rule another eight years. ``And now, you promise
the country eight more years, with torture, assassination and
violation of human rights. To me, it seems inadmissible that a
Chilean is so ambitious for power as to pretend to hold it for 25
years,'' he said, igniting the incipient campaign to oust the
leader. Only months later, newspaper headlines worldwide screamed,
``Chile says `No' to Pinochet.'' The transition to democracy was
suddenly under way.
 &HT;    A decade later, history's pages are turning once again before
the nation's very eyes. In London, Pinochet, at age 83, is facing
possible extradition to Spain on charges of genocide and torture,
leaving Chile with an unexpected political vacuum. After all, even
under democratically elected governments, the aging general has
been a central figure in the country's political landscape. If
political polls are to be trusted, Ricardo Lagos Escobar _ the
61-year-old with a Ph.D. from North Carolina's Duke University, a
career academic who became an anti-Pinochet lightning rod, then a
post-regime minister _ will be the next president of Chile.
 &HT;    Presidential elections are in December, but Lagos has led the
polls for the past year. He must first defeat a longtime rival,
Senate President Andres Zaldivar (a weak third in polls), in the
Concertacion coalition primary on May 30. The winner faces a
concerted effort from the opposition in the form of Joaquin Lavin,
plus a protest candidacy from Arturo Frei Bolivar, a right-leaning
coalition leader considered a dark horse and a distraction for
Lavin, a young conservative mayor and unabashed `Pinochetista.' ``A
change in leadership is indispensable,'' says Eugenio Tironi,
president of Santiago marketing firm Tironi &AMP; Associates and a
political columnist. ``Lagos, and Lavin in his own way, represents
that kind of leadership.''
 &HT;    So who is Ricardo Lagos? ``That's a good question!'' laughs
Lagos himself. But the graying protester-turned-bureaucrat paints
himself as a force for change in the tough early days of the
transition back to democracy. Asked who he is not, Lagos' reply is
clearly tailored to belie fears of again placing a socialist in La
Moneda, Chile's presidential offices, a quarter century after the
coup that ousted Salvador Allende: ``I am not a sectarian. I am not
an ideologue. I am what you would call, in the United States, a
liberal.''
 &HT;    Like other parts of the world in recent years, Chile seems to be
questioning the conservative agenda. The Chilean ``economic
miracle'' _ cheered from Washington to Hong Kong and openly admired
and copied by emerging economies across the globe _ is clearly
losing its luster. A decade of brilliant 7 percent average annual
expansion with moderate inflation and a stellar 22 percent savings
rate hides a steady decline in growth rates in recent years. The
economy is facing a serious brake on its progress: poor roads,
bridges and ports, under-qualified workers and a strained
public-health system. According to local estimates, Chile needs to
spend some US$20 billion on infrastructure, which in its present
state is costing the nation almost $2 billion annually due, among
other things, to transport delays and illnesses related to poor
water quality.
 &HT;    Riding a fine line between social healer and hard-nosed
pragmatist, Lagos has managed to poll big numbers from the left
while simultaneously talking of partially privatizing the last
bastion of Chile's former union-heavy statist economy _ Corporacion
Nacional del Cobre (Codelco). His promise to open the state-run
copper giant to private investment is clearly a political move to
reduce the power of the Chilean military, which, by law, receives
10 percent of Codelco's nearly $3 billion in annual revenues.
Nonetheless, the initiative is also a clear signal to investors
that Lagos is market-oriented.
 &HT;    The message: Spending on infrastructure, health and education is
critical, even if he must sell the nation's crown jewel, Codelco,
to fund his programs. ``I want to be pragmatic: How do we obtain
more resources for the government?'' says Lagos, who was Chile's
public works minister until last year. ``(As minister), I
authorized criteria for private investment in infrastructure at
levels never before seen in Chile, and I did it for the country. We
had to double investment in infrastructure and, taking into account
only public financing, we couldn't even consider it.''
 &HT;    If it sounds like Lagos is preaching, that's because he is.
Credibility on economic issues is essential to his chance at
victory. The last socialist to sit in the presidential palace, La
Moneda, died there, a little more than 25 years ago. Former
President Salvador Allende's policies had the downtrodden at heart
but the results were disastrous. Inflation zoomed to 1,000 percent
and the economy staggered as profitable private firms and lands
were forcibly taken. It seemed clear to many in Chile and abroad
that the country was a hair away from becoming the next Cuba.
 &HT;    Taking matters into their own hands, General Augusto Pinochet
and the other military governors shelled the narrowly elected
government of Salvador Allende into submission. They then embarked
on a reign of terror that left some 2,000 political opponents dead,
thousands more tortured and exiled from the country. Led by
Pinochet, the military regime brutally restructured the economy and
political reality to the core, later casting their reforms into
concrete with heavy-handed constitutional revisions nonetheless
approved by national referendum in 1980. Now, after two successive
terms for a democratically elected centrist coalition, the country
must once again choose between left and right.
 &HT;    ``Waiting for Lagos is a matter of fear and uncertainty. Fear
because of the Allende years and the takeovers, and uncertainty
because it may very well not turn out to be like that,'' says
Ricardo Schwartz, president of Chile's Association of Plastics
Manufacturers.
 &HT;    Lagos, however, categorically rejects any suggestion that he has
been somehow ``rehabilitated'' from his socialist roots. ``I feel a
little bit offended when I am asked this. I have nothing about me
to rehabilitate. I have always been a democrat. I have always
supported human rights. I have always been against violence,''
Lagos says, a note of irritation rising in his voice. ``Now, it is
true, the world has changed, and it has changed into a global
economy. And when you have a global economy, you have to think
about how to organize the economy of the country. ... This is not
rehabilitation; this is simply understanding the realities of
life.''
 &HT;    One of the emerging realities in Chile is a stubborn gap between
rich and poor. Poverty has plummeted, thanks to military reforms
sustained after the transition to democratic rule. All Chileans are
earning more than in years past, but the difference between the
richest 10 percent and poorest 40 percent stayed roughly the same
through the mid-1990s, according to United Nations studies. A city
bus driver in Santiago, if he rides full 12 times a day, makes
US$5,390 a year. Meanwhile, the cost of living not including rent
in Santiago is equal to that of New York City. Spend a half-hour on
a street corner in Santiago and it becomes obvious that filling a
bus 12 times in a day takes far more than an eight-hour shift.
Dozens of cranky old buses compete for the same handful of
passengers at each stop.
 &HT;    Add to that redundant legions of taxi-drivers, and below them
the truly out-of-work. ``I studied information technology, but
driving a taxi is the only job I could find,'' complains Roberto
Guerra, 29. ``I have to keep a radio on in my house and leave at 3
a.m. if they call in a fare, or I make no money at all. It's hard
on my family.''
 &HT;    Politicians of all hues are recognizing these hardships as the
crux of the country's political debate. Both right and left talk of
reform and the future, of markets and growth, of good government
and positive change. Each side's carefully developed political
strategy is played to slightly different timbres, but the catch
phrases are the same: health, education, and training.
 &HT;    This would be achieved, say Lagos supporters, through bettering
the work force in hopes of higher pay down the road, credit for
small business and increased emphasis on research and development.
``Our challenge is to reinforce the trust people have in the
Chilean economic model, and to ensure that people have the
perception that they participate in it,'' says Alvaro Garcia, Lagos
campaign manager and former economy minister under President
Eduardo Frei.
 &HT;    The left and right start to diverge at this juncture of economic
policy, but even here the difference is minimal. ``Lagos is very
charismatic, or rather, he has a very good marketing apparatus, but
the dangers of electing a socialist president remain,'' says
Roberto Palumbo, acting president of Renovacion Nacional, the
center-right opposition party. ``There is a lot of talk about
social inequality despite our growth. The socialist solution for
this is always to raise taxes, which increases bureaucracy and
takes resources away from the productive sectors of the economy.''
 &HT;    Palumbo's solution: Vote for the right. ``The original is always
better than the photocopy,'' he says.
 &HT;    Through two successive center-left governments, Chile has
maintained its course toward open markets, low tariffs and
integration. Even if a socialist once again gains the presidential
palace, history is on the side of continuity, business leaders
predict. ``Nobody is proposing changes to any of these things,''
says Andres Concha, general secretary of Sociedad de Fomento
Fabril, Chile's chief industrial trade group. ``Politically, there
is a tacit agreement that the world is going this way and Chile has
to go with it or be left behind.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LAGOS SPEAKS ...
 &HT;    _On criticism that he is a ``rehabilitated'' socialist ...
 &HT;    _It seems important to me that public resources be directed to
social needs. It is important to build school and hospitals and let
the private investment go to the highways. What I can save on
spending on highways goes to social programs. This isn't being
rehabilitated; this is common sense.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On privatizing Codelco, the state-run copper company ...
 &HT;    _It is very important to incorporate private capital into
Codelco so that it can expand. Now, in order to privatize Codelco
we have to stop giving 10 percent of Codelco's revenues to the
military. I don't think there are any private investors who would
be interested in Codelco until we overcome this problem. ... Also,
it is important to recognize that Codelco provides more than US$1
billion a year to the government. With Codelco privatized, with all
the earnings from the sale, and adding the taxes we would earn, how
much could we get?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On the economy and development ...
 &HT;    _Chile is a country with an economic model that works well and
it should be sustained. It's a privilege that we do not have to
argue about how to lower inflation. It's a privilege that we don't
have to argue about how to keep the economy growing. It's a
privilege that we don't have to argue about how to balance the
budget; it is balanced. It is a decided privilege that our
macroeconomic accounts are in order. We have to preserve this
privilege. We have things to do. We have to raise the savings rate
from 23 percent to 26-27 percent of GDP. We have to renew foreign
investment flows into Chile and Chilean investment abroad. If we do
it well we will be able to reach _ I believe _ investment of 30
percent over GDP. This is my goal.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On inequality and its challenges ...
 &HT;    _Regarding the problem of inequality, there are short-term and
long-term solutions. In the long term, the only solution is
education and training for workers. In the long term, you have to
reduce the gap in worker productivity. But ending the gap in
productivity means a very deep transformation of the economy. In
the next century, the difference between rich countries and poor
countries will be a matter of education. As the saying goes, ``If
you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, but if you teach him to
fish ... ''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On reconciliation ...
 &HT;    _Every transition from dictatorship to democracy requires a
degree of forgiveness. Not everything is forgiven. There is a
measure of justice. Not everything demands justice; there is also a
measure of pardon. That's how it went in South Africa, Brazil,
Spain, Portugal, Argentina, Uruguay ... What has been the
difference between all of these countries and Chile? There is one,
a very important difference. In all of these countries, the
transition concluded because there was a new consensus. The
difference here is that a constitution was drawn up in the
interests of Pinochet and it cannot yet be changed. The difference
is that in Chile the Concertacion received 55 percent of the vote _
in any European country or in the United States if you have the
majority you have the power to govern _ and in Chile we don't have
the power to govern because we are still the minority in the
Senate. What kind of Constitution is that?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On the proper resolution of Pinochet's problems abroad ...
 &HT;    _I have said that things among Chileans should be dealt with in
Chile. He should return, but we have a task, too. And that is to
recover an institutionality in which we can all agree.

it is important to recognize that Codelco provides more than US$1
billion a year to the government. With Codelco privatized, with all
the earnings from the sale, and adding the taxes we would earn, how
much could we get?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On the economy and development ...
 &HT;    _Chile is a country with an economic model that works well and
it should be sustained. It's a privilege that we do not have to
argue about how to lower inflation. It's a privilege that we don't
have to argue about how to keep the economy growing. It's a
privilege that we don't have to argue about how to balance the
budget; it is balanced. It is a decided privilege that our
macroeconomic accounts are in order. We have to preserve this
privilege. We have things to do. We have to raise the savings rate
from 23 percent to 26-27 percent of GDP. We have to renew foreign
investment flows into Chile and Chilean investment abroad. If we do
it well we will be able to reach _ I believe _ investment of 30
percent over GDP. This is my goal.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On inequality and its challenges ...
 &HT;    _Regarding the problem of inequality, there are short-term and
long-term solutions. In the long term, the only solution is
education and training for workers. In the long term, you have to
reduce the gap in worker productivity. But ending the gap in
productivity means a very deep transformation of the economy. In
the next century, the difference between rich countries and poor
countries will be a matter of education. As the saying goes, ``If
you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, but if you teach him to
fish ... ''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On reconciliation ...
 &HT;    _Every transition from dictatorship to democracy requires a
degree of forgiveness. Not everything is forgiven. There is a
measure of justice. Not everything demands justice; there is also a
measure of pardon. That's how it went in South Africa, Brazil,
Spain, Portugal, Argentina, Uruguay ... What has been the
difference between all of these countries and Chile? There is one,
a very important difference. In all of these countries, the
transition concluded because there was a new consensus. The
difference here is that a constitution was drawn up in the
interests of Pinochet and it cannot yet be changed. The difference
is that in Chile the Concertacion received 55 percent of the vote _
in any European country or in the United States if you have the
majority you have the power to govern _ and in Chile we don't have
the power to govern because we are still the minority in the
Senate. What kind of Constitution is that?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _On the proper resolution of Pinochet's problems abroad ...
 &HT;    _I have said that things among Chileans should be dealt with in
Chile. He should return, but we have a task, too. And that is to
recover an institutionality in which we can all agree.

 WEIRTON, W.Va.: near horizon.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mill that stands on Main Street in this town of 22,000 once
employed 13,500. Today, it has 4,300 workers, with 780 of them
still furloughed.
</P>
<P>
   To Glyptis, the union boss _ who remembers when President
Clinton campaigned in Weirton in 1992 promising to protect American
steel from foreign ``dumping'' _ steelworkers are now being
sacrificed on the altar of globalism and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's not welcome here, and neither is Gore,'' said
Glyptis, whose organization, the Independent Steelworkers Union,
has removed the president's picture from the union hall, leaving a
bare spot on the wall. ``I'd run them out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Around town, handwritten signs displayed in store windows say
``Let's Buy Steel'' and ``Don't Let Clinton `Steel' Our Jobs.'' At
Renee's Cafe, at the bottom of a menu featuring homemade cakes,
pies and 50-cent hot dogs, is the postscript ``Stand Up for
Steel!!!''
</P>
<P>
   With Weirton paying up to $60,000 a year, in a town where a
five-bedroom house rents for $350 a month, employees rarely want to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Bennett, 25, is a third-generation steelworker, laid off
and working as a courtroom magistrate to support his wife and four
children on a salary of $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we needed to do to make our mill the best,''
Bennett said. ``But this has a lot to do with economics and world
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank You Sen. Rockefeller, Sen. Byrd,'' read signs outside
the union hall, referring to the state's two Democratic U.S.
senators, John Rockefeller IV and Robert Byrd. They are
spearheading the Senate quota bill _ following Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., who led the House fight.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, also
tucked a long-shot rider onto a pending hurricane relief bill to
provide $1 billion in loan guarantees for steelmakers. In
Washington, this rider is known as the Weirton Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Either measure could give some much-needed relief to Weirton
Steel. But even at the best of times, profits are razor thin. In
1998, the company lost $6.1 million on revenue of $1.25 billion,
and more losses are expected this year. Weirton's stock is now at
$2 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company is so mired in debt from a recent modernization
program that nearly every dollar it earns is devoted to interest
payments to its debt holders. And like many steelmakers, Weirton
cannot take advantage of low interest rates to reduce its borrowing
costs because there is virtually no market for steel-industry
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Weirton's situation is especially poignant considering that in
1984, with its former parent company, National Steel, threatening
to close the mill, Weirton was bought by its employees for $386
million in one of America's largest employee stock ownership plans.
Today, employees own 24 percent, having sold off chunks in the
public markets to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole community is on pins and needles,'' Dean Harris,
Weirton's mayor and a steelworker, said. ``If I lose my job, where
do I go? How do we take care of the dreams of our children?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Big Steel has railed against imports for years, last
year's surge was particularly significant. Over two months, the
price of flat-rolled steel fell to $250 a ton from more than $320.
``When prices get down to the $250-a-ton level, the whole industry
is losing money,'' said Richard Riederer, Weirton's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Big Steel suffered much more than did minimills.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 fourth quarter, when the foreign pricing pressures
were most severe, the nation's 11 biggest integrated-steel
companies were able to sell twice as much steel as the 14-largest
minimills _ $5.9 billion in combined revenue, compared with the
minimills' $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater sales, the big mills' higher production costs
meant they earned less than minimills, which recorded operating
profits of $199 million for the period, compared with $138 million
for big mills.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, steel prices have recovered somewhat, rising last
month to around $290 a ton. This came after the Commerce Department
imposed anti-dumping tariffs against Brazil and Japan and
negotiated a trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these events, Weirton is in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   The company's cash cow is a tin mill accounting for 40 percent
of its revenue. Though company executives take comfort that tin is
rarely imported and is not made by minimills, the market for tin _
mainly for food cans _ has stopped growing.
</P>
<P>
   And the bulk of Weirton's output, around 60 percent of revenue,
comes from rolled steel, a commodity subject to the vagaries of
global pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Weirton is dabbling in new businesses, forming a steel-trading
e-commerce Web site, entering joint ventures with overseas mills
and inventing new specialty products like steel roofing shingles.
But these early efforts have yet to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we haven't done things right,'' Mark Roach, a
Weirton steelworker, said. ``We've spent money on modernization. We
just can't compete with slave wages. Until recently, we were the
largest employer in the state. It's kind of embarrassing to say now
Wal-Mart is.''
</P>
<P>
   For big integrated mills, it was not supposed to be this way.
Over the last decade, to compete globally, the American steel
industry pumped $50 billion into a huge modernization that paid off
handsomely _ though with a human cost.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, it took 10 man-hours to produce a ton of
steel; today, that is down to under four. Steel is being produced
with fewer than two man-hours a ton at minimills, and, remarkably,
even at Weirton, too.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those left working at places like Weirton are in
their mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have an influx of young bodies,'' Harris, Weirton's
mayor, said. ``We'd have 20, 25 guys in the hot mill. Now it's
eight. You can walk for long periods in the mill and not see
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as Weirton and other steel companies lobby in
Washington for protection against these trends, some say it may not
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handwriting is on the wall for the big integrated steel
mills,'' said Daniel Griswold, a trade expert at the Cato
Institute. ``There is nothing that Congress can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bennett, the laid-off steelworker, hedged his optimism:
``Even if they resolve this thing fast and they call everyone back,
it doesn't mean it's over. If I leave this magistrate's job, should
I go back? But there really is nothing else around here.''

impose quotas on imported steel and roll back imports to pre-1998

 Por GREG BROWN 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO _ En 1988, Chile sufria el peso de decada y media de
dictadura cuando el disidente Ricardo Lagos estremecio la nacion
con la fuerza de un terremoto. En un programa de television en
vivo, inesperadamente miro hacia la camara, levanto el dedo y se
dirigio al general Augusto Pinochet, fustigandolo por haber
incumplido su promesa de retirarse antes de una proxima votacion
para decidir si el gobierno militar se extenderia ocho anos mas.
``Y ahora usted le promete a la nacion ocho anos mas de torturas,
asesinatos y violaciones de los derechos humanos. A mi me parece
inadmisible que un chileno tenga tanta ambicion de poder que quiera
mantenerse en el poder 25 anos,'' dijo Lagos. Sus palabras fueron
la chispa que inflamo la incipiente campana para que Pinochet
abandonara el poder. Unos pocos meses despues, los titulares de los
periodicos proclamaban: ``Chile le dice no a Pinochet'' y
repentinamente comenzaba la transicion hacia la democracia.
 &HT;    Diez anos despues, los chilenos vuelven a estar ante un giro de
la historia. En Londres, Pinochet, que ya tiene 83 anos, afronta la
posible extradicion a Espana por acusaciones de genocidio y
tortura, lo que crearia en Chile un inesperado vacio politico
porque el general, a fin de cuentas, ha sido un personaje central
en el panorama politico del pais. Si las encuestas aciertan, el
proximo presidente de Chile sera Ricardo Lagos Escobar, academico
de 61 anos con un doctorado de la Universidad de Duke, en Carolina
del Norte, que fue un lider de la oposicion contra Pinochet y luego
ministro cuando Pinochet entrego el poder.
 &HT;    Las elecciones presidenciales son en diciembre, pero Lagos
encabeza las encuestas desde el ano pasado. Primero debe derrotar a
un viejo rival, Andres Zaldivar, el presidente del Senado, quien
ocupa un debil tercer lugar en los sondeos, en las primarias de la
coalicion de partidos llamada Concertacion, que tendran lugar el 30
de mayo. El ganador debe medirse entonces con la oposicion
encarnada en Joaquin Lavin, de la Union Democratica Independiente
(UDI), de centro derecha, y con la candidatura de Arturo Frei
Bolivar, lider de una coalicion de derecha que podria robarle
votantes a Lavin, un joven alcalde conservador y abierto
pinochetista. ``Es indispensable un cambio en el liderazgo,'' dice
Eugenio Tironi, presidente de la firma santiaguina de mercadeo
Tironi &AMP; Associates y columnista politico. ``Lagos, y Lavin a su
manera, representan esa clase de liderazgo.''
 &HT;    Quien es Ricardo Lagos? ``Esa es una buena pregunta!'' responde
con una carcajada el propio Lagos. Pero el disidente convertido en
burocrata se describe como una fuerza del cambio en los dificiles
dias de la transicion a la democracia. Cuando se le pregunta quien
no es, se hace evidente que la respuesta de Lagos esta concebida
para aplacar el temor a colocar de nuevo a un socialista en La
Moneda, el palacio presidencial, un cuarto de siglo despues del
golpe militar que puso fin al gobierno de Salvador Allende: ``No
soy un sectario. No soy un ideologo. Soy lo que en Estados Unidos
se llamaria un liberal.''
 &HT;    Como ha ocurrido en otros paises en los ultimos anos, Chile
parece cuestionar su agenda conservadora. Ya es evidente que el
``milagro economico'' chileno (aplaudido desde Washington hasta
Hong Kong y admirado y copiado por las economias emergentes de todo
el mundo) pierde su brillo. Una decada con una poderosa expansion
anual promedio del 7 por ciento, una inflacion moderada y una
estelar tasa de ahorros del 22 por ciento, oculta una constante
declinacion de los indices de crecimiento en los ultimos anos (ver
tabla). El progreso de la economia afronta un peligroso escollo: el
mal estado de carreteras, puentes y puertos, trabajadores poco
calificados y un acosado sistema de salud publica. Segun calculos
locales, Chile necesita invertir unos US$20.000 millones en
infraestructura, que en su estado actual le cuesta al pais casi
US$2.000 millones al ano debido, entre otras cosas, a retrasos del
transporte y a enfermedades causadas por la mala calidad de agua.
 &HT;    La linea que separa a Lagos del afan por resolver los problemas
sociales y del pragmatismo mas porfiado no es mas ancha que el filo
de una navaja. Lagos ha conseguido un gram apoyo de la izquierda en
las encuestas mientras a la vez hablaba de privatizar parcialmente
el ultimo baluarte del estatismo sindicalista de Chile, la
Corporacion Nacional del Cobre (CODELCO). Su promesa de abrir el
coloso cuprifero estatal a la inversion privada es, obviamente, una
maniobra politica para reducir el poder de las fuerzas armadas
chilenas, que por ley reciben el 10 por ciento de los ingresos
anuales de Codelco, que suman casi US$3.000 millones. Pero la
iniciativa es tambien una clara senal para los inversionistas de
que Lagos favorece el libre mercado.
 &HT;    El mensaje de invertir en infraestructura, salud y educacion es
vital, aunque Lagos debe vender la joya de la nacion, Codelco, para
costear sus programas. ``Quiero ser pragmatico: como conseguimos
mas recursos para el gobierno?,'' dice Lagos, que fue ministro de
Obras Publicas hasta el ano pasado. ``(En mi puesto de ministro)
autorice criterios de inversion privada en la infraestructura a un
nivel nunca antes visto en Chile, y lo hice por el pais. Tuvimos
que duplicar la inversion en infraestructura y, contando solo con
el financiamiento publico, ni siquiera lo hubieramos podido
considerar.''
 &HT;    Esto no solo parece una predica de Lagos: es una predica. La
credibilidad en los asuntos economicos es esencial para sus
probabilidades de triunfo. El ultimo socialista que ocupo La Moneda
murio alli, hace poco mas de 25 anos. La gestion del difunto
presidente Salvador Allende se concentraba en los desposeidos, pero
los resultados fueron desastrosos. La inflacion se disparo al 1.000
por ciento y la economia sufrio graves problemas mientras el
gobierno nacionalizaba tierras y empresas privadas rentables. A
muchos, tanto en Chile como en el extranjero, les parecia obvio que
el pais estaba a un paso de convertirse en la proxima Cuba.
 &HT;    El general Augusto Pinochet y otros altos oficiales encabezaron
una sublevacion militar que derroco al gobierno de Allende, que en
las elecciones no habia alcanzado una mayoria de votos. Los
golpistas dieron inicio a un regimen de terror en el que murieron
unos 2.000 opositores y otros miles sufrieron torturas o se
exiliaron. Dirigido por Pinochet, el regimen militar reestructuro
radicalmente la realidad economica y politica y consolido las
reformas con revisiones autoritarias a la Constitucion que, no
obstante, recibieron el visto bueno en un referendo nacional
celebrado en 1980. Hoy, despues que una coalicion centrista, electa
en las urnas, ha gobernado dos terminos, el pais debe elegir una
vez mas entre la izquierda y la derecha.
 &HT;    ``Lagos genera temor e incertidumbre. Temor por el recuerdo de
la epoca de Allende y las confiscaciones, e incertidumbre porque a
lo mejor no pasa nada de eso,'' dice Ricardo Schwartz, director de
la Asociacion Gremial de Industrias del Plastico de Chile (ASIPLA).
 &HT;    Pero Lagos rechaza categoricamente la opinion de que se ha
``rehabilitado'' de sus raices socialistas. ``Me siento ofendido
cuando me lo preguntan. No tengo nada de que rehabilitarme. Siempre
he sido un democrata. Siempre he apoyado los derechos humanos.
Siempre he estado contra la violencia,'' dice con cierta irritacion
en la voz. ``Ahora bien, es verdad que el mundo ha cambiado y se ha
convertido en una economia global. Y cuando hay una economia
global, hay que pensar en la forma en que se va a organizar la
economia del pais ... Esto no es rehabilitacion. Es, sencillamente,
comprender la realidad de la vida.''
 &HT;    Una de las realidades que afloran en Chile es la persistente
brecha entre los ricos y los pobres. La pobreza ha disminuido
gracias a las reformas del regimen militar que se mantuvieron
despues de la transicion a la democracia. Todos los chilenos ganan
mas que en el pasado, pero la diferencia entre el 10 por ciento mas
rico y el 40 por ciento mas pobre se mantuvo aproximadamente igual
a mediados de los 90, segun estudios de la ONU. Un conductor de
autobus de Santiago que hace 12 viajes diarios gana US$5.390
anuales. Pero el costo de la vida en Santiago (sin incluir el
alquiler de la vivienda) es igual al de Nueva York. Basta pasar
media hora en una esquina de Santiago para comprobar que no alcanza
una jornada de ocho horas para llenar un autobus de pasajeros 12
veces al dia. Decenas de viejos autobuses compiten por el mismo
punado de pasajeros en cada parada.
 &HT;    A eso hay que agregar las legiones de taxistas y los que de
verdad estan sin trabajo. ``Estudie informatica, pero el unico
trabajo que he encontrado es conducir un taxi,'' se queja Roberto
Guerra, un joven de 29 anos.
 &HT;    Los politicos reconocen que este malestar es el centro del
debate nacional y hablan de las reformas y del futuro, de los
mercados y del crecimiento, del buen gobierno y de los cambios
positivos. La estrategia politica de cada bando tiene matices
diversos, pero las consignas son identicas: salud, educacion y
capacitacion.
 &HT;    Los partidarios de Lagos dicen que esas metas se alcanzaran
mejorando el nivel de la fuerza laboral para lograr un incremento
salarial, creditos para los pequenos negocios y un mayor enfasis en
la investigacion y el desarrollo. ``Tenemos un reto: fortalecer la
confianza en el modelo economico chileno y conseguir que el publico
sienta que participa en ese modelo,'' dice el director de la
campana de Lagos, Alvaro Garcia, que fue ministro de Economia en el
gobierno de Eduardo Frei.
 &HT;    La izquierda y la derecha divergen en esta coyuntura economica,
pero muy poco. ``Lagos es muy carismatico, es decir, tiene un
excelente aparato de mercadeo, pero perduran los riesgos de elegir
a un presidente socialista,'' dice Roberto Palumbo, presidente
interino de Renovacion Nacional, el partido de oposicion de
centroderecha. ``Se habla mucho de desigualdades sociales a pesar
de nuestro crecimiento. La solucion socialista siempre es elevar
los impuestos, lo que aumenta la burocracia y le quita recursos a
los sectores productivos de la economia.'' La solucion de Palumbo
es votar por la derecha. ``El original siempre es mejor que la
fotocopia,'' senala.
 &HT;    Durante dos gobiernos de centroizquierda sucesivos, Chile ha
mantenido su rumbo hacia los mercados abiertos, los aranceles bajos
y la integracion. Aunque otro socialista ocupara el Palacio
Presidencial, la historia esta de parte de la continuidad,
pronostican los lideres empresariales. ``Nadie esta proponiendo
cambiar ninguna de estas cosas,'' dice Andres Concha, secretario
general de la Sociedad de Fomento Fabril, el principal grupo
industrial de Chile. ``Politicamente, hay un acuerdo tacito de que
el mundo tiene un rumbo y Chile tiene que seguir esa pauta o
quedarse rezagado.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HABLA LAGOS ...
 &HT;    _Sobre las criticas de que es un socialista ``rehabilitado'' a
 &HT;    _Me parece importante que los recursos publicos se destinen a
las necesidades sociales. Es importante construir escuelas y
hospitales y costear las carreteras con inversion privada. Lo que
puedo ahorrar de los gastos de las vias pasa a los programas
sociales. Eso no significar estar rehabilitado; significa tener
sentido comun.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _Sobre la privatizacion de Codelco ...
 &HT;    _Es muy importante introducir capital privado en Codelco para
que pueda expandirse. Pero para privatizar Codelco tenemos que
suspender la entrega del 10 por ciento de sus ingresos a las
fuerzas armadas. No creo que ningun inversionista privado este
interesado en Codelco hasta que superemos este problema a Tambien
es importante reconocer que Codelco aporta mas de US$1.000 millones
anuales al gobierno. Cuando se privatice, con todas las ganancias
de la venta, y anadiendo los impuestos que recibiriamos, cuanto
podemos ganar?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _Sobre la economia y el desarrollo ...
 &HT;    _Chile es un pais con un modelo economico que funciona bien y
debe mantenerse. Es un privilegio no tener que discutir como
reducir la inflacion, no tener que discutir como mantener el
crecimiento economico, no tener que discutir como equilibrar el
presupuesto: ya esta equilibrado. Decididamente, es un privilegio
que nuestras cuentas macroeconomicas esten en orden. Tenemos que
conservar este privilegio. Tenemos cosas que hacer. Tenemos que
elevar la tasa de ahorro del 23 por ciento al 26 por ciento o 27
por ciento del PIB. Tenemos que renovar la entrada de inversion
extranjera en Chile y la inversion chilena en el extranjero. Si
hacemos las cosas bien, pienso que seremos capaces de lograr una
inversion equivalente al 30 por ciento del PIB. Esa es mi meta.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _Sobre la desigualdad y sus desafios ...
 &HT;    _Sobre el problema de la desigualdad, hay soluciones a corto
plazo y a largo plazo. A largo plazo, la unica solucion es la
educacion y la capacitacion de los trabajadores. A largo plazo, hay
que reducir la brecha en la productividad laboral. Pero cerrar la
brecha en la productividad implica una profunda transformacion de
la economia. En el proximo siglo, la diferencia entre los paises
ricos y los paises pobres sera una cuestion de educacion. Como dice
el dicho: ``Si a un hombre se le da un pescado, tiene para comer
ese dia, pero si se le ensena a pescar ... ''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _Sobre la reconciliacion ...
 &HT;    _Toda transicion de la dictadura a la democracia requiere cierto
grado de perdon. No se perdona todo; hay una medida de justicia.
Tampoco todo exige justicia, porque tambien hay cierta medida de
perdon. Asi ocurrio en Sudafrica, Brasil, Espana, Portugal,
Argentina, Uruguay a Cual ha sido la diferencia entre todos estos
paises y Chile? Hay una diferencia muy importante: en todos estos
paises, la transicion se culmino porque hubo un consenso nuevo. La
diferencia aqui es que se redacto una Constitucion de acuerdo con
los intereses de Pinochet y todavia no se puede cambiar. La
diferencia es que en Chile la Concertacion recibio el 55 por ciento
de los votos (en cualquier pais europeo o en Estados Unidos, si uno
gana la mayoria tiene la potestad de gobernar) y no tenemos la
potestad de gobernar porque aun somos minoria en el Senado. Que
clase de Constitucion es esa?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    _Sobre la resolucion adecuada de los problemas de Pinochet en el
extranjero ...
 &HT;    _He dicho que los problemas entre los chilenos deben ventilarse
en Chile. Pinochet debe regresar, pero nosotros tambien tenemos una
tarea. Y esa tarea consiste en recuperar una institucionalidad con
la que todos podamos estar de acuerdo.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SANTIAGO _ En 1988, Chile sufria el peso de decada y media de
dictadura cuando el disidente Ricardo Lagos estremecio la nacion
con la fuerza de un terremoto. En un programa de television en
vivo, inesperadamente miro hacia la camara, levanto el dedo y se
dirigio al general Augusto Pinochet, fustigandolo por haber
incumplido su promesa de retirarse antes de una proxima votacion
para decidir si el gobierno militar se extenderia ocho anos mas.
``Y ahora usted le promete a la nacion ocho anos mas de torturas,
asesinatos y violaciones de los derechos humanos. A mi me parece
inadmisible que un chileno tenga tanta ambicion de poder que quiera
mantenerse en el poder 25 anos,'' dijo Lagos. Sus palabras fueron
la chispa que inflamo la incipiente campana para que Pinochet
abandonara el poder. Unos pocos meses despues, los titulares de los
periodicos proclamaban: ``Chile le dice no a Pinochet'' y
repentinamente comenzaba la transicion hacia la democracia.
 &HT;    Diez anos despues, los chilenos vuelven a estar ante un giro de
la historia. En Londres, Pinochet, que ya tiene 83 anos, afronta la
posible extradicion a Espana por acusaciones de genocidio y
tortura, lo que crearia en Chile un inesperado vacio politico
porque el general, a fin de cuentas, ha sido un personaje central
en el panorama politico del pais. Si las encuestas aciertan, el
proximo presidente de Chile sera Ricardo Lagos Escobar, academico
de 61 anos con un doctorado de la Universidad de Duke, en Carolina
del Norte, que fue un lider de la oposicion contra Pinochet y luego
ministro cuando Pinochet entrego el poder.
 &HT;    Las elecciones presidenciales son en diciembre, pero Lagos
encabeza las encuestas desde el ano pasado. Primero debe derrotar a
un viejo rival, Andres Zaldivar, el presidente del Senado, quien
ocupa un debil tercer lugar en los sondeos, en las primarias de la
coalicion de partidos llamada Concertacion, que tendran lugar el 30
de mayo. El ganador debe medirse entonces con la oposicion
encarnada en Joaquin Lavin, de la Union Democratica Independiente
(UDI), de centro derecha, y con la candidatura de Arturo Frei
Bolivar, lider de una coalicion de derecha que podria robarle
votantes a Lavin, un joven alcalde conservador y abierto
pinochetista. ``Es indispensable un cambio en el liderazgo,'' dice
Eugenio Tironi, presidente de la firma santiaguina de mercadeo
Tironi &AMP; Associates y columnista politico. ``Lagos, y Lavin a su
manera, representan esa clase de liderazgo.''
 &HT;    Quien es Ricardo Lagos? ``Esa es una buena pregunta!'' responde
con una carcajada el propio Lagos. Pero el disidente convertido en
burocrata se describe como una fuerza del cambio en los dificiles
dias de la transicion a la democracia. Cuando se le pregunta quien

para aplacar el temor a colocar de nuevo a un socialista en La
Moneda, el palacio presidencial, un cuarto de siglo despues del
golpe militar que puso fin al gobierno de Salvador Allende: ``No
soy un sectario. No soy un ideologo. Soy lo que en Estados Unidos
se llamaria un liberal.''
 &HT;    Como ha ocurrido en otros paises en los ultimos anos, Chile
parece cuestionar su agenda conservadora. Ya es evidente que el
``milagro economico'' chileno (aplaudido desde Washington hasta
Hong Kong y admirado y copiado por las economias emergentes de todo
el mundo) pierde su brillo. Una decada con una poderosa expansion
anual promedio del 7 por ciento, una inflacion moderada y una
estelar tasa de ahorros del 22 por ciento, oculta una constante
declinacion de los indices de crecimiento en los ultimos anos (ver
tabla). El progreso de la economia afronta un peligroso escollo: el
mal estado de carreteras, puentes y puertos, trabajadores poco
calificados y un acosado sistema de salud publica. Segun calculos
locales, Chile necesita invertir unos US$20.000 millones en
infraestructura, que en su estado actual le cuesta al pais casi
US$2.000 millones al ano debido, entre otras cosas, a retrasos del
transporte y a enfermedades causadas por la mala calidad de agua.
 &HT;    La linea que separa a Lagos del afan por resolver los problemas
sociales y del pragmatismo mas porfiado no es mas ancha que el filo
de una navaja. Lagos ha conseguido un gram apoyo de la izquierda en
las encuestas mientras a la vez hablaba de privatizar parcialmente
el ultimo baluarte del estatismo sindicalista de Chile, la
Corporacion Nacional del Cobre (CODELCO). Su promesa de abrir el
coloso cuprifero estatal a la inversion privada es, obviamente, una
maniobra politica para reducir el poder de las fuerzas armadas
chilenas, que por ley reciben el 10 por ciento de los ingresos
anuales de Codelco, que suman casi US$3.000 millones. Pero la

STARTOYS (Phoenix) - Lucasfilm is fending off reporters by the
dozen. The Internet is buzzing with rumors. Fans are plotting to be
first in line. And we aren't talking about the movie.
Frighteningly, this is just about the toys. At 12:01 a.m. Monday,
the Star Wars: Episode I playthings will descend upon the country
with a nearly deafening marketing roar. Retailers across the
country are planning to take advantage of the first minute of the
first date the embargo is lifted. Here's a sneak peek, mostly due
to two folks: local collector Oliver Huish, who found a naughty
Chandler K-Mart that sold toys early, and Dallas Web junkie Philip
Wise, who found his own Star Wars toy manufacturing sources in Hong
Kong. The big news: The toys can talk to each other.By JAIMEE ROSE.
Story will move in the ``A'' and ``E'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PARTNERS (Phoenix) - Chic Older works out alone so people won't see
him cry. However, Older, who is executive director of the Arizona
Medical Association, admits there are significant advantages to
working out with others.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts believe motivation is the single most important
reason for working out with others. Most people, they say, do not
have the discipline to work out solo over a long period. That, in
part, accounts for the success of health clubs and specialty
organizations where people with like interests get together to
bike, run or even walk. By THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``L'
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - It's 12:36 a.m., my eyes fly wide open
and I find myself gasping for breath. I look at the clock and
realize that it's only been three minutes since the last time I've
blown my nose. I find my tissue and blow until I hear my ears pop.
I'm not sick. I have allergies. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the
``L'' category. &QL;  &QL; 
FOODMED (Phoenix) - If Americans need proof that medical
professionals in this country don't recognize the link between food
and health, they need only check out ``the abysmal foods served in
hospitals,'' says Andrew Weil, physician, author and guru of
alternative medicine. Weil appeared on a panel discussing the use
of food as medicine at the annual conference of the International
Association of Culinary Professionals held in Phoenix earlier this
month. By BARBARA YOST. Story will move int he ``L'' category.
llrybarbara yose  &QL; 
VITAMIN COCKTAIL (Phoenix) - Ruth Kawasaki has a cocktail every
morning before work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Tanqueray and vermouth in a seductive glass, Kawasaki
chugs a dozen vitamins and supplements with a water chaser.
Although there is no information on the number of people who take
double-figure dietary supplements daily, surveys show that more
than half of the U.S. population uses dietary supplements and
spends nearly $10 billion on them annually.
</P>
<P>
   But do they really make us healthier? And is more better? With
PHOTO. By THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Fire gets our attention. All heat and
light. But then the flames subside and the smoke dissipates. The
embers cool. Ashes crumble to dust and scatter in the wind. And we
forget. The name Jermaine ``J.R.'' Miguel Jr. means nothing. By
E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By LUCY RUSSELL &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, enthusiasts for American military action
abroad invoked the domino theory: If one country was allowed to
fall to communism, many others would follow.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over Kosovo, opponents of American military action
(including many of those former enthusiasts) invoke a sort of
reverse domino theory: If we save anyone from mass murder or
humanitarian disaster, we'll find ourselves doing it again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   Moral consistency requires us to do nothing in Kosovo because we
can't intervene every time a thug like Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic decides to start slaughtering his own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only argument against the Kosovo intervention.
But is it true? Would it really be an impossible burden to stop
every moral outrage on the level of Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   Isolationist pundits give the impression that the world outside
the United States is a boiling cauldron of centuries-old ethnic
rivalries, in which mass slaughters are everyday occurrences. In
fact, attempts at genocide are fairly rare.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``genocide'' is often invoked rather wildly. Russian
newspapers love to talk about the ``genocide'' against
Russian-speakers in the Baltic states, for example, while European
intellectuals like to accuse Hollywood of committing ``cultural
genocide.'' But genocide has a precise and universally accepted
definition: ``acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in
part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group,'' according
to the 1951 Genocide Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been using the term genocide cynically.
Washington studiously avoided the ``G word'' in describing the
killings in Rwanda, where it clearly applied. By contrast, State
Department spokesman Jamie Rubin has been tossing it around
liberally in the last few weeks, even though human rights groups
say they haven't yet been able to document that genocide is
underway in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the United States, along with its allies, put the horse
before the cart again and committed itself to stopping genocide
wherever it occurred. How many military actions would that have
required in, say, the past 10 years (before Kosovo)?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: three definites and one maybe. The definites are Bosnia,
Rwanda, and Iraq, while the maybe is Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, genocide was arguably underway as early as the summer
of 1992, but the United States did not take military action until
1995. In the interim, thousands of lightly armed troops from NATO
countries stumbled around Bosnia in their U.N. blue helmets, trying
to feed victims and stay out of harm's way. This was a gruesome
farce, and the United States should have acted much earlier, with
substantial firepower, to overwhelm the Bosnian Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the media have tended to explain genocides as the
spontaneous action of one group motivated by insatiable hatred of
another.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how genocides work. Yes, ethnic hatred runs deep
in the Balkans, but Milosevic had to deliberately fan it in order
to start the war, and the genocide, like all genocides, was planned
and executed by a relatively small group of extremely evil people.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda is an even more salient example of this. Perhaps because
Western journalists knew so little about the country, their
reporting suggested that the Hutu-Tutsi conflict was so deeply
rooted, it was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   One hears it endlessly from ``experts'' on TV talk shows:
``These people have been killing each other for hundreds of years,
and there's nothing we can do about it.'' (Even if you know nothing
about Hutu and Tutsi, this argument has no logic. The point is that
the two ethnic groups have been living in peace for a long period,
and something happened to destabilize that peace. That's why it's
in the news, and that's why you, you ignorant windbag, have been
invited on television to discuss it.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a relatively small group of Hutu planned and executed
the Rwandan genocide. They had to coerce and intimidate many of
their fellow Hutu to go along with them -- thousands of Hutu were
also slaughtered in the genocide for failing to join in. They used
the mass media, especially radio, to broadcast their bloody
exhortations. And they used the silence of the outside world --
especially France, Belgium, the United States, and the United
Nations--to justify their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein's gassing of the Kurdish population in 1988 falls
outside the arbitrary 10-year rule. From March to September 1988,
the Iraqi army seized every Kurd in a vast ``prohibited area'' and
carted off nearly 100,000 civilians for execution; it also used
chemical weapons against the Kurdish population. The outside world
did not know the full extent of the killing until reports after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   But those reports established Baghdad as a genocidal regime. So,
when the Kurds came under Iraqi attack again, in 1991, there was
good reason to fear that another genocide was in the offing
(although President Bush's real motivation was defending the
stability of Turkey, where the Kurds were fleeing).
</P>
<P>
   Somalia technically was not a genocide. The 1992-93 famine
lacked the central direction of a genocide, and its victims were
not murdered on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, or
religion. But it was a massive, politically inspired slaughter,
which certainly justified foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that I can't resist including Somalia shows the
difficulty of maintaining any clear line between situations that
justify intervention and those that don't. No doubt there would be
other occasions that clearly met the standard where intervention
was unrealistic. For example, no reasonable person would expect the
United States to invade or bomb Turkey to stop genocide against the
Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   But even a fuzzy and occasionally failed standard would be an
improvement on the ad hoc and random decisions we make now. A
standard for intervention that was universally accepted and
regularly if not uniformly applied might even reduce the number of
occasions when intervention would be needed. If a Milosevic knew
with reasonable certainty that ethnic cleansing would be prevented
and punished, he might not attempt it.
</P>
<P>
   The main point, though, is that there aren't actually all that
many Milosevics in the world. Of the three and a half genocides in
the past decade, the United States and others actually did
intervene--albeit too late or ineptly--in two and a half: Iraq,
Bosnia, and Somalia. Only in Rwanda did the West stand by and do
nothing. A cleaner conscience is not an impossibly ambitious goal.

THE SUMMER JOB FRONT

   Summer is almost here, and financially challenged teens
everywhere are looking for jobs. But even with the great job
opportunities out there lately, it is hard for kids under age 16 to
find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Child labor laws for younger workers cause so many problems that
employers do not like to hire 14 and 15-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure out how to work for your mom,'' suggests high school
student Marcela Evans, 15. ``She is the only one who will hire
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some young teens find summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already had three jobs,'' said 15-year-old high school
student Lindsay Hoying.
</P>
<P>
   The most wanted jobs are at stores with great employee
discounts. Jobs at the mall and secretarial work are scarce. Most
teens end up working in grocery stores or at telemarketing
companies or fast-food places.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting that perfect job is confidence. Filling out
the application neatly and dressing nicely for the interview help
also.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a note from your parents saying you can work late,''
suggests Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   With just one month left until summer, anything to get an
advantage might mean the difference between an allowance and a
paycheck.

   EMINEM
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever think a CD could make you sick?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I didn't think it was possible, until I listened to the
new Eminem CD, ``The Slim Shady LP,'' which recently spawned the
hit song ``My Name Is.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing only half of it, I turned it off in disgust. It
was nothing but a big mix of everything your parents told you to
stay away from.
</P>
<P>
   The songs talk about inappropriate topics, then made it seem
like no big deal. It also made fun of real problems. It's nothing
but one big joke _ and not a very funny one.

ADVICE ABOUT GRADUATION, TATTOOS

   DEAR TeensTalk: I'm a senior this year and getting ready to
graduate. But I missed the boat on signing up for caps and gowns.
When they came around, I didn't sign up for them because I didn't
think walking across the stage was a big deal. My mom started
crying and said I disappointed her. She said she waited her whole
life to see me graduate. Now I want to get a cap and gown, but the
school said it was too late. What should I do? _ Graduation.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Graduation: This is a party you don't want to miss. Many
kids do not understand the importance of participating in their
graduation ceremony. This is your moment of glory. You worked 12
years to complete your education. You and your family deserve to
celebrate your accomplishment of graduating from high school.
</P>
<P>
   So check with the school and get a number from the company that
orders the graduation caps, gowns and the invitations. They have
late orders and will help you get the stuff you need.
Congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I went with some friends to a tattoo shop just
to see what it was like. I wound up getting one. I got one with a
skeleton with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other.
When I got home, I showed it to my parents. I didn't think they'd
mind, but they said it was embarrassing and disgusting. They said I
should have checked with them first, but this is my body and my
choice. They have grounded me for six weeks. I don't think it's
fair. What can I do? Tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Tattoo: Your parents are in shock. They can't change what
has happened, but they can let you know that they don't approve.
And by grounding you, they are letting you know that they want you
to think before you make decisions like this in the future.

   TEENS GUN DOWN CLASSMATES
</P>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Hurling bombs and blasting away with guns,
two students in black trench coats killed 12 schoolmates and a
teacher last Tuesday at Columbine High School, in one of the
deadliest school massacres in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, both were
members of a group of outcasts called the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
They killed themselves after gunning down the students and teacher.

   The pair was apparently enraged by what they considered taunts
and insults from classmates. Investigators said that the boys also
wanted to kill at least 500 others, attack nearby homes and then
hijack a plane and crash it into New York City.

   Texas Gov. George W. Bush ordered flags in Texas lowered to half
staff in response to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so tragic is not only the loss of life but the fact
that there are people in our society who disregard human life to
the point where they will act out their fantasies and aggressions
with weaponry,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, many officials wondered how to stop violence
in schools.

   NEW YORK _ For teens interested in how young people can cope
with such problems, a new interactive Web site gives kids a safe
and trustworthy place to share fears and concerns with each other.
It also offers resources to help resolve teen problems before they
get out of hand. It's at TeenCentral.Net. The site was developed by
KidsPeace, a part of the National Center for Kids Overcoming
Crisis.

   GOODBYE GREAT ONE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wayne Gretzky, known as the best hockey player ever,
retired from hockey after two unforgettable decades on the ice,
walking away from the game he loves, despite pleas from friends and
family not to go.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old ``Great One'' said goodbye in last week's season
finale against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden. The New York
Rangers lost 2-1 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this game,'' Gretzky said. ``No matter what happens,
I'm going to miss it more than anybody.''

   HELPING CHILDREN OF WAR
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston Rockets basketball star Hakeem Olajuwon is
trying to get children involved with relief efforts for refugees
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has agreed to help the Houston office of UNICEF raise
$250,000 to support children in Kosovo. He and Houston Mayor Lee
Brown met last week with students who have developed fund-raising
projects for refugee kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel privileged and am willing to play my role and help
encourage people to step up and do something _ to take
responsibility,'' Olajuwon said.

</P>
<P>
   John Travolta is planning to fly around the world to welcome the
year 2000. The plan is to race across the world's time zones on the
last day of 1999, and although he plans to bring along wife Kelly
Preston, he left her at home for a recent test flight across the
Pacific in his new Boeing 707. He took off into the wild blue
yonder with some fellow flyboys.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ruth Kawasaki has a cocktail every morning before
work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Tanqueray and vermouth in a seductive glass, Kawasaki
chugs a dozen vitamins and supplements with a water chaser.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nicoletti and his wife, Lisa, do much the same. Joe tosses
down a whopping 56 pills, Lisa a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki and the Nicolettis, all Phoenix residents, are among
the burgeoning number of Americans who start each day with vitamin
cocktails, a practice also known as stacking, in which a dozen or
more vitamins, herbals, minerals or food supplements are taken
together as a talisman against poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no information on the number of people who
take double-figure dietary supplements daily, surveys show that
more than half of the U.S. population uses dietary supplements and
spends nearly $10 billion on them annually.
</P>
<P>
   But do they really make us healthier? And is more better?
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and clinical nutritionists often refuse to endorse
dietary supplements, pointing out that many of their manufacturers'
claims to better health never have stood up under rigid, scientific
testing. Besides, they say, if most people simply ate the right
foods in the first place, they wouldn't need vitamin cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Those who advocate alternative medicines or sell dietary
supplements agree that eating better is beneficial, but they say
the bottom line is that people don't eat what they should or they
don't eat the appropriate quantities. Some go further to say that
even if you did eat all the right foods, you'd still be lacking
certain nutrients because of the way food is processed for
large-volume sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the controversy is a nonplused public.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amardeep Majhail, an inter nal-medicine specialist who
practices in the Horizon Medical Clinic in Sun City West, is not
impressed with most dietary supplements, with the exception of St.
John's wort for depression and saw palmetto for prostate problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their popularity is due to people thinking they're
missing out on something,'' Majhail said. ``Everyone wants that
magic bullet, even though there is no scientific basis for all
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Claims made by herbal manufacturers are especially outlandish,
Majhail said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the very popular herbal medicines echinacea and ginkgo
biloba as examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginkgo has been widely touted to improve memory, but there's
been only one brave scientific study about it, and that study
showed its benefits were minute for most people,'' Majhail said.
``Same for echinacea. There's absolutely no scientific proof that
it improves immunity, yet people feel a cold coming on and that's
what they take now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki, a Phoenix family counselor, has no problem including
echinacea in her vitamin-cocktail mix when she feels a cold coming
on. She also takes vitamins A, C and E; multiple vitamins; ginseng;
fruit and vegetable supplements; a digestive aid; and whole
enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know these things work because of my energy level, and I
don't get sick very often,'' Kawasaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicoletti, an ABCO employee, said he's spending about $100 a
month on his habit of taking 56 dietary supplements a day. He began
taking them last September. Included in his pill troupe are
stomach-acid stimulators, St. John's wort, multivitamins, calcium,
magnesium and co-enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat a lot of fast food,'' Nicoletti said, ``so I've always
taken vitamins, just never in this extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his current massive dietary-supplement program after
talking to a nutritionist who analyzed his nutrient deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   An older-brother pharmacist also guided him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all I know, this could be hogwash,'' Nicoletti admitted.
``But I do feel better. I had a problem with being exhausted all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Francis, a staff pharmacist for CIGNA HealthCare, also
takes echinacea for colds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does work,'' Francis said. ``Instead of having a cold for
seven days, I'll only have it for four when I take echinacea.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who has a special interest in alternative medicines,
especially herbs, is convinced echinacea is more than just a
placebo, as some medical experts insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a situation where I expected it to work,'' Francis
said. ``I was very skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, like Majhail, believes food is the best source for
obtaining nutrients, but feels dietary supplements are also
beneficial if used appropriately. She is not an advocate of
stacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the approach where you individualize it,'' Francis
said. ``If I'm a post-menopausal woman worrying about osteoporosis,
I'm going to have a different need than if I'm diabetic. Just to
take a (multi) vitamin that has a little bit of everything in it is
not a good idea. Our bodies are made to take what they need to
maintain health, and anything else is excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lessman, owner of the Winning Combination, a
nutritional-supplement manufacturer in Henderson, Nev., said mixing
dietary supplements is normally not harmful. He and his products
are regularly featured on the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   Lessman, a former biochemistry and medical-school student, takes
issue with Majhail and other physicians who condemn dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical community, by and large, does not have the benefit
of a great deal of information and education in this area,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lessman said he's been putting folic acid in his products for 20
years and was told by doctors that he was foolish. It wasn't until
January of this year that the U.S. Public Health Service announced
that folic-acid supplements are beneficial for pregnant women. It
reported that during the first weeks of pregnancy folic-acid
supplements can cut by 50 to 70 percent a woman's risk of having a
baby with a neural-tube defect, in which the brain and spinal cord
form improperly.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration now requires food manufacturers
to fortify grain products with folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the gap between physicians and patients seeking
alternative medications has given rise to a new niche in the
medical field: the intermediary nutritional consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Zachow of Scottsdale is an independent distributor for a
large dietary-supplement manufacturer, Body Wise International,
based in Tulsa. She's also the wife of Valley physician William E.
Zachow. Recently, she launched a program called PPIP _ Putting
Prevention Into Practice _ in which she consults with doctors on
behalf of patients who would like to take nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of patients are going to their doctors and saying,
`Look, there are so many products out there. What works, what
doesn't? Can you help me?' I work hand in hand with physicians in
letting them know what is available and the research behind the
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many physicians are reluctant to endorse dietary
supplements for reasons that go beyond whether the supplements
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we see is that patients sometimes focus so
much on their dietary supplements that they forget to take their
prescription medications, which really help them,'' Majhail said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, despite their gentle nature, there still can be risks in
mixing certain combinations of minerals and vitamins. He tells a
story from his own practice of a woman who had chronic diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't understand why,'' Majhail said. ``When we found
out she was taking all these vitamins and supplements, we had her
stop them, and the diarrhea immediately disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitamins A and D are quite notorious for causing toxicities,
Majhail said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vitamin K can neutralize a lot of medicines, like blood
thinners,'' Majhail said. ``Patients who have a propensity for
developing kidney stones, if they keep taking calcium and vitamin
D, they will be causing themselves more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, the CIGNA pharmacist, said vitamins adversely can
affect certain antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that calcium, iron and magnesium will bind up a
new group of antibiotics for upper-respiratory problems so they're
not absorbed into your body,'' Francis said. ``If you're taking a
multivitamin, don't take it with an antibiotic. Wait a couple
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale allergist Dr. Michael Manning sees his share of
patients who are allergic to certain medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Francis points out that alternative medicines, and
Chinese medicine in particular, have been around a lot longer than
modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's something to it,'' Francis said. ``And as a
pharmacist, I see the side effects of the modern medications I
dispense. They're not free of risks, either.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2) CAUTIONS &QL; 
Negative reactions &QL; 
Dietary supplements and various medicines may have negative
interactions. Never guess if taking medications and supplements at
the same time. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about potential
conflicts. &QL; 
Known negative interactions include: &QL; 
- Vitamin K and blood-thinning medications may decrease the
effectiveness of the blood-thinning medication.  &QL; 
- Certain antibiotics and multivitamins can prevent antibiotics
from working. &QL; 
- Vitamin D and antacids with magnesium may cause too much
magnesium in blood, especially in people suffering kidney failure. &QL; 
- Vitamin D and diuretics increase risk of hypercalcemia (too much
calcium in the blood). &QL; 
- Mixing certain supplements together also can cause problems. The
most common negative reaction is one supplement preventing another
from being absorbed. Some reactions can be more serious. Potassium
and calcium, for instance, increase the possibility of heartbeat
irregularities. Supplements alone also can have bad reactions in
people allergic to them. Adverse reactions include:  &QL; 
- Bee pollen may cause itching. &QL; 
- Echinacea may cause dermatitis.  &QL; 
- Kava kava may cause drowsiness. &QL; 
- Ginkgo biloba may cause diarrhea or headaches. &QL; 
- Magnesium may cause abdominal pain or appetite loss. &QL; 
- Vitamin A may cause hair loss or bone-joint pain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3) REGULATIONS &QC; 
Dietary supplements &QL; 
In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was
established for Food and Drug Administration regulation of dietary
supplements. Effective in March, the following information must
appear on the labels of dietary supplements: - Statement of
identity (for example, ginseng). &QL; 
- Net quantity of contents (for example, 60 tablets). &QL; 
- Purpose for using product with the disclaimer that it has not
been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. &QL; 
- Directions for use. &QL; 
- Facts panel (serving size, amount and active ingredients). &QL; 
- Other ingredients in descending order of prominence. &QL; 
- Name and place of business of manufacturer. &QL;

MULLEN SELLS MAJORITY STAKE TO INTERPUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Mullen, the third largest ad agency in New England and
the region's largest independent agency, has sold a majority stake
of its business to a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., the New
York conglomerate that last year bought Boston ad agency Hill,
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly consolidating ad industry, Mullen is the third
big ad agency to be purchased by an outside-the-region
communications company in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced Wednesday, Mullen will keep its
autonomy; founder Jim Mullen will remain chief executive of the
Wenham agency for the next few years and there will be no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mullen: ``I want to stabilize the future of this company.
This was an opportunity to preserve our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen's clients include L.L. Bean, Swiss Army Brands, and
Polartec. Mullen was recently hailed as the region's ad agency of
the year by Adweek New England, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but ad agencies have
generally been selling for 1 to 1.5 times annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Given that independent ad agencies are becoming increasingly
scarce, Mullen may have fetched a premium price, said Adweek New
England editor Judy Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen had revenues of about $38 million last year, and IPG's
Lowe Group division is buying a 70 percent equity position in
Mullen, according to sources. That would mean the deal could be
worth from $27 million to $40 million in cash and IPG stock.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are driving consolidation in the ad industry.
</P>
<P>
   First, many agency founders are nearing retirement. For Mullen,
58, the sale is a way to cash out his investment.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic partly prompted Ed Eskandarian to sell Arnold
Communications to Snyder Communications of Maryland last year and
Jack Connors to sell Hill Holliday to IPG.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many client businesses are looking to hire agencies
with global reach, ones that can offer a wide range of services
including public relations and Internet marketing. Today a regional
ad agency may be too small to handle the marketing chores of a big
multinational corporation like Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   To address the needs of global giants, publicly traded
communications conglomerates have sprung up. Buoyed by a bull
market, these companies have used their rising stock shares to help
finance strings of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, firms such as IPG, Omnicom Group, and True
North Communications have bought ad agencies, PR firms, and
direct-marketing shops as they seek to put together portfolios of
communications companies that can provide soup-to-nuts marketing
services to even the largest of clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a steady stream of acquisitions for the last 10
years,'' said William Blair &AMP; Co. analyst Anthia Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, it was almost inevitable that Mullen
would be snapped up, and founder Mullen said he had talked with
many suitors in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   In other industries, acquisitions generally mean that two
companies are blended into one, with the smaller company often
losing its identity and some of its work force as efficiencies are
sought. But acquisitions are different in the ad industry.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its creativity, an ad agency's most valuable assets
are its paying clients. If an acquisition causes some clients to
defect, the acquisition loses some of its value.
</P>
<P>
   What would cause a client to defect? Suppose two ad agencies
represented two rival banks. If the two ad agencies joined forces,
one of the banks would almost surely leave, fearing that
proprietary information might be leaked to its competitor.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent client defections, a company such as IPG keeps the ad
agencies it buys separate and autonomous. As a result, it's not
unusual for two ad agencies owned by the same holding company to
compete against each other for a prospective client's business.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Mullen and Hill Holliday are now part of the same
New York company, don't expect them to be mingled.
</P>
<P>
   With this acquisition, Ingalls of Boston becomes the region's
largest independent ad agency. Ingalls had capitalized billings of
$141 million in 1998. That compares with Mullen's $254 million,
Hill Holliday's $707 million, and Arnold's $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What impact will the sale of local ad agencies to outsiders have
on the region? That's not immediately clear. On one hand,
acquisitions often accelerate growth at the purchased ad agency and
create more local jobs, Adweek's Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is less tangible'' and unlikely to be apparent
until the ad agencies' founders step down, something not expected
to happen for another few years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as an agency evolves from an independent privately owned
shop to part of a publicly traded company, at which the goal is to
maximize profitability, the contributions and pro bono work local
agencies do for local charities could decrease, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Boston was a branch office for big New York
ad agencies, said Skip Pile of Pile and Co., a Boston consulting
firm. Then several young men, notably Mullen and Connors, decided
to help open their own local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now gone through a 30-year cycle,'' Pile said.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, IPG shares fell 2 5/16 to 78
after hitting a 52-week high earlier in the day.

WILSON PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER WITH THE BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Landon Wilson insists it was not his formal
introduction as a bona fide National Hockey Leaguer. Dave Karpa
certainly would disagree _ if he could remember anything about the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson turned the Carolina defenseman into a virtual hologram
with a calamitous check that forced a giveaway and set up the
Bruins' first goal Monday night at the FleetCenter. No matter that
Boston went on to lose the game, 3-2, and trailed in the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal, 2-1, when the teams
took the ice Wednesday. Wilson couldn't be blamed _ for a pleasant
change.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the 6-foot-2-inch, 215-pound right wing was one
of the Bruins' few effective forwards through the first three
games, throwing around his weight _ and Hurricanes _ with abandon.
The Karpa pancake was merely Exhibit A.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his fourth pro season with his third organization,
it seems that Wilson finally has fit together the pieces of a game
that had been a Rubik's Cube for him since Toronto chose him with
the 19th pick in the 1993 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a reflection of the way the team is playing, the
way my linemates (Sergei Samsonov and Joe Thornton) are playing,''
said Wilson. ``We're playing well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are differences of opinion as to why the
24-year-old is emerging as a force after a maddening shuttle
between the minors and the NHL with Colorado, which acquired him
from the Maple Leafs in 1994, and Boston, which sent a first-round
draft pick to the Avalanche to get him on Nov. 22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who played just 22 regular-season games with Boston in
1998-99, believes his development is the inevitable result of
increased playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more ice you get, the more confidence you get,'' said
Wilson. ``When I was up before, I was playing on the fourth line,
getting maybe five shifts a game. I was up for injury purposes. I
knew I wasn't here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns sees the equation in reverse: The extended
activity is the product of Wilson's belated development, which
Burns has been awaiting since he was coaching Toronto when the
Leafs drafted the University of North Dakota star.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with Toronto,'' said Burns, ``I was told about all
the things we're seeing now _ a big, strong player.''
</P>
<P>
   What Burns really means is that Wilson finally is playing big
and strong. That wasn't consistently the case in the past; hence,
Wilson's failure to stick in the majors, regardless of his
revisionist history about lack of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maturity part is coming into play,'' said Burns. ``That's
the big thing. He wasn't always sure what he wanted to do (in terms
of playing style). People say, `Why don't you tell the player what
he has to do?' Well, you do tell him. But you can talk to him all
you want. It has to come from within the player. When you talk to
him enough, sometimes you say, `If you want to be that way, then go
ahead down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That kept Wilson on the commuter track to Providence amid a
series of unsuccessful flings with Boston. This season he
established himself at the AHL level, earning first-team All-Star
honors despite playing just 48 games between recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing my game consistently in Providence, night in and
night out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question was whether he ever would figure out how to do that
at the top level. Burns, who could see the tantalizing traces of
potential, had begun to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he was going to mature during this lifetime of
hockey,'' said the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more perplexing, Wilson comes from a hockey
pedigree _ two uncles played in the NHL and his father, Rick, is an
NHL veteran who now serves as an assistant coach in Dallas. Yet
Wilson still wasn't getting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to his father a little,'' said Burns. ``And I talked
to Landon a lot. I think he's one of those guys who needs
(guidance).''
</P>
<P>
   Burns always has felt it was worth the effort. ``I liked Wilson
in Toronto,'' he said. ``When you get a big, strong player like
that, you've got a player for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems to have arrived for Wilson.

PRISONER TRIES TO CATCH UP AFTER 40 YEARS IN SOUTH KOREAN JAIL

 By   NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ For four decades in prison, Woo Yong Gak
coolly handled just about every challenge life could throw at him,
from the most brutal tortures to endless spells of solitary
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few things do intimidate Woo these days in a way that
torturers never could. Vending machines, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you do this, anyway?'' Woo asked, staring in puzzlement
at a hot drink machine on a Seoul street. ``I've never used one of
these contraptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Woo, 69, emerged in February after 40 years, 7 months and 13
days in prison, after becoming known in human rights circles as the
world's longest-serving political prisoner. After decades simply as
Prisoner 3514, he has recovered his name and he has a nice new
watch on his wrist and he is even taking lessons in using
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said quickly, ``I haven't gotten as far as getting
an e-mail address.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere could a Rip Van Winkle encounter greater changes in four
decades than in South Korea, the world's fastest-growing economy in
that period. These changes are particularly poignant because they
would seem to challenge everything that Woo believed in, everything
that carried him through beatings and sickness and the constant
threat of anonymous death in the darkness of his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Woo endured because of his faith in the Communist government of
North Korea, and in 1958, when he was arrested, that might have
seemed a good bet. North Korea then was booming economically and
was regarded by many Koreans as a more legitimate government than
the American-backed dictatorship in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now Woo has been released into a different world, one where
South Korea is a rich, industrialized country and a vigorous
democracy. North Korea, on the other hand, is so poor that it is
suffering a famine, and it remains a tightly run authoritarian
nation halfway between a Communist country and an ancient Korean
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   None of this persuades Woo to change his loyalties. In a long
conversation in the offices of a human rights group that battled on
his behalf, he comes across as friendly, humorous, polite _ and a
dedicated North Korean Communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue isn't economic development,'' he said stoutly,
dismissing South Korea's economic gains. ``GNP _ that's just
numbers. The fact that the living standard has increased might be
an interesting research topic, but it's not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Woo is not particularly impressed by the degree
of freedom in the society that imprisoned him for 40 years. For a
determined Korean nationalist like Woo, the crucial issue is
whether a country is self-sufficient and can stand on its own. And
there he finds North Korea does better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost our self-reliance here,'' he added, referring to
South Korea. ``Economically, politically and militarily, the level
of dependence on the outside has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, as a vibrant democracy whose president, Kim Dae
Jung, is himself a longtime dissident, may seem like an odd place
to have held the world's longest-serving political prisoner. But
South Korea somehow manages to be deeply authoritarian as well as
vigorously democratic, and there is strong public support for
repressive laws that punish anyone who praises the enemy in the
North.
</P>
<P>
   Minkahyup, a leading human rights group, says South Korea still
has more than 200 political prisoners. The longest-serving
political prisoner now that Woo has been released is Sohn Song Mo,
70, who has been imprisoned for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kim Dae Jung has been honored with human rights
awards and touted as a `human rights president,''' said Nam Kyu
Sun, the secretary general of Minkahyup. ``But such things don't
make a `human rights president.'''
</P>
<P>
   The way for Kim to really earn the title, Mrs. Nam said, would
be to ease the National Security Law that punishes Communist
sympathizers and to curtail the security organizations that now run
around seizing people who praise North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although Woo came to be renowned as a political prisoner, he
started his prison career as an ordinary spy. He was commander of a
boat that was gathering intelligence on South Korea's coast when he
and his comrades were captured in July 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But such intruders were quickly released if they agreed to
denounce North Korea and cooperate with the South, and indeed some
of Woo's companions were freed in this way. Even terrorists who
blew up a South Korean airliner and attacked the presidential
mansion were pardoned after switching sides, and no one doubts that
Woo would have been freed as well if he had not stubbornly clung to
his faith in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the torturers battered Woo, trying to force him
to sign a statement denouncing North Korea. He lost his teeth to
the torture _ now he is outfitted with dentures _ and he says his
best times in those decades were the moments when he felt himself
fainting from the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a peaceful feeling,'' he recalled. ``I was so
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most unbearable thing was watching my friends dying of the
torture, one by one,'' he said, adding that 12 of his companions
died that way. The worst heartache, he said, was when a childhood
friend, Choi Seok Ki, was stomped to death in his prison cell for
refusing to renounce North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   When Woo left on his mission, he had a wife and a 4-year-old son
in North Korea, and he says the knowledge that they were safe was
an enormous comfort to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought that my child would remember me as a father who
went missing while fighting for reunification was a source of great
strength to me,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea and South Korea have talked publicly about
exchanging prisoners, so that Woo could go home and see his family
again _ although he has no word on whether they are still alive.
But those talks quickly broke down, and so Woo remains stuck in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to make the most of it by taking his computer
classes and trying to acquire skills that might help him get a job
in some charitable organization. But he has a lot to catch up on,
for until his release he had never done something so simple as ride
a subway or make a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that are common knowledge to other people are all new
to me,'' he said with a laugh. ``I've made some phone calls, now,
but I'm still really bad at speaking on the telephone.''

BRUINS HAVE TO BE THEIR OWN BEST FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Well, yes, you want to win because that's the basic
object of the exercise, isn't it? You win, and then you advance to
another seven-game series, and then another, and the next thing you
know you're playing for the championship and if you win that you
get to skate around holding up The Cup and Jeremy Jacobs might even
dismount his golden throne and shake your hand, presuming, of
course, that he can even tell his Swedes from his Russians from his
Ukranians from his Canadians from his Americans from the Crunch and
Munch Man.
</P>
<P>
   You play to win; that's a given. But _ and this is not exactly a
major news bulletin _ the 1999 Boston Bruins aren't really playing
to win the Stanley Cup. That's in the realm of fantasy for many of
the participants, not including the Senators and Mighty Ducks, each
of whom have already cleaned out their lockers following
first-round sweeps. Anyway, who doesn't know that the Stanley Cup
winner is coming out of the West?
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is still a lot to play for, particularly if you
are Pat Burns and what your team basically consists of is a lead
dog and a bunch of pups. There is no George Allen thing going on
here. The future for this hockey club most assuredly is not now. He
is trying to build something here, and the primary gauge of a
successful 1998-99 season is for his team to win a series. Not win
the Cup. Win one series. Anything after that, frankly, will be
gravy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for this team to win a series,'' asserts
38-year-old resident legend Raymond Bourque, the obvious lead dog
on this sled. ``We have a lot of young guys and we need to take the
next step so they can experience the feeling. Last year they got a
taste of what it's all about by getting into the playoffs. Now if
we can win a series it will be an important step in their growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year our goal was to get into the playoffs,'' confirms
Burns. ``This year the goal was to get into the playoffs and
advance. We're not going to build Rome in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth of this team is truly astonishing. Burns suited up 18
non-goaltenders for Wednesday's Game 4 against the Carolina
Hurricanes, and 12 of them were 25 years of age or younger.
Combined winning playoff series of the 11: zero (0).
</P>
<P>
   (itals)What could Ray Bourque possibly have in common with these
kids? He remembers 45s. He probably saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan.
He stumbled through an entire childhood without Velcro.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' maintains Burns. ``Having a team this young
is exciting for the organization and for the city. But I do have to
maintain a different frustration level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids.
</P>
<P>
   There are 25-year-olds (Hal Gill, Darren Van Impe, Mattias
Timander). There are 24-year-olds (Anson Carter, Landon Wilson, Ken
Belanger). There are 23-year-olds (Jason Allison, P.J. Axelsson,
Shawn Bates). There is a 21-year-old (Kyle McLaren). There is a
20-year-old (Sergei Samsonov). And there is a 19-year-old (Joe
Thornton).
</P>
<P>
   Kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that can't be taught by a coach,'' Burns
says. ``They have to be experienced. You can talk to these young
players all you want, but in order for them to absorb certain
things they have to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this youth there is one very intriguing
individual. ``I'm tired of losing,'' declares that wily old veteran
McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   Surely McLaren must be an exception here to this youth thing.
C'mon, coach, doesn't a guy with 264 games combined regular-season
and playoff experience qualify as a ``veteran,'' even though he
won't turn 22 until June 18?
</P>
<P>
   Burns shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a `veteran' if you go by seniority,'' says the mentor,
``but he's still learning. He has to be shaken up every now and
then. He has to learn that if you want to win you have to come to
practice prepared to work every day and that you can't be running
around out there wildly, that you've always got to be in control of
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that McLaren feels like a weary veteran when it
comes to this playoff business. He engaged in his first playoff
series as an 18-year-old rookie three years ago. The Bruins went
down in five games to the Florida Panthers, and it certainly made
an impression on him. ``I looked around the locker room and there
was no emotion on the faces of the veterans,'' McLaren recalls.
``You could hear a pin drop in that room. That was a team people
thought was good enough to go all the way at the start of the
season and no one was ready to go out in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even get in the playoffs two years ago. Last year the
Bruins re-entered the Stanley Cup process, but lost out to the
Washington Capitals in six games. This year he'd like to stick
around. After all, he hasn't really won anything in, oh, seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think back to my hometown (Humboldt,
Saskatchewan),'' he says. ``It was a great feeling to win the
Western Canada championship when I was 14. But this is 10 times
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   At least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win because I want to win, not just to get a taste
of playoff success,'' says Allison. ``But it would definitely be a
big step for us. It would help us down the road to know what it
feels like. I've won two World Juniors and a Calder Cup, so I have
something to relate to, but it's not the same as winning something
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Ray Bourque remembers when Don Cherry was a coach, not a
national institution. Ray Bourque predates SUVs. Ray Bourque grew
up using a dial phone. Ray Bourque played with Cashie, Cheesie,
Doakie, Schmautzie, and Nifty, not to mention Gentleman Jean
Ratelle and Brad Paaahk.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Burns repeats. ``It's important for these
kids to go through all the emotions _ the highs and the lows.''
</P>
<P>
   They already know about the lows. Now they must provide
themselves with a high.

EPA CHIEF BOOSTS FEDERAL OPEN-SPACE PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Warning that Americans' quality of life is under siege
from sprawling development and traffic jams, President Clinton's
top environmental official came to Boston Wednesday to promote new
federal programs that would protect open space and help create
neighborhoods where people can walk to the corner store.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Browner, administrator of the US Environmental Protection
Agency, said that 1,200 acres of open space are developed in New
England every week, while traffic congestion costs people scores of
hours a year in wasted time.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said Clinton wants to help local and state governments
turn the tide, and has proposed a $10 billion no-interest bond fund
to protect land and $1.6 billion to reduce road congestion and
boost mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cities, towns, and communities . . . need help if they are
to be vibrant in the century to come,'' said Browner, speaking in a
Ford Hall Forum lecture at the Boston Center for Adult Education.
``The president's livability agenda is giving them the tools they
need to get that job done.''
</P>
<P>
   This Clinton agenda, a favorite of Vice President Al Gore, is
aimed at national anxiety over such trends as development that
creates long commercial strips at the expense of downtowns and a
burgeoning suburban population that must drive practically
everywhere they go.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, voters confronted a record 240 environmental ballot
initiatives, approving $7.5 billion in state and local spending
mainly to preserve land from development. In Massachusetts, Cape
Cod residents approved a 3 percent surcharge on their property
taxes to preserve land.
</P>
<P>
   In response, EPA has promoted redevelopment of former industrial
land in cities, and held a conference on sprawl in Boston this year
that was attended by nearly 1,000 people. In addition, Clinton
proposed his Better America Bonds to buy land in his state of the
union speech.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have attacked Clinton's livability plans, doubting
that there is a role for the federal government in such local
matters as highway planning and oversight of development.
</P>
<P>
   But Browner said there is a national interest in creating
``livable'' communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a human cost here. Studies say we lose two full
working weeks a year, or more, stuck in traffic,'' said Browner. In
addition, she said the economy loses $74 billion a year in lost
work and wasted fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Browner said she envisioned an America where
``families won't have to burn a quart of gas to get a quart of
milk. Parks will sprout on abandoned industrial sites that are now
unsafe for children. And stands of trees, protected from
development, will protect rivers and creeks for the wildlife that
need them and the families that want to enjoy them.''

SPLIT PERFORMANCE LEAVES MARKET FLAT, ANALYSTS CONFUSED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chemical, paper and other stocks sensitive to the
business cycle turned in another strong performance Wednesday while
technology and other longtime market leaders sagged.
</P>
<P>
   The sharply split performance, which resulted in a flat market
overall, left analysts struggling to figure the significance of
this month's sudden but erratic revival of cyclical stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market doesn't have a well-organized, broad-based economic
theme to support itself anymore,'' said Christine Callies, chief
investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It's
confusing. The market goes in several different directions at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, driven by cyclical stocks,
sailed above the 10,900 mark for the first time but swooned late in
the session and managed to hang on to only 13.74 points of a gain
that had swelled to more than 103 points. Still, the one-tenth of a
percent rise, to 10,845.45, was a new high.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, lost 52.04 points, or 2
percent, to 2,550.37, as software and computer stocks slumped, led
by Amazon.com, which fell 12 3/8, to 193 1/2. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 11.89 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to
1,350.91.
</P>
<P>
   All of the top-performing blue-chip stocks from Wednesday stand
to benefit from stepped-up global economic growth. Alcoa added 6
5/8, to 62; Dupont rose 4 3/8, to 73 1/2; Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing climbed 3 11/16, to 84 1/2; Exxon increased 3 1/4, to
81 1/2, and Allied Signal was up 3 1/16, to 59 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drags on the Dow were IBM, down 7, to 205, and
American Express, down 5 11/16, to 133 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing continued rotation away from consumer stocks,
particularly pharmaceuticals, into industrial companies and oils,''
said Timothy Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors.
Merck fell 2 13/16, to 70 3/4, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson dropped 2
7/16, to 99 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Winters, chief investment officer at Mellon Private Asset
Management, called America's large-capitalization growth stocks
``perhaps the most overpriced asset'' in the world. Money should
flee them, he said, and ``flow to the broader universe of stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical jumped 8 1/2, to 126 1/2, to lead a strong showing
by chemical companies. The paper group featured Mead, up 4 3/4, to
43 5/16, with the aid of a recommendation by Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter; Bowater rose 5 7/8, to 52, after earnings fell less than
expected, and Georgia-Pacific increased 4 1/16, to 94 1/8. Its gain
is now above 60 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The most actively traded issue, McKesson HBOC, the biggest drug
wholesaler, was one of the biggest casualties. It plunged 31 1/4,
to 34 1/2, after restating earnings because of improperly recorded
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna joined the long list of big companies that beat Wall
Street's expectations this spring and its shares soared 10 1/8, to
92. But America Online, whose report after the close on Tuesday did
little better than match forecasts, dropped 10, to 143, still more
than eight times its price on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, which fell for a second consecutive day after five
advances, reflected losses in its dominant high-technology sector,
with Microsoft, down 1 7/8, to 82 1/8, having the biggest effect.
Next were Cisco, which was down 3 5/16, to 111 3/4; Dell, which
fell 1 9/16, to 41 5/8, and Amazon.com. Ebay skidded 16 11/16, to
192 9/16, and Yahoo fell 11, to 173 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley Cyclical index jumped 2.6 percent, its
biggest gain since April 15, and lifted its gain for the month to
more than 20 percent.
</P>

COMMENTARY: UNMASKING POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Ill., Ariz., Mich., N.Y.)  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cities have not been in the news much lately. Crime is down,
unemployment is down and the ghettos are not burning down. What's
to cover?
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Monica and impeachment, the war in the Balkans,
high school massacres and Hillary's quest for fulfillment, the
status of daily life in places like Rochester, N.Y., or Flint,
Mich., is _ to most people _ not worth thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes Andrew Cuomo to awaken us from our urban snooze.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a booming national economy and the creation of millions
of jobs, many American cities still face a bewildering array of
very serious problems. In an important new report called ``Now Is
the Time: Places Left Behind in the New Economy,'' Cuomo, the
secretary of housing and urban development, argues that the current
economic environment ``offers the best opportunity in a generation
to effectively address these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel-good stories about the economy are waved in our faces like
pompoms, making it easy to miss the astonishing fact (to cite just
one example) that the poverty rate for the city of Miami is 42.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That should be unacceptable, and a big story. But it's not even
part of the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities are doing reasonably well. But Cuomo's report,
released Wednesday in Washington, says that one in three central
cities are struggling with persistently high poverty rates, one in
five are experiencing steady population losses and one in six are
faced with chronically high unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are pervasive. According to the report, ``The
comparatively high unemployment areas, most of which are small or
mid-sized cities, are found throughout the nation, from farm cities
to former industrial giants, from timber towns to former mining
centers: Yuma, Ariz., saw its unemployment rate fall modestly, from
19 percent in 1992 (pre-recovery) to 18.8 percent in 1998; Madera,
Calif.'s rate fell more than 5 percent over the last six years but
remains high at 18.3 percent; North Chicago, Ill., saw a modest
drop from 10.7 percent in 1992 to 10.3 percent last year; and
unemployment in Yakima, Wash., has declined from 13.7 percent to
10.2 percent, still more than twice the national average in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The jobless rate in Madera, Calif., or Yakima, Wash., is not
high on the list of most Americans' concerns. They are out of sight
and far out of mind. And even in big cities like New York and
Chicago, the ugly pockets of poverty and joblessness lie hidden and
neglected in the shadows that surround the glittering economic
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy is in some ways deceptive,'' said Cuomo. ``It is
so strong that it has generated almost an economic euphoria. But
when you look at the numbers underneath, you see a widespread group
of cities and counties which are lagging behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most of the country is doing well, and because of the
residential and employment patterns that have emerged in the last
few decades, most Americans never see the areas of extreme economic
distress, and don't encounter their fellow citizens who are
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that as he traveled the country talking about these
problems, the reaction he frequently got was surprise. ``You have
to expose it because people don't see it anymore,'' he said.
``They're surprised that it still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The report lists what it describes as the economic successes of
the Clinton administration, including the creation of 18 million
jobs, the lowest peacetime unemployment rates in decades, decreases
in poverty rates among blacks and Hispanics, and a record rate of
home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those successes, the report says in its conclusion,
``The great project of our nation _ extending opportunity to all _
remains incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems of America's cities are not limited to the cities.
They have bled into the suburbs and they are evident in many areas
of chronic economic distress, including Appalachia, the Mississippi
Delta region and many of the nation's Indian reservations _ places
Cuomo refers to as ``economic flatliners.''
</P>
<P>
   If those problems are not forcefully addressed when the national
economy is strong and budget surpluses are huge, said Cuomo, then
when?

BRUINS LOOK TO KHRISTICH'S SCORING KNACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In search of . . . Dmitri Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   Headed into Game 4 of the Bruins-Hurricanes Eastern Conference
quarterfinal series Wednesday, Boston coach Pat Burns went
sleuthing for his top-scoring right wing. Khristich disappeared in
the first three games, totaling only one shot across 197 minutes,
and it didn't take an ex-cop, with a summa cum laude in street
sense, to figure out that Khristich was the key to the Bruins
getting back in the series.
</P>
<P>
   When Burns found Khristich, he delivered the obvious message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him this morning, `Deemer, you're frustrating me, and
I'm frustrating you,' '' Burns said following a workout at the
FleetCenter, where the Bruins were looking to even the seven-game
series at two wins apiece. ``He's frustrating his teammates, and
they're frustrating him. He's got to get his head up and get
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Burns dismissed any temptation he might have had to
sit out Khristich or reduce the enigmatic winger's ice time for
Game 4. In fact, he eschewed a kick in the derriere and instead
went with a vote of confidence. Rarely seen on the ice in the late
stages of Game 3, Khristich was penciled in to be back on a line
with Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov, setting him up for ample
ice time and a chance to play himself back into good graces.
</P>
<P>
   Does that line sound familiar? It should. For the better part of
two seasons, the trio has formed Boston's top performing line.
After three games in which the Bruins barely scratched together an
offense against the scrappy 'Canes, it was Burns's attempt _
perhaps his only remaining hope _ to find a way back into the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Look, Deemer, I've been a good supporter of you,'
'' said Burns. ``But I also said, `Now I want something back.'
Heck, we need his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   No Bruin scored more goals than Khristich during the regular
season. He potted 29, most of them when riding with Samsonov and
Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the line combinations the last two years,'' said
Allison, thinking ahead to the night's reuniting, ``no one's played
as well as us. If we can find that again, we'll be a tough team to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Headed into the postseason, the Bruins were confident that they
had a bonafide two-line attack, with Allison skating much of the
time with Steve Heinze and Anson Carter. Jumbo Joe Thornton
finished the regular season with Khristich and Samsonov, in part
because Allison was nursing a sore wrist in the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But when Game 1 opened, Thornton was sidelined (strained
sternum), leaving Samsonov and Khristich with Randy Robitaille, a
loaner from the Baby B's of Providence. Allison remained with
Carter and Heinze. In short, nothing clicked. Rob DiMaio and Ken
Belanger had the Game 1 goals, a 2-0 Boston victory. But in Games 2
and 3, with Thornton back, the Bruins dropped to a 2-1 series
deficit in large part because they couldn't establish any first- or
second-line presence.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich, in particular, looked lost. It's one thing to take
shots and miss, or get stoned by the goalie. But Khristich wasn't
even in the play. He skated aimlessly, shift after shift, returning
to the bench zombie-like, his gaze fixed to the floor until it was
again his time to roll over the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through these things before, too, and it's tough,''
said Allison, reflecting on Khristich's cold spell. ``I went
through it when I was in Washington and, hey, I went through it for
25 or 30 games this year _ a stretch when I wasn't playing well at
all. It's not as if you're not trying, but it's like, no matter
what you do out there, it doesn't accomplish anything. It's hard to
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond wanting the obvious, such as a handful of goals, Burns
was looking for the Allison-Khristich-Samsonov trio to play a
smart, simple game. To wit: Allison and Khristich had to commit
themselves to grinding the puck low in the offensive end and
Samsonov, if not leading the play across the blue line, could swoop
in as an effective trailing shooter. Samsonov, emphasized Burns,
could not concern himself with making fancy plays, a trademark,
though crowd-pleasing at times, that too often can lead to costly
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is such a big part of coming out of something like
this,'' said Allison. ``But you can't just say, `Hey, I'm
confident.' It's not that easy. You just have to keep playing until
you get into a zone, or a flow, and then you're all right. Even if
he's not scoring, Deemer's still good in our end. There are some
guys, all they can do is score. Otherwise, they're no good to you
at all. In fact, they hurt you. But Deemer's good defensively, he
can play the penalty kill _ he can do a lot more than score
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   All true. All vital. Every team needs quality, complete players,
and Khristich has been that for most of his two years in Boston.
But for the first three games in the spring of '99, he showed up
with a noticeable chunk missing from his repertoire. He wasn't
skating. He wasn't shooting. He wasn't even noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than send him to the dungeon, Burns chose to boost him
back to the No. 1 line. Did he have a choice? Not really. He could
have slipped Cameron Mann or Ken Baumgartner into the equation, but
Burns didn't see that as addition by subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 was Khristich's chance to come back to the dance. And
everyone waited to see if heard the music.

 &HT;    HOUSE VOTES TO RESTRICT ANY GROUND WAR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided House of Representatives voted Wednesday
to restrict President Clinton's power to wage a ground offensive
against Yugoslavia, but stopped short of ordering him to withdraw
U.S. forces from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In their first formal response to the five-week-old air war, the
lawmakers voted 249-180 to deny funding for ground troops unless
the president wins authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected a measure to require Clinton to bring home
the U.S. forces involved in the NATO operation, 290 to 139. It also
trounced a proposal, with only two ``yes'' votes, to make a formal
declaration of war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the action on ground troops was
uncertain, since the Senate would have to pass a similar bill,
which could then be vetoed by the president. Moreover, several
senators have introduced a proposal that would extend the
president's authority to use ``all means necessary,'' including
ground troops, in the Balkan struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the emotional daylong debate aired long simmering
disputes over the the U.S. role in the Balkans, the
administration's conduct of the war, and whether Congress has a
constitutional duty to play a role in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not even be in the Balkans,'' said House Armed
Services Chairman Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C. ``The national security
of the United States is not at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the mission countered that Americans had an
obligation to stop the assaults on ethnic Albanians by the forces
of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosovic. ``The voices of
appeasement and isolationism are reverberating in these halls,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who fled the Nazis during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Other members complained that there were no good options. Rep.
Herbert H. Bateman, D-Va., said the Balkan conflict offered ``one
of the most dismal range of policy choices this House has ever been
asked to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had attempted to preempt the House action by
reassuring lawmakers in person and through a letter in which he
wrote the would seek their consent before deciding to wage a ground
war. In remarks outside of the White House during the House debate,
the president said he was asking the lawmakers to follow the
example of unity set by the NATO summit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are speaking with a single
voice,'' he said. ``America must continue to speak with a single
voice as well.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told his
colleagues that it was unnecessary to pass a law requiring
authorization to expand the air assault into a land operation.
``The president said he would not as a practical matter ask for an
introduction of ground troops without coming here and taking the
time to ask us for a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance was not enough for some members. Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., one of the managers who conducted the impeachment
trial in the Senate against Clinton, told his colleagues: ``I do
not have the confidence'' that Clinton will seek a vote before
ordering troops into ground action, he said. ``Now's the time to
speak, more than less, sooner rather than later, before we get a
lot of people killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the House refused to go along with a resolution by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to withdraw the troops from the conflict.
Using the provisions of the War Powers Act of 1973, Campbell had
single-handedly forced the House leadership to schedule the debate
on the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment that we never had in Vietnam we now have,'' he told
his colleagues. ``We have a chance to stop it before we get in too
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the congressional leadership had shied away
from a public debate over the conflict, and the White House had
strongly discouraged it. Minority Leader Gephardt told his
colleagues, ``Mr. Milosevic will be listening carefully to what is
being said here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the issue was joined, critics opened up on the Clinton
policy. House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, called for pulling
out now. ``Was it worth it in Vietnam?'' he asked. ``In Lebanon,
(President) Ronald Reagan cut his losses and withdrew the troops''
after a barracks was bombed. ``We should do the same thing before
the body bags start coming home. What good have we done? None.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the members chose a more middle of the road
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No military action should have been initiated in the Balkans
without prior approval of Congress,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas. ``But with this conflict already underway, it would be
folly not to consider the facts on the ground. An immediate exit
would send the wrong message to Milosevic and to other petty
tyrants around the world from Iraq to North Korea, and it could
defeat our goal of ensuring peace and
</P>
<P>
   stability in Europe.''

BRITISH AEROSPACE DISCUSSES JOINT EUROPEAN MISSILE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Aerospace PLC, the British military giant,
acknowledged Wednesday that it was exploring a deal with French and
Italian companies to create a European missile industry to
challenge Raytheon of the United States, the global leader in
missile manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The news emerged one day after British Aerospace signed a formal
agreement Tuesday to acquire the British General Electric Co.'s
Marconi Electronics defense and missile business. The $12.7 billion
takeover was first announced last January and will now be examined
by regulators. It brings together British Aerospace's military
hardware, such as the Tornado warplanes in action over Yugoslavia,
with Marconi's military and civilian electronics and missile
guidance systems. Britain's General Electric is not linked to the
U.S. company of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The January deal makes British Aerospace the world's No. 3
military company after Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. of the
United States. An important but less publicized aspect of that deal
also gives British Aerospace access to Marconi's 50 percent stake
in a missile project with Alenia, owned by Italy's Finmeccanica.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace already had a joint venture with the French
Lagardere company's Matra subsidiary _ Matra BAe Dynamics. Mike
Peters, a spokesman for British Aerospace, said the talks on a
joint missile venture, first reported in Wednesday's Financial
Times, were not surprising in light of British Aerospace's
long-term goal of creating a pan-European military industry.
``Discussions have been held and there'll be further discussions,''
he said. He declined to speculate on when the discussions might
bear results and said their outcome depended partly on British and
European regulatory approval of the British Aerospace-Marconi deal.
``Until that happens, nothing can happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a separate merger involving Matra and Aerospatiale
in France needs regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking for is a restructuring to make Europe into
a major player,'' Peters said. ``We wish to grow the industry in
Europe so that it can match the U.S. giants and so that, in future
projects, Europe is treated as an equal partner.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the talks sent British Aerospace shares up 12 pence, or
2.6 percent, in London trading to 478.25 pence, or about $7.70.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Progress towards a pan-European military industry, which has
strong political backing in France and Britain particularly but
faces a range of hindrances, has been ``glacial,'' said Chris
Avery, a military industry analyst at Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   The British Aerospace-Marconi merger infuriated Germany's
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG, which had itself been pursuing a
cross-border merger with British Aerospace, while Thomson-CSF of
France had been wooing Marconi. Instead the merger created an
all-British colossus with the likelihood of annual sales in excess
of $20 billion _ more than twice that of any continental European
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a tangle of deals and joint ventures in missile
manufacture that draw in many European countries. British
Aerospace's joint missile venture with Lagardere's Matra subsidiary
feeds into Matra's own merger with Aerospatiale, itself in the
process of shedding state control. At the same time, Matra BAe
Dynamics is linked with the missiles subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   And an even broader array of missile manufacturers, including
CASA of Spain and Saab Dynamics of Sweden, are grouped in a
separate bid to produce new Meteor air-to-air missiles for
Britain's Royal Air Force and other air forces.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation reflects over-capacity in the post-Cold War
era. Despite regional crises, such as those in the Persian Gulf in
1990-91 and in the Balkans since 1992 _ leading to the current
conflict in Kosovo _ European military budgets have been cut,
leaving nationally based military industries with far more capacity
to produce weapons than Europe's individual military establishments
can afford or are able to absorb.

KURDS ARE DETERMINED TO RESTORE TV STATION SHUT BY THE BRITISH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Although the British authorities have shut
down the world's sole Kurdish-language television station, its
director has vowed to find a way to bring it back to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision came as a great shock to us,'' the station
director, Hikmet Tabak, said. ``But Kurds will not give up their
right to broadcast. We are not going to enter the new millennium
without television.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabak did not say how he hoped to resume broadcasting. He is
reportedly approaching European governments in search of one that
will give him permission to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think every possibility is exhausted,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Brussels. ``We are not without choices.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Independent Television Commission, which
regulates broadcasters based in Britain, ordered the Kurdish
station, Med-TV, to halt operations permanently. It said Med-TV had
broadcast programs ``which included inflammatory statements
encouraging acts of violence in Turkey and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurds are a large minority in Turkey, and some among them assert
that they have been so brutally repressed by Ankara that their only
alternative is revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In February and March, Med-TV carried a series of interviews
with supporters of rebel guerrillas who have been fighting a
separatist war in eastern Turkey for more than a decade. The rebel
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured in February by Turkish agents
and faces a trial that could lead to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Ocalan's capture, several of his supporters
appeared on Med-TV and urged Kurds to attack Turkish targets and
kill Turkish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Tabak said afterward that he regretted the broadcasts and had
dismissed staff members who allowed them on the air. He and lawyers
for Med-TV told the British commission that they would prevent such
broadcasts in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took particular and sympathetic account of the
circumstances in which the broadcasts in question were made and the
changes which Med-TV proposed to make to its service in the
future,'' the commission chairman, Sir Robin Biggam, said in
announcing its decision. ``However the commission decided that it
was necessary in the public interest to revoke this license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever sympathy there may be in the United Kingdom for the
Kurdish people, it is not in the public interest to have any
broadcaster use the U.K. as a platform for broadcasts which incite
people to violence. Med-TV have been given many opportunities to be
a peaceful voice for their community. To allow them to continue
broadcasting after such serious breaches would be to condone the
misuse of the U.K.'s system for licensing broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Med-TV has been broadcasting from Britain since 1994. It
encourages Kurdish nationalism and supports efforts to establish a
Kurdish identity. On its news commentary and interview programs, it
offers a platform for Kurds of various persuasions, including those
who support the war that is being waged against the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
   The station has many viewers in eastern Turkey, where the
authorities consider it a tool of terrorists. The officials have
made several efforts to obstruct the station, including jamming its
signal and restricting residents' use of satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   After the British announced their decision, the Turkish Foreign
Ministry issued a statement to welcome the demise of ``the hateful
organ that continuously promoted violence and bloodshed in our
country.''

COMMENTARY: THE DEADLIEST DOWNLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During President Clinton's watch, America's most
vital nuclear secrets _ guarded intensely for five decades _ have
been allowed to spill out all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago I surmised that what now worried our scientists
most was the possible theft of the ``Lagrangian codes'' from our
national laboratories. These are the supercomputer programs that _
when fed secret data ``benchmarks'' from all our nuclear tests _
enable foreign scientists to simulate our explosions and erase our
lead.
</P>
<P>
   We are now informed by The New York Times'
Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative team that the codes _ ``legacy
codes,'' as they are known at Los Alamos _ were allegedly
downloaded by Wan Ho Lee in 1994. Our nuclear genie is out of the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People's Republic of China is the number one
proliferator,'' said Rep. Chris Cox, chairman of the select
committee on Chinagate. ``Now the secrets are out there in the
stream of commerce, and probably on to Iran and North Korea and
Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhage is horrendous. How did it happen? The Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence is grilling FBI Director Louis
Freeh Thursday in secret, but here are some facts:
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting Lee at Los Alamos to be a spy for China, FBI agents
in 1997 alerted the White House and went to the Department of
Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy Review to request
application to a special court for a wiretap under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act. But Acting Director Gerald Schroeder
and his aide Alan Kornblum decided the evidence was insufficient
and refused to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then went over Schroeder's head to the office of Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder, and was turned down again. The FBI
never returned with new evidence to Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Did Freeh appeal to Janet Reno about ``over-lawyering'' in a
national security case, or was he too browbeaten to try? The bureau
learned that when it comes to China, Reno Justice assigns only its
most incompetent operatives and penalizes prosecutors who target
Asian financing of the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Justice makes some 700 court applications a year for
taps under that surveillance law. Maybe once or twice a year, says
a Justice intelligence official, it finally refuses the FBI's
request that it apply. This case, involving an embarrassment to
China when Clinton was proclaiming ``strategic partnership,'' was
the one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Congress should examine the ultra-gentle prosecution
of a Los Alamos nuclear simulation scientist, Peter Lee, who was
let off with a year in a halfway house. The sentencing judge was
never told all Justice knew of his spying.
</P>
<P>
   With his Chinese chickens coming home to roost, Clinton has been
desperately trying to keep a lid on China-gate. His first reaction
_ that it happened back in the '80s and had nothing to do with him
_ has been overtaken by eventful truth.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 weeks he ducked a meeting with Cox and Norman Dicks of
the House committee seeking security clearance of their 1,000-page
report on China's penetration of our scientific and political
worlds. Last week they met in a ``sober'' session; Cox expects his
slightly sanitized report to be made public by May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after that, we'll see what the president's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board comes up with. Its chairman, former
Sen. Warren Rudman, was incensed by a prediction in this space of a
whitewash: ``It will be a hard-hitting report about security at the
labs,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman has hired nine new investigators and may come up with
recommendations about locking the barn door now that the secrets of
almost every nuclear test we have undertaken are on their way to
Baghdad or Pyongyang via Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   As the dangerous duping of this administration unfolds, keep in
mind Beijing's grand design: Use Asian fund-raisers to influence
White House policy to sell China advanced computer and missile
technology. Simultaneously, use spies to steal both the secret
codes to program those supercomputers and to steal the data
benchmarks enabling them to simulate our nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the downloading of our secrets, American cities will
be less safe in two years than they were at the height of the Cold
War. We owe it to ourselves to find out who let it happen and why.

U.S. EASES SANCTIONS ON SALES OF HUMANITARIAN ITEMS TO IRAN, LIBYA
AND SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced on Wednesday
that it had decided to ease its sanctions policy to permit the sale
of food and medical supplies to Iran, Libya, Sudan and other
nations alleged to support terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which had long been sought by lawmakers in
agricultural states and lobbyists for several large corporations,
will make a general exemption for food and medicine whenever trade
sanctions are placed on countries considered adversaries of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The shift would not directly affect trade sanctions against
Cuba, Iraq and North Korea, in part because American companies are
already permitted to carry out some trade in food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies with those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, under secretary of state for business and
economic affairs, said that President Clinton had approved the
policy after a two-year review concluded that the sale of food and
medicine ``doesn't encourage a nation's military capability or its
ability to support terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat told reporters that a ban on such sales can backfire
by eroding support for American foreign policy, by depriving
American companies and farmers of the chance to sell their goods,
and by harming innocent civilians abroad who are deprived of needed
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said President Clinton
had decided that ``food should not be used as a tool of foreign
policy, except under the most compelling circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy shift reflects a growing sense, both in the White
House and on Capitol Hill, that sanctions are not an effective way
to make foreign policy and punish rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders have long contended that economic sanctions
rarely produce changes in foreign governments and taint American
corporations are unreliable suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups disagree, insisting that economic sanctions
have been a factor in the collapse of pariah governments, notably
the apartheid government of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, the nation's largest private company and shipper of
much of the world's grain, and Farmland Industries, the nation's
largest farmer-owned cooperative, as well as several other large
agricultural and commodity-trading companies had lobbied
intensively for the policy change. USA Engage, a powerful coalition
of more than 670 companies that have sought an easing of American
trade sanctions, welcomed the administration's announcement. ``This
is good news for American agriculture, it's good news for U.S.
producers of farm equipment and it's an outstanding development for
American foreign policy,'' said Bill Lane, Washington director of
Caterpillar Inc. and the coalition's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials insisted that Wednesday's move
was not meant to be a gesture of friendship toward Iran, but they
acknowledged that the action would undoubtedly encourage improved
ties between the United States and the government of President
Mohammad Khatami, who is perceived to be a relative moderate among
Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The policy shift comes only two weeks after President Clinton
made strikingly conciliatory comments about Iran during a public
appearance in the White House in which he saluted that nation's
``enormous geopolitical importance over time'' and said that it had
``been the subject of quite a lot of abuse from various Western
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   An American exporter, Niki Trading Co., recently sought an
special export license from the Treasury Department to sell
millions of tons of food products, mostly grain, for about $500
million, to Iran, a deal that now seems likely to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had seen the deal as a promising line
of contact with Iran after two decades of bitter hostility
following the 1979 Iranian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department labeled Iran last year as the ``the
most active state sponsor of terrorism,'' the administration is
hopeful that easing the sanctions might help give Khatami leverage
that could allow him to rein in rival factions of the government
that support anti-American terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy shift, the sale of food, medicine and other
``human necessities'' would be included in trade sanctions only if
a targeted nation is in armed conflict with the United States or is
diverting food and medical supplies for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's move by the administration will not affect trade
with Cuba, which is limited principally by Congressional sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat noted that the sale of medicine and medical supplies
to Cuba was already allowed under legislation approved in 1992, and
the regulated sale of food, pesticides and related items was
permitted under a policy shift announced last January.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are allowed to sell food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods to Iraq under the so-called oil-for-food program
overseen by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   American companies are already permitted to trade food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods to North Korea under a deal brokered
by the State Department to end that country's program to develop
nuclear weapons. The United States government has provided tens of
thousands of tons of donated food to North Korea as a result of the
widespread famine in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the countries affected by Wednesday's decision offer
large markets to the United States. With a population of nearly 70
million people and its oil riches, Iran is a notable exception, and
each year it imports millions of tons of grains and food oils,
worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Iran had been eager to resume trade with the United States. In
August, it lodged an official complaint with the United Nations,
charging that the American sanctions had created a ``scarcity of
essential goods needed for the improvement of the nutritional and
health care standards of the Iranian people.''

DAVENPORT: WOMEN READY TO BOYCOTT THREE SLAMS OVER LACK OF PARITY
IN PRIZES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Grand Slams don't pay, they won't play. Tired of
receiving second-class treatment on the payrolls of three of the
sport's four Grand Slams, the women who make their living from
professional tennis may resort to a boycott to bite the hand that
feeds them _ but feeds the men more _ if the three shallow-pocketed
Slams don't make a millennial motion toward equality.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King calls it a potential ``girl-cott.'' Bart
McGuire, the WTA Tour's chief executive officer, calls it a
militant maneuver he hopes his troops won't deploy. Lindsay
Davenport, who sits on the tour's Player Council, calls it a
possible future payback for past and present slights.
</P>
<P>
   If Wimbledon, currently the most chauvinist of the Slams in its
pay scale, doesn't announce a raise Thursday for this year's event,
don't look for many female players at Wimbledon next year: they
just may have other plans for that particular fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't actually spoken to any of the players about
boycotting, but I think the players need to be ready for it,'' said
Davenport, who earned a record $700,000, the same as the men's
champion Patrick Rafter, for her 1998 U.S. Open title. ``Obviously
we can't expect to see total equality this year, but we need to see
some goals set for it to happen soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the money debate began in January with a plaintive
piece of rhetoric from Venus Williams and some unanimous advice to
the tour from the four business advisers on its council.
</P>
<P>
   Williams surveyed the year's first Grand Slam, the Australian
Open, and came away unconvinced that the bigwigs behind the
tournament couldn't find a way to ante up the measly $200,000 that
separates the men and women from fiscal equality on its $10 million
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you even want to play in a place that doesn't give
you equal prize money with the men?'' asked the 18-year-old
Williams. The answer is that the women don't want to. And if things
don't change at the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, all
of which ignore the U.S. Open's 25-year tradition of awarding equal
prize money, perhaps the women won't play them until the concept of
equal remuneration becomes universal. ``The ladies need to get
together on this one,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Nudged along by the four business advisors, who urged the
council's eight player members to make gender equity on the Grand
Slam payrolls a top priority for 1999, some of the players did get
together.
</P>
<P>
   This month, they assembled their discontent into a petition that
demands equal pay at the Grand Slams, a document decorated with
signatures from the top-ranked player Martina Hingis and No. 2
Davenport (Steffi Graf is the only top player uninterested in the
issue) as well as 50 others.
</P>
<P>
   They supported McGuire, in a series of strongly worded documents
and orations to the chairmen of all three Grand Slams, and added
the petition as further ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   They were mildly approving when the French Open, citing the
increased entertainment value provided by the women's game, bumped
up their prize money to within 90 percent of what the men receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French moved about a third of the way in the right
direction,'' McGuire said. He also noted the Australian Open, which
in 1995 reneged on its decade-old policy of equal pay, gave the
women a slightly larger raise than the men this year. But a 6
percent discrepancy persists, which is why Martina Hingis collected
$529,600 while Yevgeny Kafelnikov received $563,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that hurts us the most is the one where we had equal
prize money and then they took it away,'' Davenport said about the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Tobin, president of the International Tennis Federation,
commiserated. ``In recent years, the Australian Open has moved from
prize money parity,'' he said, ``which is a pity, but I hope will
be redressed soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the players are waiting to see what happens Thursday
at Wimbledon, when the All England Club will announce its 1999
prize money. Last year, they shortchanged the women by 20 percent.
Pete Sampras took in $717,750 with his title, while Jana Novotna
settled for $645,975.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire is aware that players are judging his performance _
under scrutiny as well for the tour's trouble in landing a title
sponsor _ on the response his pleas for parity inspire from
Wimbledon. In his own defense, McGuire pointed out that the three
Slams in question ``are played in countries where there's nothing
comparable to Title IX in the legal system or in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGuire made it clear that now is not the time for the
players to be threatening boycotts. ``Strikes and boycotts are the
atomic bombs of dispute resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even King is comfortable slinging a word like boycott
around. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably isn't the right time to go for the girl-cott,''
said King, who was a willing party to the one that got women's
professional tennis off the ground 30 years ago. ``But if the Slams
don't come through with something like a three-year plan to put
things on an equal level, then the boycott becomes an option. My
take on this is that first you do things diplomatically; then you
fight.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DEVILS DON'T DARE LOOK AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the Devils' road to what they hope will be the Stanley Cup,
they are not only trapped in a backup at a toll booth, but they
also know the highway is even more jammed beyond the next exit.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Devils win their opening round playoff series with
the Pittsburgh Penguins, which resumes Friday night in the
Meadowlands, their next opponent is already established: the
Buffalo Sabres, alias Dominik Hasek, hockey's most dreaded
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Devils are looking past the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' coach Robbie Ftorek said. ``We've got to
play Tom Barrasso and the Penguins.''
</P>
<P>
   What else would any coach say? One of sports' oldest
commandments is: never look ahead. But left wing Dave Andreychuk,
who was once Hasek's teammate in Buffalo and still lives there in
the off-season, acknowledged thinking about the Sabres' goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told the people at my golf course not to let him on,''
Andreychuk said, joking. ``The Sabres have 10 days off now. That's
a long time to stay sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Devils, at least publicly, don't dare look past the
Penguins, it is only because they don't want to see what they know
is there: Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   While the Devils were squaring their best-of-seven-game series
with the Penguins at 2-2 with a 4-2 victory in Pittsburgh on
Tuesday night, Hasek and the seventh-seeded Sabres were sweeping
the second-seeded Ottawa Senators, the Northeast Division
champions, out of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the four games that included a 30-minute overtime, Hasek
allowed only six goals, a 1.33 goals-against average. With 156
saves, his save percentage was .963, even better than his
league-leading .937 during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek again proved the value of a ``hot goaltender'' in the
playoffs. Although the Sabres have never been good enough as a team
to win the Stanley Cup, he lifted them to the conference final last
year. And the Devils know he is capable of ending their cup hopes
this year _ if they survive the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek is a candidate to be the NHL's first-team All-Star
goaltender for the fifth time in the last six seasons and he could
win his fifth Vezina trophy. He earned the Hart trophy as the
league's most valuable player the previous two seasons. During last
year's Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, he dominated the Czech
Republic's gold-medal victory.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent season, the Devils had a 1-1-1 record against
Hasek, who permitted only five goals in those three games, but four
occurred in a rare 7-4 shootout in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   All the Devils who played in the 1994 opening round playoff
remember Hasek from the sixth game, the Sabres' four-overtime, 1-0
victory as he made 70, count 'em, 70 saves, before Dave Hannan's
goal shortly before 2 o'clock in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils won the seventh game, 2-1, then eliminated Boston
before losing to the Rangers in seven games in the conference
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasek's amazing,'' Andreychuk said. ``In practice once, we had
to send him off the ice because we couldn't get the puck past him.
He made you lose your confidence. When we asked him how he did it,
he didn't have an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But another reason the Devils can't worry about Hasek yet is
because they are quietly worrying about their own goaltender.
Martin Brodeur, with a 2.52 goals against average and a shaky .877
save percentage in the Penguins series, hasn't been as consistent
at making the big save as he was when the Devils won the 1995
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a more intense effort Tuesday night that limited the
Penguins to 18 shots, the Devils weren't dominant in their two-goal
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play with the same heart and passion,''
defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ``If we let up, we're not going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night Jaromir Jagr, the league's leading scorer with
127 points, is expected to be in uniform for the Penguins after
having missed three games with a groin injury. Look for the Devils
to pound him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity is there, you've got to take the body,''
Daneyko said. ``Jagr is a big guy, the best player in the league.
You've got to match his size and strength. If you don't, you're
going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Devils won't get to go against Dominik Hasek in the next
series. &QL;

TAINTED INFORMER FOR U.S. IN DRUG CASE COULD GET $10 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mexico, Colombia)  (bl) 
 By TIM GOLDEN with CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As federal prosecutors went to trial here against
a group of Mexican bankers and accused drug traffickers implicated
in the biggest investigation ever into the laundering of illegal
drug money, their evidence seemed overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suspects had been caught on hidden cameras as they
negotiated with undercover U.S. Customs agents about how to hide
millions of dollars in illicit funds. A half-dozen defendants had
pleaded guilty rather than face a jury, and several of them agreed
to testify against their former associates.
</P>
<P>
   But now a crack has appeared in the government's case as defense
lawyers have focused on a mysterious Colombian-born informer who
was at the center of the undercover operation _ and who could
receive almost $10 million for his help.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the prosecution will be weakened
seriously by disclosures about the informer, a former emerald
dealer named Fred Mendoza. But the trial has already focused new
attention on how law-enforcement agencies use informants in the
money laundering investigations that have become a central part of
the fight against the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trial hinged on his testimony, we might be in big
trouble,'' one senior customs official said of Mendoza. ``But
without this guy or somebody else like him, we never would have
made a case like this in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the first of four scheduled trials in connection with the
customs investigation known as Operation Casablanca, law
enforcement officials said Mendoza had been recruited in part
because he had no criminal record and was not wanted for any crime
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While they acknowledged that his value as an informer stemmed
from the contacts he had developed in the drug underworld, they
also insisted that he was a brave and honest man who was motivated
by more than just money he might make.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mendoza prepared to begin testifying last week against a
first group of six Mexican defendants, one customs official
acknowledged in court that the informer's earnings could reach
perhaps 10 percent of the $101 million that the government has
frozen or seized in the case. And even then, law-enforcement
officials said, Mendoza would not become the most highly paid
informer federal law-enforcement agencies have ever employed.
</P>
<P>
   What may be more damaging to Mendoza's credibility, though, are
allegations disclosed to the defense by prosecutors indicating that
their star witness may have been considerably more involved in drug
trafficking than at least most of the government officials involved
in the case had known.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, a boyish looking man in his 40s, was known to the
bankers and accused traffickers in the case as ``Javier Ramirez.''
The Mexicans, having been introduced to Mendoza by drug traffickers
associated with the Cali cartel in Colombia, believed him to be the
boss of a big Colombian money laundering operation run out of
warehouse offices in an industrial suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's bona fides in the underworld were in fact quite good _
and far better than Customs officials acknowledged before the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning in court and in his confidential debriefings
by customs agents, Mendoza said he was drawn into the drug trade in
1989, when, as a gem dealer in Los Angeles, he sold $150,000 worth
of emeralds to a new customer from Colombia. The customer turned
out to be a reputed drug trafficker named Luis Enrique Puentes, and
he quickly discovered that he had been sold a cache of emeralds
worth only about one-third of what he paid.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza said that after he told the trafficker he had already
spent most of the money, he was forced to work off his debt as a
drug money courier, making seven or eight deliveries of cash to
storefronts and offices in the jewelry district of downtown Los
Angeles. Although Mendoza's activities eventually brought him under
the scrutiny of federal agents who were then pursuing another huge
money laundering investigation, he was never arrested.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confidential customs report based on the
debriefing of an FBI informant in Houston on March 23, Mendoza also
had a hand in arranging for one or more cocaine flights into Mexico
in the early 1990s. A copy of the report was obtained by The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said some of the Houston informant's claims
were patently false: He asserted, for instance, that Mendoza had
been an associate of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the late Mexican
trafficker against whom Operation Casablanca was directed.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza did admit in court to having helped with the
arrangements for a flight of 1,320 pounds of cocaine into Mexico in
1992, and said he became a customs informant in 1995 only after he
was kidnapped and held for 18 days by traffickers demanding payment
on a debt owed by his brother, a drug trafficker already working
for customs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge presiding over the trial, Lourdes Baird,
barred lawyers from introducing the Houston report about Mendoza as
evidence. But she allowed defense lawyers to draw from it in
cross-examining Mendoza, and one of them, Michael Pancer, used the
information to suggest that he had been less than candid with his
customs handlers and less than noble in his past activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were willing to profit on the misery that that drug gives
people?'' Pancer asked, referring to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Mendoza finally said.
</P>
<P>
   Under contracts with the Customs Service, the officials said,
Mendoza could receive as much as $7.5 million in rewards, in
addition to slightly more than $2 million that he has already
received in commissions on the money he helped to launder, other
fees and the reimbursement of his expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement agencies generally cap their payments to
informers at one-fourth the value of the assets seized in an
operation, or no more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, however, has been especially liberal in
circumventing those limits with contracts like the ``personal
service agreements'' that Mendoza signed. Customs agents say it has
often helped them to recruit better informants than those of the
FBI or the Drug Enforcement Administration.

GERMANS SEEKING WAY TO END KOSOVO CRISIS WITHOUT DEALING WITH
MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ The German government is pressing a Western
diplomatic initiative aimed at isolating the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, rather than dealing with him. The strategy is
driven by the conviction that he will almost certainly be indicted
by the international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Germany was at the center of diplomatic activity
directed chiefly at securing Moscow's support for NATO's objectives
in Kosovo, and thus reducing Milosevic's room to maneuver, Western
officials said. No sign emerged Wednesday of any immediate
breakthrough in the discussions that began on Tuesday with a visit
to Moscow by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, but Western
officials held out hope that Russia, Milosevic's chief if not
enthusiastic supporter, might shift its position.
</P>
<P>
   An eventual indictment of Milosevic would have enormous
political repercussions because it would effectively make it
impossible for Western governments to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic of the process is that there will be an indictment,
and this is also the view of the chancellor,'' said Michael
Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to the German chancellor,
Gerhard Schroder. ``We don't need Milosevic for a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear on Wednesday whether the United States or other
NATO allies supported the German position that Milosevic could be
circumvented in the search for a solution to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although Western leaders have stepped up their rhetoric against
Milosevic _ Jacques Chirac, the French president, has called him a
``dictator'' and both President Clinton and the British prime
minister, Tony Blair, have said peace in the Balkans appears
incompatible with his rule _ a possible agreement with him has not
been formally dismissed by Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner, a veteran Balkan diplomat, said, ``If Mr. Milosevic is
indicted, he cannot be the signatory to any accord. That is already
a factor we have to take into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said that the allies had needed Milosevic's signature
earlier this year at peace talks in France that eventually failed.
``But we are no longer in the same game. We now need certain things
to happen _ Serbian troops out of Kosovo, and the Kosovar refugees
back _ but we are not necessarily in a signature game any more,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, there were also clear signs on Wednesday
that a chief Western objective has become an attempt to fan the
tensions between Milosevic and a traditionally hapless democratic
opposition in Serbia in an effort to weaken the nationalist
leadership that has held sway throughout the eight years of
Yugoslavia's violent dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, a NATO spokesman, said that ``the tide may be
beginning to turn against President Milosevic,'' adding that the
``unity based on fear'' that has characterized Serbian society in
recent years was fragmenting. ``Beneath the permafrost, there are
some green shoots of democratic recovery,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether NATO was indulging in wishful thinking,
or had solid evidence of a weakening of Milosevic's stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Shea spoke, Yugoslavia's deputy prime
minister, Vuk Draskovic, who recently called for ``brave moves'' by
his government toward compromise, was removed from office for
speaking out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said the aim of the talks in Germany on
Wednesday was, as one put it, to ``bring Russia into line,'' and so
eventually make it possible to pass a U.N. Security Council
resolution buttressing at least the central points of NATO's aims,
including the deployment in Kosovo of an international military
force.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister, met
in Moscow with Russia's Balkan envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, while Schroder held talks in Berlin with the U.N.
secretary general, Kofi Annan. Chernomyrdin is expected in Bonn on
Thursday. Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has objected to the
idea of an international military force in Kosovo and to the
growing Western conviction that some form of protectorate will now
be needed in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin's planned visit to Bonn, and Annan's departure
on Wednesday from Berlin to Moscow, suggested that the Russian
position may shift. ``There are some indications that slightly
raise hope for a political solution, but one should not
overestimate this,'' Scharping said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder warned that the process will be long. ``I urge those
who expected to have the crisis resolved in a matter of days to
have more patience. We are at the start of a political process, not
at the end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, also met Annan on
Wednesday and said that Germany favored the adoption of a Security
Council resolution under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which
allows the Security Council to authorize military operations
without the consent of the parties to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Such a resolution on Kosovo could eventually provide the legal
support for an international military deployment in Kosovo under
what Western leaders have called ``semi-permissive'' conditions _
for example, in the event of a Serbian troop withdrawal from Kosovo
but without a formal agreement from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But any Security Council resolution would be blocked without the
Russian support now being persistently sought.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that ``if there was something to talk about,'' the
West would have to ``talk to those in power in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Milosevic had ``waged ethnic war against large
parts of his population using great brutality, and there is a court
in The Hague responsible for all Yugoslavia.'' Fischer was
referring to the International Criminal Tribunal set up in 1993 in
The Hague to investigate ``reports of mass killings'' in Bosnia,
among other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister added that if an international force was
deployed in Kosovo, the West would be in a position ``to bring to
light'' evidence of war crimes committed as Serbian forces drove
over 500,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes. His clear
implication was that Milosevic might be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said his conviction that Milosevic would eventually be
indicted grew out of a meeting last week in Bonn with Louise
Arbour, the Canadian judge who is the tribunal's chief prosecutor.
Schroder also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, whose decade in power has coincided with wave after
wave of violence, has always denied any knowledge of, or
involvement in, war crimes.

KATZENBERG TESTIFIES DISNEY RENEGED ON BONUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeffrey Katzenberg, testifying over the last two
days about his angry relationship with his former employer, Walt
Disney Co., said his 10 years at the studio had proved to be ``a
lie'' because of a dispute with Michael Eisner, the Disney
chairman, over a huge bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg's testimony came in the second phase of a trial in
which the former studio chief contends that Disney owes him at
least $250 million, based on an agreement that was to have given
him 2 percent of the profits on films including ``The Lion King,''
``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin'' and ``The Little Mermaid,''
and spinoffs from them.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's general counsel, Louis Meisinger, who spoke scathingly
to Katzenberg, has argued, essentially, that while Katzenberg was
owed some bonus money, the former studio chief was not defrauded or
duped by Eisner. ``The purpose of all this is to embarrass Disney,
and not focus on the valuation,'' Meisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Meisinger, in questioning Katzenberg, contended
that the former studio chief had endured numerous flops in 1994 _
when Disney's film division, under Katzenberg, had an operating
loss of $231 million. At the same time he depicted Katzenberg as a
shrewd negotiator _ one who would not have allowed any ambiguity in
his own contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being presided over by a retired Los Angeles
Superior Court judge, Paul Breckinridge.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for two such powerful and high-profile
Hollywood moguls to bare not only their public anger at one
another, but also details about compensation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Katzenberg testified that as early as 1984, after he
joined Disney, the company offered him a 2 percent share of the
profits from films and television shows placed in production or
acquired for distribution during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he said, Eisner and Frank Wells, the
president of Disney, offered him a seven-year deal to extend his
contract to 1997. They offered, among other things, a base salary
of $750,000 a year, an option on 500,000 shares of Disney stock, a
$1.5 million ``cash flow safety net'' over and above his salary and
a beach house that the company would buy. But they wanted
Katzenberg to give up his 2 percent bonus. He rejected the deal,
saying of the bonus, ``It was the most important element of my
original deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said that a new deal was signed in 1988, allowing him
to leave the company as early as 1994, three and a half years into
his contract, without forfeiting the bonus. But Katzenberg said he
was informed by a Disney lawyer in 1993 that, if he left the
company early, he might forfeit his bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Katzenberg said, his attorney, Arthur Emil, was
told by Wells to ``read the contract.'' Katzenberg said he phoned
Wells to say ``that I didn't understand why a game is being played
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said he told Wells, ``If I worked for this company
for 10 years under a lie, I couldn't possibly stay another day. I
was furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells replied that he would speak to Eisner about the matter,
Katzenberg said, adding that Wells was ``the peacemaker'' and ``the
person who kept Michael and I working together.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, Wells was killed in a helicopter crash, and
Katzenberg left within months. He said Eisner ``told me he did not
want me to stay with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Katzenberg said, he had two meetings with Eisner,
one in which the company chairman came to his home and another at
the Disney offices, but the bonus issue remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, whose lawyer at the trial is Bertram Fields, left
Disney officially in September 1994, and sued in April 1996. Eisner
is expected to testify next week.

ECONOMIC SCENE: WORDS IN NEED OF ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's proposal for reforming
international financial institutions, announced on the eve of this
week's gathering of the world's finance officials in Washington,
was greeted mostly with yawns. His ideas were described as modest
or cautious _ mere tinkering in a financially hazardous world that
cries out for bold architectural overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with Rubin's proposal, some prominent economists
say, lies not with its cautious ideas. Professor Barry Eichengreen
of the University of California at Berkeley argues that modest
reforms are what are needed. ``The problem with Rubin's policy
announcement,'' he said, ``is too little follow-through.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics
agrees. ``Rubin failed to outline concrete steps that would
translate pleasant words into effective action.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial crisis struck Asia hard in the summer of 1997, spread
to Russia and Brazil last year and continues to threaten Japan and
China. The International Monetary Fund intervened but could not
prevent steep recessions in any of the countries. The question that
lingers is how to stop currency crises before they spread.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would discourage the use of pegged exchange rates _ rates
that are temporarily linked to the dollar but easily abandoned
during crises. Countries inevitably run out of dollars to prop up
their currency, accelerating the flight of investors and
precipitating a currency crisis. ``At the center of each recent
crisis,'' Rubin argues, ``has been a rigid exchange-rate regime
that proved ultimately unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   To discourage the practice, Rubin would, with caveats, deny
large bailouts to countries that peg their currencies. That could
persuade most developing countries to adopt floating rates or
currency boards, which bind the value of a currency to the dollar
with no easy way to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also proposed that creditors bear more of the cost of
bailing out insolvent governments. And he wants developing
countries to accept fewer short-term loans, the kind that cause
creditors to flee at the first whiff of financial trouble. That
prescription might encourage developing countries to adopt measures
that the industrialized powers have historically opposed, including
taxes on short-term capital loans.
</P>
<P>
   Economists point out that it takes more than hortatory language
to achieve Rubin's goals.
</P>
<P>
   To force creditors to bear some of the cost of bailing out
insolvent governments requires rewriting contracts that govern the
issuing of their bonds. Those contracts would need to allow a
majority of creditors to renegotiate on behalf of all bond holders
rather than require unanimous consent. The bond contracts would
also need to require creditors that sue delinquent governments to
share settlements with all bond holders. Only then could creditors
as a group accept lower interest payments rather than driving the
debtor government into default.
</P>
<P>
   But, Eichengreen points out, no developing country can rewrite
bond contracts on its own. If Ecuador tried to write anti-creditor
provisions into its contracts, creditors would take their money
elsewhere. There is, however, one country that could proceed with
impunity. Eichengreen says that Rubin could have announced that the
United States would take the lead and incorporate majority voting
and settlement-sharing provisions into its bond offerings, giving
cover for other countries to mimic.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer makes a similar point about Rubin's call for steering
developing countries away from short-term loans. Rubin could have
made headway had he proposed, for example, that the banking
authorities in the United States impose higher reserve requirements
on banks that make such loans. Rubin calls instead for
international guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer and Eichengreen are more supportive of Rubin's decision
to avoid the many grandiose ideas that have been proposed to solve
the international financial crisis. Some want to create an
international ``lender of last resort'' _ an international central
bank that would make loans to distressed governments, just as the
Federal Reserve does to distressed banks in the United States.
Others call for an international agency, modeled on Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., to insure foreign loans. The idea would be to
reassure skittish investors that their loans were safe so they need
not bolt at the first signs of financial stress.
</P>
<P>
   But Eichengreen exposes the flaws of ambitious institution
building in a book published earlier this year. International
pledges to insolvent governments encourage investors to take
unwarranted risks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, international authorities cannot provide unlimited
loans or insurance to individual governments or banks without the
right to halt activities that threaten solvency _ an invasion of
sovereignty that no proponent of these new institutions has yet to
tackle.

TWO HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to breathe life into the dying effort to
shore up Social Security, two pivotal House Republicans laid out a
plan Wednesday that they said would assure the retirement system's
long-term health without cutting benefits or raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would plug the projected hole in Social Security's
balance sheet by taking trillions of dollars in government revenues
in coming decades and giving the money to individuals in the form
of tax rebates. Workers would then have to invest that money in the
stock and bond markets through individual accounts, with the
proceeds going to help finance their retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal is similar to the approach advocated by
most Republicans, it has been shunned by the party's leaders, in
part to avoid what they fear would be a losing political fight with
Congressional Democrats and President Clinton. As a result, the
plan has virtually no chance of passage, and some members of both
parties said Social Security was all but dead as a substantive
issue until after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan's Republican authors, Reps. Bill Archer of Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Clay Shaw of
Florida, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social
Security, said they intended to push ahead anyway, in the hope that
they could create momentum for bipartisan negotiations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Insuring that Social Security can weather the impending
retirement of the vast baby-boom generation and be there for future
generations should be a matter of ``principle over politics,'' said
Archer, who is retiring from Congress at the end of this term.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said he believed that a deal was still possible.
The president is to plot his next move in a strategy session with
his advisers on Thursday, and administration officials said they
were not considering any dramatic new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they would look for ways to make a gesture to
Archer and other Republicans. Among the options on the table are
technical changes in the way Clinton's current plan would use the
surplus to help Social Security. Also being considered is an effort
to convince Republicans that Clinton's proposal for a new type of
individual retirement account outside of Social Security could be
part of a package to strengthen the system.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to nurture the remnants of bipartisan good will on the
issue, White House officials gave the Archer-Shaw plan a gentle
reception Wednesday, saying they objected to some of its components
but appreciated Archer's willingness to tackle a subject that many
Republicans have been loathe to touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a serious attempt to engage in a very
important debate,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although many House Democrats attacked the plan, others,
including Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat
on the Ways and Means Committee, muted their criticism. After being
briefed on the plan by Archer and Shaw on Wednesday afternoon, some
Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee said the plan, while
deeply flawed, could be the basis for negotiation if the Republican
leadership is willing to engage on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Without any changes, Social Security will run short of money
needed to pay promised benefits starting in 2034, after the
retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach relies largely on using the projected budget
surplus to bolster Social Security's finances and allowing the
government to invest a portion of the retirement system's reserves
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Shaw plan uses the same basic tools but in very
different ways. All workers would receive a tax credit from the
federal government each year equal to 2 percent of the 12.4 percent
payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits. Because the
payroll tax currently is only levied on the first $72,600 of wages
(the amount is adjusted each year for inflation), the maximum
annual credit would be $1,452.
</P>
<P>
   The money would automatically be deposited in a Social Security
account in the worker's name. The worker would then choose from
among a variety of mutual funds, all of which would be required to
hold 60 percent of their assets in stock indexes and 40 percent in
high-grade corporate bonds. Any gains in the account would
accumulate tax free.
</P>
<P>
   At retirement, the money in the account would be used to help
finance the worker's Social Security benefit. All workers would
receive at least as much as promised under the current system,
regardless of how well their investments do. Those workers whose
accounts do particularly well would come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the plan has two major flaws. It relies on
federal budget surpluses to finance the tax credit, and the surplus
is likely to be exhausted sometime in the next several decades,
they said. And it creates what Democrats said would be an unwieldy
system of more than 100 million individual accounts that would be
very expensive to administer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was also unpopular among conservatives, who said it did
not go nearly far enough to give individuals control over the new
retirement accounts and did not allow them to reap enough of the
benefits at retirement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the chances of reigniting serious bipartisan negotiations
this year remain dim, some members of both parties said there may
be an opportunity now to look at other compromise proposals,
including one being developed by Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the Republican desire to shift more control to
individuals, Cardin's plan would establish savings accounts within
Social Security but would have them supplement the current system
rather than replace part of it. In an attempt to appeal to
Democrats, Cardin's plan would also allow the government to invest
a portion of the system's money on Wall Street, but only under
restrictions that would limit political meddling in the investment
decisions.

   `MAKING MASTERPIECES'
</P>
<P>
   A three-video set written and presented by Neil MacGregor. Home
Vision Arts. $79.95. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should you happen to be in the mood to paint your own
Renaissance-style altarpiece, I know the perfect video for you.
``Making Masterpieces'' takes you into the conservation lab of the
National Gallery in London and shows you how artists achieve their
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Neil MacGregor, the museum's director, is a man in love with
artists' materials, and here he offers step-by-step instructions on
such fascinating if not exactly timely techniques as hammering
Florentine coins into gold leaf (you will need it for your halos)
and creating a rare shade of vermilion paint from a substance
excreted by Polish insects.
</P>
<P>
   Originally televised in six segments on the BBC in London, the
video adds up to a sly revisionist argument. MacGregor believes
that stylistic revolutions in art owe less to their creators than
to the materials they favored, from the lapis lazuli stones of the
Middle Ages to the cadmium colors invented by 19th-century
chemists.
</P>
<P>
   Angst, draftsmanly genius, an obsession with one-point
perspective, Cezanne's radical geometry: all the standard
explanations for masterworks are blithely pushed aside here.
Ingredients get the starring role. Artists are merely the servants
who use them.
</P>
<P>
   As MacGregor sees it, the great turning point in art history
occurred in the Netherlands in the 15th century, with the invention
of oil paint. Artists had previously bound their pigments in egg
yolks, an imperfect medium, in part because yolk dries with a
dullish matte finish (just think of an eggy plate left too long on
the breakfast table).
</P>
<P>
   Oil paint, by comparison, is a greasy miracle. It can capture
the sparkle of sunlight and, conversely, the murk of shadow. It
prepared the way for Caravaggio, Rembrandt and other Old Masters,
whose fabled use of light-dark contrasts imbued their pictures with
a drama and psychological inwardness that could not be achieved in
egg.
</P>
<P>
   A second turning point came in 1841, when John Rand, an American
painter living in London, invented the collapsible metal paint
tube. This meant, in effect, that artists could suddenly take their
materials anywhere _ that they no longer had to stay in their
studios, grinding pigment with linseed oil and storing it in pigs'
bladders, which worked fine for centuries but was a bit of a
headache for artists not fond of jabbing organs.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the paint tube brought on a vogue for plein-air
painting; among its practitioners was Vincent van Gogh, whose
pigment-laden landscapes are evidence, according to MacGregor,
``not of a tortured personality but of a flourishing paint
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One presumes the comment was intended as a joke, but even so, it
hints at the reductive approach that ultimately mars the video.
Seeing MacGregor at a table, chirping away as he cracks an egg into
a bowl and whips up a batch of tempera paint, you begin to feel as
if you are watching Julia Childs in the kitchen. He fails to
acknowledge that it takes more than the right ingredients to make a
great supper, not to mention Leonardo's ``Last Supper.''

ANALYSTS EXPECT `VERY CHAOTIC ELECTION' IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story, sent and held yesterday, is now released for
publication.) 
(mk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia is holding its breath. Ready or
not, it is about to leap into the second phase of its transition
from 32 years of dictatorship with an election _ just six weeks
away _ that will shape the post-Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   Though the election has been planned for months, it is fraught
with uncertainties, from unresolved technical questions to the
possibility of violent rivalries and attempts to derail the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The election, scheduled for June 7, will be the first step in a
complex process of selecting a 700-member body that is to choose a
president in November. None of the parties is expected to win a
majority; the leading parties will be happy to win 30 percent of
the vote. Intense coalition-building is expected after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first democratic vote in this nation of 200
million people since the 1950s, and the capstone to the uprising
that forced former President Suharto from power last May.
</P>
<P>
   But with competing interests _ political and religious
rivalries, major economic feifs, an unsettled military and a
plethora of armed groups _ and with election preparations far
behind schedule, many analysts are bracing for confusion, electoral
disputes and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see more dead victims in the process of
democratization,'' President B.J. Habibie said recently. ``We all
want to see a smooth, peaceful election. Otherwise disaster is
waiting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto took power in 1965, no one has ever lost a
presidential election in Indonesia: He was always the only
candidate. A do-or-die contest with 48 parties will be a new
experience with unpredictable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably heading for a very chaotic election,'' said
David Timberman, an American election analyst. ``There is far too
much that needs to be done with far too little time and far too few
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the best-case scenario will probably be characterized by
a great deal of ad-hoc-ism and improvisation, which in turn will
lead to confusion, inconsistencies and, as a result of that, a
great number of disputes and controversies. There is nobody who
knows how this is going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western diplomat said: ``The diplomatic community expects
serious violence in May and June, but it has very, very little idea
who may be behind it or why or what the consequences might be for
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relatively optimistic that the election will take place
and that the votes will be distributed relatively fairly. I expect
we'll see a lot of violence and in the end see some kind of
coalition emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hari Tchan, a political analyst with the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said the greatest threat of instability
would come from a possible victory by Golkar, the political party
that was formed to protect the interests of Suharto and that still
dominates the government.
</P>
<P>
   It is the party of Habibie, who is resented by many in the
political elite because of his ties to the past as Suharto's vice
president. This taint, along with sharp internal rivalries, make it
unclear whether Habibie will be the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the forces considered to be pro status quo win, people will
just not accept that,'' Tchan said. ``There will be prolonged
disturbances, prolonged tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the country's many competing groups have for the most
part swapped street demonstrations for electoral politics, the
momentum still appears to be with the forces of change. An outcome
that does not bring a clear-cut end to the Suharto era will not be
widely accepted, Tchan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Habibie has overturned much of the legacy of his mentor and
introduced a vividly open new style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment the capital is strikingly calm. The disruptive
student demonstrations and violence of four months ago have
disappeared from the streets. The collapse of the economy has
become a way of life, with people hunkering down in more frugal and
limited lives.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of communal violence that has taken hundreds of
lives this year in several remote areas has not, so far, spread to
the capital or had a significant political impact here.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential for widespread violence remains, particularly
as Indonesia's economy continues to founder. The local eruptions
have mostly involved long-suppressed ethnic, religious and
separatist conflicts, issues that are reflected across Indonesia
and could flare spontaneously, or be provoked for political
reasons, at any time.

RAPP SNAPS SOX LOSING SKID IN CONFIDENCE BUILDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Red Sox9, Twins4 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The pieces Wednesday started to fit for Pat Rapp.
And it couldn't have come at a better time for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp's sixth-inning contribution to a 9-4 rout of the Minnesota
Twins did more than snap a two-game skid against a team Boston
should be able to handle. It went a long way in restoring the
club's confidence in the big righthander who had been impressive in
spring training but struggled in his first three starts, all Red
Sox losses.
</P>
<P>
   With the status of Bret Saberhagen a question mark, it is vital
that one of the other starters be ready to step up. If it's not
Mark Portugal, who couldn't hold a four-run lead in a 6-4 loss
Tuesday night, it has to Rapp, a veteran who was 12-13 for the
Kansas City Royals a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, the Sox took a 4-0 lead. But Rapp
refused to cave in to the pesky Twins, limiting them to six hits
and one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been messing with my mechanics since spring training,''
Rapp said when asked how it turned things around Wednesday. ``And I
was trying to find a happy medium where I wasn't off balance and
out of synch. Today, I just tried to slow everything down. Last
week I felt like I was throwing the ball 200 miles per hour. When I
do that, it takes away from my location and my speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game went on, I was able to work my sinker in there a
little more, use my changeup and try to hit my spots. It turned out
a lot better than my last three games. The long ball has been
killing me. I've given up six. So I just tried to stay calm, pitch
down in the zone all day, and try to get some double-play balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp got two double plays and didn't yield a homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had been outhustled Tuesday night, but not Wednesday. In
the third inning, Boston took advantage of wildness by Twins
starter Mike Lincoln, who gave up a single to Darren Lewis and the
first of three walks that were issued to Trot Nixon. A wild pitch
allowed both runners to advance into scoring position. One run came
in on a sacrifice fly by Jose Offerman, a second on a ground out by
John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Boston built the lead to 4-0 as Lincoln again had
trouble finding the plate. Brian Daubach, making a rare start at
first, led off with a double to right-center and advanced to third
on a wild pitch. Daubach then was caught off the bag on a grounder
to second by Jason Varitek, but Varitek was able to reach second
during the rundown. After Nixon's second walk, Offerman came
through with a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln left after the fourth, and the Sox jumped on his
replacement, Joe Mays, for four runs in the sixth. Nixon hit a solo
home run in the seventh, his second of the season, and scored four
runs on the day. Not bad for a guy hitting .105.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more patient today and more relaxed,'' said Nixon, who
couldn't remember a game in which he had three walks. ``With my new
stance I feel very comfortable. By cutting out all the extra
movement, I can see the ball better.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Red Sox saw the ball better judging by the 11-hit output
against four Minnesota pitchers. Boston stranded six more runners,
but it is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have base runners,'' said manager Jim Williams, ``the
opportunities are there. Even though we have left some bodies on
base in a couple of games, I'd rather do that than not have anybody
on.
</P>
<P>
   Of Nixon, Williams said, ``If the kid takes a walk three times,
it just shows his patience at the plate. You never know what will
happen when you give young players an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was especially pleased with Rapp's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real good competitor for me,'' said Williams. ``He made
some pitches when he had to and he made some double plays. Offerman
and Nomar (Garciaparra) really had outstanding games. They made
some nice plays, including both double plays and several other
stops up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garciaparra and Jose played a great game today,'' said Rapp.
``They were catching everything in the hole, double plays left and
right. It kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox simply can't afford to take things for granted on
offense or defense, said Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we'd get on a pitcher early, score some runs, and
that was it,'' Garciaparra said. ``Today, we jumped on the pitcher
and just kept going. That's nice. That's what we have to do. You
can't always assume the game is under control. That's not always
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did get busy out there today. But that's all part of it.
You've got to play on both sides of the ball. If the pitcher feels
comfortable on the mound and in control of their game, that's
important.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal commission is preparing to send Congress
and the president sweeping recommendations for the gambling
industry, including a moratorium on expansion and some form of
government regulation of the giant casinos on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years of studying the economic and social effects
of gambling, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is
likely to issue a report that, as expected, leaves major commercial
casino operators free of federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the moratorium, the commission, meeting here for
two days this week, is likely to recommend that all forms of
Internet gambling be prohibited, that state lotteries curtail
advertising and that states sponsoring lotteries be required to
contribute some of their revenue to the treatment of problem
gamblers. Although the nine-member commission _ comprised of
gambling opponents and proponents alike _ is not expected to
advocate any federal taxes or regulation of the casino industry, it
appears that more federal oversight of casinos operated by
Native-American tribes will be recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was formed in 1996 and at the time casino
operators were fearful that it would lead to federal policies that
could stifle business and impose taxes and layers of regulation.
But after vigorous lobbying by the casino industry, the major
changes that are expected to be recommended to Congress are aimed
mostly at other forms of gambling, and even many of those
recommendations are expected to face vigorous fights in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle over the commission and the hearings have educated
the American people about the money and power'' that the casino
industry has, said Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican who
sponsored the legislation leading to the formation of the
commission. Wolf, an immovable opponent of gambling, said he was
pleased, nonetheless, that the commission was ``putting the
spotlight'' on the industry. ``There will be a lot of information
and data in the report,'' he said. ``You had to have the commission
report to take these guys on.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is facing a June 18 deadline, is currently
debating the final report, which will be delivered to Congress, the
president and tribal governments. Although no drafts have been made
public, it has become apparent during commission meetings that
while there is unanimous agreement on some issues, like raising the
minimum age for gambling to 21 and banning Internet gambling,
commission members remain divided over other major issues, like the
extent of compulsive gambling in the country, and whether the
social costs of the growth in legalized gambling outweighs the
economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who like to emphasize the costs and those who
like to emphasize the benefits,'' said Kay C. James, the chairman
of the commission who resigned this week as a dean at Regent
University in Virginia. ``Although there is now a great deal of
consensus, on some issues that just won't happen.'' For instance,
Ms. James noted that while there is no disagreement over the
existence of pathological gambling, ``the disagreement is over the
numbers and how much of a problem it is.''
</P>
<P>
   With some form of gambling now legal in 47 states, commission
members are expected to express concern in their report about how
quickly gambling has spread since the last federal study in 1976.
One of the most heated issues of debate here on Wednesday concerned
whether a moratorium should be imposed on the expansion of
gambling. Some commissioners contended that such a move would give
local governments a chance to evaluate the effect of their gambling
operations before adding more.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman and chief
executive of the MGM casinos, said a moratorium was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear the word moratorium, they think, `That's it.
They want to end it,' '' Lani warned. After a majority of
commissioners voted to recommend a moratorium, Lani warned that he
might draft a minority report if the issue is not resolved before
the final report is submitted.

GLOBE WON'T BAR TOBACCO ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The New York Times announced says it will no longer
accept cigarette and tobacco advertising in its pages, effective
Saturday. The decision by the Times, whose parent company owns The
Boston Globe and 20 other newspapers, does not apply to those
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe will continue to accept advertising for tobacco
products, but strict guidelines that were put in place last month
will be applied in selecting the ads for publication, a spokesman
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard P. Gulla, director of public relations at the Globe,
said revenue from tobacco advertising accounts for a fraction of
the newspaper's overall advertising volume and revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not go out and seek this type of product or this kind of
advertising business, but if an ad comes to us and it meets certain
guidelines then we will accept it for publication,'' Gulla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco is still a legal product regardless of how one views
it,'' he added. ``Censorship, whether of a news story or an
advertisement, is something we look at closely every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and the
Los Angeles Times are among several newspapers around the country
that accept advertising for tobacco products, though revenue from
such ads is small.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, cigarette and tobacco advertising has decreased
sharply in recent years, dropping to just over $11 million today
from $21 million in 1995, The Wall Street Journal reported this
week. By contrast, $500 million is spent on tobacco advertising in
the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The New York Times Co., said
Wednesday that tobacco ads represented less than 1 percent of the
newspaper's advertising revenue. She told reporters this week that
a ban is being instituted because the paper ``does not want to
expose readers to advertising that is harmful to health or
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neilsen stressed that the decision applied only to the
Times, and not to the Globe or the other newspapers the Times Co.
owns. ``All of our properties have the autonomy to make their own
decisions about the advertising they accept,'' she said. ``In fact,
I think our properties were caught by surprise. We did not tell
them in advance that we were going to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Globe's advertising policy, the newspaper will not
accept cigarette ads that are targeted at children or teenagers,
ads that contain cartoon characters, or ads in which the text or
images suggest that smoking and good health are related or that
smoking could lead to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   The policy also prohibits placement of the ads in newspaper
sections designed for children or teenagers, and it bans
distribution of tobacco products through the Globe's product
sampling programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gulla said all tobacco advertising copy must be submitted in
advance. He added that freestanding inserts and advertising copy
are also expected to meet the standards outlined in the Globe's
policy.

 WASHINGTON: is submitted.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides the content of the report, commission members are also
wrestling with its tone. ``What's missing in my view is an explicit
recognition of the fact that the American people love to gamble,''
said John W. Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees International Union, which represents 75,000
casino employees. ``While I don't think it's the only thing to say,
I certainly don't think it should be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, established in 1996 by Congress and the
president at a cost of $5 million, the commission has traveled
around the country to explore the consequences of gambling's rapid
expansion, and it has also financed several studies to help reach
its conclusions. One study found that more than 5 million Americans
are considered problem or pathological gamblers, and an additional
15 million are at risk. Another study found that an estimated 1.8
million American adults and 1.1 million young people 12 to 17 years
of age exhibit severe, or ``pathological'' gambling behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But gambling advocates on the commission contended that the
language on compulsive gambling was misleading and intended to
exaggerate the dangers. For example, they said it was unfair to say
that all of the 15 million people who have gambled at least one
time to relieve uncomfortable feelings should be classified as ``at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said they were displeased that one study found
that the economic cost of gambling addictions is about $5 billion a
year _ for things like legal fees for divorce, court and jail
costs, bankruptcies and lost wages _ much less than opponents of
gambling had previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not appear that the commission will take any
action that will severely effect the large casinos, some members
want to ensure that the report reflects a concern about the
dominate role the casino industry now plays in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time gambling was rare and considered exceptional,''
said Richard C. Leone, a former state treasurer of New Jersey and
currently president of the New York-based Century Fund. Gambling is
now ``common and unexceptional,'' Leone said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the minimum legal age for all forms of gambling could
effect race tracks, which in many states allow 18-year-olds to
wager. States with legalized casinos already have set the minimum
age at 21, but the commission agreed that stricter enforcement is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The final report is expected to be highly critical of the
lottery industry. At one point, some commissioners favored
referring to politicians as ``addicted to the revenue'' that comes
from state-sponsored gambling. Ultimately, they agreed to change
the language, but they were still expected to call for independent
boards to oversee the regulation of lotteries, and they were also
likely to recommend that states disassociate themselves from the
video lottery business.
</P>
<P>
   One study financed by the commission found that about 5 percent
of lottery players purchase more than half of the tickets sold and
that poor people spend a greater portion of their income on lottery
tickets than other players. The commissioners agreed that a portion
of the revenue from lotteries should go toward the treatment of
compulsive gamblers. Although most large casino companies already
finance research and treatment for such problems, state lotteries
are not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is expected to be extremely, the commission appeared
to be unanimous in its desire to stop the highly lucrative online
gambling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Should a complete ban on online gambling prove impossible to
implement and enforce, one proposal under consideration by the
commission would make it illegal to use credit cards to gamble with
the offshore Internet casinos.

KRAFT HAS MANY OUTS TO HARTFORD DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connecticut, eager to lure the New England Patriots to
Hartford last year, gave team owner Robert Kraft many conditions
under which he could walk away from the $374 million stadium deal
without paying a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The escape clauses, negotiated by Kraft into the 300-plus page
contract, take on crucial importance now that Massachusetts
lawmakers have agreed to a plan that has a shot at keeping the team
in Foxborough, even though it is significantly less lucrative than
Hartford's.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Connecticut deal, Kraft would have to
formally break off negotiations with Connecticut to consider the
Bay State bid. According to a review of the publicly available
contract signed by Gov. John G. Rowland and Kraft, that won't be
hard. Or expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Until May 2 there is only one penalty included in the accored _
a maximum $2 million fine _ that is Connecticut's ``sole and
exclusive right and remedy'' for any potential breach of contract.
After that date, penalties would increase depending on how much the
state has expended on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Before May 2, Kraft would have to pay only if he failed to honor
his agreement to negotiate exclusively with Connecticut or did not
show ``good faith'' in trying to complete details of the proposed
stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   But because of delays in assembling the Hartford stadium site,
and serious questions about the state's ability to clean up the
property and deliver it on time and on budget, Kraft appears to
have ample grounds to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contact, the Patriots can terminate the agreement
without any penalty if, in the team's ``sole and absolute
discretion,'' the state's interim report, delivered last month,
fails to ``demonstrate sufficient progress'' in moving the steam
plant currently located the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   The May 2 deadline also allows the team to call it quits if the
report ``does not provide sufficient assurances that the site,
scope, cost, timing or funding'' of the project, and necessary
infrastructure improvements, can be completed in time for the team
to move into the stadium by August 2002.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues have dogged Connecticut from the start.
Connecticut has not yet reached a final agreement on moving the
steam plant, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Key soil tests began just days ago, and results won't be
available for weeks, making it hard to determine whether the state
can clean up the site in time and on budget by the 2002 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about the project's infrastructure
budget. Construction experts, for example, are concerned that the
state may not be able to hang a portion of the 68,000-seat stadium
over a highway as planned without going over budget. And a change
in stadium design would also cause further delays.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has not negotiated the required sublease with the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The May 2 deadline is the most obvious window of opportunity,
although the contract is littered with other ``escape hatches''
with varying deadlines. The later exit dates come with varying
degress of risk, however, and carry damages that would be decided
in a Connecitcut court.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months or so, there are a number of other things
Connecticut must do, almost none of which have been completed.
These items include plans for:
</P>
<P>
   -- Preliminary stadium design agreements
</P>
<P>
   -- A project timetable and master coordination plan
</P>
<P>
   -- A site survey
</P>
<P>
   -- Site clean up and preparation
</P>
<P>
   -- Relocation of sewer and utility lines
</P>
<P>
   -- Stadium project budget
</P>
<P>
   -- Infrastructure improvements
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also protected if the other NFL owners refuse
to approve the team's proposed move from Foxborough to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has formally submitted his application for the move, but
team owners are expected to approve it only if Massachusetts fails
to deliver an alternative proposal.

 NEW JERSEY'S STATE POLICE ENLIST HOTEL WORKERS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Adds new material in 2nd Take; new hedline; corrects slug to(mb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In an effort to catch drug smugglers who travel
through Newark International Airport, the New Jersey State Police
have quietly enlisted workers at dozens of motels to tip them off
about guests who pay for rooms in cash, receive a flurry of
telephone calls or, in some cases, simply speak Spanish, according
to people who have participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel-Motel Program, operated out of the State Police
special projects unit since the early 1990s, has recruited managers
and employees at an undisclosed number of places to act as
informers in their anti-drug initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel managers who participate in the program say they allow
troopers to routinely leaf through the credit card receipts and
registration forms of guests without a warrant, and to offer $1,000
rewards to hotel workers whose tips lead to arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the hotel and motel managers say, they are assured
that any searches or arrests will occur after the suspect leaves
the hotel premises, and their workers will never be required to
testify or have their names disclosed in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the program are the troopers' surveillance
seminars, which train front desk clerks, bell hops and porters to
scrutinize guests who fit the profile of drug traffickers by asking
for corner rooms, hauling trailers behind their cars or frequently
moving from room to room. Several hotel employees and union leaders
said troopers have also trained them to take racial characteristics
into account and pay particular attention to guests who speak
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   State Police officials, who have been besieged for years by
charges that troopers illegally target black and Hispanic
motorists, acknowledge that hotel personnel have been enlisted as
informers, but they vehemently deny that race plays any role. Lt.
Bruce Geleta, who commands the unit, declined to discuss what
factors troopers teach hotel employees to look for, saying that he
did not want to alert the drug traffickers to his tactics. But he
insisted race was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, these days, we're very careful not to do anything
like that,'' he said in an interview last month.
</P>
<P>
   But Clo Smith, a front desk clerk at a Holiday Inn near Newark
Airport, said she sat through the hour-long seminar three years ago
and was offended that the state police detective suggested that
Spanish-speaking guests should be treated with more suspicion than
those who speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say I found it somewhat insensitive,'' said Ms.
Smith, the union steward for Teamsters Local 819, which represents
front desk employees at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   David Feeback, president of Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local
69 in Secaucus, said some union members have also complained that
that troopers have pressured them to participate and report some of
the patrons at hotel restaurants who pay with large sums of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's racial profiling, plain and simple,'' Feeback said.
``They shouldn't be discriminating against people that way. And if
any of my members ask, I tell them to have nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But one manager involved in the program, Fred Hartman, who runs
the Ramada Inn Newark Airport, said he never actually sat through a
training session, but was convinced that it did not involve race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no profiling whatsoever,'' said Hartman, who added
that said he frequently allowed troopers to check credit card
receipts and guest registration forms.
</P>
<P>
   Geleta said he would not provide a racial breakdown of those
people stopped, searched or arrested as part of the Hotel-Motel
program. John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state police, also
declined to disclose the names or court case numbers of people who
were prosecuted after being arrested by troopers in the Hotel-Motel
Unit.

HOUSE SEEKS TO LIMIT CLINTON'S ABILITY TO DEPLOY TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House defied Clinton administration pleas
Wednesday and approved a measure that would restrict the
president's ability to deploy ground forces in Yugoslavia without
first consulting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 249 to 180 vote signaled that Congress seeks to assert a
larger role in U.S. policy toward the conflict with Yugoslavia,
more than a month after the United States and its NATO partners
launched an aerial campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end his assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.,
would ban the use of federal money to deploy ``ground elements''
unless Congress first authorizes it. The Senate is working on
similar legislation and could consider it before the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has said he would consult Congress if he
decides to move beyond the bombing campaign and send troops into
Yugoslavia, Republicans said the legislation gives Congress a
vehicle to assert its power to declare war and would force Clinton
to keep his promise.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats argued that Goodling's bill was vaguely written
and could be misinterpreted to mean that the current use of U.S.
Apache helicopters over Kosovo would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton said ``America must continue to speak with a
single voice'' in dealing with Yugoslavia. And senior
administration officials, in a letter to Republican congressional
leaders, said the Goodling bill would ``unacceptably restrict the
president's ability to carry our his responsibilities as commander
in chief and to conduct foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said the bill would have no effect
on the ongoing air campaign and said the intent of the legislation
``is to preclude a large'' deployment of land forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does not tie the president's hand,'' she said. ``It
will not impair the use of Apache helicopters or small numbers of
forces ... for intelligence gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
resolution on ground forces was unnecessary because Clinton has
promised to consult Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Clinton reiterated that promise Wednesday to
lawmakers who attended a White House meeting on the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization operation that began on March 24. Clinton has
repeatedly said he does not expect to use combat forces and expects
the air campaign to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a change of policy by NATO or ground troops
(become necessary) then it must be debated by Congress and a vote
must be taken by Congress,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said he hoped the
measure would reverse the trend of presidents deploying air or
ground forces before consulting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship with Congress comes before our relationship
with our NATO allies,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that if Clinton had consulted Congress before
starting the air war, the U.S. would have been able to send a
strong, united message to Milosevic. ``We can do this if we do it
together Mr. President,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on Kosovo policy was forced by Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif., who submitted two resolutions earlier this month aimed at
forcing Congress to take a firm position on the U.S. role in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of ground troops and I don't think anybody
should be mistaken about that,'' Campbell said. ``We are at
war...we have a constitutional obligation to fulfill.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Campbell's resolutions called for Congress to declare war
against Yugoslavia and the other called on Clinton to withdraw U.S.
forces from the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected voted 427 to 2 against the declaration of
war; the resolution to withdraw American personnel was defeated 290
to 139.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO campaign is designed to prod Milosevic to end his
assault on the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province of Serbia
that once enjoyed relative autonomy. Serbia, the dominant republic
of Yugoslavia, sees Kosovo as an invaluable part of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders unsuccessfully tried to get Campbell to
withdraw his resolutions. Instead, Republican leaders offered
Goodling's legislation and a Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The House also debated a Democratic-backed resolution expressing
support of the current air campaign, but it failed to pass late
Thursday in a 213 to 213 vote. The resolution, which was adopted by
the Senate before last month's air campaign began, authorizes
Clinton to conduct such an operation.

 TRENTON, N.J.: Hotel-Motel Unit. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it is a common, and widely accepted, investigative
technique for detectives to develop sources within the community
they police, the state troopers' Hotel-Motel Program is unusually
aggressive because it uses an entire hotel or motel staff to to
scrutiinzie guests during their entire stay. That fact has made the
program very effective, Geleta said, although he declined to say
how many arrests the unit has made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also raised privacy concerns from some civil rights
advocates and members of the tourism and hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Lapidus, legal director for the New Jersey chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said she was shocked that the state
police and some hotels had been so cavalier about intruding on the
privacy of hotel guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the state police to be looking through people's credit
cards receipts and registration forms, and from what I understand,
conducting surveillance on some of them, is just a gross invasion
of privacy,'' Ms. Lapidus said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Larsen, president of the New Jersey Hotel and Motel
Association, said he had never heard of the program and the
organization has never been asked to take a formal position on the
matter. But Larsen said he would not allow the hotel he manages to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't allow the police to look through our records
without a subpoena, period,'' said Larsen, manager of the East
Brunswick Hilton. ``We have an obligation to protect people's
privacy. I would think there's a civil liability if we start giving
out information.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fields, owner of the Days Inn near Newark Airport, said
he refused to participate in the program because he thought it
violated his guests' right to privacy. Fields said that in 1997,
his general manager was pressured by state police to join the
program, but felt that it would be intrusive to grant the troopers'
requests to arbitrarily search through ``the bucket'' where
registration cards and credit card imprints are stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tactic out of some dictatorship,'' said Fields.
``When a person checks into a hotel, he or she has a reasonable
assumption that the place of business will protect their privacy,
not treat them like a criminal.'' Many criminal defense lawyers
were stunned to learn of the existence of the informers and said
the program might also raise concerns about whether troopers
testified truthfully in court hearings about arrests that were
initiated by hotel employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapidus said the she may file court papers to force state
police to turn over records of all arrests made by all troopers
involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly search and seizure issues here,'' said Ms.
Lapidus. ``The Constitution guarantees that every defendant knows
all the evidence against them and all the witnesses against them,
so if we find that that hasn't been happening, it's certainly
something we'd be interested in pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   If criminal defendants can prove that officers testified
untruthfully about the circumstances leading up to a search, they
can ask a judge to throw out their search and overturn their
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Geleta said that his detectives are responsible enough to
handle the job the without violating either the law or police
procedure. The vast majority of the arrests made by the unit ended
with guilty pleas long before trial, he said. And if the cases went
to trial, he said, the detectives were trained to conceal their
informers identities without lying during court hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ways of handling that,'' he said, but declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel managers who participated in the program differed in their
assessments of whether race played a role in it. Fred Hartman,
manager of the Ramada Inn near Newark Airport, said he was
convinced that guests were scrutinized only on their behavior, and
not on their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no profiling whatsoever,'' said Hartman, who
acknowledged that he never attended one of the troopers' training
sessions. He said he had no qualms about allowing troopers to check
credit card receipts and registration forms because ``they're good
guys, and we want to co-operate with them whenever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some hotel managers who support the program said that
state troopers had told them that the intent was to catch West
Indians or Hispanic people, particularly South Americans, involved
in the drug trade. Chip Woodell, general manager of the Hampton Inn
near Newark Airport, said he agreed to let the state police address
his employees last month because troopers convinced him that they
were interested in catching international drug smugglers rather
than guests who may have used narcotics themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they weren't interested in catching someone
smoking a joint in their room,'' said Woodell, who noted that he
had allowed troopers to check his registration records about twice
a week. ``What they want is some guy from Colombia, who swallowed a
kilo of cocaine wrapped in balloons, who was trying to sneak it
through the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   David Chertoff, the former manager of the Howard Johnson near
Newark Airport, said he supported the program because he trusted
the troopers' judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the state police had their own criteria in
deciding who to look for, and it was a very detailed, complex
thing,'' said Chertoff. ``Race was one small part of it. But I will
tell you, it was not a function solely of race. If a Jamaican came
in, or someone with dreadlocks, it's not like they were
automatically targeted. A lot of our clientele and employees were
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   State police officials would not discuss the size of the program
or its origins, and asserted that any publicity about the hotel
employees' involvement in the plan might endanger those employees.
But when he was pressed to describe how publicity could pose a risk
to informers if they were not identified in news accounts, Geleta
conceded, ``Well, maybe it would endanger the program, because the
drug dealers would know what we're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the unit said that a training film shown to all
members of the unit stated that the program was based on a similar
initiative by the Los Angeles Police Department and some federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
although officers were never trained to target Hispanic or West
Indian people, they were frequently reminded that much of the
illegal narcotics in the area was shipped from South and Central
America and the Caribbean. They were also pressured by their
superiors to make as many arrests and seizures as possible, the
trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could turn it into profiling, pretty easily,'' the
trooper said, although he insisted he never took race into account
when carrying out his duties.

MILOSEVIC ABRUPTLY FIRES OPPOSITION GADFLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A Yugoslav deputy prime minister who had
threatened street demonstrations against the government over press
freedom went quietly Wednesday evening after being fired by fax.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Vuk Draskovic, the outspoken and liberal
window-dressing for President Slobodan Milosevic's government, was
informed of his dismissal by Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic just 30
minutes before it was announced on Serbian state television,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic, a close ally of Milosevic, said Draskovic, a writer
who turned to politics in the late 1980s and has always been
something of a maverick, had been dismissed ``because of his public
statements against government positions, and for damaging the
government's prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials had interpreted Draskovic's stand as a
sign of dissent born of the air war. But Draskovic is not an
insider and there are few signs that the ruling circle around
Milosevic and his wife is cracking.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief news conference Wednesday evening, Draskovic issued
no direct challenge to Milosevic. He said he supported the united
fight of the Serbian people against NATO and would continue to urge
a negotiated settlement for Kosovo, adding, ``I hope Milosevic
wants the same things I want.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the garrulous Draskovic had called on the
government to ``stop lying'' about the war and to negotiate a peace
that would be monitored by armed United Nations troops.
</P>
<P>
   But more threatening than these suggestions, senior Yugoslav
officials and analysts said, were his repeated criticisms of the
political parties of Milosevic and his influential wife, Mirjana
Markovic. Draskovic said the couple had taken advantage of the war
to further their own political aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped over some line with Milosevic,'' a senior Serbian
journalist said Wednesday night. Senior Draskovic aides were upset
by the dismissal, having urged him in recent days to tone down his
criticism and limit his interviews. ``He got carried away with
everyone slapping him on the back,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   In statements carried Wednesday night on Studio B, the
television station that his Serbian Renewal Movement controls,
Draskovic was supportive and careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that my country is a victim of aggression,'' he said, ``I
am one of the millions of Serbs who are soldiers of their
fatherland. We sometimes disagree about the ways and means of
defending ourselves, but we are united and uncompromising in the
decision to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity. There
is no crack here and there will not be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television also announced Wednesday night an
agreement between Ibrahim Rugova, an ethnic Albanian leader in
Kosovo, and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic to work on a
political settlement for Kosovo, a province in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova actually addressed the camera in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, speaking in Serbian and emphasizing ``an atmosphere of
mutual confidence.'' Rugova, whom NATO regards effectively as a
prisoner and unable to speak freely, looked relaxed as he said:
``The most important thing is this mutual trust that we have built
and the world will salute.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had ``successfully cooperated'' with Serbian
officials, including Milosevic and Milutinovic, ``and we shall
continue in that manner until we reach a solution and we create
organs and institutions in Kosovo for all nationalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously Rugova could be seen but not heard, with his views
being summarized, accurately or not, by an announcer.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, he and Milutinovic agreed to form a new,
temporary government for the province; resume talks immediately on
giving Kosovo ``wide self-rule'' within Serbia and Yugoslavia, and
invite some foreigners ``as guests'' to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, a leader of anti-Milosevic protests in 1996 and 97,
had joined the government in January saying both that he wanted to
strengthen it during a time of crisis over Kosovo and that he
wanted to change it from within.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Draskovic said that a military censor had
taken over Studio B, an assertion denied by the military and later
by the station itself, and that he would lead street demonstrations
if military control over programming continued.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained bitterly about spending cuts for Belgrade
city, which his party governs, while the Serbian government faced
few cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday evening, the executive committee of
Milosevic's Socialist Party said: ``We shall not allow anyone to
weaken our people's resolve by diverting attention to any other
issues than defense of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic had earned most attention from the West for his
statements that Yugoslavia was practically alone in its war over
Kosovo, that NATO was not cracking and that he thought Milosevic
would permit an armed United Nations force in Kosovo after
hostilities ended.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials say the same, although the government position
remains that only unarmed civilian observers from non-NATO
countries will be allowed into Kosovo _ nowhere close to the
allies' demand that an armed ``international security force,'' with
NATO troops as its core, go in to give ethnic Albanians the
confidence to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Three ministers from Draskovic's party resigned in protest
Wednesday is evening. They were he Information Milan Komnenic; he
Domestic Trade Slobodan Nenadovic, and Milan Bozic, a minister
without portfolio who is also deputy mayor of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While Komnenic helped foreign journalists come to Yugoslavia to
cover the war, the resignations will have little effect on the real
power structure, which is controlled by Milosevic and his wife.

 &HT;    1ST LEDE WRITETHROUGH TO REFLECT VOTE ON FOURTH AND FINAL ISSUE
 &HT;    HOUSE VOTES TO RESTRICT ANY GROUND WAR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided House of Representatives voted
Wednesday to restrict President Clinton's power to wage a ground
offensive against Yugoslavia, but stopped short of ordering him to
withdraw U.S. forces from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In their first formal response to the five-week-old air war, the
lawmakers voted 249-180 to deny funding for ground troops unless
the president wins authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected a measure to require Clinton to bring home
the U.S. forces involved in the NATO operation, 290 to 139. It also
trounced a proposal, with only two ``yes'' votes, to make a formal
declaration of war against Yugoslavia. The House later deadlocked
213-213 on a symbolic measure that would have authorized the
current air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the action on ground troops was
uncertain, since the Senate would have to pass a similar bill,
which could then be vetoed by the president. Moreover, several
senators have introduced a proposal that would extend the
president's authority to use ``all means necessary,'' including
ground troops, in the Balkan struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the emotional daylong debate aired long simmering
disputes over the the U.S. role in the Balkans, the
administration's conduct of the war, and whether Congress has a
constitutional duty to play a role in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not even be in the Balkans,'' said House Armed
Services Chairman Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C. ``The national security
of the United States is not at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the mission countered that Americans had an
obligation to stop the assaults on ethnic Albanians by the forces
of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. ``The voices of
appeasement and isolationism are reverberating in these halls,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who fled the Nazis during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Other members complained that there were no good options. Rep.
Herbert H. Bateman, D-Va., said the Balkan conflict offered ``one
of the most dismal range of policy choices this House has ever been
asked to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had attempted to preempt the House action by
reassuring lawmakers in person and through a letter in which he
wrote that he would seek their consent before deciding to wage a
ground war. In remarks outside of the White House during the House
debate, the president said he was asking the lawmakers to follow
the example of unity set by the NATO summit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are speaking with a single
voice,'' he said. ``America must continue to speak with a single
voice as well.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told his
colleagues that it was unnecessary to pass a law requiring
authorization to expand the air assault into a land operation.
``The president said he would not as a practical matter ask for an
introduction of ground troops without coming here and taking the
time to ask us for a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance was not enough for some members. Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., one of the managers who conducted the impeachment
trial in the Senate against Clinton, told his colleagues: ``I do
not have the confidence'' that Clinton will seek a vote before
ordering troops into ground action, he said. ``Now's the time to
speak, more than less, sooner rather than later, before we get a
lot of people killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the House refused to go along with a resolution by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to withdraw the troops from the conflict.
Using the provisions of the War Powers Act of 1973, Campbell had
single-handedly forced the House leadership to schedule the debate
on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The War Powers Act requires congressional action when
hostilities last more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment that we never had in Vietnam we now have,'' he told
his colleagues. ``We have a chance to stop it before we get in too
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the congressional leadership had shied away
from a public debate over the conflict, and the White House had
strongly discouraged it. Minority Leader Gephardt told his
colleagues, ``Mr. Milosevic will be listening carefully to what is
being said here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the issue was joined, critics opened up on the Clinton
policy. House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, called for pulling
out now. ``Was it worth it in Vietnam?'' he asked. ``In Lebanon,
(President) Ronald Reagan cut his losses and withdrew the troops''
after a barracks was bombed. ``We should do the same thing before
the body bags start coming home. What good have we done? None.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the members chose a more middle of the road
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No military action should have been initiated in the Balkans
without prior approval of Congress,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas. ``But with this conflict already underway, it would be
folly not to consider the facts on the ground. An immediate exit
would send the wrong message to Milosevic and to other petty
tyrants around the world from Iraq to North Korea, and it could
defeat our goal of ensuring peace and
</P>
<P>
   stability in Europe.''

OECD PROPOSES GLOBAL CODE OF CORPORATE CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Corporations around the world will be encouraged to
offer employees stock-ownership plans and other profit-sharing
incentives under a new code of good corporate conduct that finance
ministers from 29 industrial countries are expected to endorse in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The code was drawn up by the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development at the request of member
governments last year after the financial meltdown in Asia. The
OECD said the crisis highlighted what it called the need for better
standards of business behavior in that region of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the code Wednesday, OECD secretary-general Donald
Johnston called it a ``cornerstone for attracting foreign
investment into the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the code as complementary to the efforts of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are holding their
annual spring meetings in Washington, to strengthen the
international financial system after the crises in Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis highlighted the weakness in transparency, in
regulation and in overall good governance in the corporate sector
in a number of countries,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   The new code, which will be approved at a meeting in Paris on
May 26, comes a few months after the organization banned corporate
bribery and after ratification by 12 governments including the
United States, Germany, Japan and Britain. Johnston said France is
expected to ratify this summer.
</P>
<P>
   This prohibition on bribery, which closely follows existing U.S.
law, requires ratifying countries to introduce domestic legislation
making it a criminal offense for their corporations to bribe
foreign officials in order to win business contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new corporate governance code is voluntary, Johnson
said the World Bank and the IMF could insist that governments
encourage companies to follow its prescriptions as a condition for
loans they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the code's provisions are already accepted practice in
the Western industrialized world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The recommendation that corporations offer profit-sharing plans
to employees comes in the section dealing with ``the role of
stakeholders in corporate governance'' which calls for ``active
cooperation'' between businesses and all those with a stake in
their success, such as workers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the code define the rights of shareholders and
provide for their equitable treatment. The code also lays down
general principals for corporate disclosure of finances and
management and defines the responsibilities of a board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of the joint development committee of the World
Bank and the IMF, which deals with poorer nations and those
recovering from conflicts, World Bank president James Wolfensohn
said Wednesday that he expected the number of Kosovar refugees to
rise from 600,000 at present to 950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 days, he said, the World Bank and the European Union
plan to establish a jointly financed relief operation and to start
planning for the refugees' eventual return as well as for the
reconstruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the longer the bombing lasts in Yugoslavia,
the greater the economic damage to surrounding countries like
Macedonia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Albania and Romania, which are
suffering trade and investment losses.

 &HT;    1ST LEDE WRITETHROUGH TO REFLECT VOTE ON FOURTH AND FINAL ISSUE
 &HT;    HOUSE VOTES TO RESTRICT ANY GROUND WAR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided House of Representatives voted
Wednesday to restrict President Clinton's power to wage a ground
offensive against Yugoslavia, but stopped short of ordering him to
withdraw U.S. forces from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In their first formal response to the five-week-old air war, the
lawmakers voted 249-180 to deny funding for ground troops unless
the president wins authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected a measure to require Clinton to bring home
the U.S. forces involved in the NATO operation, 290 to 139. It also
trounced a proposal, with only two ``yes'' votes, to make a formal
declaration of war against Yugoslavia. The House later deadlocked
213-213 on a symbolic measure that would have authorized the
current air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the action on ground troops was
uncertain, since the Senate would have to pass a similar bill,
which could then be vetoed by the president. Moreover, several
senators have introduced a proposal that would extend the
president's authority to use ``all means necessary,'' including
ground troops, in the Balkan struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the emotional daylong debate aired long simmering
disputes over the the U.S. role in the Balkans, the
administration's conduct of the war, and whether Congress has a
constitutional duty to play a role in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not even be in the Balkans,'' said House Armed
Services Chairman Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C. ``The national security
of the United States is not at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the mission countered that Americans had an
obligation to stop the assaults on ethnic Albanians by the forces
of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. ``The voices of
appeasement and isolationism are reverberating in these halls,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who fled the Nazis during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Other members complained that there were no good options. Rep.
Herbert H. Bateman, D-Va., said the Balkan conflict offered ``one
of the most dismal range of policy choices this House has ever been
asked to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had attempted to preempt the House action by
reassuring lawmakers in person and through a letter in which he
wrote that he would seek their consent before deciding to wage a
ground war. In remarks outside of the White House during the House
debate, the president said he was asking the lawmakers to follow
the example of unity set by the NATO summit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are speaking with a single
voice,'' he said. ``America must continue to speak with a single
voice as well.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told his
colleagues that it was unnecessary to pass a law requiring
authorization to expand the air assault into a land operation.
``The president said he would not as a practical matter ask for an
introduction of ground troops without coming here and taking the
time to ask us for a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance was not enough for some members. Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., one of the managers who conducted the impeachment
trial in the Senate against Clinton, told his colleagues: ``I do
not have the confidence'' that Clinton will seek a vote before
ordering troops into ground action, he said. ``Now's the time to
speak, more than less, sooner rather than later, before we get a
lot of people killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the House refused to go along with a resolution by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to withdraw the troops from the conflict.
Using the provisions of the War Powers Act of 1973, Campbell had
single-handedly forced the House leadership to schedule the debate
on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The War Powers Act requires congressional action when
hostilities last more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment that we never had in Vietnam we now have,'' he told
his colleagues. ``We have a chance to stop it before we get in too
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the congressional leadership had shied away
from a public debate over the conflict, and the White House had
strongly discouraged it. Minority Leader Gephardt told his
colleagues, ``Mr. Milosevic will be listening carefully to what is
being said here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the issue was joined, critics opened up on the Clinton
policy. House Majority Whip Tom Delay, R-Texas, called for pulling
out now. ``Was it worth it in Vietnam?'' he asked. ``In Lebanon,
(President) Ronald Reagan cut his losses and withdrew the troops''
after a barracks was bombed. ``We should do the same thing before
the body bags start coming home. What good have we done? None.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the members chose a more middle of the road
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``No military action should have been initiated in the Balkans
without prior approval of Congress,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett,
D-Texas. ``But with this conflict already underway, it would be
folly not to consider the facts on the ground. An immediate exit
would send the wrong message to Milosevic and to other petty
tyrants around the world from Iraq to North Korea, and it could
defeat our goal of ensuring peace and
</P>
<P>
   stability in Europe.''

SPANKING CASE PITS MINISTER VS. ABUSE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the mind and heart of pastor Donald R. Cobble Jr.,
he has a God-given and biblically sanctioned right to punish his
young son by spanking him with a leather belt.
</P>
<P>
   But the state agency charged with protecting children disagrees,
likening Cobble's tough-love discipline to child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state's highest court will step in as arbiter, weighing
the rights of parents to raise their children as their religious
beliefs dictate, against the right of the state to step in when
strictness crosses over to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Judicial Court has short-circuited the
appellate process, bypassing the state Appeals Court to take
Cobble's appeal for itself, which often happens in cases that raise
significant legal and policy issues. It will hear the case in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Cobble's belief that corporal punishment is an act
of love sanctioned by the Bible, a belief not shared by the
Superior Court judge who agreed with the state Department of Social
Services last year that Cobble's method of discipline could veer
into child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Cobble's attorney, Chester Darling, said Cobble
believes that the DSS has tampered with his right to raise his
child as he sees fit and violated his constitutional right to
practice religion without interference from government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who the hell are they to tell parents how to discipline their
children?'' Darling asked. ``It's sad that we have these social
workers coming into a home and telling people how they should raise
their kids and objecting to the religious features of that family's
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of this case is that a lack of discipline is a
form of child abuse,'' said Darling, who successfully sued on
behalf of a veterans group to keep a contingent of gay marchers out
of the St. Patrick's Day parade in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He has also organized a nonprofit group to argue conservative
causes in court and on Beacon Hill. Cobble has hired Darling to
represent him before the SJC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Colorado and see what happens if there are no
rules and they aren't enforced by the parent,'' Darling added.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey A. Locke, acting commissioner of the DSS, said the
Cobble case should be viewed as the one that might finally, clearly
delineate the line between abuse and physical punishment _ not as
an intrusion into the privacy of child-rearing or deeply held
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Locke noted that the SJC, in a case decided in the 1980s, ruled
that a parent's religious beliefs must give way when a child's
physical well-being is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the SJC upheld the manslaughter conviction of
Christian Scientists whose son died when they did not get
traditional medical treatment for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble is an associate pastor at the Christian Teaching and
Worship Center in Woburn. In 1997, he and his ex-wife, Lisa,
clashed with the DSS.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, their son Judah was attending a special needs
program because he has attention deficit disorder. As part of the
school's education plan for Judah, a teacher sends a report
detailing the child's behavior to his parents every night. The
teacher asked for strong support from parents to help quell
negative behaviors in the classroom, Darling said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble's approach was to read to Judah from the Bible while
spanking him on the buttocks with the soft end of a belt. Judah was
always clothed and was punished only this way when he disrupted the
class or had physical contact with classmates or teachers, Darling
said. He was not disciplined for difficulties in academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Judah told a teacher he feared his father and the spankings,
triggering a DSS investigation. A social worker concluded that
Cobble had abused Judah in the past and could do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Further appeals inside DSS reached the same conclusion, as did
Suffolk Superior Court Judge John Cratsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the continued nature of the spanking, the vulnerability
of the child, and the Cobbles' admission of both spanking and
believing in spanking as a form of discipline, there is a real risk
that this practice will lead to serious injury,'' Cratsley ruled in
December.
</P>
<P>
   DSS did not remove the child from the home, and Cobble was never
charged with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is no longer involved with the Cobble family. Judah
reported getting red marks on his buttocks from the spankings, but
two doctors who regularly treated him told DSS they had never seen
signs of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble is not listed in the department's register of abusers,
but has vowed to fight the initial finding of abuse by the DSS
because of his religious and personal convictions.

A RACE IN LOUISIANA FOR THE REPUBLICAN RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   METAIRIE, La. _ On the surface, the special election to be held
here Saturday is about who will replace Bob Livingston, the veteran
congressman who admitted an affair and abruptly resigned last year
as he was about to become speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the undercurrent, as has been the case in Louisiana politics
in the last decade, is whether this will be the race that finally
cures the state, and the national Republican Party, of the angst
generated by David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, 48 and graying, is among the seven Republicans and two
Democrats competing to succeed Livingston in the deeply
conservative, reliably Republican 1st Congressional District, a
swath of suburbs and farmland north of New Orleans. And for those
who would like Duke simply to disappear, he offers this bit of
encouragement: if he loses, he has no plans to run again.
</P>
<P>
   With Duke drawing only 12 percent in his 1996 race for the U.S.
Senate, many political analysts doubt he can finish first or second
in Saturday's open primary and advance to an all-but-certain runoff
May 29. They believe he has been marginalized by a field that is so
conservative that one of its more moderate members, front-runner
David Treen, advocates the public execution of drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that once set Duke apart, like affirmative action,
immigration and welfare, have been appropriated by mainstream
Republicans. His rants about black inferiority and Jewish power
have worn thin, and their appeal has been diluted by declining
joblessness and crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   But some strategists say that strange things can happen in a
race with such a large field, and that history demonstrates that
Duke should not be underestimated. That message has not been lost
on the national Republican leaders who must protect the party's
narrow congressional majority in next year's elections. If Duke
wins, they acknowledge, every Republican candidate in 2000 can
expect Democratic advertisements that meld their faces into that of
a white-hooded klansman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will become our Y2KKK problem,'' said Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, the Republican dean of Louisiana's congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears help explain why a number of prominent Republicans
have tried, with only partial success, to forge a consensus around
the 70-year-old Treen. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, has joined Livingston and Tauzin in backing Treen, a former
governor and congressman. Playing on the district's concern about
the loss of Livingston's 21 years of seniority, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert has declared that he would try to give Treen credit
for his previous seven years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's outcome, therefore, should provide clues about how
far to the right the rightest of the Republican South is leaning at
a time when the party's presidential candidates are beginning to
hunt for traction.
</P>
<P>
   It also may speak to the state of racial politics in Louisiana.
Voting was deeply polarized along racial lines in the 1995
gubernatorial election, when M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, a white
Republican businessman, defeated Cleo Fields, a black Democratic
congressman. Foster is expected to have an equally easy re-election
campaign this year against Rep. William Jefferson, a black liberal
Democrat from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The glass ceiling for black politicians in Louisiana, where 68
percent of registered voters are white, is sufficiently low that
the popular black mayor of New Orleans, Marc Morial, is exploring
the possibility of amending the city charter so he can run for a
third term. ``He has no place else to go,'' said Susan Howell, a
political scientist at the University of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Treen, the first Louisiana Republican since Reconstruction to be
elected to Congress or the governorship, is widely favored to
finish first Saturday, but without the majority needed to avoid a
runoff. The other Republicans vying for a spot are Monica Monica, a
free-spending ophthalmologist who says her father loved her so much
that he named her twice; David Vitter, a telegenic young state
legislator and Rhodes Scholar; Rob Couhig, the owner of the New
Orleans Zephyrs minor league baseball team, and Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The only serious Democratic candidate in the race is Bill
Strain, a state representative who is considered as conservative as
his Republican counterparts. The list of less viable candidates
includes Patrick Landry, an electrician who is campaigning as a
33-year-old virgin, an interesting approach given that Livingston
forfeited the speakership when Hustler magazine threatened to
expose his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Monica and Vitter are considered leading contenders for the
second runoff spot, and the two have thrown a barrage of negative
advertisements at each other. She has pumped nearly $1 million into
her campaign, and has outspent Vitter and Treen by more than 2 to
1.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are ideologically similar, but Treen's age has
pushed the issue of term limits to the fore. Vitter was the author
of Louisiana's 1995 law that limits legislators to three four-year
terms, but refuses to take a voluntary pledge to restrict his stay
in Congress. Dr. Monica has pledged to serve only three terms and
has criticized Vitter as a term-limits hypocrite. Vitter counters
that he is the only leading contender who can build the kind of
seniority enjoyed by Livingston. Dr. Monica, he said, has limited
her own tenure while Treen may be ``limited biologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Duke critics believe that the warfare between Dr. Monica
and Vitter may hurt both candidates, and therefore help Duke. While
many national Republican leaders have denounced Duke, they note
that Foster and a number of other leading Louisiana Republicans
refuse to do so. Indeed, Couhig is the only candidate who has made
a public show of repudiating Duke's views.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the back booth of a Mandeville Waffle House,
where Duke devoured a late lunch of four fried eggs, grits and
toast, the candidate said that the 1st District has ``perfect
demographics'' for him. Eighty-five percent of the district's
registered voters are white, and Duke won well over half of the
white vote in his unsuccessful races for the U.S. Senate in 1990
and for governor in 1991. His biggest electoral success came in the
heart of the district, Metarie, which elected him its state
representative in a 1989 a race against Treen's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's candidacy coincides with the release of his
self-published book, ``My Awakening,'' a 736-page tract that calls
for an Aryan resurgence and the establishment of ``optional
separate homelands'' for minorities. His television advertisements
criticize the depiction of Malcolm X on a postage stamp, the recent
change of the name of a New Orleans elementary school from George
Washington to that of a black doctor, and prohibitions against
singing Christmas carols in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is out, Kwanza is in,'' Duke says in one
advertisement. ``We're clearly in a fight for our heritage.''

   FORT STEWART, Ga. _ Gunner Jeff ``Bear'' Martin relaxes with a
cup of cold cocoa while mechanics try to repair the turret of his
Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Though his trigger finger is itchy, Bear knows how to hibernate
in the classic military hurry-up-and-wait sense. The 13-year Marine
Corps member, who served in Desert Storm, knows how to fight, too.
</P>
<P>
   Broad-shouldered and barrel-chested, the Gainesville native
didn't say how he got his nickname, but it fits him. He likes the
moniker. It's on his business card from St. Ives Coffee Roasters,
where he works as a sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the citizen soldiers of the Georgia National
Guard's 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Martin is at Fort
Stewart preparing for a conflict that now seems far away. The 48th
is a desert-trained outfit and not likely to be called early even
if the fighting in Kosovo escalates.
</P>
<P>
   The 48th's annual training started Saturday at the base near
Hinesville. Scheduled for more than a year, it is unrelated to
events in Kosovo. Yet the conflict there lends a heightened
awareness for these soldiers that they are always a phone call away
for deployment. Everyone in the 48th Brigade knows situations can
change quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of regular Army advisors, they are
conducting field operations, planning attacks on ``enemy''
positions and setting up mock field hospitals to care for
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   During three weeks of training, more than 4,000 citizen soldiers
of the 48th Infantry will rotate through this 280,000-acre Army
base.
</P>
<P>
   They will operate awesome M1A1 tanks and deadly Bradleys, the
most sophisticated fighting machines ever built. They will blow
holes in moving targets and blast craters in the sandy hills of
Fort Stewart's artillery range with huge howitzers and powerful
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   They will come away from the experience not ready to fight, but
a little better prepared, said brigade Deputy Commander Tommy
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   If the standard for training soldiers to fight is 90 days, the
intent of this training is to get a head start, perhaps knocking 15
days off the necessary preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Macon, the 48th Infantry is the largest unit in
the Georgia National Guard. It is made up of units from 40
communities throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer soldiers' reasons for serving in the Guard are as
varied as their careers outside the military. Some love the
military lifestyle. Some just like the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Don Carpenter, a mess sergeant with 29 years of service in
the Army and Guard, works for the Savannah Water Department.
</P>
<P>
   Cook Gloria Sutton of Hinesville, a veteran of desert warfare in
the Desert Storm and Desert Shield operations, cleans homes for a
living and hopes for better.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ray Reid of Snellville commands an M1A1 tank for
Canton-based Delta Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pull the trigger, it's a lot of fun,'' said Reid, a
Guardsman for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing a video game,'' said gunner Gerard Link,
``except you don't have to put in quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these men and women of the 48th were left behind when
other units deployed to fight in Desert Storm. And they're still
feeling the stigma of being labeled ``unready'' to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us still have a bad taste in our mouths, but we don't
blame the army. A lot of it was politics,'' said Capt. Paul
Schmutzler, the Bravo Company commander.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of those in summer training here, Schmutzler doesn't
relish the idea of going to war.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I would love for us to get the opportunity to go
and do what we are trained to do.

NBC OFFERS BUYOUTS TO SOME EMPLOYEES AS AFFILIATES FACE PRESSURE
FROM NETWORKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC &UR;  &LR; is offering financial buyouts to all 20 members of its
affiliate relations department, a move network executives said was
part of a long-term strategy to redefine NBC's relationship with
its affiliated stations.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC executives said the buyouts were also meant to achieve
budget reduction goals set by the network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, which is owned by General Electric, &UR;  &LR; is not eliminating the
affiliate department, Bob Wright, the president of NBC, emphasized,
and the network does not expect all 20 employees to accept the
buyout. NBC executives would not say how many executives they
expect to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Scanlon, the executive vice president for employee
relations for NBC, said, ``If not as many as we expect take the
buyout, there will be some layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as the networks, struggling to be profitable, are
trying to adjust their relationships to the affiliates. Walt
Disney's ABC &UR;  &LR; angered its affiliates when it announced plans to
start a soap opera cable channel using programs previously
available exclusively to its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a subsidiary of News Corp., &UR;  &LR; enraged its affiliates when it
announced plans to reclaim for its own use more than 20 percent of
the commercial time the stations had previously sold.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives met in New York Wednesday with executives from
several of its biggest station group owners, including Tribune
Broadcasting, Sinclair Broadcasting and Meredith Broadcasting,
trying to work out a deal that might put its switch in commercial
time into affect without the input of any of the smaller stations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox stations have openly discussed some alternatives if Fox goes
through with its plans, even leaving Fox for some other network.
The two new and smaller networks, Time Warner's WB and UPN, which
is owned by Viacom and Chris-Craft, have been actively courting
disaffected Fox affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon said NBC's decision to reduce its affiliate relations
department was connected to the network's conviction that
``affiliation is going to be done in a different way in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said that NBC's decision to pare down its affiliate
relations department was mainly part of the network's continuing
effort ``to try to reduce our costs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that the network-affiliate relationship was in
the midst of an overhaul at every network which would leave the
system significantly changed in the next two to five years. The
current contracts between networks and affiliates will be ending
over that period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes NBC is aiming for is reduction or elimination
of the fees, called compensation, that the network pays to stations
for carrying its shows. Wright said that only the smallest stations
truly needed compensation to help their profits and yet large
stations received the most money. ``Compensation is like social
security,'' Wright said. ``Some people need it but other don't.
It's an entitlement without necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the larger question of how all of these changes might affect
network-affiliate relationships, Wright said most of the stations
``have no place to go.'' He said that unlike a few years ago, when
many stations jumped networks, few stations were likely to find it
attractive to switch networks now.
</P>
<P>
   `'I think it's unlikely that our affiliates will go somewhere
else, just as it's unlikely most Fox affiliates will join UPN,''
Wright said. &QL;

MARKET PLACE: CARNAGE AT MCKESSON HBOC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is sure to become fodder for shareholder
groups who oppose frequent mergers, McKesson HBOC Inc., the
nation's largest drug wholesaler, announced Wednesday that it would
restate earnings for the last four quarters after discovering
improperly recorded sales from its recently acquired software
business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors promptly dropped the stock. Shares of McKesson plunged
47.5 percent, or $31.25, on Wednesday, to $34.50, a new 52-week
low. Some investors had suspected that McKesson had troubles and in
the last few weeks had been buying up huge volumes of put options,
or bets that the stock would decline.
</P>
<P>
   While stock analysts had expressed some reservations about
McKesson's $13.9 billion acquisition in January of HBO and Co., the
largest supplier of patient monitoring systems, the carnage
Wednesday caught them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While ratcheting down its fourth-quarter earnings, McKesson also
shaved 16.6 percent from its per-share earnings goal for fiscal
2000 and announced that further revisions were possible as the
company's audit progressed. McKesson now expects to earn $2.50 a
share in 2000, far below analysts' consensus of $2.94, according to
First Call Corp., which tracks corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened at McKesson HBOC may take months to
unravel fully. The company said Wednesday that it had discovered
$26.2 million in transactions during the fourth quarter and another
$16 million in the other three quarters that had been booked as
sales when they had not been fully completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``HBO put so much pressure on their sales people,'' said Kenneth
Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ``They may have
been stretched for results. I'm sure they had agreements with these
accounts. The sales here on some of these may just be delayed by
six to nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the sales contracts that McKesson discounted were
over simple problems. A typical situation would have a client's
chief information officer making a deal that had to be approved by
the company's board, said Larry Kurtz, a spokesman for McKesson. If
the board had yet to approve the contract, the sale was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The setback was enough for McKesson to lower its fourth-quarter
earnings per diluted share Wednesday to a 27-cent loss and earnings
for fiscal 1999 of 75 cents. This came less than a week after
McKesson announced a fourth-quarter loss of $60.4 million, or 22
cents per diluted share. For the year, McKesson had net income of
$237.1 million, or 84 cents per diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the discovery of McKesson's unearned sales raised more
troubling questions. Analysts feared that when the audit was fully
completed, McKesson, which is based in San Francisco, would have to
lower its earnings in several more quarters. But a company
spokesman said this was unlikely because the audit is only for four
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that worry, it was especially troubling to have the
sales error involve HBO. That some of HBO's sales could have been
inflated, even accidentally, made analysts worry that McKesson may
have paid too much for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder with this accounting procedure in place
since December '98, if this could not have been uncovered sooner,''
said Christopher McFadden, an analyst with First Union Capital
Markets. ``There has been a lot of negative sentiment about the
McKesson and HBO acquisition. HBO was so aggressive in their
acquisitions. There was some speculation whether they had done all
their homework.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for companies to restate earnings for periods
longer than several quarters. CUC International Inc. uncovered fake
sales on its books last year after it had merged with HFS Inc., a
hotel franchiser. The combined company, Cendant Corp., was forced
to restate earnings back to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson appears to have detected the sales discrepancies during
its routine year-end audit. According to analysts, McKesson's
accounting firm, Deloitte &AMP; Touche, mailed a survey to several
clients asking for the amount they had actually purchased from the
company. Several of the amounts returned by clients did not match
what HBO had recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Deloitte &AMP; Touche declined to comment about
McKesson's audit. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co., HBO's
auditor, also declined to comment but said the accounting giant was
cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were especially interested in the chronology of the
audit. While the volume of puts traded for McKesson had been thin
during the months before Wednesday's announcement of the restated
earnings, huge volumes were traded within the last six weeks. On
March 15, for example, 500 put contracts were traded and on April
16, another 1,424 contracts were traded. A put investor is betting
that McKesson's stock will fall.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday if McKesson's accounting error would
invite scrutiny from federal investigators. The Security and
Exchange Commission declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more trouble appears to be imminent. One New York law firm,
Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &AMP; Herz, announced Wednesday that it
was filing a class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California for shareholders of McKesson HBOC.
The lawsuit seeks to recoup damages from McKesson's fallen stock.

MEDICAL GROUP SETS STANDARDS FOR `PHYSICIAN PROFILING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Growing enthusiasm for ``physician profiling'' _
measuring doctors' performance _ has got the Massachusetts Medical
Society worried.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000-member group Wednesday published a set of criteria it
says should govern what kind of data are collected on physicians'
quality of care, and how it should be shared with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public release issue is huge,'' the Medical Society said
in its 40-page report.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society has no power to enforce its proposed
standards. Officials of the group said they hope to get health
plans, insurers, hospitals, employer groups and others interested
in profiling doctors' performance to agree voluntarily to adopt its
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Stason, a cardiologist who led the effort, said it
is not an attempt to block public disclosure of physician
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we release information, it's got to be thoroughly
justified in terms of its accuracy and statistical significance,
because physicians will object to the release of information that
is not well-founded,'' Stason said. ``But you can't hide behind a
shield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should receive reports that are relevant to
choosing a physician, health plan, or hospital,'' the Medical
Society report said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report said, consumers might be told of
doctors' performance in controlling high blood pressure, preventing
post-surgical wound infections, patients' timely access to needed
care, and patients' satisfaction with the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Medical Society's nine ``principles'' on physician
profiling pertain to disclosure of the results.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report asserts that data released to the
public must meet ``especially high standards of accuracy, validity,
relevance, and clarity.'' There should also be ample opportunity
for doctors to screen public reports before their release, the
Medical Society said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on individual doctors' performance should be distributed
only on a ``need to know'' basis, the report says, but adds ``a
clear definition of this phrase. . .is elusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Often individual physicians do not have enough cases to allow
statistically meaningful conclusions about their performance, he
said. But when they do, or when groups of physicians have
sufficient cases, ``I personally see no reason to embargo those
data,'' Stason said.
</P>
<P>
   Stason said the emphasis on high-quality data and review should
not become an excuse to block or delay information that helps
consumers choose a physician or a health plan. ``We need to apply
the best the current state of the art permits but not hide behind
perfection,'' he said.

 &HT;    Women pilots, like men, are ready with an 'attack mind-set'
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTER ARMY AIRFIELD, Ga. _ Sitting in the front seat of her
Apache attack helicopter, U.S. Army 1st Lt. Marla Bradbury looks
this way and that through an infrared monocle attached to her
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-controlled 30 mm cannon mounted on the chopper's
belly follows her head movements. It is aimed and ready.
</P>
<P>
   When she spots an ``enemy,'' the 5-foot-2-inch Boston University
graduate can unleash an awesome arsenal _ enough to annihilate an
entire company of enemy tanks or level a couple of city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four Apache helicopters have been deployed to the Balkans
for combat in the Kosovo crisis. The technology they represent has
taken the brute out of ``brute force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly a buttons game,'' said the 24-year-old
Californian.
</P>
<P>
   But pushing the buttons has devastating results. In practice
firing, entire boulders disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhilarating,'' Bradbury admitted. ``I get a burst of
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury and Chief Warrant Officer-2 Catherine R. Jung are the
only two women pilots assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment at
Hunter Army Airfield near Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Both women fly the front seat of the two-seat Apaches, and
although they can fly the aircraft from that position, they are
primarily responsible for locating targets and firing weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Their physical size and strength are not an issue, their
commanders said. At 5 feet 5 inches, Jung is about the same stature
as her battalion executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Women have been allowed to fly in combat roles only since 1992.
They still cannot participate in ground combat roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches that Bradbury and Jung fly are designed primarily to
support ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its cannon, each Apache carries 38 rockets that can hit
a target from four miles away. But the helicopters' biggest weapons
are 16 laser-guided Hellfire missiles. The Hellfire is an anti-tank
missile that proved itself in the 1991 war for Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The two women pilots, the first in this unit's history, compare
the high-tech point-and-shoot practice to video games they played
as children _ except that you can feel the power of these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes you aback,'' Jung said. ``You feel the recoil of the
gun. It's a pretty awesome sight at night because you can see the
muzzle fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Jung was aiming for ``top gun'' honors in a recent training
exercise, but lost on the final night. She came in third out of 24
chopper pilots in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury was in the middle of the pack. Some defective rockets,
she suspected, held down her score.
</P>
<P>
   The women said they have few problems getting along with the
male pilots. There's competition, sure, but it's friendly and they
are as gung-ho as their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for other women, but I don't think we're any
different than any of the men,'' said the 28-year-old Jung.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, being female offers them no advantages in the
Army either, the women said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury is thinking of leaving the Army because she can't get
enough flying time: There are more senior men pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Jung and Bradbury haven't flown combat missions, and their unit
probably won't be sent to the Balkans unless things escalate
rapidly over there. But both women said they're ready and would
have no problem pushing the buttons against live targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mission, just like any other job,'' said Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to be involved in a shooting war, Bradbury said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (if) I got over there, I'm going to kill them before they
kill me,'' she said. ``I just have an attack mind-set.

GOOD READ OFFERS GLOBAL WARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Few writers have capably painted the issue of
global environment. Some sketch in a few trees, but journalist Mark
Hertsgaard has crafted a veritable masterpiece from comprehensive
research during travels to 19 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth Odyssey'' (Broadway Books; $26) is a trek around the
world to witness the problems in developed countries and developing
nations alike. He frames the issues cohesively, tying in growth
with environmental devastation, connecting the woes of rich and
poor with global warming. That he sometimes takes leaps of faith to
present dire predictions of what might happen is nearly forgivable
given the sweep of the book and powerful, irresistible journalistic
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard's visits to ground zero of devastation are
beautifully rendered; one can almost smell the stench of
industrializing China and cringe at nuclear accident-prone Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It's like getting a bucket of cold _ and polluted _ water thrown
in your face. Deforestation in Brazil. Population explosions in
India. Poverty, tainted water, desertification, war and government
corruption in Africa. Overconsumption and addiction to the
automobile in North America, Europe and Japan. Food shortages in
many third-world counties. And, of course, the grim warnings about
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   While none can doubt the reality of the problems presented, the
conclusions Hertsgaard reaches are debatable.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the 372-page book, the Washington, D.C., author
ponders whether humankind will survive the next hundred years.
Except for the obvious danger of nuclear catastrophe, it's hard to
see how even a combination of disasters would result in extinction.
The more likely scenario is a series of terrible plagues that would
devastate parts of Africa and perhaps Asia. Population growth,
flooding, shrinking coastlines, food shortages _ a combination
could wipe out whole areas. Rich countries with a better handle on
such difficulties will be less impacted.
</P>
<P>
   The book offers opinion, makes readers think and stirs emotion,
and those are the ingredients of a good read. Our rating: { &QL;

<P>
   Legends like river runner Buzz Holmstrom are the focus of great
yarns destined to be regaled around campfires for decades to come.
And, like many legends, many of those tales are just smoke.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably as many diverging stories about Holmstrom as
there are tributaries of the Colorado _ a river the Coquille, Ore.,
native conquered as a solo boater in 1937, the first time the
navigation feat had been accomplished. Like Glen and Bessie Hyde _
honeymooners who rode the Colorado and only their boat was found _
he has achieved cult status among the fraternity of river runners.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Holmstrom's diaries, letters and remembrances of
people who knew him well helps unravel the mysterious character in
``The Doing of the Thing: The Brief Brilliant Whitewater Career of
Buzz Holmstrom'' (Fretwater Press; $20) by Vince Welch, Cort Conley
and Brad Dimock.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy widow hired him in 1939 to take her the length of the
continent via waterways; he joined two boats that followed the
Columbia, Snake, Yellowstone, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio,
Allegheny, Erie Canal and Hudson. Then he killed himself in 1946 at
the age of 37, shocking his friends and family members. For many
years, wild theories held sway _ he argued with a cook, who shot
him, or died as a result of a terrible accident.
</P>
<P>
   The 290-page book shows a darker side of Holmstrom. He loved
challenging rivers but returned back home frustrated and restless,
always planning his next adventure. After looking upon the Colorado
``like a friend, a companion'' and believing that the river claimed
a part of him, he confessed ``everything seems kind of empty.'' The
authors describe his reaction as ``withdrawal from the incredible
elation of the River.'' It's no great surprise that the tedium of
work could not match his river treks.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of the title is that it tells the story with little
intrusion. Our rating:

 &HT;    Quayle wary of new gun laws
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle, in Atlanta to raise
money for his presidential campaign, said Wednesday that President
Clinton is ``playing politics'' by proposing new gun control laws
in response to the massacre at a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming for the support of social conservatives, Quayle said
anti-gun measures are simple answers to a complex problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think this is primarily an issue about guns or
primarily about values?'' Quayle asked the nonpartisan Georgia
Public Policy Foundation. Quayle made it clear he would choose the
latter.
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, he emphasized his doubts about the
efficacy of enacting new gun control laws, saying that Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris, the two gunmen at Columbine High School,
broke 17 laws in their murderous attack on schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are a few more laws out there going to make a difference?''
Quayle said. ``I'm not sure they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quayle said he would be open to a law that prohibited
kids who commit firearms violations from ever owning a gun.
</P>
<P>
   And asked about a federal proposal to limit purchasers of
handguns to one a month, Quayle said, ``I'd have to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who is struggling to distinguish himself from a
half-dozen GOP candidates, issued a strong statement following the
high school shootings that warned gun control advocates not to try
to take advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Quayle has talked about parental involvement and
responsibility, although it is unclear what kind of relationship
Klebold and Harris had with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the teen-age years of his children, Quayle said he and
his wife, Marilyn, imposed curfews. ``Literally, you've got to get
in their face a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spoke to 200 people at the foundation luncheon, one in a
series featuring presidential candidates. He also held a private
fund-raising reception.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Sen. Mack Mattingly, a fellow Indiana native and
national co-chairman of Quayle's campaign, introduced the former
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, Quayle drew scattered applause when he criticized
Clinton for getting the United States involved in what he called a
civil war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has called for a negotiated settlement, which he defended
as the only way out of a situation in which U.S. vital security
interests are not at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian treatment of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is
``outrageous,'' Quayle said. ``But does that mean you're going to
get involved in a civil war? I would say no.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to point up his experience in foreign affairs,
saying the country cannot afford another president who needs
``on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   That line apparently referred to the leading Republican
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spoke more directly about Bush in the interview when he
joked, ``He's got to come out of Texas sometime. Sometime this
year, I presume.''

FIRING OF DEPUTY LEADER BLURS SIGNALS FROM YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, who publicly
criticized Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the weekend
for not telling his people the truth about the war in Kosovo, was
fired Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice of reason has now been put out,'' said Vuk Draskovic,
who was once the leader of Yugoslavia's main nationalist opposition
party.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic had said on Serbian television that Milosevic should
tell his people victory over NATO was impossible and that the
Yugoslav president should accept a UN security force to enforce a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   His words were widely seen either as an indirect peace
initiative by Milosevic or as a sign of a fissure within his
regime. Draskovic's dismissal Wednesday tended to dampen both
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Belgrade's
position on ``the key points'' has not changed enough ``to justify
any overwhelming optimism or any optimism at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin quoted several political figures in Serbia, mainly
opposition party officials who have spoken out against Milosevic in
recent days. However, he said, ``Whether that will signal a change
in his policies . . . is anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   --Several countries stepped up diplomatic efforts to settle the
conflict, most notably Russia. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy
to the Balkans, is expected in Belgrade Thursday. Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said the discussions will focus on what kind of
international force should enforce a peace settlement inside
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, traveling in
Berlin, said NATO and Russia were close to an agreement on this
issue. But he added, ``We have not heard anything from Belgrade''
that Milosevic might go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic alliance insists that NATO be ``at the core'' of
such a force, even if troops from non-NATO countries are also
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojse Vujevic, said
Wednesday that a peacekeeping mission must be ``nonarmed'' and
``under United Nations protection.'' He also said NATO must
withdraw its forces from Kosovo's borders before any such mission
moved in. NATO officials have dismissed both ideas as unacceptable,
noting that Kosovar refugees would not come back unless they were
protected by NATO arms.
</P>
<P>
   --White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton does
not support the Rev. Jesse Jackson's trip to Yugoslavia to try and
free the three US soldiers who were captured March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the risk when Milosevic hears from multiple voices that
the message is not clear,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger met with
Jackson Wednesday, to reinforce the point that ``this is a private
mission'' and is ``not one we support,'' Lockhart said. Jackson
left Wednesday night, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The three prisoners, who had recent visits from International
Red Cross officials, were allowed to fax messages to their families
for the first time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton, speaking in the Rose Garden, reiterated that NATO's
airstrikes will continue as long as necessary. With the impending
arrival of extra warplanes in the region, he said, ``We will be
flying arond the clock, at lower altitudes, from all directions.''
He also said the weather should be getting better, allowing for
more persistent bombing. ``The weather is better in May than in
April, better in June than in May, better in July than in June,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also restated, in a White House meeting with
congressional leaders, that the air campaign alone would accomplish
NATO's goals. Senator John F. Kerry said after the meeting that
Clinton assured them that if US ground troops ever were sent in, he
would first ask Congress for approval, just as President Bush did
before sending troops to push Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters he saw some signs that Milosevic might be
losing his grip, citing the much-reported disagreements within
Yugoslavia, then adding, ``There are some things that we know that
I think I should not comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   --In a further expansion of the air war's resources, Bulgaria,
which borders Serbia, formally agreed to let NATO warplanes use its
air space in exchange for NATO guarantees of Bulgarian security.
</P>
<P>
   --Two grenades were tossed from a moving car into a NATO supply
depot manned by French troops near Skopje, Macedonia, early
Wednesday morning. Nobody was hurt, but the action heightened
concerns about Western soldiers' security and the possibility of
the conflict expanding outside Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   --Ethnic Albanian refugees continued to stream across the Kosovo
border, raising the total to well over a half-million.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, Clinton's humanitarian aid coordinator,
expressed concern that Milosevic might push all the remaining
Albanians out of Kosovo in the coming weeks, which would add
another 800,000 people to the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the overcrowding in Albanian and Macedonian refugee
camps has ``reached a breaking point,'' the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees declared in a public statement. ``Tensions are on the
rise'' and the ``health and sanitation situation is quickly
deteriorating, leading to fears of the oubreak of epidemics'' once
warmer weather arrives. Measles, respiratory infections, and other
diseases are already breaking out at a rate that emergency vaccine
programs can barely cope with.
</P>
<P>
   Over 22,000 of the refugees have been evacuated to other
countries, mainly in Europe. The 20,000 to be accepted in the
United States should be leaving in the next few weeks. However,
Atwood said he was ``not satisfied'' that other countries are
fulfilling their commitment to accept another 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six refugees were killed, and another seven were injured
Wednesday when they strayed into a minefield while approaching the
Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials acknowledged that a stray GBU-10 laser-guided
bomb, dropped Monday by an F-15, slammed into a residential area in
the Serbian town of Surdulica. Belgrade authorities, calling the
attack ``barbaric,'' said 16 civilian Serbs were killed. They also
said 400 have been killed, and 4,000 injured, through the five
weeks of NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, while regretting the incident, said
these numbers could not be confirmed. Given that NATO attack planes
have flown 4,500 sorties to date, Shea said, the number of errant
bombs has been phenomenally low.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the cause of the
mistake was unclear. However, it is well known that clouds, smoke,
or fog can diffuse, refract, or otherwise distort a laser beam.
Since the bomb follows the beam, such conditions could cause the
bomb to go astray. According to some reports, the stray weapon was
the third bomb dropped on the target and may have been deflected by
the smoke sent up by the two earlier explosions.

KRAFT HAS MANY OUTS TO HARTFORD DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connecticut, eager to lure the New England Patriots to
Hartford last year, gave team owner Robert Kraft many conditions
under which he could walk away from the $374 million stadium deal
without paying a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The escape clauses, negotiated by Kraft into the 300-plus page
contract, take on crucial importance now that Massachusetts
lawmakers have agreed to a plan that has a shot at keeping the team
in Foxborough, even though it is significantly less lucrative than
Hartford's.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Connecticut deal, Kraft would have to
formally break off negotiations with Connecticut to consider the
Bay State bid. According to a review of the publicly available
contract signed by Gov. John G. Rowland and Kraft, that won't be
hard. Or expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Until May 2 there is only one penalty included in the accored _
a maximum $2 million fine _ that is Connecticut's ``sole and
exclusive right and remedy'' for any potential breach of contract.
After that date, penalties would increase depending on how much the
state has expended on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Before May 2, Kraft would have to pay only if he failed to honor
his agreement to negotiate exclusively with Connecticut or did not
show ``good faith'' in trying to complete details of the proposed
stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   But because of delays in assembling the Hartford stadium site,
and serious questions about the state's ability to clean up the
property and deliver it on time and on budget, Kraft appears to
have ample grounds to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contact, the Patriots can terminate the agreement
without any penalty if, in the team's ``sole and absolute
discretion,'' the state's interim report, delivered last month,
fails to ``demonstrate sufficient progress'' in moving the steam
plant currently located the proposed stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   The May 2 deadline also allows the team to call it quits if the
report ``does not provide sufficient assurances that the site,
scope, cost, timing or funding'' of the project, and necessary
infrastructure improvements, can be completed in time for the team
to move into the stadium by August 2002.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues have dogged Connecticut from the start.
Connecticut has not yet reached a final agreement on moving the
steam plant, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Key soil tests began just days ago, and results won't be
available for weeks, making it hard to determine whether the state
can clean up the site in time and on budget by the 2002 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about the project's infrastructure
budget. Construction experts, for example, are concerned that the
state may not be able to hang a portion of the 68,000-seat stadium
over a highway as planned without going over budget. And a change
in stadium design would also cause further delays.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has not negotiated the required sublease with the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The May 2 deadline is the most obvious window of opportunity,
although the contract is littered with other ``escape hatches''
with varying deadlines. The later exit dates come with varying
degress of risk, however, and carry damages that would be decided
in a Connecitcut court.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months or so, there are a number of other things
Connecticut must do, almost none of which have been completed.
These items include plans for:
</P>
<P>
   -- Preliminary stadium design agreements
</P>
<P>
   -- A project timetable and master coordination plan
</P>
<P>
   -- A site survey
</P>
<P>
   -- Site clean up and preparation
</P>
<P>
   -- Relocation of sewer and utility lines
</P>
<P>
   -- Stadium project budget
</P>
<P>
   -- Infrastructure improvements
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also protected if the other NFL owners refuse
to approve the team's proposed move from Foxborough to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has formally submitted his application for the move, but
team owners are expected to approve it only if Massachusetts fails
to deliver an alternative proposal.

AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MAGAZINE EDITORS HANDS OUT ITS AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.) (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the world of psychotherapy, at
Wednesday's National Magazine Awards it seemed at times that the
magazine world was trying to reach closure on the issue that
dominated magazine covers over the last year: the presidential
intern.
</P>
<P>
   While the lunch opened with a pair of Broadway actors singing
Monica Lewinsky-specific ditties, the tone later turned sober. The
American Society of Magazine Editors gave Newsweek the award for
reporting, for three articles about the intern and President
Clinton _ ``Clinton and the Intern,'' ``The Secret War'' and ``The
Tripp Trap?'' _ by the reporter Michael Isikoff and the Washington
editor, Evan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen B. Shepard, the editor in chief of Business Week
magazine, was inducted into the Society's Hall of Fame _ along with
longtime former Scientific American editor Dennis Flanagan _ and
made pointed remarks about the culture of ``buzz'' and how
magazines can potentially sink to the ``lowest common
denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age when it is fashionable to trash the media,''
Shepard said. However, he added, ``in an era of Matt Drudge, it is
possible to be provocative and successful without being trivial and
trashy.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards luncheon, sponsored by the magazine society and
administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism, hosted a record attendance of almost 1,500 guests. At
the ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, images from the scandal
_ like Ms. Lewinsky's Vanity Fair photo spread and a provocative
New Yorker cover featuring a presidential lower half surrounded by
microphones _ flitted across the video screens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the winners _ and losers _ were notable. The New Yorker,
which had been nominated for eight awards, received none. Saveur
and Esquire, both nominated for three awards, and GQ, nominated for
one, did not win any.
</P>
<P>
   In the feature writing category, The American Scholar _ a
quarterly with a circulation of under 100,000 published by the Phi
Beta Kappa Society in Washington _ beat out GQ, Esquire and The New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford American _ a cultural bimonthly magazine published in
Oxford, Miss. (the magazine's publisher is John Grisham, the
thriller writer) _ beat competitors like The New Yorker and
Business Week for the award of best single-category issue.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the ASME gave an award for General
Excellence in New Media: the online version of Cigar Aficionado
beat TheStreet.com, Slate, People Online and TheStandard.com, the
online version of The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a complete list of National Magazine Award winners: &QL;
</P>
<P>

DOWNLOADED SECRET CODES ARE RECIPE FOR ATOMIC WEAPONS, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-NUKE) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The secret computer codes that were downloaded into a nonsecure
computer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and that federal
experts fear were given to China are the distillation of more than
a half-century of research on how to perfect nuclear weapons,
experts in and out of government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Using the programs, which calculate step by step how a bomb
explodes, they said, weapons designers could produce simulations of
nuclear explosions realistic enough to check the feasibility of new
designs before taking the costly step of testing arms in actual
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   At their most basic level, the codes are equations rooted in the
laws of physics, which are taught in high school and college. But
added layers of hard-won tricks and lore turn the codes into
informational gems, spelling out, for instance, not only how
nuclear weapons can be constructed, but also how they can be made
smaller, lighter and more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stunning revelation,'' said Dr. Matthew McKinzie, a
former Los Alamos researcher now at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms. ``It's the
distillation of 50 years of work, over 1,000 nuclear tests and
thousands upon thousands of man-hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days when the designers of nuclear bombs liked nothing
better than unleashing the atom's power in huge explosions
literally felt halfway around the globe, the scientists first
conducted mathematical calculations to try to insure that their
creations would not be costly duds and embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   Over 50 years, experts said, that work yielded 100 or so
advanced computer programs, about as many as there are types of
nuclear warheads in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Those secrets, known as the ``legacy codes,'' consist of
millions of lines of computer instructions that detail the physical
principles at the heart of U.S. atomic warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The secrets are now at the center of a political firestorm.
Federal officials assert that a scientist suspected of spying for
China improperly transferred large parts of the codes from a
computer system at the Los Alamos, N.M., lab, potentially giving
away the secrets of virtually every weapon in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Downloaded as well, federal and lab officials said, were data on
the materials and shapes of parts that make up specific weapons
designs. Someone who put all that data together could create
virtual blueprints of the nuclear explosive parts of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the codes are highly complex, because they mimic how
colossal forces of nature alter materials _ for instance, how
temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun and pressures
greater than at the center of the Earth can transform dense metals
at the heart of a bomb into hot fluidlike plasmas in a split
second.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, federal scientists said, the codes allowed
computerized dry runs that checked the feasibility of designs
before millions of dollars were spent to build and test a new
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were used to decide whether a particular design was worth
testing,'' said Dr. Randy Christensen, a bomb-code physicist at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, one of three
national labs that developed nuclear arms and now maintain them. In
recent years, with the advent of the ban on nuclear testing, the
codes have been used as a substitute for test explosions
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Alamos physicist who has worked extensively on bomb codes,
Dale Henderson, said, ``Computation is the only place where
everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   With computerized go-aheads, hundreds of underground nuclear
blasts rocked the test site in Nevada, a desolate expanse of desert
bigger than Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, when nuclear weapons flashed to life, scientists
struggled with side rules and crude computers to find the best way
of slamming together the critical mass of bomb fuel _ uranium 235
or plutonium 239 _ to make the chain reaction that released huge
bursts of energy.
</P>
<P>
   High explosives working at room temperature were fine to ignite
an atomic bomb, it turned out. But complexity soared in 1952 with
the advent of hydrogen bombs, which use an exploding atomic bomb as
a fiery sunlike torch to ignite deuterium and tritium, both heavy
forms of hydrogen that make up the fuel of a hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the computerized codes, developed with the
world's most powerful computers, were critical to perfect the first
hydrogen bombs and their numerous progeny, which today dominate the
world's nuclear arsenals. The first hydrogen bomb was 700 times
more powerful than the bomb that hit Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   The codes start with raw physics, scientists said, like the
equations that describe how X-rays that flash out of an atomic
blast interact with the fuel of the hydrogen bomb. Experts say what
goes into the modeling recipe is as important as what is left out
and ignored.
</P>
<P>
   A senior scientist at a nuclear-weapons lab who insisted on
anonymity likened the general recipes to building codes adopted by
communities to make sure that buildings are safe and sound.
``They're all the rules you have to apply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Added to those general rules are the architect's details of how
an individual house is to be built, height, shape, siding,
materials and plumbing and electrical systems, producing a plan
``so you end up with a house,'' the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and lab experts say such ``input data'' for specific
weapon types was included among the information downloaded at Los
Alamos. Such details include the shapes and sizes of bomb parts and
extensive data on the physical characteristics of nuclear
materials, which vary widely among the 100 or so designs that have
been in the nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The various designs are used to give the arsenal greater variety
in how the warheads could be deployed and launched and would vary
depending on the type of intended target like deeply fortified
bunkers, cites or missile sites.
</P>
<P>
   For newer weapons, the codes include large numbers of ad hoc
refinements and tricks gleaned from decades nuclear testing,
scientists said. Such improvements are informal rather than derived
from the laws of physics. Learned through trial and error, the
advances are needed because the science is insufficiently precise
to make computerized models of bomb-blast complexities in all their
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one way we've always compensated for not having perfect
science or infinitely powerful computers,'' said Christensen of
Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear-weapons physicist at Livermore, Dr. Ray Kidder, said
the combination of source code and input data was equivalent to a
scientific blueprint, allowing a bomb to be reverse-engineered,
analyzing the completed product. In theory, Kidder said, ``you
cannot only find out how it was done, but you can also improve the
weapon by running the code and changing some of the parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the design not spelled out in such computer data,
Kidder added, include the gadgets and conventional explosives that
help start the chain reaction, factors considered more or less
common in bomb design for 50 years.

REFLECTING UPON THE TROUT OPENER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ A few observations from the opening
weekend of trout fishing in the Eastern Sierra:
</P>
<P>
   Mystery solved: He registered for trout derbies in Bishop and
Toms Place as ``Uncle Bill's Barber Shop.'' So when calls were
placed to tournament headquarters late Saturday evening to inquire
the name of the angler who took the 10.35-pound brown trout at
Bridgeport Reservoir that was the opening-day's second largest
fish, all that newspapers could report was ``angler unidentified.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Tuesday that confirmation was made that the
mystery angler was Bill Kinzy, whose Bishop haircutting business on
Main Street was closed through Monday with a sign that read, ``Gone
fishing! Be back Tuesday. Uncle Bill''; the word ``Tuesday'' was
crossed out. Apparently he thought he would push his luck a little
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Not for anglers only: The trout opener also can be a pleasure
for Eastern Sierra residents who are working and rarely get a
chance to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like seeing the guys from the year before,'' said Lee McCoy,
proprietor of Falling Rock Marina situated on Bridgeport
Reservoir's east side. ``And my son (Lee of Gardnerville, Nev.)
comes and works with me opening weekend, and that's important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the period of a couple of days, 300 guys will call you by
your first name. It feels good. That's neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny stories: Deborah Paules of Simi Valley got some second
looks at her pink fishing rod and reel. ``Isn't it hideous?'' she
observed while bank-fishing at Upper Twin Lake out of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ron, bought it for her, but said: ``If she goes for
a drink and a fish hits, I won't touch it. Any self-respecting man
won't touch a pink fishing rod.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they don't get their fishing tackle mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a family was still chatting about a fishing pole that
was lost hours earlier when an overzealous trout took hook, line
and sinker; the outfit was caught a short time later by another
angler... with the offending trout still hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first guy was crying the blues,'' said Ron Paules, who
witnessed the sequence of events. ``Ten minutes later his buddy
says, `Guess what? I've got your pole and the fish is still on
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Paules wasn't so lucky last year; he lost a rod and reel
under similar conditions while fishing the same lake from a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Opener blastoff: At Crowley Lake, the most popular of
opening-day destinations, fireworks were set off at 5:10 a.m. to
signal the season's start in Mono County, replacing the traditional
pre-dawn flare.
</P>
<P>
   Second's best: Often overlooked by the opening-day's big fish at
Crowley Lake is the top catch of Day 2, which, in this case, was a
half-pound heavier than the first day's trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Yamasaki of Torrance on Sunday fooled a 6-pound, 5-ounce
rainbow at Sandy Point using a worm.
</P>
<P>
   Cold cuts: Anglers at Crowley on Saturday were subjected to
periods of snow that occasionally was blown sideways by gusts of
wind estimated at 25 mph or greater.
</P>
<P>
   Those gathering data at fish-cleaning stations near Crowley's
marina noticed that the cold weather might actually have
contributed to anglers attaining their five-trout limits as early
as 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't picking and choosing their fish as much,'' said
Curtis Milliron, as associated fishery biologist with the
Department of Fish and Game's office in Bishop. In other words, he
explained, anglers weren't as apt to throw back smaller fish in
hopes of catching larger ones... so they could get out of the
elements faster and into their trucks, car and campers.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Meanwhile at Crowley, Milliron crunched the
statistics that are gathered and analyzed for his annual
opening-weekend studies. The results from 423 rainbow trout
measured:
</P>
<P>
   Average length: 14.0 inches _ an inch longer than the norm, as
predicted, thanks to a mild winter that allowed the 300,000
rainbows planted in August and September to feed more actively
during the closed season.
</P>
<P>
   Average weight: 1.07 pounds, slightly above the long-term
average. Milliron had predicted even heavier fish _ 1.1 to 1.2
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Percent of carryovers: 17.5. The long-term average of trout
caught after surviving one or more fishing seasons is about 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Percent of brown trout in catch: 1; the biologist usually
expects 2 to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other results:
</P>
<P>
   Catch rates: 1.23 trout per hour Saturday for 574 anglers
interviewed. That means a five-fish limit was taken in 4.07 hours,
quicker than the average limit in 4.7 to 4.9 hours. Fishing was
even more productive Sunday, when 315 anglers caught 1.39 trout an
hour, or a limit in 3.6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The DFG's goal is a trout an hour, or a limit in five hours.
However, depending on the mildness or harshness of the winter,
respectively, limits have been taken in as short as 3.13 hours (at
1.6 trout per hour in 1992) and as long as 15.6 hours (at .32 trout
per hour following the late, late thaw of 1993, there weren't
enough hours of daylight to catch a limit).
</P>
<P>
   Lakewide catch estimates: 7,034 trout on Saturday, 6,355 Sunday,
for a two-day total of 13,389 fish _ 14,326 pounds or 7.16 tons.

ADMINISTRATION LIFTS BAN ON FOOD, MEDICINE SALES TO THREE
COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Wednesday lifted a ban
on the sale of food and medicine to three countries sanctioned for
being terrorist states, paving the way for Northwest farmers to
sell wheat to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Iran, the action also makes sales of food and
medicine possible to Libya and Sudan. In the future, President
Clinton wants to exclude food and medicine sanctions against any
country unless they are at war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Agriculture Department estimates that U.S.
exporters could sell as much as $500 million worth of goods,
primarily wheat, corn and rice annually to sanctioned countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national security and foreign policy concerns that led to
the original decisions to impose comprehensive sanctions on those
countries still pertain,'' said Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat. ``(But) sales of food, medicine and other human
necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military
capabilities or support terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said the decision was driven by the administration's
decision to reform sanctions policy, and not by any particular
political concerns. But U.S.-Iranian relations have warmed somewhat
in recent months, and Libya recently complied with a longstanding
U.S. demand that it turn over to Scotland two suspects in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Iran was a huge market for Northwest wheat prior to the Iranian
revolution of 1979. Northwest wheat growers had 53 percent of the
Iranian wheat market _ a percentage that would be worth $176
million annually today, according to Glen Squires of the Washington
Wheat Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But when the U.S. imposed sanctions, the Iranian wheat market
was snapped up by countries such as Canada and Australia. Now the
United States must compete with those countries to win back Iranian
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Libya and Sudan are less significant potential markets for
Washington state growers.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the second bit of good news in recent weeks
for wheat farmers, who have been struggling to survive with low
prices. The Clinton administration recently persuaded China to drop
its longstanding ban on the importation of Northwest wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news, and shows that common sense is finally
catching up with the silliness of unilateral sanctions,'' said
state Agriculture Director Jim Jesernig. ``It's another step toward
eliminating a tool that only hurts Washington farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not open the door to unrestricted sales of food and
medicine to Iran, Libya and Sudan, but rather granted the federal
bureaucracy permission to consider sales on a case by case basis.
But administration officials said the presumption now is that sales
will be allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has already placed an order with a trading company called
Niki to purchase grain from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a constructive move, and very helpful to U.S.
agriculture,'' said Richard Bliss, president of Niki. ``From the
Iranian point of view, having us as a competitor in the grain
market is very positive, because our absence from the market gave
the Iranian trade to other countries and probably resulted in
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss said the first sale to Iran, which has yet to be approved
by the administration, would probably involve several types of
wheat, including the white wheat grown in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is fabulous,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., whose eastern Washington district is home to much of the
state's wheat acreage. ``We hope we get a chunk of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahriar Afshar, the president of the Iranian Trade Association,
a U.S. organization pushing for a lifting of sanctions against
Iran, welcomed Wednesday's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' he said. ``This will be of tremendous
benefit to American exporters ... and is a real positive step in
U.S.-Iran engagement.''

COLORADO SHOOTING EXPOSES CRACKS IN GUN CONTROL MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gun control groups have seized on the mass shooting at Columbine
High School as a new opportunity to gain command of the nation's
firearms debate, but the massacre has also intensified long-running
divisions among the allies over the best way to reduce deaths from
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   From whether to punish the parents of children who use guns in
crimes to the effectiveness of safety locks, the groups are often
at odds, their differences often reflecting their political
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   While moderate organizations like Handgun Control Inc., based in
Washington, applauded the broad package of gun control measures
announced on Tuesday by President Clinton, an official of the
Violence Policy Center, a small activist group in Washington that
favors a ban on handgun sales, said the package's only worthwhile
proposal was to ban sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing more than a collection of knick-knacks and
doo-dads that focus on the gun seller and gun user but does not
focus on the gun industry,'' said the group's director of federal
policy, Kristen Rand.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for Handgun Control, Naomi Paiss, said the group
does not favor a such a ban. But she also said that groups in the
firearms control movement shared many of the same objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a lot of players in gun control,'' Ms. Paiss
said. ``And divisions, such as they are, are nothing compared to
the other fratricide on the other side of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun groups like the National Rifle Association also often find
themselves disagreeing with other gun interests, such as
manufacturers, on policies and strategies to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But some gun control advocates have even challenged data used by
others in the movement to lobby for new laws. In the past decade,
for example, Handgun Control, the nation's biggest gun-control
group, has helped pass laws in 16 states that would make parents
liable if they failed to store guns safely. In advocating that
approach, the group has pointed to a 1997 study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association that found that states that had
enacted such bills had seen a 23 percent reduction in the number of
accidental shootings of children.
</P>
<P>
   But in an editorial published Thursday in the British Medical
Journal, Stephen P. Teret, director of the Johns Hopkins University
Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that the study is flawed
because its conclusions were overly influenced by findings in just
one state, Florida, which passed the nation's first safe storage
bill in 1989. With the Florida results removed, an unpublished
analysis of the JAMA data performed by Johns Hopkins researchers
suggests that the laws have little or no impact.
</P>
<P>
   Teret said in a telephone interview Wednesday that because the
JAMA study was the only one on the issue he had no idea whether the
laws work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my reservations,'' said Teret, who is an advocate of
``smart'' technology that would limit a weapon's use to one person.
``People buy guns because they want them available for immediate
protection, and it may be not be realistic to expect people to lock
them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paiss said that Handgun Control believes that the Johns
Hopkins review had failed to account for factors like how
vigorously the safe storage laws have been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do agree that more research is needed,'' Ms. Paiss said.
``But we are confident that strong, well-publicized child access
laws will have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Cummings, a doctor at the Harborview Injury Prevention
and Research Center in Seattle and the lead author of the 1997 JAMA
article, could not be reached Wednesday for comment. But in an
recent interview he said that he was collecting more data on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other steps, the proposals announced by the president
on Tuesday would restrict the purchase of handguns to one a month
and restore a waiting period before any handgun purchase. It also
would raise the minimum age for possessing a handgun to 21 from 18
and impose felony penalties on adults who knowingly or recklessly
allow a child access to a gun that is used to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Horowitz, a lawyer with the Coalition to Stop Handgun
Violence, in Washington, said the group backed the initiatives
cited by Clinton but did not believe they went far enough. Among
the group's goals: a tough licensing and registration system on all
firearms as well on limits on those who could buy handguns.
Horowitz added there were ``honest differences'' within the
firearms movement over the effectiveness of measures like safety
locks for weapons and the smart technology championed by Teret.
</P>
<P>
   Those favoring mandatory safety locks say that they are a cheap
and simple way to prevent children from shooting either themselves
or friends, or using the guns to commit crimes. Requiring companies
to include the safety locks with firearms is a good way to remind
parents and others to store guns safely, those advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   But other gun control groups say that locks are little more than
a feel-good measure. Responsible gun owners are already safely
storing their weapons, they say, and giving a lock to those who
leave guns lying around or to those bent on violence won't mean
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think to make the argument that trigger locks would be a
deterrent to two kids capable of making hundreds of bombs is
ludicrous on its face,'' said Ms. Rand of the Violence Policy
Center.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of companies including Colt's Manufacturing, Sig Arms
and O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons Inc., are developing firearms that
incorporate technologies in which only an authorized user can fire
the weapon, officials in the firearms industry said. And Teret says
that widespread use of such technology could have reduced gun
problems ranging from accidental shootings to the use of guns in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But some gun control advocates have their doubts. Ms. Rand said
that the number of deaths that could be prevented by such guns
might be offset, because people who might not otherwise buy a
firearm might buy a smart weapon. As a result, she said, a
homeowner might try to use such a weapon in defense against an
attacker and get shot.
</P>
<P>
   While Handgun Control backs the development of the smart
technology, Horowitz of the Coalition to Stop Handgun Violence,
said that his group is hedging its bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one side they will save lives and on the other side they
will increase gun sales, which may lead to more shootings,''
Horowitz said. ``Right now, it's unclear what the effect will be.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: NO QUICK SOLUTION TO KOSOVO CONFLICT IN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-CONGRESS) 
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five weeks into the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the
Clinton administration is faced with three choices on the war in
Kosovo, all disagreeable: an open-ended air campaign, the dispatch
of ground troops, or compromise in a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   None of the options offers a quick solution. President Clinton
suggested on Wednesday that bombing could last into the summer;
preparing for an armed invasion could take months, and a negotiated
resolution would have to span a yawning chasm between NATO and
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on the shape of a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   With mounting eagerness, the administration appears to be
focusing on a diplomatic strategy and using Russia, whose opinion
it spurned at the outset of the conflict, to help find an exit out
of an increasingly difficult situation. After a telephone call from
President Boris Yeltsin to Clinton on Sunday, Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott made a one-day visit to Moscow to explore the
potential of Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The potential use of Russia as a mediator turned into an option,
administration and European officials said, as the military outlook
of the Kosovo conflict became less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is throwing a `Hail Mary' to the
Russians,'' said an adviser to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton and other NATO leaders confidently proclaimed at
their recent summit that the air campaign is eroding Milosevic's
strength, one of NATO's senior soldiers, Gen. Klaus Naumann, said
publicly on Monday that the exclusive use of air power had never
achieved victory in the history of military campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The military alternative, an invasion by land, appeared less and
less likely after the administration choked off discussion of
ground troops at the NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Among factors that the White House is taking into consideration
are polls that show that less than 50 percent of the American
public support ground troops in Kosovo if that means American
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic alternative also raises problems. One is whether
the Russians will really argue for NATO's five conditions, which
include an international military force with NATO troops at its
core. Another is whether NATO is prepared to compromise on the
conditions, after insisting that it will not _ a compromise that
would require some tricky explanations from NATO and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials seemed confident that if this path was
chosen, Clinton would find a way to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a better communicator than anyone else,'' said a
senior administration official. ``Once Clinton decides that's what
he's going to do, he'll sell it. If Nixon could sell the the fall
of Saigon as peace with honor, Clinton can sell this.`
</P>
<P>
   But ``this'' _ a diplomatic solution based on a compromise _ may
be no more of a quick fix than the path of a stepped up air
campaign that the administration has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has given any estimate yet how long the bombing could
last, and Clinton suggested on Wednesday that it could go at least
into July.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, noted in a
briefing Tuesday that despite the intensive air assaults to date,
Milosevic had as many forces inside Kosovo now than he did six
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   To some officials in Washington, the general's assessment looked
like a plea in disguise for ground troops, but that option was not
on the table, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The British prime minister, Tony Blair, failed to persuade
Clinton of the wisdom of preparing for ground troops during a
meeting at the White House before the NATO summit opening. The
French president, Jacques Chirac, who had been expected to argue
for ground troops, failed to do so. And elsewhere in Europe,
particularly Germany and Italy, there was considerable political
opposition to ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   While a diplomatic solution was looking better and better, at
this point it still seemed a long stretch, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have insisted that they are not willing to be only
a ``postman'' for NATO, as Foreign Secretary Igor Ivanov put it.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the administration and NATO insist for now that
they will stick to their five conditions. The most contentious of
these is the composition of the international security force that
would take Albanian refugees back to Kosovo and the character of an
international protectorate that the administration has said it
favors carving out in Kosovo .
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic appeared to be holding firm to his
opposition to the presence of NATO troops on Kosovo soil. His
stubbornness was demonstrated Tuesday evening when he fired Deputy
Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic for suggesting that foreign
peacekeeping troops under U.N. control should be allowed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With such a large gap between what the administration can
apparently tolerate and what Milosevic will agree to, there seemed
to be much diplomatic work to be done, administration and European
officials said.

IMF TO RESUME LENDING TO RUSSIA, PENDING REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund announced a
preliminary agreement Wednesday night to lend Russia $4.5 billion
over the next 18 months, the first resumption of loans since the
country defaulted on its debts and devalued its currency last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But in a little noticed and highly unusual element of the deal,
the money will never actually be sent to Moscow. Instead, at the
insistence of the U.S. Treasury and some European nations, the
loans will essentially be transferred from one of the Monetary
Fund's accounts to another _ allowing Russia to avoid default on
money it owes the IMF this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The Western allies feared that if the loan was made in the usual
way, with the money transferred directly to Russia's central bank,
the cash could disappear in days. That is what happened last July,
when the fund sent $4.8 billion to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal enables Russia to make it through elections in the year
2000 without a default to the IMF that would undercut whatever
strands of credibility the country has with private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the loan had sputtered along for months, as
the fund had sought to extract commitments from Russia over its
spending policies, reluctance to collect taxes, and failure to
reform a collapsing banking system. But the renewed drive by the
West to complete the deal reflected a wish to avoid another nasty
dispute with the Russians at a moment when Moscow has been courted
extensively to play the role of mediator in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make sure that Russia does not feel even more
alienated from the West,'' one senior official involved in the
talks said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday night about the loan
agreement, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said, ``I am
pleased that we have agreed with the Russian authorities on an
economic program for Russia that I hope to be able to recommend to
the Executive Board in support of a new Stand-by Arrangement as a
new step in the cooperation between the IMF and Russia. There are
still a few technical elements to be settled in the next few
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia also had agreed to provide the IMF with an
explanation of how earlier loans had been used, a veiled reference
to widespread suspicions that past loans had been funneled to
benefit some of Russia's wealthy oligarchs or secretly sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal to send the new loans to Moscow reflected some
behind-the-scenes pressure from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin
and finance ministers from other European nations, who had argued
that any credible new loan program for Russia must include
safeguards to prevent a repeat of last summer's embarrassment. In
mid-March, Rubin told a congressional panel that much of the $4.8
billion pumped into Moscow's foreign exchange reserves at that time
``may have been siphoned off improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was referring to investigations showing that when the IMF
money briefly propped up the value of the ruble, the country's
richest oligarchs raced to convert their cash into dollars at a
favorable exchange rate. More than $4 billion flowed out of Russia
nearly immediately, much of it headed for Swiss bank accounts and
other safe havens.
</P>
<P>
   This time, officials say, Rubin's aides made it clear to the IMF
that the United States would seek to block any effort to resume
loans to Russia unless the IMF retained direct control over the
money at all times. And that means the aid amounts to little more
than rescheduling Russia's payments to the fund. It owes more than
$5 billion to the IMF over the next 18 months, and nearly $2.5
billion by the end of June. So even with the tentative agreement
reached Wednesday, Russia's new loans will total less than its
repayments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the IMF will get a bit more from
Russia than Russia gets from the fund,'' one senior official
involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's finance minister, Mikhail Zadornov, who has been in
Washington all week holding talks with the IMF and the World Bank,
had hinted earlier Wednesday that an agreement was close, saying
``we do not have any special problems.'' The governor of Russia's
central bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, had hoped to borrow about $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement alone will not get Russia the money it has
sought for so long. Before the board of the IMF formally approves
any accord, the IMF is insisting that the Russian Parliament pass
several bills to remake Russia's bankruptcy laws, strengthen the
tax-collection system and overhaul the banking system. Last year
the IMF transferred money to Russia before the Parliament acted _
only to discover that the Communist-led body failed to fulfill
several commitments made by the government of President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   A senior European official who had been briefed on the
negotiations said Wednesday that ``the way the agreement is now set
not a dollar will actually enter Russia, so the risk is very
small.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is something else the IMF's board has demanded: A report
by Price Waterhouse on the operations of Fimaco, an offshore
company based in Britain's Channel Islands, where the Russian
Central Bank was secretly sending a portion of its foreign
reserves. The fund was never informed by Russian officials that
they were moving some of the reserves _ presumably including some
cash loaned by the IMF _ outside of Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Russia has yet to provide a convincing explanation
of why the money was sent to the offshore haven, exactly who had
control over it, and who may have benefited from management fees or
investment proceeds.

KRAFT TURNABOUT WOULD BE A WORLD RECORD, ROWLAND SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ This buttoned-down capital, long a
minor-league way station &UR;  &LR; between Boston and New York, is counting
on elemental economics to preserve its ticket to the big leagues:
Bob Kraft knows a sweet deal when he sees one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kraft does (leave) it'll go down in the Guinness Book of
World Records as one of the more interesting turnabouts,'' Governor
John Rowland said in an interview with the Globe Wednesday. ``Why
would someone walk away from a $374 million publicly financed deal
to go build your own facility on your own dime?''
</P>
<P>
   As officials in Boston celebrated an 11th-hour, $70 million deal
designed to stop Kraft and the New England Patriots from moving to
a riverfront site here, the architects of one of the nation's most
generous publicly financed stadium deals pronounced Massachusetts'
efforts stingy by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium boosters, including state government leaders and many
business executives, insist Kraft will stick with the deal he
hammered out in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a signed agreement with Kraft,'' Thomas Ritter, the
former Democratic speaker of Connecticut's House of Representatives
and a staunch stadium supporter, said. ``I don't care how many
meetings there are in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of a deal in Boston lit up the lines on the city's
talk-show circuit and prompted Rowland to emerge from his office,
greeting reporters with buckets of rhetorical cold water. Logic and
reason, he said, lean toward Hartford, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no butterflies in my stomach,'' the Republican governor
said later in a shirtsleeve interview in his capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three discussions among some political leaders do not
make for a very sophisticated proposal to accommodate an NFL
franchise and all the things that go into it,'' Rowland said. ``We
have thousands and thousands of hours invested in this. We have
millions and millions of dollars invested in this. And we're
actually working with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he last spoke with Kraft about a week ago, and the
team owner told him his commitment to Hartford is absolute.
Hartford has already spent over $2 million on the stadium
initiative, including paying for soil tests for architectural
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he going back to?'' Rowland asked. ``It's not an
emotional issue. It's a financial issue. He's got to be able to
afford his team. I mean the bottom line is that to be able to
afford NFL franchises these days, and pay the players what you have
to and all the rest, yes, you do need a good media market. But you
also have to have the revenues to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those revenues that enraged some Connecticut conservatives
who argued that Rowland and other stadium supporters were duped by
Kraft, blinded by the glitter that accompanies modern major-league
sports. The deal Rowland signed with Kraft not only calls for
taxpayers to foot the bill for stadium construction, it also
promises the owner revenues from luxury box seats, concessions, and
parking, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Connecticut plan Wednesday rooted for a Kraft
double-reverse that would land him back in Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal was a bad deal to begin with and, frankly, I hope
they stay in Boston because of the cost to the state. It's too much
for the taxpayers to bear.'' said State Senator Edith G. Prague, a
Democrat from Columbia who had opposed the deal. ``Now the NFL is
saying that they may contribute to the cost of the stadium in
Massachusetts, and they're not contributing a dime here. Let them
stay in Foxborough. I will shed no tears and neither will the
taxpayers who are praying that this deal falls apart. We simply
cannot afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk-show host Tom Scott of New Haven said the
negotiations in Boston confirmed his suspicions Kraft was just
using Connecticut to get the best deal in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kraft should be careful not to let the door to the state
border hit him in the backside on his way out of Connecticut,''
said Scott, a former Republican state senator. ``His arrogance and
contempt for the taxpayers of Connecticut is something that hasn't
been seen around here in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patriot fans, like 39-year-old John X. Smith, the Boston
deal would bring frustration after the enormous excitement the
advent of the Patriots had stirred up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kraft is going to stick it to Hartford. I really do,''
Smith said Wednesday in a downtown park. ``I think he's going to
stay put. And I was really looking forward to watching the games
here until this last-minute deal came up.''
</P>
<P>
   But most fans were more sanguine. Money, they said, talks. And
if there's anything that a businessman like Kraft understands, it's
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a real sweet deal here,'' said Wesley Stewart, 64, a
retiree who lives near the stadium site. ``I think he's going to
come. I don't think that Boston can top that deal that he has. No
way. Kraft is a wheeler-dealer and he wheeled and dealed this deal.
The state will be dishing out a lot of money for a long time.''

CLINTON TALKS OF KOSOVO CAMPAIGN LASTING MANY MONTHS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Wednesday that NATO's
bombardment and economic pressure on Yugoslavia would persist for
many more months and called on Congress to quickly pass his request
for $6 billion in emergency funds to pay the mounting costs of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day, our military campaign takes a toll on Serbia's
machinery of repression,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden statement
after a meeting on the Balkan conflict with 46 members of Congress.
``The Serbian leadership has failed to divide us and will not
outlast us. The combined military might and moral determination of
Europe and North America will endure.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that additional air power was arriving in the
region and allied pilots were beginning to fly around the clock on
missions to destroy Serb troops who are terrorizing the the ethnic
Albanian population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia. The Serbs
have already driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovo's people out of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the air campaign, now at the end of its fifth
week, had been hampered by rain and clouds and said the pace would
now pick up as the skies clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the weather is better in May than in April,
better in June than in May, better in July than in June,'' Clinton
said in a clear sign that he intends to continue the air war for
months. ``And I feel very strongly that we should stay with and be
very strong in determination to pursue our strategy, as well as the
very important decisions we made at the NATO conference to
intensify the economic pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that signs of dissension were beginning to
appear in Belgrade, including public criticism by senior officials
of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, said that Clinton pleaded for
forbearance from lawmakers during their meeting, saying they had to
give air power time to work to undermine Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the administration's ``gradualism and
incrementalism'' were frustrating many in Congress, who want
quicker consideration of the use of ground troops to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said absolutely we have to be patient,'' Ms. Snowe said.
``But he gave no indication how long it would last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snowe and other members of Congress who attended Wednesday's
session with the president said he repeated his determination not
to dispatch ground troops to fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``He
indicated that he intended a stepped-up prosecution of the air war
and the blockade of oil supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members said that Clinton's aims _ the removal of Serb
forces from Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees _ could not be achieved with air power
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said that the administration had
been sending confusing signals about the the goals of the war, its
costs and the administration's plans for relocating refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The messages coming out of the White House have a great deal
of ambiguity,'' Callahan said. ``But it's very obvious to me that
this is going to be a prolonged and costly endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the lawmakers to move quickly on his funding
request, which would provide money to replace munitions already
used and to build weapon stockpiles for a lengthy air campaign. The
administration's $6 billion package also includes about $1 billion
for food and shelter for refugees displaced by the fighting in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that Congress should resist the temptation to
attach to the legislation money for unrelated activities, no matter
how worthy, because it would slow the bill's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk
now,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Draft proposals in the Senate and the House would add $6 billion
to $7 billion in Pentagon programs, bringing the emergency spending
bill requested by Clinton to roughly $12 billion to $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional add-ons include projects arguably unconnected
to NATO's operations in the Balkans. For example, the House bill
would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction
programs sought by the military to increase soldiers' morale and
efficiency, such as refurbishing 50-year-old barracks, building car
washes and garages, and paving parking lots at bases in Germany.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Republicans are eager to approve them as a show of support
for the military, and to bolster their argument that Clinton has
starved the Pentagon. But the emergency money must come from
surplus Social Security revenues, which both parties have pledged
to keep their hands off.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Republican senators, loath to break their vows of
fiscal abstinence, are ready to break with their colleagues instead
of supporting a $12 billion emergency bill, according to senior
aides. They want the spending limited to what the president has
requested. Others want to see even more money added to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Given the intensity of the internal debate, it will be at least
two weeks before any money is approved.
</P>
<P>
   In his White House remarks, Clinton said that the terror in
Kosovo was the product of a ``meticulously planned'' campaign by
Milosevic's Serb troops to drive the ethnic Albanian majority out
of the province. ``A campaign organized by the government of
Belgrade for a specific political purpose _ to maintain its grip
over Kosovo by ridding the land of its people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the expulsions began, ethnic Albanians made up about 90
percent of Kosovo's population of two million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited continuing reports of atrocities, including one
unconfirmed report brought to him by Brian Atwood, the
administration's humanitarian coordinator for the region. Atwood,
who just returned from Albania, said he had been told of one
village in Kosovo where most of the men were rounded up, tied
together and burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of story that would be too horrible to believe
if it were not so consistent with what so many refugees have been
saying,'' the president said.

CONGRESS BARS USE OF GROUND TROOPS WITHOUT APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wary Congress waded into the politics of war
Wednesday, as the House rejected calling home US forces from the
Balkans but voted to prohibit President Clinton from sending ground
troops into Kosovo without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The House also overwhelmingly rejected a resolution to declare
war on Yugoslavia, marking the first time since World War II that
Congress has voted on a declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate with potential implications for individual members
and their parties in the 2000 elections, lawmakers summoned the
conflicting images of the US experience in Vietnam and the triumph
over fascism in World War II before they voted, 249-180, to require
congressional approval for the use of ground forces in NATO's
battle against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The vote threw open a window on the deep divisions within
Congress over the US role in the NATO campaign, as 45 Democrats,
including four from Massachusetts, supported the measure despite
Clinton's warning that ``America must continue to speak with a
single voice.'' The president has said he opposes a ground war in
the Balkans but believes he should retain the power to deploy US
forces without prior approval.
</P>
<P>
   A related skirmish roiled over Clinton's request for $6 billion
to fund the Kosovo operation through September and a rival plan by
House and Senate Republican leaders to spend $13 billion on Kosovo
activities and other Pentagon needs, including a pay raise for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, lawmakers faced the prospect of linking themselves
and their parties to a potentially unpopular military conflict, as
they weighed the US role in the Balkans with an eye toward the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   At times, subtlety all but dissolved as lawmakers reminded each
other of the personal consequences. In pushing for the House to
declare war on Yugoslavia rather than pursue the ``half-hearted''
policies that led to the US defeat in Vietnam, Representative Gene
Taylor, a Mississippi Democrat, scanned the chamber and told his
colleagues, ``You aren't willing to risk your careers, but you're
willing to risk those kids' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor stood nearly alone in supporting the war resolution,
which was defeated, 427-2. The only other supporter was
Represetantive Joe Barton, a Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, California Republican Tom Campbell,
even voted against it. Campbell said he had pushed the legislation
to force reluctant House leaders to bring the Kosovo issue to the
floor for a debate.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Vietnam-era Congress for lacking the courage to
declare war on Vietnam or end US involvement there, Campbell said
of the Kosovo conflict, ``We have a chance to stop this now, to say
no before we get in too deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Foes called the proposed declaration of war a highly provocative
step with potentially disastrous consequences for world stability.
</P>
<P>
   The House also killed a measure that would have ended US
involvement in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, based on the Vietnam-era War Powers Act, would
have required the White House to limit the military campaign to 60
days unless it obtained congressional authorization. The measure
was defeated, 290-139, after Clinton's handling of the Kosovo
crisis was roundly criticized by many members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 Democrats broke with Clinton on the measure. And only
two New Englanders supported it: New Hampshire Republicans Charles
F. Bass and John E. Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was the vote to require congressional approval for
ground troops in Kosovo that Republican leaders hailed as a
triumph. The measure faces a likely filibuster in the Senate and a
possible veto by Clinton, who had assured congressional leaders
before the vote that he would consult them before he deployed
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet GOP leaders said they wanted to hold Clinton to his word and
press him to communicate US objectives in the mission more clearly.
``It is important that the American people be heard, through their
elected representatives, before ground troops are committed in this
hostile situation by the president,'' said House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said Clinton should consider the contentious House
debate ``a signal that he should better explain the goals, the cost
and the long-term strategy of why we are there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats accused GOP leaders of trying to use the war
to their political advantage. ``I think the Republican idea is to
make this Clinton's war,'' said Representative J. Joseph Moakley of
South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to develop a strategy where if this operation
should prove to be unsuccessful, they will be in a position to
criticize,'' said Representative William D. Delahunt, a
Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The four Massachusetts Democrats who voted to require
congressional approval for ground troops were Barney Frank, Edward
J. Markey, James P. McGovern and John F. Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should be very cautious about getting ourselves
into a ground war in the Balkans,'' Markey said. ``We should recall
the lessons of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution and not pass a Gulf of
the Adriatic resolution that provides an open-ended and
unconditional authorization for the use of ground forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, scheduled a hearing Thursday to vote on a
measure that would authorize Clinton to use ``all means
necessary,'' including ground troops, to prosecute the war.

 Upstart Sticks Pin in Voodoo   By David Einstein 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A race car explodes in a ball of flames following a 100-mph
collision. Tiger Woods raises a clenched fist after sinking a
birdie putt. The Empire strikes back and shatters your spaceship
into smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Video games have gotten awfully realistic, thanks mostly to 3-D
chips on special circuit boards that go into personal computers.
And now the competition is heating up, with two Silicon Valley
rivals introducing the most powerful technology yet.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's 3Dfx Interactive, the perennial market leader in
high-end PC graphics, recently introduced the Voodoo3, the latest
in its popular line of 3-D Voodoo chips.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, Santa Clara's Nvidia will unveil its new
Riva TNT2 chip, which it says will outperform the Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews in trade publications tend to back up some of the
claims, suggesting that 3Dfx's undisputed reign may be ending. &UR;  &LR; ``A
lot of people expect the TNT2 to be the high-end product of the
year,'' said analyst George Iwanyc of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   3Dfx is selling three versions of Voodoo3 video boards under its
own brand name, priced at $129, $179 and $249. Boards based on
Nvidia's TNT2 should start shipping next month from Diamond
Multimedia, Creative Labs and other vendors in similar price
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   (Like every other computer component or peripheral, video boards
have been dropping in price, and the arrival of new technology is
making older products even cheaper. A Voodoo2 board that cost $299
a year ago can now be had for $100.)
</P>
<P>
   The technology coming out of 3Dfx and Nvidia already has turned
the PC into a gaming platform that offers clearer images and faster
action than you can get now on a dedicated game console such as the
Sony PlayStation or the Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   As high-speed Internet access becomes widely available, 3-D
chips also will enhance multimedia on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most new PCs come with 3-D video _ the biggest provider is ATI
Technologies, a Canadian company that specializes in selling
graphics systems to PC-makers. But the 3-D built into PCs usually
is not top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   For a better picture, you have to install a video board with a
chip from 3Dfx, Nvidia or even ATI, which also has some pretty good
retail products.
</P>
<P>
   Video boards featuring Voodoo chips have been among the most
popular upgrades for PCs, and as a result, 3Dfx has been one of the
most successful computer hardware companies. Founded just four
years ago, it had revenues of $202.6 million and income of $21.7
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nvidia, which went public in January, also has prospered. In
fiscal 1998, sales of video chips earned it $4.1 million and
generated revenue of $158.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   With TNT2, Nvidia has sent a signal that it no longer intends to
settle for second place. ``We truly believe that it will provide a
stunning level of visual realism, for the first time, to the
mainstream PC user,'' said Nvidia spokesman Derek Perez.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely technical standpoint, Nvidia indeed may have the
edge. The TNT2 can display 32-bit color at high screen resolutions
versus just 16 bits for Voodoo3. That can translate into clearer
images and sharper color definition. Nvidia also says its chip is
faster than Voodoo3, with better image textures and smoother
action.
</P>
<P>
   3Dfx officials argue that Nvidia's chip takes a performance hit
because it's too busy trying to display vibrant colors. As a
result, action can become jerky.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our competitors are talking about 32-bit rendering, the
thing they never tell you is that along with that goes lousy
performance,'' said Peter Wicher, director of consumer products for
3Dfx.
</P>
<P>
   Voodoo3, says Wicher, provides a superior ``overall quality for
the gaming experience.''
</P>
<P>
   3Dfx also says more games are compatible with its chips than
with Nvidia's _ partly that's because some games are written to
work best with 3Dfx's own software standard, called Glide. Most
popular games, however, should work well with either chip.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who has the technical edge may be a moot point
with the average user, because with most current games there's not
much difference in actual performance between TNT2 and Voodoo3.
Both can run full-motion video as well as graphics without breaking
a sweat, and both significantly enhance the performance of sports
games, shoot-em-ups and fast-paced adventure games.
</P>
<P>
   None of today's games can take the new chips to their limits.
But games optimized for them will soon start to appear, and then
we'll get a better idea of how the TNT2 stacks up against Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the claims of the companies about technology
effectively cancel each other out, the only key issue left will be
price. If TNT2-based boards fetch less at retail than their Voodoo3
counterparts, analysts say Nvidia could win wide acceptance for its
brand and take market share from 3Dfx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely it will come down to which one can hit the right
price point and get the buzz generating around it,'' said
Dataquest's Iwanyc.

 Charismatic Editor Steps Aside at S.F. Business Monthly
Upside  Media 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Inside Upside, changes are afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brandt, the charismatic editor of the monthly business
magazine, has stepped aside. He's still with Upside Media, but is
seeking funding for a new Internet media business.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Macworld editor Adrian Mello is the new
editor-in-chief, overseeing the magazine, Web site and book
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel moves come as the company, late of San Mateo,
settles into its new home on San Francisco's Market Street, just
four floors below Mother Jones' headquarters. That's San Francisco
for you: A magazine aimed at the captains of the technology
industry under the same roof as a nonprofit magazine that keeps
capitalism under fire. Framed pictures are still on the floor in
chief executive David Bunnell's corner office, waiting to be hung
on the wall, and Bunnell is upbeat as he talks about Upside.
</P>
<P>
   He started out as an investor in the company _ which was founded
by Tony Perkins, now the CEO and editor-in-chief of competing
magazine Red Herring, and Rich Karlgaard, now publisher of Forbes _
and became CEO two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, circulation has ``more than tripled,'' he said, to
200,000 _ 20 percent of it paid, but 60 percent of it going to
corporate board members.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he's expanding. ``Now we're a magazine and an online
business, and a robust conference business and a book division,''
he said. ``We're becoming a true media company. But we're not going
to change the name to Upside.com.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have a change of heart if he decides to take the
company public. ``Dot com'' is the magic phrase in the stock
market. ``We're looking at an exit strategy,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to spend more time promoting his 70-person company,
Bunnell also elevated Gini Talmadge, who joined the company in
January, to president and publisher, overseeing sales, marketing,
circulation, finance and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the impression one might have from Upside's name,
Bunnell said the magazine is anything but boosterish. The latest
cover is a good example. It's a photo of people holding picket
signs with such slogans as ``Tax the Net'' and ``Ban Internet
Welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We question why it is that the Net is tax free for three
years,'' Bunnell said. ``It seems awfully strange: We're creating
all these billionaires, and giving them tax breaks....
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't read this article in any other magazine,'' he said
proudly. ``All they do is suck up to whatever technology believes
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell, 49, has an impressive media pedigree. He is the founder
of PC Magazine, PC World, Macworld and New Media magazines, as well
as a biotechnology newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Mello, 43, worked with Bunnell in the early days of PC Magazine,
when its offices were spread throughout the Sunset District. He
ultimately rose to become editor-in-chief of Macworld, leaving in
1997 when that magazine went through a restructuring related to the
turmoil afflicting Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes the fourth editor in Upside's 10-year history,
following Perkins, Eric Nee (now with Fortune) and Brandt. He
starts work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brandt, who joined Upside in 1995 after 14 years with
Business Week, heads to New York next week to meet with venture
capitalists he hopes will fund his next business.
</P>
<P>
   Until it's funded, he won't say what it is _ and he's not
leaving Upside. ``I can't just quit,'' said Brandt, 43. ``I need
some income.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ZDNET ZOOMS &LR; : Shedding the muzzle of the ``quiet period,'' ZDNet
chief executive Dan Rosensweig sounded like a happy man Tuesday as
he talked about his company's earnings and the state of online
media.
</P>
<P>
   You know ZDNet: It's the San Francisco online division of
computer magazine publishing giant Ziff-Davis. Ziff sold tracking
stock in ZDNet to cash in on the Internet stock craze, and it paid
off beyond anyone's dreams: Its market value is $2.6 billion, more
than the $1.7 billion value of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The first public earnings report revealed that ZDNet lost
$186,000 in the three months that ended March 31, but its revenues
nearly doubled since last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Rosensweig also noted ZDNet's increasing traffic numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet puts up content from Ziff magazines, but it also employs
300 people _ half in San Francisco _ creating original content.
It's become a formidable competitor for Cnet, the San Francisco
online media powerhouse. Cnet once ridiculed Ziff in ads showing a
bulked-up bodybuilder with skinny legs; the ads said the upper body
was Ziff-Davis in print, and the scrawny lower body was Ziff-Davis
online.
</P>
<P>
   Representing Ziff online, Rosensweig says: ``That's my upper
body in the picture.'' Having bulked up, ZDNet will keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that will help foster that growth is ZDNet's stock,
which Rosensweig said ``creates a currency for all the reasons we'd
need a currency, from employee retention to potential
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; PRIZE SURPRISE: &LR;  Right up there with Tina Brown, David Remnick,
Martha Stewart and other magazine luminaries at New York's
Waldorf-Astoria yesterday were Paul Somerson and Greg Mason, editor
and publisher of San Francisco's PC Computing magazine, hauling off
a prestigious National Magazine Award.
</P>
<P>
   They beat out a diverse group _ Saveur, Conde Nast's Women's
Sports and Fitness, and Field and Stream _ with a package from last
November, ``Undocumented Internet Secrets,'' giving the Ziff-Davis
magazine's 1 million subscribers tips on searching the Net without
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The award ``says San Francisco is a real publishing hub,''
Somerson said. ``And computer magazines have come up into the
mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different, regional contest, Bay Area &UR;  &LR; technology and
business pubs brought home a lot more hardware. The Western
Publications Association bestowed the Maggie Awards to Upside (two
awards), Business 2.0 (not only best new mag, and not only best
special interest mag, but best consumer mag), Macworld in print and
online, Publish, New Media, InfoWorld and PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Shed a tear for the Industry Standard, which celebrated its
first birthday with four Maggie nominations, but didn't win any.

 Increasing Storage Capacity
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'd like to add a second hard drive to increase the
storage capacity of my PC (my original drive holds 2 gigabytes, and
I'm looking at adding one that holds 10 gigs). Is this something I
can do myself, and if so, how hard is it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It's actually pretty simple. Your PC case should have
a space called a bay inside it for an extra hard drive. But you
should open the case and make sure that's the case (is that
clear?). Anyway, here's how to install the new hard drive:
</P>
<P>
   _Set the switch on the back of the drive to the ``slave''
position. Also, make sure that your original drive is set to the
``master'' position. That way, the computer will boot using the
original drive, which contains your operating system.
</P>
<P>
   _Slide the new drive into the empty bay and secure it with
screws on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   _Your original drive is connected to the motherboard with a flat
ribbon cable. In the middle of the cable there should be a black
connector that's not being used for anything. Connect it to the
back of your new hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _Connect the drive to one of the free plugs that extend out of
the computer's power supply.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Now close the case, fire up the computer and follow
the instructions that came with your new drive to format it and get
it ready.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get an acknowledgment when someone gets the e-mail
I've sent them? I'm sure I figured out how to do it once, but I
can't seem to find my way there again.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Both Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator let you
request receipts for when mail is received, and when it's read.
</P>
<P>
   To request receipts for all messages that you send in Outlook
98, choose Options from the Tools menu, then tab to Preferences and
click E-Mail Options. In the dialog box that appears, click
Tracking Options, then select ``Tell me when all messages have been
delivered'' and/or ``Tell me when all messages have been read.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also track an individual message. Open a new e-mail
message window and click Options on the toolbar. In the Voting and
Tracking Options area, check the boxes for the receipt options you
want.
</P>
<P>
   To request receipts for all messages, open your Inbox, then
choose Preferences from the Edit menu. In the Preferences dialog
box, go to the Mail &AMP; Newsgroups category on the left and choose
Return Receipts. Then choose your receipt preferences.
</P>
<P>
   To track an individual Netscape message, open a new message
window, click Options on the toolbar and check the box for Return
Receipt. There doesn't seem to be an option for finding out if an
individual message has been read as well as received.
</P>
<P>
   Banish Your Buddies
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 79 and very much a neophyte as far as computers are
concerned. I use America Online as my ISP and whenever I access, it
I get a ``Buddies Online'' window in the top right-hand corner. I
couldn't care less about it and need to deluun it. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A: Irritating, isn't it? But fear not, you can banish your
buddies with a few quick mouse strokes. Just click the Setup icon
in the Buddies Online window, then click Buddy List Preferences.
Now remove the check (by clicking it) from the box labeled ``Show
my my Buddy List(s) immediately after I sign onto AOL.`` Next time
you sign on, the buddy window will be gone. You're welcome.
</P>
<P>
   So Sorry
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three years ago, I bought a Macintosh clone _ a Power
Computing PowerCurve 601/120. Loved it. But now the motherboard has
burned out. Can I buy a replacement motherboard now that Power
Computing no longer exists? Or am I just stuck?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You're just stuck. The motherboard for your machine is no
longer being made, and an Apple expert tells me that there probably
isn't a current board that would be compatible with your system.
Best bet: Get yourself a new tangerine-color iMac.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  If you download a lot of programs, why not create a folder on
your desktop to hold them all. That way, you won't have lots of
icons cluttering up the desktop, and you'll always know where your
programs are. To create a new folder, right click on any unused
area of the desktop, point to New and choose Folder from the list
of options. Immediately type a name for the folder, then hit Enter.

MICROSOFT QUESTIONS DELAY IN NETSCAPE-AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. tried Wednesday to
show that Netscape Communications Corp. and America Online delayed
the announcement of their merger for several weeks last fall,
apparently because they feared that earlier disclosure of it might
hurt the government's antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to suggest a plot between the two companies and
the government to keep their intentions from Microsoft's legal
team, the lawyer, Michael Lacovara, questioned Peter Currie, a
senior vice president for Netscape, for more than two hours. The
deposition was the first of several that will be taken to prepare
rebuttal arguments for the trial, which is in recess.
</P>
<P>
   All but about 10 minutes of the deposition was taken in public,
as the result of a suit filed by 13 news organizations, including
The New York Times, under a 1913 law intended to make antitrust
cases subject to public scrutiny. During the final few minutes of
the deposition, the lawyers discussed what they described as
confidential business information, and the public was asked to
leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   But during the public portion, a small gathering of reporters
and other onlookers at a Washington hotel watched as Currie, in
response to questions from Lacovara, said discussions of the deal
between the two companies were quite active last August and
September, ``but then they went into hiatus for weeks and weeks _
until mid-November.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Nov. 23, America Online announced that it was buying
Netscape for $4.2 billion, while also forming an alliance with Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   In his questions, Lacovara said nothing about why he thought the
``hiatus'' had occurred. But Microsoft is basing the major portion
of its rebuttal case on the thesis that the Netscape-America Online
deal changes the competitive landscape of the software industry,
seriously undermining the government's charge that Microsoft is a
bullying monopolist with the power to cow the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In support of that notion, Lacovara quoted from an underwriter's
report on the proposed deal presented to the Netscape board last
fall, which called the acquisition ``an industry-defining
transaction.'' Currie scoffed at that, saying, ``it sounds like the
kind of thing they might have said.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and government lawyers both completed presenting their
principal cases at the end of February, when the antitrust trial
went into recess. It is currently expected to resume in late May,
when both sides offer three rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   During the earlier part of the trial, in October, James
Barksdale, Netscape's former chairman, and David Colburn, a senior
America Online executive, testified for the government. This was
during the hiatus in the merger talks. At the time of their
testimony, no hint of the discussions came out in court.
Presumably, had Microsoft known of the proposed deal, the company
could have made the argument earlier that it undermined the
government's case and could have questioned executives of the two
companies about it.
</P>
<P>
   Currie said he heard no significant discussions within Netscape
last fall about how the proposed deal might affect the antitrust
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very brief discussion _ will this have an
impact,'' he said. ``But mainly we were looking at the business
issues. There were only a very few people at Netscape worrying
about the trial. And remember, at that time we had no deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara also suggested that Netscape informed the Justice
Department about the proposed deal in September. On Wednesday,
David Boies, the government's lead lawyer in the case, said the
government was not informed until mid-November. But Microsoft has
subpoenaed thousands of pages of documents from Netscape, and
Lacovara said: ``I would not ask a question like that unless I had
a good faith basis for believing it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the September revelation would prove even if true,
Lacovara said only, ``Let us shake the case out, and then we'll
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deposition had ended, Boies called the
Netscape-America Online issue ``a sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about what Microsoft did, despite Microsoft's
effort to change the subject to what other people did,'' he said.
``I don't think this witness was very helpful for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Colburn of America Online testified last October that his
company had ended its relationship with Netscape and had chosen
Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the default browser for its
service because Microsoft had promised America Online a prominent
advertisement in all copies of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued in court that America Online had chosen
Internet Explorer because it was technically superior; it offered
specific features that Microsoft valued that Netscape could not
match. Microsoft also argued that Netscape never did produce a
version of its browser including those features.
</P>
<P>
   But Currie said Netscape's main interaction with America Online
in September and October was Netscape's effort to persuade America
Online to adopt a new version of the Netscape browser that did
include the specific features the company wanted.

MCCAIN RECORD AS HAWK A RECENT DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential
candidate from Arizona, for weeks has generated positive publicity
by outlining a clear policy on the Kosovo crisis, calling for
immediate preparation for a possible ground war. Wednesday, McCain
urged fellow Republicans to pass his resolution approving ``all
necessary force'' to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain is described as a defense hawk, a review of his
record since the former prisoner of war in Vietnam was first
elected to Congress in 1982 shows he frequently opposed military
interventions by both Democratic and Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain objected to the use of US forces in Lebanon,
Somalia, and Haiti. Most significantly, McCain originally opposed
US intervention in the 1994 crisis in Bosnia. But McCain changed
his mind the following year and co-authored a resolution that
backed US peace-keeping troops on the ground. McCain did support
the use of force in Grenada and the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's stances on military intervention shows a complex and
contradictory record, much of it based on a world view developed
when he was a POW for five years, that is sometimes at odds with
his own party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view is that if US interests compel intervention,
adequate military force must be deployed to ensure a swift victory,
something that many say did not happen during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has been a thorn in the side of both Democratic and
Republican administrations,'' said Chris Hellman, senior analyst
for the independent Center for Defense Information. ``Because of
his personal history, he has a lot of credibility on national
security issues, and as an individual he is not afraid to take on
the powers that be when he believes that our national security is
being done in an improper way, be it deployment or misallocation of
funds. That makes him both a loved and a hated man.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain denies he has taken a hawkish position on Kosovo for
political gain and is unsure whether it will help or hurt his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know and I don't care,'' McCain said. ``If I were to
somehow be guided by my political ambitions, then I would be guilty
of all the things I really did dislike in previous leaders.'' He
said he was referring to the way President Lyndon Johnson initially
played down US involvement in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after McCain was elected to the US House in 1982, he was
pressured to support a request from President Reagan to deploy US
Marines to Beirut. But the freshman Republican bucked his party,
saying he saw nothing for the Marines to do there except hunker
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not see a convergence of US interest and values,''
McCain said, citing his two conditions for military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view seemed prescient when 241 people were killed at
the Marine barracks in Beirut by a suicide bomber in October 1983,
prompting a US pullout.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after the bombing, when Reagan authorized the
invasion of Grenada, McCain backed the intervention because of
concerns that the tiny Caribbean island had become a Soviet
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not, however, approve of Clinton's decision to send
troops to Haiti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Haiti, as deplorable as it is, as distasteful
and odious as those people who are running that country are, is not
worth the sacrifice of any American lives,'' McCain said before
Clinton ordered troops there.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he still believes it was not worth going into Haiti,
saying that ``arguably Haiti now is as bad or worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   When a US mission to relieve starvation in Somalia in 1993
turned into a military effort to track down a warlord, McCain
wanted US troops out of the African nation as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did support the Gulf War in 1991. But three years later,
when Clinton was trying to get backing for military involvement in
Bosnia, McCain at first was against it.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, 1994, when McCain learned that NATO planes were
getting ready to conduct airstrikes in Bosnia, he went to the
Senate floor and said: ``I have long opposed this action. I am very
concerned about the ultimate outcome of the use of air power
without a full commitment of the US forces because I do not believe
it is a viable military option.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said he changed his mind when the Serb leaders in
Bosnia laid siege to Srebrenica, feeling that only US military
pressure would bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1995, McCain was in a quandary. He was helping run
the presidential campaign of Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas
Republican who adamantly opposed putting US forces in Bosnia. But
McCain decided he agreed with Gramm's opponent, Senate majority
leader Bob Dole, who supported the Clinton administration's
proposal for peacekeeping forces in the region. Much to Gramm's
dismay, McCain co-sponsored a resolution with Dole that called for
US ground forces to keep the peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain emphasized that he warned in December 1995 that Clinton's
promise to bring the troops home within a year would never be
fulfilled. Today, 6,400 US troops remain in Bosnia, down from the
original contingent of 20,000. A Pentagon spokesman said there is
no timetable for reducing the remaining force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said ``it was disingenuous'' for Clinton to say in 1995
that the troops would come home in a year, just as it is for
Clinton to now say no ground troops are necessary in Kosovo. That
prompted McCain to introduce his resolution allowing all necessary
force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not originally call for military intervention in
Kosovo. But when he examined the initial airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, he concluded there was no way NATO could oust Serbian
forces in Kosovo without a credible threat of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stated that he fully supports the NATO effort in Kosovo.
Even if Clinton had not ordered the airstrikes, public reaction to
the refugee crisis eventually would have prompted such action, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that if there had been several hundred
thousand refugees in Kosovo and we had declared we would do
nothing, I'm not sure you hold to that position,'' McCain said.
``It does destabilize the region.''

ADMINISTRATION TO SEEK GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER INVESTMENT BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried that Wall Street will soon forget its brush with
financial meltdown six months ago, federal regulators will take
steps and seek new powers to further regulate the trading practices
of investment banks and examine the books of private investment
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, acting on a government report, plans
to introduce legislation soon that, while not calling for direct
regulation of the investment pools for the wealthy known as hedge
funds, will give the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission enhanced powers to examine
the dealings of Wall Street trading firms.
</P>
<P>
   They will also seek congressional backing for rules that require
hedge funds to disclose more information about their borrowing and
trading practices even if that drives some such funds out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report is the product of an investigation into
Wall Street practices that began after the government-brokered
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management last September. Although it
falls short of recommending direct regulation of hedge funds, which
would have provoked strong opposition within the financial
industry, the authorities do plan to adopt fresh powers over
investment banks, which were among the biggest lenders to Long-Term
Capital. The measure would make the Wall Street houses subject to
some of the same controls that commercial banks face.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are part of a long study on financial
borrowing prepared by the nation's top financial regulators, led by
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve. The report was obtained by The New York
Times and is expected to be released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Long-Term Capital's near collapse happened only six
months ago, it is no longer a pressing concern on Wall Street,
where companies are profiting handsomely from buoyant stock and
bond markets. Long-Term Capital was rescued by 14 Wall Street
companies, which injected $3.6 billion at the height of the crisis.
The hedge fund has since posted solid returns and generated profits
for its new owners.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout of Long-Term Capital was orchestrated by the
Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, and regulators said at
the time that the hedge fund's failure might have prompted a
worldwide financial crisis. Officials now argue that the lessons of
that brush with disaster would be lost unless they adopted new
measures designed to limit the risks that financial companies take.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators called the amount of money that Long-Term Capital
borrowed ``extraordinary'' and complained that many of the best
known banks and securities companies adopted ``excessively
liberal'' lending policies. But they said the problem went well
beyond Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LTCM episode illustrates the need for all participants in
our financial system, not only hedge funds, to face constraints in
the amount of leverage they can assume,'' the report says. ``Some
of the same weaknesses that permitted LTCM to achieve its
extraordinary market leverage were evident in other market
participants.''
</P>
<P>
   The report uses strong language to describe the increasing
tendency of financial companies to leverage their bets on financial
markets with borrowed money. It says, for example, that leading
securities firms use even more borrowed money relative to their
capital than Long-Term Capital did. The ratios of borrowed money to
capital at the top five investment banks average 27 to 1, the
report says, a bit higher than Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The securities companies may not be much better able to
withstand a sharp downturn in financial markets than that hedge
fund was, the report says. A collapse of a major Wall Street firm
is widely dreaded because it could have ripple effects on financial
markets everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators did not propose legal limits on borrowing.
Instead, they expressed hope that public scrutiny of borrowing and
trading practices would prompt financial companies to reduce their
risk levels voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not, however, the authorities are threatening much
sterner measures. These include imposing tight capital requirements
on investment banks, not unlike those imposed on banks. The
government is also considering direct regulation of both hedge
funds and derivatives dealers, which are now largely free of
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these steps don't work to reduce the leverage in the
system, then there are other options we can take,'' said one member
of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the
regulatory committee that studied the Long-Term Capital fallout.
``These would be likely to raise a great deal of noise from the
industry, and we are hoping that it will not be necessary to take
these steps.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report mainly recommends that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bank and securities regulators insure that financial companies
adopt better risk management practices, saying that the risk
management system ``broke down'' when companies allowed Long-Term
Capital to borrow so much money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banks and brokerages houses provide a more detailed summary of
their lending to individual borrowers so that both regulators and
other financial companies can spot excessive risk building up.
</P>
<P>
   - Federal authorities take action to insure that other
countries, and particular popular offshore financial centers like
the Cayman Islands, toughen their regulatory policies in tandem
with the strengthened U.S. rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress speed passage of updated bankruptcy laws that would
make it easier for financial companies to allow a hedge fund like
Long-Term Capital to collapse without upsetting the entire
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street executives contacted on Wednesday said they had no
read the report, and most declined to comment. But the proposals on
the whole seem unlikely to prompt a strong protest from banks and
brokerages houses. Many traditionally secretive hedge funds seem
likely to bristle at the demand for more disclosure. But they are
not viewed as a strong industry lobbying group and many already
operate from offshore bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hedge fund industry will object to disclosing more than
they do now. They won't like it,'' said Roy Smith, a professor of
finance at New York University. ``But it's a nuisance they brought
on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the requirements on banks and brokerage firms, Smith said
they sounded moderate. He reflected the views of many in the
financial industry who argue that the Fed may have overreacted to
the Long-Term Capital crisis and that no radical changes are needed
in the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not appear to be a major overhaul in the way things
work now,'' he said. ``That's a wise conclusion for the committee
to reach.''

 &HT;    BB&AMP;T to buy First Liberty
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of First Liberty Financial Corp. jumped 34
percent and reached a 52-week high Wednesday on news that the
Macon-based bank holding company is being acquired for $500 million
by BB&AMP;T Corp., a bank holding company based in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   First Liberty closed Wednesday at $31.06 1/4, up $7.81 1/4,
after hitting a 52-week high of $32.25. BB&AMP;T shares closed at $39,
down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Macon bank has $1.7 billion in assets and 39 branches in
South and Central Georgia. Its net income has nearly doubled since
1995. During the 1990s, it has made several acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   BB&AMP;T has a 580-bank network in North Carolina, South Carolina,
Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. The company was
founded in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price has been on an upswing since 1992. It is now the
fourth-largest bank based in North Carolina and is doing business
in fields such as accounts receivable, insurance, venture capital
and investment banking, spokesman Robert Denham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great deal for First Liberty shareholders,'' said
John Pandtle, bank analyst at Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will involve a stock swap. A First Liberty stockholder
will receive BB&AMP;T shares based on an exchange ratio tied to BB&AMP;T's
stock price at some point before closing. Shareholders of the Macon
bank can expect to receive about 0.85 shares of BB&AMP;T stock for each
First Liberty share they hold. Closing is expected to be in the
fourth quarter, said Richard A. Hills Jr., First Liberty's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hatcher, First Liberty's chief executive, will be
president of BB&AMP;T's Georgia operations.
</P>
<P>
   Pandtle and other analysts expect those to continue to grow.
BB&AMP;T's assets were $37.8 billion at the end of March. In January,
it agreed to buy First Citizens Corp. of Newnan for $126 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing in Georgia is consistent with how they
have built a sizable franchise elsewhere in the Southeast,'' said
Pandtle. ``And there are plenty of opportunities for them to build
a franchise here.

 &HT;    Magazine sees return of old-line stocks
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bull on Wall Street has long since reached the
status of senior citizen, but it still shows no signs of retiring.
If anything, says Business Week (May 3), the stock market might get
a shot of adrenaline, thanks to the shift of investor interest
toward old-line, blue chip industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next phase, we may see what you might call the wiser
bull _ a market that provides a more comprehensive view of the
economy's overall potential, and not just the extraordinary
expectations for a few leaders,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Business Week sees the market's leading
stocks shifting from companies such as America Online, IBM,
Microsoft and Sun Microsystems to Alcoa, Caterpillar, International
Paper and Ingersoll-Rand.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean investor interest will wane for the recently
highflying Internet and other high-tech stocks. ``Technology still
has the greatest profit promise, well ahead of other industries,''
says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But the new buying pattern will broaden the market's base, even
including the stocks of smaller companies at some point.
</P>
<P>
   In the same edition, Business Week makes a case that the Federal
Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan is shifting its focus from
inflation _ which is under control _ to productivity in domestic
policy, and a more global view of finance outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Little guys get a chance
</P>
<P>
   Everybody yearns to get in on the ground floor of a hot new
stock when a company goes public with an initial public offering.
But individual investors rarely get a chance to do this because the
brokerages that underwrite stock offerings hog the initial shares
for themselves and friends _ especially if it is a hot prospect.
</P>
<P>
   But Individual Investor (May) reports that a Silicon Valley
investment banker, William R. Hambrecht, is trying to level the IPO
playing field by offering on the Web the shares of the IPOs his
company underwrites.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking from the ranks of most Wall Street firms, Hambrecht
has been branded as ``a traitor.'' Others suggest that only
desperate companies will do business with his company, W.R.
Hambrecht &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Nobel laureate Milton Friedman pontificates on his inflation
theories in a challenging Forbes (May 3) interview. Calling
inflation the century's dominant economic problem, he says Asia's
recovery may cause more problems for the United States than the
recessions that Asian nations have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investors looking for stocks worth buying should keep an eye
on companies that buy back their own shares, Kiplinger's Personal
Finance Magazine (May) suggests. It's not a sure-fire signal of
undervalued stocks. But one research project showed that stocks of
companies that buy their own shares rose an average of 12 points in
the year after a buyback.

 &HT;    Home Depot fans meet chairman at book signing
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bernie Marcus is likely nursing a sore right hand
today.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and co-founder of Home Depot spent several hours on
Wednesday signing his new tell-all book at a Chapter 11 bookstore.
About 200 people lined up at 7:30 a.m. to get autographed copies of
``Built from Scratch,'' a gritty look back into the making of the
$30 billion company. Written with co-founder and Chief Executive
Arthur Blank, the book tells the tale of two ``regular guys'' who
built a retail empire with scrappy determination.
</P>
<P>
   The book was written for Home Depot employees, Marcus said.
``Every time I visit a store, they want to know how we did it,''
Marcus said during a break. ``Once we started putting the book
together, the memories just poured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Several anecdotes are particularly notable, such as how Ross
Perot came close to being the majority owner of Home Depot during a
desperate search for financing. And then there's the one about the
banker who risked his career to give the company a $3.5 million
loan it needed to survive. In all, it's 300 pages of Home Depot
machismo, sprinkled with profanity and wild drinking parties.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 copies of the book sold Wednesday, said Chapter 11
President Barbara Babbit Kaufman. Home Depot stores are also
carrying the book, which sells for $24.95. Royalties will be
donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those at the book signing were Home Depot employees or
other business people. Customers and shareholders also showed up to
rub elbows with Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend a lot of time in the stores, so I just wanted to meet
Bernie,'' said Jim Cooke, who owns a real estate investment
company. ``I asked him when the stock would split, but he wouldn't
tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Williamson had an additional motive. ``I want to get a
job with the company,'' said Williamson, who was sharply dressed in
an olive-colored suit.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson arrived at 7:45 a.m., planning to chat with Marcus
until he saw the throng. ``I could've have been here at 7 o'clock,
but I didn't want to pounce on the man.

 &HT;    CheckFree reports electronic account glitch
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As many as 500,000 people who do their banking from
PCs using Quicken and Microsoft Money software could be having
trouble accessing their accounts because of problems with
CheckFree's equipment, a spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic payment platform has not crashed, said CheckFree
spokeswoman Laurinda Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Those affected are the software-based home-banking customers of
the 20 banks _ including First Union _ that have been moved to
CheckFree's new Genesis technology platform. Customers have had
intermittent problems since Monday, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first service interruption of this magnitude at
CheckFree, Wilson said. CheckFree processes electronic payments for
2.8 million people and handles 11 million transactions a month.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree said earlier this week it has the potential to manage
70 percent of the telecommunications bills in the country.

 &HT;    MindSpring plans campaign to increase brand awareness
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises plans to add more
content to its Web site (www.mindspring.net) and increase its
advertising and marketing spending to boost national brand
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Wednesday morning, MindSpring Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Charles Brewer told Wall Street analysts
the company would either make the investment itself or seek
partnerships with media companies so it can leverage its portal
presence and turn it into a money-maker. MindSpring has 1.2 million
subscribers, which is a lot of potential eyeballs logging onto its
home page.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the company's growth meant that there were ``a lot
of things we can do on the portal side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can create a much more in-depth portal. ... It's certainly
worthy of more effort from our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Michael McQuary also said the company
would be ramping up its advertising and marketing efforts,
including a foray into television advertising at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brewer still won't comment on plans for the $430
million raised in a recent stock offering. Weeks ago, Brewer told a
group of investors at the Robinson-Humphrey conference he would be
interested in acquiring the Microsoft Network of dial-up
subscribers. Brewer also declined to get into specifics about the
proposed MediaOne/AT&AMP;T acquisition. He restated his position on the
cable industry's need to open lines to competition if it plans to
offer other services, including cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable industry is trying to have us believe that because
they developed a cable service in the past, the rules don't apply
to them. The law says that if you want to provide other services,
the rules do apply.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brewer dismissed any notion that MindSpring might be
carried on MediaOne, McQuary did say the company was talking with a
number of small cable operators about providing MindSpring service
over their wires. He didn't name any.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer also urged analysts to ``stay the course'' with 1999
earnings estimates. First Call estimates for fiscal 1999 are for a
profit of 88 cents a share, including quarterly earnings of 20
cents, 25 cents and 29 cents a share for the second, third and
fourth quarters, respectively.

TWO STUDENTS SHOT BY TRENCHCOAT WEARER, 14 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In a school gun assault with eerie parallels with
last week's murders in Colorado, a 14-year-old student Wednesday
shot two older boys in the hallway of an Alberta high school,
killing one and critically wounding the other.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth grader, who reportedly wore a blue trenchcoat, was
arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police. There was no clear
motive for the violence except that the assailant was widely
regarded as ``depressed'' and ``unpopular,'' and had reportedly
been regularly taunted by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of his victims were in the 11th grade, and reportedly were
only vaguely acquainted with the younger boy.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, who often consider themselves immune from the gun
violence plaguing their southern neighbor, were stunned by the
incident at C. W. Myers High School in the small farming community
of Taber, about 50 miles north of the border with Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 14-year-old male has shot two 17-year-old males at the
school,'' said Cpl. James Johnston of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. ``A suspect was taken into custody at the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to divulge the names of either the victims or the
suspect. Fellow students described the shooter as a loner who had
few friends and had recently stopped attending classes at W. R.
Myers, which has only 440 students. He was reportedly in a home
instruction program for troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis and a catastrophe that no one could even have
imagined occurring in small town Canada,'' said Sharon Holtman, a
member of the school board in the community of 8,000. ``It's like a
bad dream. Only we can't wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooter reportedly offered no resistence when he was taken
into custody by an off-duty police officer working at the school.
The shootings occurred after he entereed the school at lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out of the classroom, I saw his gun right
there,'' Regan Valgardson, a 11th grade student, told CTV News. ``I
asked the guy what he was doing. He told me to get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian news reports said the boy wore a blue trenchcoat. It
was unclear whether his gun was a rifle or handgun, or whether he
intentionally singled out the two victims or whether they were shot
at random.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the regional hospital in nearby Lethbridge,
Alberta, said that the second shooting victim was still in surgery
Wednesday night. The first victim was pronounced dead at a smaller
medical facility in Taber.
</P>
<P>
   The Taber shootings occurred eight days after two students
killed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on
themselves in Littleton, Colordao. The horrific incident was widely
covered in Canada, although many Canadians seemed to view it as
less of a storm warning for their own schools than an indictment of
the United States, whre violent crime is far more prevalent than in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not immune to something like this,'' said Toronto
lawyer Eric Roher, an authority on teen crime. ``Violence also
afflicts our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting at the Alberta high school occurred in the early
afternoon, Rocky Mountain time, according to Canadian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the two students were shot, the principal of the
school ordered all students to report to the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports on the chronology of events.
According to one student, the armed ninth grader first held a gun
to the head of a feamale teacher, screaming ``this is not a joke,''
before stalking into the hallway and shooting the two older
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying, all this week all we'd been talking about is
what happened in Littleton,'' said student Valgardson. ``None of us
could imagine such a thing coming to our little town.''

THE WOODLANDS _ In the car business, if you sell Cadillacs, you
don't put a Mercedes-Benz logo on the hood ornament. If you deal in
Jaguars, you don't borrow engine parts from Lexus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In golf, it's supposed to be the same way. If your course is
lined with trees and filled with forced carries over water and
sand, common sense dictates that the greens be somewhat more spongy
and receptive to approach shots than the nearest freeway overpass.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case this year on the PGA Tour. Too
often, the world's best golfers have been subjected to U.S.
Open-like conditions. Too often, well-played shots have ended up in
bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tell the PGA Tour,'' Payne Stewart said Wednesday,
``is that we'd like to have the courses set up tough, but fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are places this year that they have lost the `fair'
part of that scenario. Some places have been growing rough so high
that it's like we're playing the U.S. Open every week. I don't
think fans get a lot out of that. And it starts testing our
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, the $2.5 million Shell Houston Open will curb
the frustration and offer a return to normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   They call this tournament the SHO. It may also be a SHO-case for
the skills of golf's best before the week is done.
</P>
<P>
   With manageable rough and a little help from Mother Nature, the
Tournament Players Course at The Woodlands should provide the
perfect stage for low scoring this week. Monday's rain softened up
the course and made the greens like dartboards.
</P>
<P>
   If the warm, dry weather of the past two days continues, the
course will dry out and the proverbial ``ideal scoring conditions''
should rule.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a delight to the playing field, if that's the case.
Golfers are no different than other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   They want the chance to make good shots and have those shots
rewarded. They don't like seeing a sand wedge shot take two big
bounces and then roll off the back of the green when the same shot
on the same green last year backed up eight feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, when somebody runs a 100-yard race in
nine seconds, they don't say that it's too fast and now everybody
has to run 103-yard races,'' said Peter Jacobsen. ``But they try to
do that in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody shoots a low score, everybody worries that
conditions are too easy. But usually, it's only one guy who shoots
that score. It doesn't mean you have to start doing things to the
course or start putting pins on the collar of the green next to a
bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   The TPC at The Woodlands has been blessed with a layout that has
played tough without an abundance of trickery. And with the rough a
couple inches shorter than last year, the birdies should start
flying today and the scores ought to be lower than the 72-hole
total of 12-under 276 that has won the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said, ``By the start of the week, we usually know what
the scores are going to be like. At The Players, I knew even-par
was going to be a good score for the week.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see scores well in the red,'' Stewart said. ``This
course is in very good shape, and the greens are so good. The rough
is penal, but it isn't too high. You have to think your way out of
it. But the scores will be lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing compared to the hardship the players have
faced at some courses this year. The Phoenix Open, Bay Hill and The
Players Championship all featured rock-hard greens.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who thrill at approach shots that suck up close to the hole
have all too often been left disappointed when even short-iron
shots bounded hard off the putting surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sport has a wonderful identity with the fans, but if we
continue to be tested with hard, fast greens surrounded by
five-inch rough, we will lose our patience,'' Stewart said. ``We
will lose our professionalism as athletes, and fans are not going
to want to see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a steady diet of that gets real old in a hurry. I
think fans would rather see us making birdies than us chopping out
shots from thick rough around the green and making bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take The Players Championship (last month). David Duval was
leading the tournament and shot 2-over-par over the last two rounds
and still won. I don't think fans want to see that every week. They
want to see some shots that show how good players out here really
are. You want to get those `oohs' that come with great
shot-making.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jacobsen said: ``The silliest thing is when they've got four
or five inches of rough around the greens. When you see that, you
might as well take Seve Ballesteros and Tom Watson and guys like
that out of the record books. Part of the reason they were so great
is they were so good with their games around the green.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, there will be no such problems around the green. What
is uncertain is whom the conditions will favor.
</P>
<P>
   Duval enters as the pre-tournament favorite, as he does in every
event he plays. But with birdie opportunities throughout the
course, anybody who gets a hot putter will be a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is coming off a second-place finish at the MCI Classic
two weeks ago, when he lost in a playoff. It was the 25th runner-up
finish of his pro career to go with 10 victories. Other than Tom
Kite, no active player on the regular tour has more second-place
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know how other people view it,'' Stewart said
of his flair for near misses. ``But I feel like it's a sign that I
get myself into position a lot. And that's why I'm out here _ to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I couldn't go out there and defend Glen Day's putt (to
win on the first playoff hole at the MCI two weeks ago). I was
looking at a putt to win the tournament, then he makes his and I'm
looking at my putt now just to stay in it. There's not much you can
do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Except come back firing again this week. And the targets should
be a little easier to hit than at some tour stops this year.

COMPANY THAT DETECTED COMPUTER SECURITY FLAW IS UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When privacy advocates first sounded alarms in
January about a serial number that Intel Corp. had embedded in its
new Pentium III processor, the company quickly responded by
distributing software that enabled owners of Pentium III computers
to hide the number. But it now appears that the problem is not
solved and is not about to fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a researcher at a small Canadian software company found
a way to make the hidden serial number hidden visible again to
prying eyes _ and without the owner's realizing it. Acting in what
it says is the public interest, the company, Zero-Knowledge Systems
of Montreal, placed a program on its Web site demonstrating the
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Intel is responding more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an Intel executive called executives at
Symantec Corp., maker of the popular Norton anti-virus software,
and told them that the demonstration program was ``hostile code.''
</P>
<P>
   Symantec agreed that the program fit its definition of a type of
malicious program known as a Trojan horse, so it included the
software in its continually updated list of dangerous programs,
which include viruses, that cause warnings to pop up on its
customers' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, users of the Norton anti-virus software who visit the
Zero-Knowledge site get a warning that they are about to download a
virus.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, one man's virus is another's diagnostic tool.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Zero-Knowledge said they were being unfairly
portrayed as outlaws by Intel. Zero-Knowledge, which employs about
40 people, develops software that enables Web surfers to protect
their identity on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a virus,'' said Austin Hill, president
Zero-Knowledge. ``It was simply a demonstration of a software
flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   He also disputed Intel's assertion that the demonstration
program, which locks up a computer and forces the user to reboot,
was destructive software. And unlike typical authors of virus
software, the company clearly identified itself with a digital
signature embedded in the program, a type of Windows-specific
software known as an Active-X control.
</P>
<P>
   The serial number is a volatile issue for Intel. The
introduction of the feature, which Intel said was designed to
increase computer security, touched off a boycott against the
company by some privacy groups, which not only insisted that the
serial number would fail to protect security but warned that it
enabled direct marketers, data-mining companies and others to track
the paths of Web surfers more easily.
</P>
<P>
   After the controversy erupted earlier this year, Intel, which
makes about 85 percent of the world's microprocessors, the nerve
center of personal computers, responded by saying that it would
work with computer makers to insure that the serial number was
switched off by default when personal computers were shipped to
stores or customers. A computer user could then turn the number on
if it was needed for a particular application.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executive vice president Paul Otellini said corporate
customers were demanding the feature, but that the company was
still evaluating the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   The software that secretly turns on the Intel serial number was
demonstrated by Ian Goldberg, chief scientist at Zero-Knowledge.
Goldberg, a graduate student in computer science at the University
of California at Berkeley, is a member of an advocacy group of
computer security researchers who assert that network security is
enhanced by publicly demonstrating the shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg says it is virtually impossible to permanently switch
off Intel's serial number. Zero-Knowledge's software turns it back
on by inserting a command in the computer's basic input/output
system, or BIOS, chip. The BIOS hold a computer's most basic
instructions, the ones that tell it to look for disk drives and an
operating system, for example, when the computer is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to switching the serial number on, the software
recalculates a protection feature known as a checksum, making it
extremely difficult to detect the tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Mike Sullivan acknowledged that there was no
perfect way to keep the number hidden, he but insisted that the
company was acting prudently to work with the industry to build
stronger defenses against tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has been discussing the vulnerability with Zero-Knowledge,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sullivan, the Intel executive who called Symantec, said he
did so because the Zero-Knowledge program left a copy of the serial
number from the user's processor on the company's Web site and
because it caused the user's computer to crash.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Intel had worked with Symantec before to combat
viruses and had engaged Zero-Knowledge in a discussion about the
problem almost immediately after notifying Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec executives said they were standing by their
determination that the Zero-Knowledge demonstration was a dangerous
program because it made the user's computer crash.
</P>
<P>
   And though Zero-Knowledge warns users that their machines will
freeze up, Enrique Salem, vice president for Symantec's security
business, said: ``If someone has work that hasn't been saved, it
will be lost as a result of running the demonstration. I really
want to make sure that we do things to protect our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Zero-Knowledge digitally signed the program, he
said, did not protect users from potential abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Knowledge said its brand had been damaged unfairly by
Symantec's characterizing the demonstration as a virus.
</P>
<P>
   One annoyed user sent an e-mail to Zero-Knowledge saying: ``My
Norton AV detected a trojan virus when I clicked on the breaking
news link. If you can't even manage your own site, there's no way
I'm going to do business with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the anger its demonstration has engendered,
Zero-Knowledge insists that the bottom line is that Intel chose the
wrong way to protect user security.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serial number is a bad way to protect someone,'' Hill said.
``It can be stolen or it can be spoofed, and it links
authentication to a computer and not a person.''

DE NIRO AND MIRAMAX PLAN A FILM STUDIO FOR THE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Actor Robert De Niro and Miramax Films plan to
announce a tentative deal with city officials to build a $150
million Hollywood-style film studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the
sprawling complex where tens of thousands of workers once built and
launched warships and tankers.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives on both sides of the negotiations, the
proposed movie studio would include 12 sound stages in three
buildings on a 15-acre site within the Navy Yard and would employ
thousands of people. It would be used by De Niro's TriBeCa
Productions, Miramax Films and other companies in the industry,
which have overrun New York in recent years, spending $2.6 billion
last year alone on crews, equipment, supplies and services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $150 million plan faces major obstacles, particularly
regarding its financing and questions about the long-term viability
of such a venture. The project's backers are investing $35 million;
they have already raised an additional $35 million from city
government sources, and will need another $80 million in financing,
people involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth of film and television production in New
York, the plan to develop the Navy Yard into film studios has had a
tortured history ever since it was first suggested last June. But
De Niro, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, and another
partner in the venture, Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty
Trust, are expected to take an important step at the Navy Yard
Monday by signing a nonbinding letter of intent to go ahead with
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Even as recently as last week, the negotiations nearly unraveled
over a rent dispute between officials at the Navy Yard and the
studio group. After frantic meetings over the weekend, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani met with De Niro and Weinstein on Monday at Gracie
Mansion and put the deal back on track. The meetings were first
reported Wednesday in The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The studio group, which is led by De Niro, has been hampered by
insufficient financing. A week ago, however, Union Labor Life
Insurance Co., a union-supported pension fund that has invested in
New York real estate projects, notified the group and the city that
it is considering whether to finance or invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a hard look at it,'' said Michael Steed, senior
vice president for investments at Union Life in Washington. ``It's
clear that New York doesn't have enough studios to handle both the
television and film production that could take place there. What's
unclear to us is exactly what types of studios should be there _
film or television _ and where they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the tentative deal, the city would provide a
$25 million, low-interest loan and the city's Brooklyn Navy Yard
Development Corp., which oversees the industrial park there, would
contribute up to $10 million in cash. The rent would rise from
almost nothing to market rates over the term of a 50-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent participant in the talks has been the Fisher real
estate family, a major Manhattan landlord. The Fishers would
oversee construction and, possibly, become a partner in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   A deal would not only rejuvenate an area that was long a main
source of the city's economic muscle, but would also provide growth
space for the city's booming film industry. The number of feature
films shot in New York City soared to 221 last year, up from 69 in
1993. During the same period, the number of television production
shooting days jumped to 7,680, from 3,598. But most of the
post-production work is done elsewhere and many companies prefer to
shoot interior shots in Toronto or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of small sound stages in New York already,
including Chelsea Piers, home to ``Law and Order'' and ``Spin
City,'' and Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, where ``Sesame
Street'' and the ``Cosby Show'' are recorded. But a number of
proposed projects have had difficulty finding financial support
because the stages, which require a large investment, are generally
at the mercy of filmmakers who do not want to pay a lot of money
for short periods of work.
</P>
<P>
   Union Life had planned to finance Hudson River Studios, a
proposed $120 television sound stage atop the St. John's Center, at
Houston and West Streets on the West Side of Manhattan. But when
the developer ran into delays in acquiring additional financing,
Union Life withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Shooting Gallery, an independent film production
company, announced plans to build a $75 million movie lot in the
metropolitan area in Harrison, N.J. In the end, the company scaled
back its plans for 15 sound stages and opened a $5 million
production center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough, very fluid business that's hard to keep
going,'' said Hal G. Rosenbluth, president of Kaufman Astoria
Studios. ``If Harry and Bob can fill the studio with their own work
then they're way ahead of the game.''

HOUSE BARS GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL OK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a heated and sometimes anquished debate, the
House voted On Wednesday to bar President Clinton from sending
ground troops to Yugoslavia without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed 249-180 as lawmakers weighed how to respond to a
policy in the Balkans that many called flawed and others defended
as a just cause. Forty-five Democrats and one independent joined
203 Republicans to support the bill. Sixteen Republicans and 164
Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In an an even stronger sign of the sharp division over Kosovo,
on Wednesday evening the House defeated in a 213-213 tie a
Democratic resolution supporting the president's policy of NATO air
strikes. In this case, 31 Republicans broke with the majority of
their party to support the air campaign, and 26 Democrats voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The all-day session marked the first formal congressional debate
since NATO began its bombing campaign on March 24 in an effort to
drive the forces of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic out of
Kosovo. The Senate had voted on March 23 to approve the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said after the vote on ground
forces, ``I would hope that the president would take this diverse
debate as a signal that he should better explain the goals, the
costs and the long-term strategy of why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the two party leaders were working behind the
scenes to see if they could draft bipartisan compromise language on
Kosovo looking toward a vote as early as Friday. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict and
is now seeking his party's presidential nomination, has introduced
his own resolution authorizing Clinton to use ''all necessary
force'' to win in the Balkans, but Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, has objected to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday,
President Clinton once again said he had no plans for ground troops
and vowed that he would seek congressional ``support'' if he
changed that stance. But he would not seek congressional approval,
his spokesman Joe Lockhart said, arguing that such a step would
raise a host of constitutional questions. While Lockhart stopped
short of a veto threat, Democrats in the House said the president
would veto any measure requiring such approval of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long day of debate, some House members invoked
the quagmire of Vietnam to call for America to withdraw from the
Balkans. Others drew comparisons with World War II and the
Holocaust to argue for the air campaign to go on. And Rep. Gene
Taylor, D-Miss., urged the rare step of a full declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in voting for war I will share the responsibility
for those young Americans who may die,'' Taylor said. ``But to do
anything else is much worse. The best course of aciton for this
nation is to use the overwhelming military might we have at our
disposal to end this war swiftly and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had tried in the past to discourage such open
debate in Congress about the Kosovo conflict in the hopes of
sending a united message to Yugoslavia and to present a unified
voice of support for the troops. Until now, the Republican
leadership had also shied away from such a debate, with some senior
Republicans calculating that their party would be best served by
distancing itself from the conflict and letting President Clinton
take any blame for involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
Willam Cohen argued in a letter to Hastert that a prohibition on
ground troops ``could be misinterpreted as a U.S. retrenchment''
from its solidarity with NATO, and would impede the president in
his role as commander in chief. But the Administration's effort to
influence the House vote was low key and the White House was not
demanding party-line support.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debates were forced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
who used his prerogatives under the Vietnam-era War Powers
resolution to force votes on what he has called an unconstitutional
war, undeclared by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we're at war,'' said Campbell, who is a law professor.
We're on the verge of ground troops. The framers were quite clear
that war was too important to be decided by one individual. Ground
troops are very seriously being considered. Therefore we must
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Working its way through an array of proposals, the House
overwhelmingly rejected the measure to issue a formal declaration
of war against Yugoslavia by a vote of 2-427. The House also
declined, by a vote of 139-290, to call for an immediate withdrawal
of all American forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans poured out their reservations about a conflict
they said had ill-defined goals and was not in the nation's vital
interest. ``Was it worth it to stay in Vietnam to save face?''
asked Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip. Sharply criticizing the
NATO bombing campaign, DeLay said, ``What good has been
accomplished so far? Absolutely nothing. What long term goal will
be accomplished by having our troops there? None unless you're
willing to occupy all of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, of Ohio and another of the many Republicans
seeking his party's presidential nomination, said, ``The fact is
the civil war in Kosovo has been raging since 1389.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich added, ``The fact is our intervening in the mdidle of an
ethnic civil war that has been going on for six centuries is not
likely to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Charlies Norwood, R-Ga., predicted that if Congress did
not act, the President ``will commit our grandchildren to policing
the Balkans. Not because we are threatened. Not because we are
under attack. But simply to enforce a new world order.''
</P>
<P>
   The many Democrats who rallied around Clinton invoked memories
of the Holocaust to cry out for help for ethnic Albanians. They
said the ban on ground troops without authorization would hamstring
NATO commanders, force the courts to decide what constituted ground
troops and sent the wrong message to Milosevic. Some said the
bill's restrictions on what it termed ``ground elements'' were so
vague that they could be interpreted as banning financing for the
support troops already in Albania and the Balkan region with the
Apache helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to say to him today, `we don't know what
we're doing, we probably won't be for ground troops?''' implored
Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, ``You want to take that
option off the table? I dont think so.''

strength. What is America supposed to do? Look the other way?''
</P>

war,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. ``The failure of the
bombing campaign is proof.''

KRAFT TURNABOUT WOULD BE A WORLD RECORD, ROWLAND SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ This buttoned-down capital, long a
minor-league way station &UR;  &LR; between Boston and New York, is counting
on elemental economics to preserve its ticket to the big leagues:
Bob Kraft knows a sweet deal when he sees one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kraft does (leave) it'll go down in the Guinness Book of
World Records as one of the more interesting turnabouts,'' Governor
John Rowland said in an interview with the Globe Wednesday. ``Why
would someone walk away from a $374 million publicly financed deal
to go build your own facility on your own dime?''
</P>
<P>
   As officials in Boston celebrated an 11th-hour, $70 million deal
designed to stop Kraft and the New England Patriots from moving to
a riverfront site here, the architects of one of the nation's most
generous publicly financed stadium deals pronounced Massachusetts'
efforts stingy by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium boosters, including state government leaders and many
business executives, insist Kraft will stick with the deal he
hammered out in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a signed agreement with Kraft,'' Thomas Ritter, the
former Democratic speaker of Connecticut's House of Representatives
and a staunch stadium supporter, said. ``I don't care how many
meetings there are in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of a deal in Boston lit up the lines on the city's
talk-show circuit and prompted Rowland to emerge from his office,
greeting reporters with buckets of rhetorical cold water. Logic and
reason, he said, lean toward Hartford, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no butterflies in my stomach,'' the Republican governor
said later in a shirtsleeve interview in his capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three discussions among some political leaders do not
make for a very sophisticated proposal to accommodate an NFL
franchise and all the things that go into it,'' Rowland said. ``We
have thousands and thousands of hours invested in this. We have
millions and millions of dollars invested in this. And we're
actually working with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he last spoke with Kraft about a week ago, and the
team owner told him his commitment to Hartford is absolute.
Hartford has already spent over $2 million on the stadium
initiative, including paying for soil tests for architectural
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he going back to?'' Rowland asked. ``It's not an
emotional issue. It's a financial issue. He's got to be able to
afford his team. I mean the bottom line is that to be able to
afford NFL franchises these days, and pay the players what you have
to and all the rest, yes, you do need a good media market. But you
also have to have the revenues to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is those revenues that enraged some Connecticut conservatives
who argued that Rowland and other stadium supporters were duped by
Kraft, blinded by the glitter that accompanies modern major-league
sports. The deal Rowland signed with Kraft not only calls for
taxpayers to foot the bill for stadium construction, it also
promises the owner revenues from luxury box seats, concessions, and
parking, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Connecticut plan Wednesday rooted for a Kraft
double-reverse that would land him back in Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal was a bad deal to begin with and, frankly, I hope
they stay in Boston because of the cost to the state. It's too much
for the taxpayers to bear.'' said State Senator Edith G. Prague, a
Democrat from Columbia who had opposed the deal. ``Now the NFL is
saying that they may contribute to the cost of the stadium in
Massachusetts, and they're not contributing a dime here. Let them
stay in Foxborough. I will shed no tears and neither will the
taxpayers who are praying that this deal falls apart. We simply
cannot afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk-show host Tom Scott of New Haven said the
negotiations in Boston confirmed his suspicions Kraft was just
using Connecticut to get the best deal in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kraft should be careful not to let the door to the state
border hit him in the backside on his way out of Connecticut,''
said Scott, a former Republican state senator. ``His arrogance and
contempt for the taxpayers of Connecticut is something that hasn't
been seen around here in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patriot fans, like 39-year-old John X. Smith, the Boston
deal would bring frustration after the enormous excitement the
advent of the Patriots had stirred up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kraft is going to stick it to Hartford. I really do,''
Smith said Wednesday in a downtown park. ``I think he's going to
stay put. And I was really looking forward to watching the games
here until this last-minute deal came up.''
</P>
<P>
   But most fans were more sanguine. Money, they said, talks. And
if there's anything that a businessman like Kraft understands, it's
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a real sweet deal here,'' said Wesley Stewart, 64, a
retiree who lives near the stadium site. ``I think he's going to
come. I don't think that Boston can top that deal that he has. No
way. Kraft is a wheeler-dealer and he wheeled and dealed this deal.
The state will be dishing out a lot of money for a long time.''

HOUSE BARS GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL OK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a heated and sometimes anguished debate, the
House voted On Wednesday to bar President Clinton from sending
ground troops to Yugoslavia without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed 249-180 as lawmakers weighed how to respond to a
policy in the Balkans that many called flawed and others defended
as a just cause. Forty-five Democrats and one independent joined
203 Republicans to support the bill. Sixteen Republicans and 164
Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In an an even stronger sign of the sharp division over Kosovo,
on Wednesday evening the House defeated in a 213-213 tie a
Democratic resolution supporting the president's policy of NATO air
strikes. In this case, 31 Republicans broke with the majority of
their party to support the air campaign, and 26 Democrats voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   The all-day session marked the first formal congressional debate
since NATO began its bombing campaign on March 24 in an effort to
drive the forces of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic out of
Kosovo. The Senate had voted on March 23 to approve the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said after the vote on ground
forces, ``I would hope that the president would take this diverse
debate as a signal that he should better explain the goals, the
costs and the long-term strategy of why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the two party leaders were working behind the
scenes to see if they could draft bipartisan compromise language on
Kosovo looking toward a vote as early as Friday. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict and
is now seeking his party's presidential nomination, has introduced
his own resolution authorizing Clinton to use ''all necessary
force'' to win in the Balkans, but Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, has objected to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday,
President Clinton once again said he had no plans for ground troops
and vowed that he would seek congressional ``support'' if he
changed that stance. But he would not seek congressional approval,
his spokesman Joe Lockhart said, arguing that such a step would
raise a host of constitutional questions. While Lockhart stopped
short of a veto threat, Democrats in the House said the president
would veto any measure requiring such approval of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long day of debate, some House members invoked
the quagmire of Vietnam to call for America to withdraw from the
Balkans. Others drew comparisons with World War II and the
Holocaust to argue for the air campaign to go on. And Rep. Gene
Taylor, D-Miss., urged the rare step of a full declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in voting for war I will share the responsibility
for those young Americans who may die,'' Taylor said. ``But to do
anything else is much worse. The best course of action for this
nation is to use the overwhelming military might we have at our
disposal to end this war swiftly and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had tried in the past to discourage such open
debate in Congress about the Kosovo conflict in the hopes of
sending a united message to Yugoslavia and to present a unified
voice of support for the troops. Until now, the Republican
leadership had also shied away from such a debate, with some senior
Republicans calculating that their party would be best served by
distancing itself from the conflict and letting President Clinton
take any blame for involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen argued in a letter to Hastert that a prohibition on
ground troops ``could be misinterpreted as a U.S. retrenchment''
from its solidarity with NATO, and would impede the president in
his role as commander in chief. But the Administration's effort to
influence the House vote was low key and the White House was not
demanding party-line support.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debates were forced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
who used his prerogatives under the Vietnam-era War Powers
resolution to force votes on what he has called an unconstitutional
war, undeclared by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we're at war,'' said Campbell, who is a law professor.
We're on the verge of ground troops. The framers were quite clear
that war was too important to be decided by one individual. Ground
troops are very seriously being considered. Therefore we must
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Working its way through an array of proposals, the House
overwhelmingly rejected the measure to issue a formal declaration
of war against Yugoslavia by a vote of 2-427. The House also
declined, by a vote of 139-290, to call for an immediate withdrawal
of all American forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans poured out their reservations about a conflict
they said had ill-defined goals and was not in the nation's vital
interest. ``Was it worth it to stay in Vietnam to save face?''
asked Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip. Sharply criticizing the
NATO bombing campaign, DeLay said, ``What good has been
accomplished so far? Absolutely nothing. What long term goal will
be accomplished by having our troops there? None unless you're
willing to occupy all of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, of Ohio and another of the many Republicans
seeking his party's presidential nomination, said, ``The fact is
the civil war in Kosovo has been raging since 1389.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich added, ``The fact is our intervening in the middle of an
ethnic civil war that has been going on for six centuries is not
likely to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., predicted that if Congress did
not act, the President ``will commit our grandchildren to policing
the Balkans. Not because we are threatened. Not because we are
under attack. But simply to enforce a new world order.''
</P>
<P>
   The many Democrats who rallied around Clinton invoked memories
of the Holocaust to cry out for help for ethnic Albanians. They
said the ban on ground troops without authorization would hamstring
NATO commanders, force the courts to decide what constituted ground
troops and sent the wrong message to Milosevic. Some said the
bill's restrictions on what it termed ``ground elements'' were so
vague that they could be interpreted as banning financing for the
support troops already in Albania and the Balkan region with the
Apache helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to say to him today, `we don't know what
we're doing, we probably won't be for ground troops?''' implored
Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, ``You want to take that
option off the table? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic whip said, ``Some say the
suffering Kosovars are not America's responsibility. That the gang
rapes, the burned villages, the mass graves are not our problem.''
He added ``We are a superpower at the peak of our prosperity and
strength. What is America supposed to do? Look the other way?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Democrats agreed. ``We cannot win peace through
war,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. ``The failure of the
bombing campaign is proof.''

TWO STUDENTS SHOT BY TRENCHCOAT WEARER, 14 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MONTREAL _ In a school gun assault with eerie parallels with
last week's murders in Colorado, a 14-year-old student Wednesday
shot two older boys in the hallway of an Alberta high school,
killing one and critically wounding the other.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth grader, who reportedly wore a blue trenchcoat, was
arrested by Royal Canadian Mounted Police. There was no clear
motive for the violence except that the assailant was widely
regarded as ``depressed'' and ``unpopular,'' and had reportedly
been regularly taunted by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of his victims were in the 11th grade, and reportedly were
only vaguely acquainted with the younger boy.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, who often consider themselves immune from the gun
violence plaguing their southern neighbor, were stunned by the
incident at C. W. Myers High School in the small farming community
of Taber, about 50 miles north of the border with Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 14-year-old male has shot two 17-year-old males at the
school,'' said Cpl. James Johnston of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. ``A suspect was taken into custody at the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to divulge the names of either the victims or the
suspect. Fellow students described the shooter as a loner who had
few friends and had recently stopped attending classes at W. R.
Myers, which has only 440 students. He was reportedly in a home
instruction program for troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis and a catastrophe that no one could even have
imagined occurring in small town Canada,'' said Sharon Holtman, a
member of the school board in the community of 8,000. ``It's like a
bad dream. Only we can't wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooter reportedly offered no resistence when he was taken
into custody by an off-duty police officer working at the school.
The shootings occurred after he entereed the school at lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out of the classroom, I saw his gun right
there,'' Regan Valgardson, a 11th grade student, told CTV News. ``I
asked the guy what he was doing. He told me to get lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian news reports said the boy wore a blue trenchcoat. It
was unclear whether his gun was a rifle or handgun, or whether he
intentionally singled out the two victims or whether they were shot
at random.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the regional hospital in nearby Lethbridge,
Alberta, said that the second shooting victim was still in surgery
Wednesday night. The first victim was pronounced dead at a smaller
medical facility in Taber.
</P>
<P>
   The Taber shootings occurred eight days after two students
killed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on
themselves in Littleton, Colordao. The horrific incident was widely
covered in Canada, although many Canadians seemed to view it as
less of a storm warning for their own schools than an indictment of
the United States, whre violent crime is far more prevalent than in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not immune to something like this,'' said Toronto
lawyer Eric Roher, an authority on teen crime. ``Violence also
afflicts our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting at the Alberta high school occurred in the early
afternoon, Rocky Mountain time, according to Canadian news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the two students were shot, the principal of the
school ordered all students to report to the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports on the chronology of events.
According to one student, the armed ninth grader first held a gun
to the head of a feamale teacher, screaming ``this is not a joke,''
before stalking into the hallway and shooting the two older
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying, all this week all we'd been talking about is
what happened in Littleton,'' said student Valgardson. ``None of us
could imagine such a thing coming to our little town.''

HOSPITAL ADMITS 19 CANCER DIAGNOSIS ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE AND RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began around the first of this year, when a biopsy report on
a patient at an Attleboro, Mass. hospital turned up positive for
prostate cancer, triggering doubts about a negative test three
years ago on the same patient.
</P>
<P>
   A review of 279 prostate tissue tests at the hospital confirmed
that the ones on that patient and 18 others had been misread, with
the patients being told they didn't have prostate cancer when they
did.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials at Sturdy Memorial are reviewing 6,000 additional
biopsies for conditions ranging from breast cancer to skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe there are problems with any of
the others. But we wanted our patients and medical staff to have
confidence and rest easy about all the findings from that period''
about which questions were raised, which was from the start of 1995
through the end of 1997, Linda Shyavitz, Sturdy's president and
CEO, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The two pathologists who misread the tests, she added, have not
been on Sturdy's staff since 1997 and the errors have been reported
to the cancer patients or their families, as well as to the state
Department of Public Health and the Board of Registration in
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 19 patients have died, ``but we are absolutely
certain that their deaths are not a result of misread biopsies.
They died from completely unrelated reasons,'' said Shyavitz. As
for the health of the remaining 17, she said, ``I have no knowledge
of that because of patient confidentiality. I have no answer to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The two issues involved in the Sturdy case have been big news
lately. Awareness of prostate cancer has been growing rapidly, in
part because it is so widespread; an estimated 179,000 men in
America are likely to be diagnosed with the disease this year and
37,000 are likely to die from it. Hospital errors also have been
shown to be pervasive, with more than 1 million occurring each year
in the United States, 100,000 of which are deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdy has been at the forefront of efforts by Bay State
hospitals to uncover such errors, which health watchers say is why
the hospital responded so aggressively once it learned about the
problems in its pathology department from 1995 to 1997. The initial
misreading of a biopsy on a prostate cancer patient was uncovered
earlier this year by a urologist, who saw a positive test result
that contradicted a test from 1996. Further review confirmed that
the 1996 test also was positive, although it was misread as
negative by the Sturdy pathologist working on the case then.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 20 prostate tests on 19 patients were shown to have
been misread, and the patients or their next of kin were notified
in late March and early April, Shyavitz said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sturdy declined to name the two doctors who performed the
erroneous biopsies, and state officials declined to comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital did approximately 15,000 biopsies during the
1995-97 period, but it is reviewing only the 6,000 involving
conditions where the tests could have affected diagnoses. Ones
involving procedures such as knee replacements or hernias are done
as a matter of routine but even if they were misread the results
would not have affected the treatment, the CEO added.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor would order a biopsy of the prostate after suspicions
of possible cancer were raised by the results of two simpler tests.
One is the digital rectal exam, in which a doctor feels the surface
of the prostate: hardness, enlargement, or lumps might indicate a
tumor. The other is a screening test, the PSA or prostate-specific
antigen, which measures the level of a chemical in the bloodstream
that is produced by the prostate and is elevated in prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The biopsy is carried out by rectally inserting a probe that
fires a hollow needle into the prostate to remove a tiny core of
tissue. Normally, several cores are obtained in different parts of
the prostate to determine the extent of the cancer, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Misreading diagnostic tests is relatively common, although
erroneous biopsies are rarer, said Andrew C. Meyer Jr., a leading
medical malpractice lawyer in Boston. His office currently is
pursuing two cases of alleged misreading of prostate cancer
biopsies, neither of which was at the Attleboro hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since most prostate cancer is slow-growing, the Sturdy patients
who received falsely negative biopsy results might not have been
significantly endangered by the delay in diagnosis, said Dr. Eric
Small, a urological cancer specialist at the University of
California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   If the pathologist wrongly read the biopsies as normal, it might
be because the cancer cells were in early stages of malignancy, he
explained. If so, ``it's still not excusable, but there would be
less clinical impact'' than if the error involved a more advanced
stage of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably in the cases of the 19 men, the men's doctors would
have been faced with a puzzlingly negative biopsy reading after PSA
and digital exam findings that were suspicious. Actually, said
Small, ``that's not an unusual scenario'' because prostate cancers
detected by PSA readings may not be big enough to be caught by a
biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   But in such a situation, the oncologist added, ``the men
shouldn't have been told just to relax and not worry.'' Rather, the
doctor should have had the PSA test repeated in six months or a
year. And if the PSA reading continued to rise, he said, the doctor
would likely have ordered a repeat biopsy.

UNOVA MOVING COMPANY BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Unova Inc. of Beverly Hills started
out life as the commercial business division of defense giant
Litton Industries Inc., which about five years ago spun it off into
a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years apart, the former relatives are about to
become neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, Unova moves from its oversized Beverly Hills
headquarters to a smaller base in the Warner Center area of Los
Angeles' suburban Woodland Hills, barely a block from the company
that once owned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like going home again. We'll be neighbors,'' said Jacquie
Hook, Unova's manager of corporate communications. ``But the
businesses won't be connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The close proximity wasn't planned that way, said Dirk Koerber,
Unova's vice president of corporate affairs and investor relations.
``It's purely accidental,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unova, a $2 billion maker of industrial automation and
data-collection and computing systems, is Litton's relative
twice-removed. To concentrate on defense engineering and
electronics, Litton spun off its commercial business division in
1994. That spun-off business became Western Atlas.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Houston-based Western Atlas, now
concentrating on oil services, in turn spun off the division that
eventually became Unova.
</P>
<P>
   Litton, incidentally, also relocated from Beverly Hills and is
now in Warner Center. It's just a few blocks from 20th Century
Industries, also a transplant from Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Unova became smaller with each spinoff, and company officials
recently concluded that the 125,000-square-foot headquarters in
Beverly Hills is too big for about 80 home office employees. The
company has a worldwide work force of about 10,000, Hook said.
</P>
<P>
   Through its pension plan, the company has bought the three-story
Woodland Hills building where it will occupy the third floor and,
when the current tenants' leases expire, part of the second,
according to Hook.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the move interested Litton officials, who were
amused by the irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would welcome them to the neighborhood,'' said Randy Belote,
Litton's director of media relations.

SCHOOL GUNMEN WERE PREPARING FOR COLLEGE, MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ At the same time Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold were making elaborate plans to cut short the futures of
hundreds of their classmates, they were also preparing for their
own futures in college and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to appease their parents, one of the boys spent the
weeks before their April 20 massacre scouting a college campus,
while the other was impressing Marine Corps recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the details that have emerged about the pair, their
planning for the future was a bizarre contrast to the deadly scheme
they had spent months plotting.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's yearlong diary, which mapped a plan to execute 500
people and blow up Columbine High School, also laid out an escape
that would take the pair to an unnamed island. But the two also
agreed to kill themselves if it became clear that they would be
caught, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to go to Mexico, or find an island someplace to
get away from America,'' said Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone.
Another scenario offered by Harris was that the two might somehow
be able to hijack a plane to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   However implausible their escape plans, officials said, Klebold
and Harris did carry out the initial steps of their assault plan,
following logistics on timing and location.
</P>
<P>
   After gunning down 12 students and a teacher, the boys killed
themselves, each firing a single shotgun blast to his head. Police
speculate that Klebold's and Harris's escape attempt was foiled
when a police officer standing in an exit fired at one of the
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   As police Wednesday continued to prepare a detailed timeline of
the events on April 20, officials Wednesday said that Klebold's
girlfriend and prom date, Robyn Anderson, purchased a rifle and two
sawed-off shotguns that were used in the shooting. On Tuesday,
officials had said she purchased two of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   They reiterated that the 18-year-old Anderson has cooperated
with requests for interviews and that she is not a suspect. They
continue trying to determine whether she was aware the weapons
would be used in a deadly shooting spree. It is illegal for a
person to provide guns if the person knows the weapons will be used
for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials are reviewing a videotape from the surveillance
camera in the school's cafeteria, but Jefferson County law
enforcement officials said Wednesday they had no indication that a
third gunman, or accomplice, was on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Several student witnesses have said they told police that a
third gunman, a former student and member of the Trenchcoat Mafia,
was inside the school Tuesday morning. Those witnesses said they
saw the teen running through the halls wielding a gun, but not
firing it.
</P>
<P>
   In response, officials said they continue to interview friends
and acquaintences of Klebod and Harris, but did not name any
suspects. ``Keep in mind, there are a lot of people, in our minds,
who have not been cleared yet,'' Sheriff's Department spokesman
Steve Davis said at an afternoon press conference.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say police had cleared three teenagers who were
arrested as they watched the chaos at the school April 20 from a
nearby hill in Clement Park.
</P>
<P>
   The three had raised suspicions because they arrived at their
vantage point so soon after the first shots rang out, and because
at least one of their jackets bore an emblem _ a crucifix with a
slash through it _ that members of the Trenchcoat Mafia sometimes
wore.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement officials now say that they do not consider
the three teens accomplices, and that the sheriff had misspoken
Tuesday night when he said the trio was the focus of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators Wednesday also interviewed an employee at a
Littleton hardware store, according to a store manager and police.
Police say that the employee told them that he sold propane tanks,
nails, and duct tape to Harris and Klebold, and that he copied a
set of keys for the teens, although they were marked ``do not
duplicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said investigators have learned that a set of keys to the
schools are missing, and officials theorize the pair stole the keys
so they would have access to the school and be able to place as
many as 60 homemade explosives and a propane bomb before the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But while they were laying out their deadly plan, Harris and
Klebold also appeared to be moving ahead with their lives. Five
days before the shootings, Harris, the son of a retired Air Force
pilot, was rejected by the Marine Corps because of his medical
history, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the teenager reportedly say Harris had been
prescribed a psychiatric drug.
</P>
<P>
   Marine First Lieutenant Jeff Sammons confirmed Wednesday that
Harris's name, along with other interested students, was provided
to recruiters by Columbine officials.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, Harris was interviewed by telephone about his
grades, his family life, and his reasons for wanting to join the
Marines, Sammons said. After passing two initial screenings, Harris
was visited at his home April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during that screening process, on the 15th, that his
parents told us there was a medical disqualification,'' Sammons
said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Harris, who allegedly was filled with
hatred for the ``jocks'' and other who he said tormented him, was
the younger brother of a Columbine graduate who represented the
type of school pride Harris despised.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Harris sailed through high school, getting good grades and
winning respect as a tight end on the football team. Neighbors said
they recall the two brothers playing basketball in the family
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris family, like the Klebolds, have hired attorneys and
declined to comment beyond statements expressing their grief and
sympathy for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   While Harris was considering a military career, Klebold
accompanied his father to the University of Arizona and returned to
tell friends he had placed a deposit on a dormitory room there.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds have lived in Littleton longer than the Harrises,
who, typical of a military family, have moved several times.
</P>
<P>
   The community continued its mourning Wednesday, as the impromptu
shrine outside Columbine grew further, extending hundreds of yards.
It overflowed with notes, cards, and flowers, and drew people late
into the evening. Many said they were unsure what they would find
at the scene, but were hoping to find comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the grief, there was a sign that forgiveness may be
possible. Fifteen large wooden crosses have been erected in Clement
Park next to the high school, one for each of the people killed,
including Harris and Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   On Klebold's cross a simple message reads, ``We must forgive
before we can move on.''

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Office was not sure he would still have a job on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight Tuesday, Parr drove to Sheriff John Stone's home
and dragged him over to Columbine High School here for an impromptu
news conference. Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news
outlets around the world read an Associated Press story quoting
Stone extensively about the massacre at Columbine last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of
evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had
announced to the world hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has
made a mistake,'' Parr, a 20-year veteran of police work who has
been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the
massacre, said on Wednesday. ``I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so delicately, Parr and Steve Davis, a sheriff's deputy who
serves as the department spokesman, spent most of Wednesday
clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the
police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a
teacher and 12 classmates last Tuesday before turning their guns on
themselves. The department is also being questioned about its
handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that
is now under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements: Three
students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last
Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation, but
in fact have been cleared. The videotape showing the carnage in the
cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen
firing at the students. There is no evidence that Harris and his
friend Dylan Klebold, the other gunman, tried to escape and were
stopped by sheriff's deputies. Investigators are eager to make
arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff can't know every single detail in a case this
huge,'' Parr said gently, noting that there are 35 investigators
from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads,
plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school.
``We're doing the best we can,'' he added. ``And we're going to
learn from this. Believe me, we're going to learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of untangling confused news reports came as the
authorities announced that Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old Columbine
senior who went to the prom with Klebold, bought three of the four
guns used in the attack, not two as they said on yesterday. Miss
Anderson, who is being treated as a witness, not a suspect, bought
the two shotguns and a rifle, the police said. The source of the
semiautomatic TEC-9 handgun used in the killing spree remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department source also confirmed on Wednesday that
Harris, 18, was rejected from the United States Marine Corps
because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are warned that if Luvox is combined with other drugs,
including alcohol, it can cause extreme agitation progressing to
delirium and coma, and death. The package insert also carries a
warning about suicide. ``The possibility of suicide attempt is
inherent in patients with depressive symptoms, whether these occur
in primary depression or in association with another primary
disorder such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,'' it reads. ``Close
supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial drug
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office said that no drugs or alcohol were found in
Harris' body during an autopsy, but would not specify whether they
had looked for Luvox. Some friends of Harris said they believed he
might have tried to go off the drug, perhaps after his rejection by
the Marines just five days before he and his best friend stormed
onto the Columbine campus with guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a bunch of cases where people have been on Lithium
and the like and have stopped and committed crimes,'' Mark Pautler,
the chief deputy district attorney for Jefferson County, said on
Wednesday, referring to another common antidepressant. ``We're
looking into everything that might be the cause and might be
preventable in the future, but at this time were not looking at
what would have caused them to commit the crime, as much as whether
anyone else would be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that
others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly
mission and have ``high hopes'' for future arrests. But so far, no
suspects have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crucial pieces of evidence in last Tuesday's shocking
spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria,
where the carnage began, that are being enhanced and reviewed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ``Some of the things we hope
to see from that tape are the gunmen, activities that were taking
place, shooting, any explosive devices that may have been
distributed, exploded, the movement of people,'' Parr said. ``If we
had a third suspect on that videotape, that person would be in jail
today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the painstaking investigation continued here , the copycat
crimes did also. There were bomb threats Wednesday at several
schools around the country and in the Denver area. In Arvada, a
community near here, students were evacuated but no explosions were
reported or bombs found during an hour-long police search.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the sorrowful townwide funeral procession
continued as Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old freshman who loved the
movie ``Star Wars,'' was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of few news developments, much attention was focused on
the misstatements made by Stone, who spent 12 years as a Jefferson
County Commissioner before being elected in November to head the
agency of 325 sworn officers patrolling 750 square miles with a
population of 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it
has a similar number of officers as one of New York's largest
precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many
television cameras ask thousands of questions. In addition to
Wednesday's clarifications, and the revised death toll, the
department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of
when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen
were shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving a lot of interviews,'' said Parr, who was
the department's media spokesman for three years before Davis took
over in January 1988. ``Occasionally we'll have
misunderstandings.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not blame The A.P. or the news organizations,
including The New York Times, that reported the sheriff's comments.
''Apparently what the sheriff was hoping to communicate wasn't
understood in the light that the sheriff was trying to get
across,'' Parr said. ``It was just a misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the
department's history; the last media swarm was when the scion of
the Coors brewing company was killed in the county in the 1960's,
long before the days of 24-hour television news channels. There
were seven murders in the county all of 1998, and four each of the
previous years. Most of the experience Parr and Officer Davis have
had with disasters involved fires and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore., where there were deadly school shootings last
year, said they, too, were overwhelmed by the onslaught of
journalists as well as the horde of investigators from various
agencies they had to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for nothing like this,'' said Terry Long,
chief deputy sheriff for McCracken County, Ky. ``All the best
preparation goes right out the windown when something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davidson of the Arkansas State Police said a school
shooting ``is one of the most chaotic situations that any emergency
personnel is ever going to enter into.'' Sheriff Jack McCann of
Craighead County, the other lead agency in the Jonesboro
investigation, said he often had to send officers out to the field
to shoo away reporters, and that it was sometimes difficult to get
accurate information from young witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson, McCann added, is ``to not say it can
never happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen here,'' he said. ``It can happen anywhere, and
it's going to happen.''

Jujamcyn Theaters. Landesman sits on the Tony administration
committee and unsuccessfully argued against Roundabout's
eligibility in 1991. ``We've been handing out Tony eligibility like
candy, and as far as I'm concerned, it has to stop.'' (Librado

FBI ARRESTS TWO PROVIDENCE TAX OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Federal agents stormed Providence city hall
Wednesday, searching five city offices, and arrested two top tax
officials on charges that they participated in an expansive bribery
and money laundering scheme that included other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The raid came as staggering blow to the mayor, Vincent A.
``Buddy'' Cianci, who has tried to overcome his city's history of
public corruption, and his own troubled past. Twenty-one of his
underlings were convicted on corruption charges during the 1980s,
and Cianci himself was forced to resign after beating his estranged
wife's boyfriend with a fireplace log.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cianci denied any involvement in wrongdoing in this case,
saying ``You won't find any stains on this jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Culminating a year-long covert probe called Operation Plunder
Dome, 76-year-old Joseph Pannone, chairman of the Board of Tax
Assessment Review, and 57 year old Davie Eade, vice chairman, were
arrested at home Wednesday and arraigned in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-page complaint detailing the charges laid out a scenario
scripted for the movies _ with hidden video cameras, undercover
informants, and accusations of double crosses.
</P>
<P>
   Pannone and Eade were were each charged with three counts of
money laundering, bribery, and conspiracy. At the heart of the case
against Pannone and Eade are 100 hours of video- and audio-taped
transactions and conversations with the informant in which the two
detailed their system of phony invoices and sham soda machine
purchases, converting checks into cash for bribery or extortion
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Pannone and Eade were suspended immediately without pay
Wednesday. Each earns about $3,500 annually from their positions on
the review board, according to the City Solicitor, Charles R.
Mansolillo. If convicted, the two men could each receive a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the probe is far from over, according to US Attorney
Margaret E. Curran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation is delving deeply into city affairs,'' said
Curran, listing five city departments served with search warrants
Wednesday. In addition to the Tax Collector's and Tax Assessor's
office, they included the Planning Department, the Department of
Inspections and the School Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation does not stop today,'' Curran said. ``If
you are out there, and you have information about corrupt conduct,
or are involved with corruption, the time to come forward is now.
Consider this a window of opportunity, but know that that window
will soon close.''
</P>
<P>
   Curran would not name any officials by name, or specify whether
anyone who came forward would be offered immunity in return for
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   But Cianci insisted Wednesday that any problem was limited in
scope. Just hours after FBI agents scoured City Hall in search of
potentially incriminating documents, Cianci said he was saddened by
the day's events, but that ``I want to reassure the people of this
city, and especially the workers of this city, that the
overwhelming majority of workers here are decent, honest people.
This is a sad day for the city of Providence and we are going to
get to the bottom of this.``
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Mawn, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said Wednesday that the impetus for the
investigation began with the flurry of citizen complaints made to
the FBI over the past several years. But the probe into Pannone's
and Eade's activities began in earnest last April, after a private
businessman spurned from a city contract agreed to pose as a person
willing to do the bidding of corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person was in a position that he was aware of possible
corruption that was going on, and they obviously disturbed him,''
said Mawn, who added that the informant was not currently under
special protection.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Curran, Mawn said the arrests were just the beginning of
a probe that would widen to include more city officials and almost
certainly lead to more arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Pannone and Eade are two of five members on the Tax Assessment
Review Board appointed by the mayor. The board considers appeals by
citizens on the amounts of property taxes determined by the tax
assessor, and has the power to change that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the investigation would lead to his office or to him,
Cianci replied, ``absolutely not.'' He sought to distance himself
from one of the suspects in particular, Pannone, saying he had
appointed him years ago and that, ``Frankly, he's a 78-year-old guy
that I haven't had a lot to do with him.``
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he tried to reassure residents of his innocence and
his administration's willingness to would cooperate with the
investigation, Cianci seemed to downplay the issue, making
announcements about an upcoming city budget, an ongoing fued
between the city's police chief and the policeman's union, and even
telling reporters about his intention to go forward with plans for
his birthday party Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't spend my time checking to see whether soda was
delivered or not,'' said Cianci, referring to charges in the
federal complaint regarding a soda machine company owned by Eade,
Doris Vending Inc.

WELLPOINT EARNINGS ON PACE DESPITE LOSS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Health insurer WellPoint Health
Networks Inc. nailed analysts' first-quarter earnings estimates
Wednesday but reported a 19 percent drop in out-of-state
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care specialist, which markets health plans locally
under the Blue Cross of California name, earned $71.1 million, or
$1.04 per share, on revenues of $1.61 billion. The results,
excluding a one-time accounting charge of $20.6 million, were 5.8
percent better than a year ago, when the company earned $67.2
million, or 95 cents per share, on sales of $1.42 billion.
WellPoint reported the results after the close of U.S. stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was right in line,'' said analyst Peter Costa at
ABN AMRO in Boston. ``No surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Most striking in Wednesday's report was a 19 percent loss in the
company's out-of-state business over the last 12 months. While
already a top player in California with 5 million members,
WellPoint is a making a push to expand nationally. To that end, the
firm reported a gain of 77,000 members in its individual, small
group and senior business outside the state. But due to attrition
at some large group plans it bought, the company overall lost
135,000 members outside of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously very important for them to maintain their
position inside California, but it's also important for them to
grow nationally,'' Costa said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was dealt a setback last month when it attempted to
buy a Colorado insurer, Rocky Mountain Hospital and Medical
Systems, but was ultimately outbid by a competitor, Anthem Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Also reflected in Wednesday's earnings were higher costs since
the start of the year resulting from payments made to physician
groups to ensure continued care for WellPoint members that had been
treated by MedPartners Provider Network Inc. doctors. MedPartners
filed for bankruptcy protection in February after state regulators
seized the firm because of what they claimed were its shaky
finances.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint shares closed up $4.0625, or 5.7 percent, to $75.

LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED BY FAILURE TO MONITOR SUSPECTED ATOMIC SPY AT
LAB 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-NUKE-CODE) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior lawmakers expressed outrage and frustration
on Wednesday over the government's failure to monitor a scientist
suspected of spying for China, who officials now say may have given
away secrets to virtually every nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour closed hearing, the Republican chairman of
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Frank Murkowski
of Alaska, criticized witnesses from the Energy Department, CIA and
FBI for not taking responsibility for lax security at Government
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to identify accountability in this process is
very, very difficult,'' Murkowski said in an interview. ``There are
so many players. There's too much finger pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses were two Energy Department officials, Notra
Trulock, acting deputy director of intelligence, and Ed Curran,
counterintelligence director; Robert Walpole, a senior CIA
official, and Neil Gallagher, assistant director of the FBI
national security division.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, downloaded millions of lines of
computer code that approximates how the country's nuclear warheads
work from a classified system at the national laboratory in Los
Alamos, N.M., and transferred the data to a widely accessible
computer network at the lab, Government and lab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The information, which Lee, who was born in Taiwan, transferred
mainly in 1994 and 1995, was apparently accessed by someone after
the files had been placed in the unclassified network, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the focus of a separate inquiry, into whether he passed
on secret design information for the most advanced U.S. nuclear
warhead, the W-88, to China in the mid-80's.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began investigating Lee in 1996, a year after American
intelligence officials first suspected that China had stolen the
W-88 information. In April 1997, Lee was moved to a new job, but
was still allowed access to classified information. Los Alamos
officials assured Energy Department superiors that safeguards in
place would prevent any unauthorized leaks of sensitive
information.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said on Wednesday that those assurances were wrong.
``This clearly points out a situation where we have the utmost
secret, national security weaponry blueprints, and oversight that's
not working,'' Murkowski said. ``During this time frame there were
some inexcusable lapses of accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is vice chairman of the
Intelligence Committee, called the suspected transfer of the
information, which could help any foreign power replicate America's
nuclear arsenal, ``especially disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, David Leavy,
acknowledged that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told President
Clinton of the new evidence on March 31 and, again, on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under no illusions that there are those who are trying
to acquire sensitive technology,'' the White House spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said. ``It's a serious problem, and we have taken steps
to increase security.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders pledged to step up investigations that
committees on both sides of the Capitol are conducting.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director, Louis Freeh, is widely expected to face harsh
questioning on Thursday at a closed hearing of the Senate
Intelligence Committee. The bureau, the main counterintelligence
agency, encountered years of delays in obtaining approval from the
Justice Department to seek a court-ordered search of Lee's house.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, shortly after Lee had been dismissed, did the
bureau finally ask for and receive his permission to search his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable to the average person that Wen Ho Lee would
not be watched closely after being suspected of espionage and be
returned to an area of our most top guarded secrets,'' Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the Intelligence Committee, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official acknowledged missteps in handling
the FBI request, which career prosecutors never knew about.
``People in the criminal division,'' the official said, ``would
liked to have been consulted early on, and it didn't happen in this
case.''

   In April 1995, long before the browser wars erupted, Microsoft
Corp. had recognized the challenge posed by the Internet. Its
strategic response, its top technology executive urged, should be
clear-cut: Control as much of the crucial technology as possible,
just as it does in the personal computer market with its
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue to be concerned about is the same issue we've
faced in the past _ proprietary standards coming from competing
software companies,'' wrote Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief
technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail to senior company executives, including Bill
Gates, the chairman, Myhrvold specifically cited Netscape
Communications Corp., the Internet browser pioneer, as one of the
challengers that would promote competing technology standards.

<P>
   His answer to the challenge was an early formulation of what
became Microsoft's ``embrace and extend'' strategy for Internet
software. ``As proprietary technology and protocols are used'' on
the Internet, Myhrvold wrote, ``we want them to be ours.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of detail about Microsoft's Internet strategy
and the inner workings of the software powerhouse that are to be
found in the thousands of pages of deposition testimony from dozens
of witnesses in the Microsoft antitrust case released Wednesday.
The mountain of documents _ the depositions of 92 people, from
Microsoft and other companies as well as expert witnesses _ are
being made public as a result of a federal court ruling sought by
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The most legally significant portions of the depositions,
including about eight of the 20 hours of Gates' videotaped
testimony, have already been presented in the long-running trial.
What is now being made public for the first time are essentially
outtakes _ the raw material not used by the Justice Department and
19 states suing Microsoft or by the company in its defense. ``If
you find anything in these pages that is not already in the trial,
we have not done our job,'' said David Boies, the lead trial lawyer
for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Yet reading through several depositions, including those of some
of the 23 Microsoft executives questioned, does offer an intriguing
glimpse of the management style and corporate culture of the
world's leading software company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft managers are apparently given a lot of freedom. For
example, the negotiations between Microsoft and Netscape in 1995
are a central chapter in the antitrust suit. The government
contends that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape to divide
up the browser market, a charge Microsoft denies. When the talks
broke down, the browser wars began.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rosen, a Microsoft manager, was in charge of the
negotiations with Netscape. When a Justice Department lawyer asked
him when he was authorized by his superiors to try to reach a deal
with Netscape, Rosen replied: ``That's a difficult question to
answer because that's sort of not the way the company explicitly
operates. My responsibilities were to some great degree formed by
myself and then later, you know, verified with others that that was
okay to be doing more than instructed to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, perhaps more than any other company, understands the
importance of shaping industry perceptions and expectations. That
process is clearly guided from the top. In an e-mail written on
July 20, 1995, when Microsoft trailed well behind Netscape in
Internet software, Gates wrote: ``We should make sure our goals for
Internet presence are low enough so that we can achieve them, but
also say that Netscape has lost control. As we achieve our goals,
people should start to question Netscape leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   From the testimony, it is striking how broad the communication
by e-mail is within Microsoft. For example, Rick Rashid, vice
president of Microsoft's research group, which mainly focuses on
long-range issues in computing, was weighing in on the fine points
of product specifications and software technology. He was joined by
senior product executives, like Paul Maritz, and young programmers
alike. Titles and hierarchy do not seem to matter much at
Microsoft; anyone with ideas can join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one senior executive is curiously absent for the most
part: Steven Ballmer, currently Microsoft's president. His name is
mentioned only fleetingly in the Microsoft depositions, and unlike
Gates he is rarely included as a sender or recipient of the
thousands of e-mail messages that have been submitted as evidence
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft explanation is that he was a senior marketing and
sales executive during most of the period covered by the suit, yet
other Microsoft marketing executives are all over the case.
Ballmer, the long-time No. 2 executive at Microsoft, regarded as
Gates' alter ego, was never questioned by government prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the mind-numbing nitpicking of the deposition process _ a
kind of rhetorical arm-wrestling between the interrogator and the
witness _ there are occasional flashes of humor. A Justice
Department lawyer, for example, presented Brad Chase, a Microsoft
executive, with yet another piece of evidence saying, ``I'm now
marking government exhibit 962.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy,'' Chase replied, ``more exhibits.''

THE PLOT THICKENS . . . AGAIN

<P>
   BOSTON -- Remember that nitwit wearing the Patriot hard hat as
he voted from the floor of the Connecticut State Legislature last
December? Wonder how he's feeling today?
</P>
<P>
   More Patriot Games. Man, I just eat this up with a spoon. And
it's going to be juicy watching the stadium game unfold.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, we've got the Connecticut Yahoos, standing at
the platform at Yo Adriaen's Landing while the train pulls away
once again. They were willing to give Bob Kraft the world, but in
the end it's never enough because they are . . . Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have Massachusetts Speaker of the House, Tom Finneran _
a Bob Kraft nemesis and guardian at the gate _ claiming victory in
his quest to protect taxpayers from the corporate welfare that
marks most modern stadium deals.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the NFL, flexing its considerable muscle and
reminding Kraft that he's going to have to play ball with them if
he wants to be a member in good standing. Nashville is bad enough.
But Hartford?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there's the suddenly silent Kraft, who spends most
of his time pretending to be doing the opposite of what he is
actually doing.
</P>
<P>
   --On draft day, Kraft is in the war room pretending he's not
calling all the shots for Bobby Grier and Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   --In Hartford, Kraft's pretending he's still interested in the
Love Canal site by the shores of the Connecticut River (was Homer
Simpson in charge of security at the steam plant? Can you just see
Homer tossing contaminated substances out of his car on his way
home from work on the Whitehead Highway?).
</P>
<P>
   --Best of all, we've got Kraft pretending he has no control over
the NFL's substantial efforts to keep the Patriots in New England.
Bob's pact with Connecticut prohibits him from negotiating any
non-Hartford proposals, but clearly the league would not be pushing
so hard if it didn't have a green light from silent Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's got to be careful. He's facing another alleged deadline
Sunday that would allow him to pull out of Hartford, but how can he
trust Massachusetts, which acts only under threat of defection? Bob
can't afford to bail out of Connecticut, then have Massachusetts
change its mind again.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran and Senate President Thomas Birmingham are saying that
they can get this bill passed by the time NFL owners would vote on
the Hartford proposal (May 24). Kraft needs approval from
three-quarters of the NFL owners to move.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, suddenly the most influential NFL force since Pete
Rozelle, continues to state that there's nothing personal in his
dealings with Kraft, which is what Bill Parcells said right up
until he blew out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The Speaker didn't want to make a prediction on what Kraft might
do, but he did say, ``I think Hartford is falling apart on a number
of levels _ those being environmental, financial, and the legal
work that has to be done between them and the University of
Connecticut. But I think the league has made it clear that the
long-term interests of the franchise and the league are best served
with a Boston or Massachusetts site.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kraft, the economics are pretty simple. He has an
opportunity to go into a $374 million Hartford stadium at no cost,
or spend$225 million to $250 million of his own dough to rebuild in
Foxborough with $70 million of infrastructure help from the state.
Economically, there's no choice. But here in the Commonwealth,
we're counting on two things: 1. Hartford's inability to overcome
the contamination/financial/steam plant/deadline issues; and 2.
Kraft's concern with his legacy and need to be loved in his native
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be great watching Kraft try to make everyone happy
as this unfolds. No doubt when he bolts from Connecticut he'll
compose one of those disingenuous letters for the Hartford Courant:
(itals)We tried our best but the NFL wouldn't let us go or We tried
our best, but Connecticut was not able to meet its timetables. We
really love the Nutmeg State and hope you'll come to Foxborough to
support the New England Patriots.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It matters not how it happens . . . contaminated soil . . .
steam plant problems . . . the lure of home . . . the NFL
television market . . . the Kraft family legacy . . .
</P>
<P>
   All that matters is that the Patriots aren't going anywhere.
They will never play a game in Hartford. They are the football
equivalent of Charlie on the MTA. They will play forever on the
fields of Foxborough.

<P>
   SURDULICA, Yugoslavia _ ``We grew up together,'' said Momir
Andjelkovic, his eyes veined and red, staring at the green,
encircling hills. ``He was my finest friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic stopped, dropping his clouded eyes to the mound of
rubble across narrow Zmaj Jovina Street, where Alexander Milic, 37,
died Tuesday afternoon. Milic's wife, Vesna, 35, also died. So did
his mother and his two children, Miljana, 15, and Vladimir, 11 _
all of them killed about noon Tuesday when an errant NATO bomb
obliterated their new house and the cellar in which they were
seeking shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived together here for 32 years, for good and bad,''
Andjelkovic said. ``He was a great man, a great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He sobbed once, briefly. ``This was a completely new house,
three stories, with completely new furniture,'' he said, still
astonished at the jagged pile of refuse where it once stood. ``It
had a large basement. Everyone felt safe there. But the whole
family died.''
</P>
<P>
   Dying with them were at least two cousins _ Stanica Rasic, 21,
and Dragan Manoluv, 18. Altogether, Yugoslav officials said 20
civilians, half of them children, died in this town of 11,000
people 200 miles south of Belgrade, near the Bulgarian border. At
least six houses were completely destroyed and another 20 or so had
significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance from Milic's house, his father, Vojislav, head
bent, sat on a broken bit of wall, cupping an unlit cigarette in
his palm.
</P>
<P>
   He was in shock. Two women hovered, arms around his shoulders,
squeezing them through his black jacket as if he might otherwise
fall over. They urged him in steady whispers to stand up, to eat
something, to drink some water.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Milic rocked silently, oblivious, his head bobbing up
and down with the even beat of a human heart.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said that this was yet another
accident of war. At least one laser-guided bomb was apparently
``blinded'' by the smoke from a previous and accurate detonation,
the officials said, and fell 200 or 300 yards from its intended
target _ an army barracks and military depot that had previously
been bombed. In the past, officials have blamed clouds or hostile
fire for apparently interfering with a laser beamed from the plane
to the target to guide the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The barracks is at least 500 yards away. Only after Western
journalists saw another large crater a half-mile from Alexander
Milic's house did NATO officials then concede that they ``could not
exclude'' that another bomb might have gone astray. The other
crater _ a nearly perfect scoop in the earth, about 30 feet across
and 20 feet deep _ had blasted three houses away on muddy
Beogradska Street. The hole, slowly filling with ground water, was
scattered with the debris of human life: filthy clothes, exploded
sofa cushions, pill boxes, the back of an oven, the cracked circuit
board from a television set.
</P>
<P>
   No one died here, officials said, although at least five people
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's swift if incomplete acknowledgment of an attack
that went wrong contrasted with its initial responses earlier this
month to a NATO air attack that killed about 70 ethnic Albanian
civilians near the town of Djakovica. It took days then for the
command to determine that allied planes had indeed fired on the
convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death can be a blessing, too,'' said Borica Novkovic. The
house of her son, Stanko, 35, was obliterated. Stanko, his wife
Tatjana and their 8-month-old daughter, Andrijana, were not in the
house. ``My son is not here,'' Mrs. Novkovic said, with pride.
``Stanko is in the army now.''
</P>
<P>
   The noise was indescribable, she said. ``The sound was like a
huge blow on my head. Everything turned over and rolled down the
hill. Radica was screaming, screaming, when we came to help her,''
Mrs. Novkovic said, bending to pull up her coarse woolen stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Radica Rastic's house was closest to the impact. ``She was taken
from the house all twisted and bent over,'' Mrs. Novkovic said.
``She was shaking and shaking, her hands were pressed tight over
her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Perica Jovanovic, a 44-year-old economist at the Narodni Bank,
said: ``I'll never forget the strange voice of the bomb. When the
plane is flying and drops the bomb the noise changes,'' he said.
``It's awful. It's like the static on the radio but so loud, and
then there is this awful crash and pressure and everything moves
and boils up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic was outside with his two children, Biljana, 13, and
Nemanje, 8. ``Somehow we stayed alive,'' he said quietly, with
care. ``But I think these NATO bastards will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped and glared. ``You should pass through that,'' he
said. ``Americans should have this experience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He softened then, to say: ``People think I'm very calm, but I'm
not, I'm very upset. Here you have 11,000 people who are crazy,
nervous. People died here and what was the aim? There is nothing
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw up his hands. ``We were very brave for 34 days, but
we've moved now,'' he said. ``I've moved the family now to a lake
in the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 yards from the crater, a half-finished house was badly
damaged. On the lintel above the door was a hand-painted sign:
``Kuca na prodaju'' _ house for sale _ ``Tel: 85-552.''
</P>
<P>
   On Zmaj Jovina Street, Slobodan Milosevic, 48, the bearer of a
common Serbian name, stood covered with dust in the ruins of his
own house, across the street from Milic's. Photographers had
scrambled up to the second floor, easily visible from the street
because the entire front of Milosevic's house had been ripped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is a ruin,'' he said. ``To build it I worked four
years in Africa _ two in Tunisia and two in Algeria.'' He laughed
sourly. ``Now I'll have to go there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, a civil engineer, was visiting relatives with his
wife, Sladjana, 45, son Sasa, 25, and daughter Suzana, 22, when the
bomb hit his street.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought when I saw it all was that we were very lucky
not to be in the house, because we would have died,'' he said.
``We're alive, so we will build another house.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sure that NATO had aimed for the houses. ``It's
impossible for the pilot to make this mistake,'' he said. ``The sky
was clear. He couldn't miss. The barracks isn't even that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his neighbor, Alexander Milic, Milosevic said he
worked in a small factory, PES, that made components for Zastava,
the huge car and munitions factory in Kragujevac that NATO has
completely destroyed. Milic also owned two small convenience stores
in town, and it seemed he was returning home for lunch when the air
raid sirens sounded and he and his family and neighbors went down
to the basement of his house. ``But Momir,'' he said, ``was really
his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic described how he went down to his own basement with
his parents and emerged to see what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand what was going on,'' he said. ``There
was dust everywhere, and the houses existing two minutes before _
right in front of my house _ were just gone. I heard people
screaming, and one of the people down there was my uncle. We tried
to dig with our hands, I made him a small hole to breathe until
first aid could come.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncle, Stojanka Petkovic, 65, ``was the only one to survive
this house.'' He pointed to the elder Milic, still sitting frozen
on the wall. ``He came from somewhere else,'' Andjelkovic said.
``He lost everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked quietly if he thought that keeping foreign troops out of
Kosovo was worth this kind of price, Andjelkovic looked up,
stunned. ``I don't understand the question,'' he said. ``You
shouldn't ask me that now _ we can talk about that in 10 or 15
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``We haven't buried these people and you want
to ask me that?''

<P>
   BOSTON -- Just about everyone had a prediction Wednesday on how
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would react to the
last-minute stadium plan to keep the New England Patriots in
Massachusetts. Everyone, that is, except Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Muzzled by his contract with Connecticut, Kraft could not
discuss any option other than accepting its offer to build, with
taxpayer money, a 68,000-seat stadium in Hartford. A team spokesman
said Kraft, who was in Boston Wednesday, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is expected to meet with his consultants Thursday in an
effort to sort through the status of the Connecticut deal, which
has been dogged by environmental and logistical problems. Terms of
the contract signed earlier this year allow Kraft to cancel the
project _ without penalty _ if he decides by Sunday that the state
cannot deliver the stadium in time or on budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Governor John G. Rowland called a news conference
at the Capitol to insist that the team would decamp from
Foxborough. ``Well, the Patriots are leaving,'' he declared.
``They're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But among Bay State business and political leaders close to the
situation, there was unbridled optimism the team would remain in
Foxborough. Political leaders crowed about Tuesday's late-night
breakthrough, which provides $70 million in state money for
infrastructure improvements if Kraft agrees to build a new stadium
in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very optimistic this can keep the Patriots in
Massachusetts,'' said Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who
last year won agreement from Kraft for a plan similar to the one
hammered out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with National Football League commissioner Paul
Tagliabue on the telephone, Governor Paul Cellucci also was upbeat.
``Connecticut is much sweeter in terms of money, but the loyal fan
base is here, and this is the sixth largest media market,''
Cellucci said. ``I think that's something the other NFL owners and
Mr. Kraft care a lot about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who many saw as the only
man stading in the way of a Masschusetts stadium agreement last
year, said the new deal is ``in the best interest of the taxpayers
and a good deal for the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers stack up like this: The Nutmeg State has agreed to
spend $374 million in public money to build a stadium along the
banks of the Connecticut River in Hartford. In addition, it would
pick up the tab for any unsold luxury suites and seats for up to 30
years. Those guarantees alone are worth more than $1 billion,
sources familiar with the contract say.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Kraft would invest $75 million in a hotel, NFL
entertainment, and fitness complex as part of the city's Adriaen's
Landing development project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Massachusetts plan, Kraft would finance a new stadium,
estimated at $225 million to $250 million, on his own, though under
recently approved rules the NFL can help with a low-interest loan.
It would also require Kraft to pay $1 million a year to the state
to compensate for some of its spending on roads, sewers, and other
infrastructure. The stadium would be built on land Kraft owns in
Foxborough, and the team would play at Foxboro Stadium until the
new facility was ready, in 2002 or 2003
</P>
<P>
   While the Massachusetts bid pales financially in comparison to
Hartford's, Boston business leaders all but predicted that Kraft
would opt to build a new home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is Robert Kraft is very much a hometown guy,'' said
former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, who has
led the Bay State's bid to keep the team. ``I'm not sure he ever
wanted to leave to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kraft has a decision to make and it's not an easy
one,'' added advertising executive Jack Connors. ``But my guess is
he will end up coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL issued a statement saying it was pleased with the
Massachusetts political agreement, reached after Cellucci,
Birmingham, Finneran, and NFL officials met for several hours over
two days this week.
</P>
<P>
   The league said the accord was a ``step in the right
direction,'' but stressed that long-term commitments by the
business community to luxury suites were essential to suceed in
keeping the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In response, business leaders said they hoped to line up
commitments for up to $15 million luxury box suites over the next
two weeks. Luxury suites would sell from $75,000 to $325,000 for
the best 50-yard-line suites. Advance sales are essential to
financing a new privately funded stadium, and a strong response by
corporations would also be send a signal to Kraft that he can count
on their support at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has left the door open for Kraft to back out of the
stadium deal, considered the most lucrative for any NFL owner. It
has stumbled badly in its attempts to acquire and clean up the
proposed stadium site, and there are serious questions about
whether the state can deliver on its promise of 2002 opening date.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NFL has said it prefers that the Patriots remain
in the Boston television market, the nation's six largest, where
games can generate much higher broadcast revenue than in Hartford,
which ranks just 27th. NFL owners, who split league TV money, are
scheduled to vote on the Connecticut move at their next meeting at
the end of May. It is not clear whether Kraft would decide before
that meeting between his competing offers, or wait to see if the
league approves or rejects Connecticut's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of my negotiations with the Patriots and Robert Kraft,
it was absolutely clear to me that given his preference Kraft
wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts,'' Birmingham said. ``The
NFL has made it incontrovertibly clear that the league's preference
is to have the Patriots remain in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut remains adamant that the Massachusetts deal is
too little, too late. Jay Malcynsky, a lobbysist representing the
team in Connecticut, said he thought the team would still move to
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kraft told me flat out, he's got the deal he want's and
it's in Hartford,'' said Malcynsky, who has close personal and
political ties to Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcynsky is so close to Rowland some say he's actually the
governor,'' said one person involved in the struggle for the
Patriots. ``It's not surprising he'd say something like that at
this point.... But even though it will cost him a lot of dough, the
smart money is on Kraft staying in Massachusetts.''

ADVERTISING:   NEW ENGLAND'S BIGGEST INDEPENDENT AGENCY ACQUIRED BY
LOWE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Va.) (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest remaining independent agency in New England remains
independent no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen Advertising, a creatively focused shop in Wenham, Mass.,
said Wednesday that it had agreed to sell a majority equity stake
to Lowe Group in London, part of Interpublic Group of Cos. Under
the deal, announced after weeks of speculation, Mullen will operate
as an autonomous agency under its current name and management.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to close in early June, is another reminder
of the relentless consolidation that is remaking the industry.
Mullen becomes the third big New England independent to be acquired
in little more than a year, coming after the purchase of Hill,
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston by Interpublic and the sale
of Arnold Communications in Boston to Snyder Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption is if you're not aligned with a bigger agency,
it's a better thing,'' said Jim Mullen, who continues as chief
executive at Mullen, which he founded in 1970, as he adds duties at
Lowe as a vice chairman offering strategic counsel for North
American operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this gives me comfort,'' Mullen said in a telephone
interview, ``because at 58, you have to understand that changes can
happen in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency is my life,'' he added, ``and to know if anything
would happen to me the agency would continue to operate with the
same culture, same leadership and same opportunities for people
that it has for 29 years is everything I've ever dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Frank Lowe, chairman and chief
executive at Lowe, offered the perspective of the acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mullen is a very, very good agency,'' Lowe said, ``and good
agencies are rather thin on the ground. So this is a great
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to be able to work with an international group,''
he added, referring to Mullen executives, who had not until now had
overseas capabilities, ``so they'll get something out of it as we
get something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen has 280 employees working on advertising, direct
marketing, public relations and digital marketing for accounts with
estimated billings of $255 million. Clients include L.L. Bean;
CompUSAnet.com, the online operation of CompUSA; the used-vehicle
and credit-card units of General Motors Corp.; MSNBC, a joint
venture of General Electric Co. and Microsoft Corp.; Money
magazine, part of the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc.; the
Monster.com Internet employment service operated by TMP Worldwide;
Oxygen Media, a company being started by the media executive
Geraldine Laybourne, and the Stanley Works.
</P>
<P>
   Though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Muller
said that scores of Mullen employees will be enriched because
ownership of the agency is ``broadly shared among senior management
and the 150 members of our employee stock ownership program.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, an agency sells for an amount about equal to its
annual revenue; Mullen's revenue last year was $17.2 million. But
the trade publication Adweek reported that Interpublic paid $123
million for Hill, Holliday, well above its annual revenue of $80
million, and Snyder paid about $117 million for Arnold, which had
revenue of $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   In operating as a stand-alone unit of Lowe, Mullen will be
separate from the agencies under the Lowe &AMP; Partners Worldwide
banner that include Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York and Lowe
Howard-Spink in London. Mullen joins such creatively focused
agencies that are autonomous units of Lowe as Goldberg Moser
O'Neill in San Francisco, which is majority-owned, and the Martin
Agency in Richmond, Va., which is wholly owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mullen people spoke with GMO and Martin,'' Lowe said, and
were told ``that I am slightly hands-off. And I think they were
appreciative of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen echoed his new boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been anybody we haven't talked with,'' Mullen
said, referring to the acquisitive top executives of the large
agencies, ``and when I met Frank Lowe, I used the term
`heaven-sent.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank leaves you completely alone,'' he added, ``and Fred
Goldberg at GMO said the most wonderful thing: `He leaves you too
much alone.' '' Lowe agencies have billings estimated at $4 billion
from clients like the Braun unit of Gillette Co., Coca-Cola Co.,
General Motors, Henkel KGaA and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Mullen deal is the second in a week for Lowe as Lowe MBAC in
Barcelona, Spain, part of Lowe &AMP; Partners, acquired a majority
stake in FMRG, another agency in Barcelona, for undisclosed terms.
FMRG is being merged with Lowe MBAC to form Lowe FMRG, with a staff
of 43 and estimated billings of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions are a nice counterpoint to large accounts
recently lost by Lowe agencies like the Mercedes-Benz of North
America unit of DaimlerChrysler AG and the United Distillers and
Vintners unit of Diageo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   So which is the largest remaining independent agency in New
England now? The Titus Moody Advertising and Maple Syrup Co.?
Actually, it is Ingalls in Boston, with billings estimated at $141
million.  &QL;

CONGRESS AND KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting a war in consultation with Congress is not always
easy for the White House, but it is necessary under the
Constitution. Given the sensitive military and diplomatic ground in
Kosovo, the House is steering a reasonable if spendthrift course
this week in acting on several measures involving the war in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were right Wednesday to insist that President Clinton
seek congressional approval if he decides to order ground troops
into combat. The measure was advanced by Republican leaders but
supported by 45 Democrats in a 249-to-180 vote that democratic
opponents mischaracterized as a message of weakness to Slobodan
Milosevic. Clinton says he has no intention of invading Kosovo or
Serbia, and NATO has made no preparations to do so, beyond the
drafting of contingency plans. If sentiment within the alliance
changes, Clinton would be well advised to start moving troops and
weapons to the Balkans to keep the option open and to increase the
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should not limit Clinton's hand on such preparations.
But if the president chooses to send ground forces into battle, he
will need the full support of Congress and the American people.
Wednesday he assured the House he would seek congressional consent.
To act without it would invite the kind of division and political
unrest that developed during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The House also properly rejected an appeal from Rep. Tom
Campbell of California to issue a formal declaration of war against
Yugoslavia. With diplomacy at a delicate stage, the act of
declaring war would escalate the conflict and harden Serbian
resistance to a political settlement. Diplomatic efforts are likely
to intensify now that Russia has taken a lead role in trying to
mediate the conflict. Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, plans
to travel to Moscow Thursday, following the visit there earlier
this week by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   The House has shown less restraint on defense spending. It
should quickly approve Clinton's $6 billion emergency request to
pay for the air war and assistance for hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces. Instead the
House is moving to provide more than double that amount, with
additional money for a military pay raise, construction projects
and other matters that should be considered as part of the normal
Pentagon budget. The Senate is likely to do the same. Using the war
to circumvent budget limitations is a misuse of congressional power
and will not help NATO prevail in Yugoslavia. &QL;

HARTFORD WAKES UP TO FIND PATRIOTS MAY NEVER ARRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The idea of luring a major league team like
the New England Patriots to this blighted insurance town between
the lights of New York and Boston had seemed so grand, so exciting,
so downright unlikely, that many Hartford boosters had feared that
they would wake up from their blissful dream.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, that seemed to be happening Wednesday morning, when
the wake-up television shows were dominated by shots of
Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, surrounded by legislative and
business leaders, declaring shortly before midnight that the Bay
State was putting aside years of bitter negotiations with the
Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, and offering a package of state
subsidies for a new football stadium next to the one at Foxboro,
just south of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the stadium is far from decided; Kraft, in fact, has
taken no public position on the offer from his home state. But to
many people here, and to executives of the National Football League
itself, the momentum appeared to be moving rapidly away from
Hartford and toward Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters here, the stadium was even being discussed in
the past tense. ``We would have loved to have had it,'' said state
Rep. Annette W. Carter, a Democrat from Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL issued a statement saying, ``The Massachusetts political
leadership's agreement last night regarding a stadium proposal is a
step in the right direction towards a Patriots alternative in
Foxboro.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Connecticut are so concerned that the deal is
slipping away that they are working with a lawyer on a possible
class-action lawsuit against the NFL, which helped broker the
Massachusetts plan, charging ``tortious interference'' in the
state's contract with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit by idly while our legal rights get
trampled,'' said George C. Jepsen, the Democratic majority leader
in the state Senate. ``We believe that a wide range of people,
including taxpayers and the trade unions that would have had all
these construction jobs, would have potential claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the stadium tug-of-war is likely to determine the
future face of Hartford, which had received a psychic lift from the
football frenzy. Losing the stadium would dash hopes for renewing
the city's downtown and could be expected to sink or at least stall
an ambitious hotel and convention center complex that was to be
built around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the deal would also be potentially devastating for Gov.
John G. Rowland, a second-term Republican who insisted that he had
``bonded'' with Kraft in their months of negotiations and who has
repeatedly said he would stake his legacy on the outcome of the
huge gamble on the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that people would like to see this fall apart _ it's
not going to fall apart,'' Rowland said Wednesday, looking a bit
rattled as he faced a huge pack of Boston and Connecticut
journalists keeping what he calls ``the death watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I quote my critics, they say this is one of the best plans
in the country. Why would he walk away from this?'' Rowland said,
referring to Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, leaders of the Massachusetts bid said that if
Kraft resists their overture, they were prepared to make their case
directly to his fellow league owners, three-fourths of whom must
approve any move by a team. The Patriots' move is scheduled for a
vote at an owners' meeting May 25 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   The abrasive back-and-forth represents an escalation in the
stadium game of demanding owners who extract lavish offers from
eagerly competing cities. Now, it appears, a victorious city cannot
rest easily even after the contract is signed.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts offer came not just with the blessing of the
NFL, but at its instigation. An NFL executive first flew into
Boston on Jan. 6, three weeks after Connecticut had approved its
deal, and the league has been working ever since to promote an
alternative to the Patriots heading for Hartford, which would mean
disrupting the team's fans in order to move from the nation's
sixth-largest television market to the 27th.
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts said that sponsorships and naming rights would
carry a much lower price in Hartford, and said that the league
could expect an erosion of viewership in Boston if the team were
playing two hours away. ``Fans try to be loyal at first, but that
rarely lasts,'' said Terri L. Ritenour, a sports analyst for Paul
Kagan Associates, in Carmel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland knew he was going to be accused of giving away the store
when he signed his stadium deal, knew the site was contaminated by
coal tar and toxins, and knew he was dealing with a canny owner who
was sure to wind up with the upper hand. But for all the hurdles
Rowland had faced, his aides say he was blindsided by the one that
now imperils his plan: the clout of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have talked privately with Rowland, he
feels betrayed. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had called to
congratulate him the night he signed the deal with Kraft. Rowland
said Tagliabue later assured him that he was ``just listening'' to
the Boston officials _ that it was his responsibility to be sure
every avenue had been explored. The very next day, according to
people who were in the meetings, Tagliabue was aggressively
lobbying business and political leaders to offer a deal to Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to make a recommendation to the owners, he has to be
able to explore all alternatives,'' said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.
``To develop an alternative you have to be aggressive. That's not
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, business and civic leaders were kicking off a
drive to sell skyboxes _ at prices running up to $325,000 a year _
in the stadium they were suddenly hoping to build.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders of the effort is the Rev. J. Donald Monan,
chancellor of Boston College, who said the city's leaders had
realized that retaining the Patriots ``wasn't just a matter of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a sport that was a business which has a tremendous
economic impact on the commonwealth, and we thought that it was a
real tragedy for the team to leave the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots issued a statement saying the team was ``not
involved with any efforts to develop, or discussions pertaining to,
a new Massachusetts stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts group is proposing a new stadium on the site
of a former horse track at Foxboro that is now used for special
tailgate parties. Kraft would have to pay to build the $250 million
stadium, and the state would pay $70 million for related
improvements, including roads, parking lots, utilities and
landscaping. The offer includes a requirement that the team pay the
state $1 million each year for using the improvements. The state
also would receive a $400,000 annual fee from the stadium's
satellite parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut offer is a much better financial deal for Kraft.
The state would pay the entire $375 million cost of the stadium,
although he has agreed to invest $70 million in a hotel in the
development.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has until Sunday to exercise one of several clauses in his
deal with Connecticut that would allow him to walk away from the
deal with no penalty. But the Boston leaders are banking on the
fact that he would accept the stingier deal in exchange for the
stability of home.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' lobbyist in Connecticut, Jay Malcynsky, who was a
senior adviser to Rowland's re-election campaign last year, said
the Massachusetts deal was similar to ones that Kraft had rejected
in the past, even without the lucrative Connecticut offer in his
back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put a tuxedo on a scarecrow, but it's still a
scarecrow,'' Malcynsky said. ``These are desperate people in
desperate times, scrambling to at least proffer the illusion that
there's a viable alternative in Boston.''

EDITORIAL: THE WAR OF THE RUDYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 29:
</P>
<P>
   The latest battle between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew could not have come at a worse time. New York
City's students face tough new testing standards, and politicians
in Albany are squeezing funds from the city's schools. Cynics might
be forgiven for wondering whether the mayor and perhaps even the
chancellor are looking for a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Crew says he is absolutely not searching for another job, but he
is at a point that often tempts reformers to decamp. New standards
and other changes have been put in place, but not for long enough
to judge how well they work. Giuliani asserts that his emphasis on
education is neither new nor an attempt to set the stage for a
Senate run. Even so, his strong words on vouchers, on Crew and the
board of education all make him sound like a politician trying to
make sure he does not get blamed for the school system's problems.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's schools have endless needs, but none more
critical than stable leadership. Crew has come up with ambitious
standards and initiatives. But because many of these steps are
underfinanced and far from fully realized, this is no time for him
to leave. As for the mayor, his chief focus should be on giving the
chancellor the support he needs, particularly when it comes to
lobbying Albany for promised aid that the governor wants to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani began his tenure by battling schools Chancellor Ramon
Cortines. Cortines was replaced by Crew, whose relationship with
Giuliani was what the mayor called ``a partnership of shared
principles.'' The state legislature then passed a major school
governance reform, giving the chancellor far more direct control
over local school boards. The board of education got a new chairman
and members with whom the mayor seemed able to work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, using language similar to his anti-Cortines campaign four
years ago, Giuliani is again calling for radical reform and
defending his comment that the system should be ``blown up,'' as he
put it so crudely last week. Although he has since tried to temper
his tone, the mayor also accused the chancellor of ``a rigid
defense of the status quo.'' That is also an exaggeration that
mocks the chancellor and others who have sincerely tried to change
the schools according to the Giuliani-Crew format.
</P>
<P>
   This page supported Giuliani's plan to abolish the school board.
We also agree with Crew that the mayor's obsession with school
vouchers is a useless distraction. But neither man can be allowed
to use these debates as a way to dodge his own responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Crew needs to calm down. Giuliani needs to acknowledge the
conflict between his call for greater mayoral control of the
schools and his advocacy of a voucher system that would deprive
them of money and public support. During the Cortines wars,
Giuliani was the radical reformer. Now he is a lame-duck mayor
whose political future will not be enhanced by running off an
effective chancellor.

BAFFERT ADDS FILLY TO THE MIX
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The Kentucky Derby field took shape Wednesday,
and it's an ample, female shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert decided to enter Excellent Meeting, giving
Saturday's race two fillies and a total of 20 horses, the most of
either since 1984. That's the year the colt Swale won a 20-horse
Derby that included Life's Magic and Althea.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting and General Challenge, coupled for wagering
because both are owned by California's John and Betty Mabee, were
made joint 3-1 favorites, with Baffert-trained Prime Timber next on
the morning line at 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that could change in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, who joined the Florida filly Three Ring in
the Derby, is also entered in Friday's Kentucky Oaks for females,
which is where John Mabee would prefer to run her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say she will run in the Derby,'' said Baffert,
who apparently prevailed in a talk with Mabee. ``(Today), I may
show up at the barn and he (Mabee) may have changed his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three fillies in 124 years have won the Derby. But if
Excellent Meeting goes in the Oaks, she'll have to overcome
barnmate Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting wound up with post position 6 for the Derby,
more favorable than Prime Timber's post 14 and General Challenge's
post 15. Churchill Downs, for the second year, catered to
television by having horses' connections ``draft'' starting spots
in an order determined by lot.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders had even worse luck than Baffert's male
contingent: Florida Derby winner Vicar and Blue Grass Stakes winner
Menifee were stuck on the outside in posts 18 and 19, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero trainer Richard Mandella, who drew the No. 1 pick,
chose ``lucky number'' post 7.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring, who has as much early speed as any horse in the
field, will have to use it to keep a clear path from post 2.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert chose 14 and 15 even though 12 and 13 were available
when he drafted. He explained that he liked the idea of putting
Prime Timber in the last stall of the main starting gate and
General Challenge in the first stall of the auxiliary gate _ giving
each a few feet of extra room on one side at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Timber can get a little fidgety in the gate, so with 14
there's no one on his immediate right side,'' said Baffert, who's
shooting for a record third straight Derby victory. ``General
Challenge takes a step or two to get in gear, and there's open
space to his inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Posts 15 and 16 produced Derby winners Grindstone in '96 and
Thunder Gulch in '95.
</P>
<P>
   But 17 through 20 have produced only two winners in the century.
</P>
<P>
   A better way?: Baffert suggested the Derby hosts try yet another
way of assigning post positions _ by letting handlers draft in an
order determined not by luck but by their horses' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas and Nick Zito quickly endorsed the idea, which
might guarantee the favorites good posts.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to be Sheikh: Is Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum a
hands-on horse owner? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheikh was scheduled to get to Churchill Downs in time for
Worldly Manner's and Aljibr's workouts this morning. The barn said
the workout distances will be determined after he arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, the 1998 Del Mar Futurity winner, and Aljibr
will be the first Arab-based horses to run in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Memory test: Churchill Downs announcer Luke Kruytbosch, recently
of Hollywood Park, will be calling his first Kentucky Derby. He has
never called a race with more than 14 horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I can look past the emotion, rattle off names and
call a solid race,'' said Kruytbosch, 36.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen TV crews have trooped through the booth this week to
interview Kruytbosch, whose job makes him a minor celebrity in
horse-oriented Kentucky. Asked how many L.A. stations showed such
interest in his three years at Hollywood Park, he gave the expected
answer: none.
</P>
<P>
   Early to rise: Lukas, named Tuesday to the thoroughbred racing
Hall of Fame, on how he celebrated: ``I didn't even leave my room.
I had some chocolate milk and I think I was in bed by 8:30.''

EDITORIAL: DUKE ELLINGTON'S CENTENNIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago Thursday, Duke Ellington was born in
Washington D.C., and if every city or town where he and his band
performed during his lifetime were to commemorate by hearing a song
of his again, the earth would resonate with music. It should not be
possible, Thursday of all days, to walk down Broadway or look out
over the rooftops of Harlem without hearing in the streets the
sound of an Ellington composition. But even if you have to listen
in your own mind, you will hear, if you listen closely, the echo of
a pulse he memorialized again and again in music.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington was partial to giving brief verbal accounts of the
moods his songs captured. Reading those accounts is like looking
deep into the background of an old photo of New York and noticing
the lost and almost unaccountable details that gave the city its
character during Ellington's heyday, which began in 1927 when his
band made the Cotton Club its home. ``The memory of things gone,''
Ellington once said, ``is important to a jazz musician,'' and the
stories he sometimes told about his songs are the record of those
things gone. But what is gone returns, its pulse kicking, when
Ellington's music plays, and never mind what past it is, for the
music itself still carries us forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's body of work is enormous, and enormously
influential. For many years he was so prolific that you cannot help
wondering whether he got down even a fraction of what he heard in
his head. If you judge his ambition by the contours of his recorded
music, then he was a vastly ambitious man, always probing outward,
across genres, from the last musical outpost he inhabited, without
ever abandoning the blues, which he helped transform. His personal
stature was stately, almost diplomatic in later years, and there
was a curious irony in the way he would introduce, with a precise,
unlocalized diction, a song that he and his band would use to
scorch the room. Thursday is a good day to remember the uprising in
the heart that a big band could cause, and especially the big band
led by Duke Ellington. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A GERMAN-ITALIAN MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 29: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The economic integration of Western Europe, as signified by the
common euro currency, was designed in part to help European
businesses unify to become world-class competitors that could
compete with giant American companies. A merger of Deutsche Telekom
and Telecom Italia is unlikely to produce such a company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, agreed to last week, would create one of the largest
telecommunications companies in the world, as measured by market
value. But for that company to be an effective competitor it would
need to pursue efficiencies under a management dedicated to making
money and improving service. Nationalistic interests would need to
take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   But those goals seem to have been overlooked in this deal. The
merged company is to be managed on the basis of ``parity,'' with
neither old company dominating the merged entity and the German
government agreeing not to meddle in management although it will
own 45 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   This is a marriage born of desperation, not of love. The Italian
company wants to fend off a hostile takeover offer from Olivetti, a
much smaller Italian concern. Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia _
once state-owned monopolies in their countries _ have been
struggling with the deregulated and internationalized
telecommunications market. They have entered into a variety of
foreign alliances that so far have shown little in the way of
results.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for a merged Italian-German business to
overcome internecine rivalries and provide superior service at a
reasonable cost. If it fails to do so, the result will be a huge
company that will gradually see its markets picked off by more
nimble competitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Office was not sure he would still have a job on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight Tuesday, Parr drove to Sheriff John Stone's home
and dragged him over to Columbine High School here for an impromptu
news conference. Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news
outlets around the world read an Associated Press story quoting
Stone extensively about the massacre at Columbine last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of
evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had
announced to the world hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has
made a mistake,'' Parr, a 20-year veteran of police work who has
been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the
massacre, said on Wednesday. ``I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so delicately, Parr and Steve Davis, a sheriff's deputy who
serves as the department spokesman, spent most of Wednesday
clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the
police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a
teacher and 12 classmates last Tuesday before turning their guns on
themselves. The department is also being questioned about its
handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that
is now under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements: Three
students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last
Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation, but
in fact have been cleared. The videotape showing the carnage in the
cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen
firing at the students. There is no evidence that Harris and his
friend Dylan Klebold, the other gunman, tried to escape and were
stopped by sheriff's deputies. Investigators are eager to make
arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff can't know every single detail in a case this
huge,'' Parr said gently, noting that there are 35 investigators
from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads,
plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school.
``We're doing the best we can,'' he added. ``And we're going to
learn from this. Believe me, we're going to learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of untangling confused news reports came as the
authorities announced that Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old Columbine
senior who went to the prom with Klebold, bought three of the four
guns used in the attack, not two as they said on yesterday. Miss
Anderson, who is being treated as a witness, not a suspect, bought
the two shotguns and a rifle, the police said. The source of the
semiautomatic TEC-9 handgun used in the killing spree remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department source also confirmed on Wednesday that
Harris, 18, was rejected from the United States Marine Corps
because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are warned that if Luvox is combined with other drugs,
including alcohol, it can cause extreme agitation progressing to
delirium and coma, and death. The package insert also carries a
warning about suicide. ``The possibility of suicide attempt is
inherent in patients with depressive symptoms, whether these occur
in primary depression or in association with another primary
disorder such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,'' it reads. ``Close
supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial drug
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office said that no drugs or alcohol were found in
Harris' body during an autopsy, but would not specify whether they
had looked for Luvox. Some friends of Harris said they believed he
might have tried to go off the drug, perhaps after his rejection by
the Marines just five days before he and his best friend stormed
onto the Columbine campus with guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a bunch of cases where people have been on Lithium
and the like and have stopped and committed crimes,'' Mark Pautler,
the chief deputy district attorney for Jefferson County, said on
Wednesday, referring to another common antidepressant. ``We're
looking into everything that might be the cause and might be
preventable in the future, but at this time were not looking at
what would have caused them to commit the crime, as much as whether
anyone else would be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that
others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly
mission and have ``high hopes'' for future arrests. But so far, no
suspects have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crucial pieces of evidence in last Tuesday's shocking
spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria,
where the carnage began, that are being enhanced and reviewed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ``Some of the things we hope
to see from that tape are the gunmen, activities that were taking
place, shooting, any explosive devices that may have been
distributed, exploded, the movement of people,'' Parr said. ``If we
had a third suspect on that videotape, that person would be in jail
today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the painstaking investigation continued here , the copycat
crimes did also. There were bomb threats Wednesday at several
schools around the country and in the Denver area. In Arvada, a
community near here, students were evacuated but no explosions were
reported or bombs found during an hour-long police search.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the sorrowful townwide funeral procession
continued as Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old freshman who loved the
movie ``Star Wars,'' was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of few news developments, much attention was focused on
the misstatements made by Stone, who spent 12 years as a Jefferson
County Commissioner before being elected in November to head the
agency of 325 sworn officers patrolling 750 square miles with a
population of 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it
has a similar number of officers as one of New York's largest
precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many
television cameras ask thousands of questions. In addition to
Wednesday's clarifications, and the revised death toll, the
department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of
when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen
were shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving a lot of interviews,'' said Parr, who was
the department's media spokesman for three years before Davis took
over in January 1988. ``Occasionally we'll have
misunderstandings.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not blame The A.P. or the news organizations,
including The New York Times, that reported the sheriff's comments.
''Apparently what the sheriff was hoping to communicate wasn't
understood in the light that the sheriff was trying to get
across,'' Parr said. ``It was just a misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the
department's history; the last media swarm was when the scion of
the Coors brewing company was killed in the county in the 1960's,
long before the days of 24-hour television news channels. There
were seven murders in the county all of 1998, and four each of the
previous years. Most of the experience Parr and Officer Davis have
had with disasters involved fires and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore., where there were deadly school shootings last
year, said they, too, were overwhelmed by the onslaught of
journalists as well as the horde of investigators from various
agencies they had to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for nothing like this,'' said Terry Long,
chief deputy sheriff for McCracken County, Ky. ``All the best
preparation goes right out the windown when something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davidson of the Arkansas State Police said a school
shooting ``is one of the most chaotic situations that any emergency
personnel is ever going to enter into.'' Sheriff Jack McCann of
Craighead County, the other lead agency in the Jonesboro
investigation, said he often had to send officers out to the field
to shoo away reporters, and that it was sometimes difficult to get
accurate information from young witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson, McCann added, is ``to not say it can
never happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen here,'' he said. ``It can happen anywhere, and
it's going to happen.''

 &HT;    100 reasons to remember Duke
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For today's centennial celebration of the birth of
Duke Ellington _ arguably America's greatest composer and easily
the most prolific in the history of jazz _ let's light 100 candles:
one for each quote and curiosity, anecdote and appreciation,
collected here. From the jazz age through the swing era until his
death in 1974, Ellington encompassed a range of moods and modes,
textures and timbres, that all but define the best of American
music.
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday to Duke. Happy listening for us.
</P>
<P>
   1. He composed ``It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That
Swing)'' in 1932, pre-dating the swing craze by at least three
years (and the current swing revival by more than 60).
</P>
<P>
   2. He composed ``Rockin' in Rhythm'' a year earlier, decades
before the rise of either rhythm &AMP; blues or rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   3. In 1936, his was the first black orchestra to perform at the
University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   4. Nat ``King'' Cole said, ``Duke will always be 25 years
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Born on April 29, 1899, in Washington, D.C., Edward Kennedy
Ellington was known as ``Duke'' before he became a musician or even
entered high school. He was polite and dapper, an American
aristocrat, in his early teens.
</P>
<P>
   6. He was, however, not much of a student, getting C's or below
in almost all of his classes, and a D the only semester he took
music.
</P>
<P>
   7. A gifted visual artist, he won a poster contest sponsored by
the NAACP in 1916 and was offered a scholarship by Brooklyn's Pratt
Institute of Applied Arts, but he decided to pursue a musical
career instead.
</P>
<P>
   8. He later explained that it was easier to write music in the
back of a taxicab than it was to paint.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Pop ran his business like a family and his family like a
business,'' said son Mercer Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   10. His band members called him ``the governor.'' Or
``maestro.''
</P>
<P>
   11. They were paid weekly in cash, by a road manager who carried
a pistol to protect the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   12. His catalog includes at least 1,500 compositions, though
some estimates extend to four times that many. His performances
over a 50-year career numbered nearly 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   13. While audiences demanded the standards from decades past _
he could rarely get away without performing ``Sophisticated Lady''
or ``Caravan'' _ Ellington was always more excited about where his
music was heading next.
</P>
<P>
   14. Trumpeter Clark Terry said that Duke wanted ``life and music
to be always in a state of becoming.''
</P>
<P>
   15. Duke said, ``To stand still musically is equivalent to
losing ground.''
</P>
<P>
   16. Asked were he got his ideas, Duke replied, ``Ideas? Oh, man,
I've got a million dreams. That's all I do is dream, all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   17. He could last for days without sleep, and when he did fall
asleep, it often wasn't until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   18. Duke said, ``You go home expecting to go right to bed. But
then, on the way, you go past the piano and there's a flirtation.
It flirts with you. So, you sit down and try a couple of chords,
and when you look up, it's 7 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   19. He asked, ``What do people do who rest?''
</P>
<P>
   20. He reportedly composed ``Solitude'' in 20 minutes, while
standing up waiting for a recording session.
</P>
<P>
   21. He said, ``There has never been a serious musician who is as
serious about his music as a serious jazz musician,'' but he
disliked being considered a jazz musician.
</P>
<P>
   22. He resisted all categories.
</P>
<P>
   23. And most criticism. ``I don't appreciate analysts,'' he
explained. ``If you're busy analyzing, you can't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   24. How would Ellington classify Ellington? ``My own music, if
you wish a succinct definition, is `screwy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   25. He warned Dizzy Gillespie not to let critics call his music
``bebop,'' because once you name it, you date it.
</P>
<P>
   26. He said, ``There are only two kinds of music: good and
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   27. Duke was a ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   28. Maybe the ultimate ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   29. ``I may be a heel,'' he said. ``But I would hate for people
to think so.''
</P>
<P>
   30. One of his favorite pickup lines: ``My mother always told me
to gravitate toward beauty, so I had to come and see you.''
</P>
<P>
   31. Another: ``I'm so jealous of your frock, because it's closer
to you than I will ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   32. Such lines worked better for Duke than they would for you or
me.
</P>
<P>
   33. Duke said, ``I have two careers, and they must not be
confused, though they almost always are. I am a band leader, and I
am a composer.''
</P>
<P>
   34. He was mistaken. His roles as band leader and composer were
inextricable, his orchestra the crucial component of his
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   35. Explained composer Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's collaborator
and musical alter ego, ``Ellington plays the piano, but his real
instrument is his band.''
</P>
<P>
   36. He called his orchestra ``an expensive toy'' and kept it
going for decades after most of the other big bands disbanded. He
loved being able to write a piece in the morning and then hear it
performed that evening.
</P>
<P>
   37. Duke said, ``It's a matter of whether you want to play music
or make money. ... A musical profit can put you way ahead of a
financial loss.''
</P>
<P>
   38. He drew so deeply upon the talents of his band that, for
many listeners, the sound of Duke Ellington is most distinctively
the warmth of Johnny Hodges' alto saxophone, the passionate purr of
Ben Webster's tenor.
</P>
<P>
   39. Or maybe the growl of Harry Carney's baritone sax.
</P>
<P>
   40. Or, early on, the gut-bucket rasp of Bubber Miley's trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   41. Succeeded by the signature sound of trumpeter Cootie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   42. Though there were occasional complaints that Ellington
received credit for contributions that should have gone to his
musicians, the stars of the Ellington orchestra rarely shined as
brightly in any other context.
</P>
<P>
   43. He hated to fire anyone.
</P>
<P>
   44. Duke said, ``There is no such thing as a 'replacement' in my
band. A new musician means for us a new sound and the creation of
new music, which he, and he alone, can properly express.''
</P>
<P>
   45. When a musician left his band, Duke would say, ``He'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   46. Almost invariably, he was. Sometimes in a matter of months,
or maybe a matter of decades.
</P>
<P>
   47. The most underrated instrumentalist in the Duke Ellington
Orchestra? Pianist Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   48. As evidence, consider his trio recordings, particularly
1962's ``Money Jungle,'' where he holds his own with the ferocious
rhythm section of drummer Max Roach and bassist Charles Mingus.
</P>
<P>
   49. And then return to the orchestra recordings with renewed
appreciation for the subtle virtuosity of Ellington's piano.
</P>
<P>
   50. As a composer, he disdained ``indiscriminate jamming,''
calling it ``the great banality of modern jazz.'' Many of the solos
most strongly associated with his musicians were written for them
by Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   51. Strayhorn said of Ellington, ``He felt that there are many
ways that one can do things, but one way that you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   52. At a time when gay musicians almost invariably kept their
sexuality a secret, Ellington's patronage proved crucial for
Strayhorn: ``We all hid, every one of us, except Billy,'' said one
of Strayhorn's homosexual friends. ``He wasn't afraid. We were. And
you know what the difference between us was? Duke Ellington.''
</P>
<P>
   53. The earliest of Ellington's recorded classics was 1926's
``East St. Louis Toodle-Oo.'' Though the title remains one of
Ellington's better-known, it was actually a typographical error by
the publisher. Duke's original title was ``East St. Louis
Toddle-O.''
</P>
<P>
   54. He enjoyed his first performing prominence from 1928-30 at
Harlem's gangster-owned Cotton Club, where only white customers
were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   55. The mobsters initially suspected that Ellington's music was
``too weird'' for the nightclub crowd, though the style of what was
widely described as ``jungle music'' found popular favor.
</P>
<P>
   56. Polite society wasn't unanimously convinced of the music's
value. ``Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?'' asked the Ladies'
Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   57. As biographer John Edward Hasse writes, ``At the same time
that white society was soaking in his music, leading magazines were
hailing him, and the entertainment world was eagerly embracing his
work, he could not eat in most American restaurants or secure a
room in most hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   58. Duke's response: ``I took the energy it takes to pout and
wrote some blues.''
</P>
<P>
   59. When Ellington introduced ``Mood Indigo'' on a 1930 radio
broadcast, the piece was titled ``Dreamy Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   60. After he played a triumphant concert in Chicago on Feb. 13,
1931, the superstitious Ellington decided that Friday the 13th was
his lucky day.
</P>
<P>
   61. Duke said, ``I'm not worried about writing for posterity. I
just want it to sound good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   62. Wrote critic Ralph J. Gleason, ``It is not necessary to
equate Ellington with Bach to observe that one can listen to both
almost indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   63. Orson Welles once said that Ellington was the only genius
he'd ever known, other than himself.
</P>
<P>
   64. When the first biography of Ellington was published in 1946,
the 47-year-old subject said, ``I'm not old enough to be
historical, and I'm too young to be biographical. Biographies are
like tombstones.''
</P>
<P>
   65. He disliked being in the country, where the grass reminded
him of graves.
</P>
<P>
   66. And he wouldn't wear clothes that were green, the color of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   67. Known for impeccable timing in his music, he was almost
always late in his personal habits. His Christmas cards
characteristically arrived no earlier than February.
</P>
<P>
   68. Wrote critic Albert Murray, ``I don't think anybody has
achieved a higher aesthetic synthesis of the American experience
than Duke Ellington expressed in his music. Anybody who achieved a
literary equivalent of that would be beyond Melville, Henry James
and Faulkner.''
</P>
<P>
   69. ``Such Suite Thunder'' translates Shakespeare into musical
Ellingtonia.
</P>
<P>
   70. ``Suite Thursday'' does the same for John Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   71. Proclaimed French poet Blaise Cendrars during Ellington's
1939 tour of Europe: ``Such music is not only a new art form but a
new reason for living.''
</P>
<P>
   72. Another French critic said that the music revealed ``the
very secret of the cosmos.''
</P>
<P>
   73. In 1965, the Pulitzer Prize committee rejected the
recommendation of its music jury to give Ellington a special award,
opting that year to give no music award at all.
</P>
<P>
   74. In response to the slight, the 65-year-old Duke said, ``Fate
is being kind to me. Fate doesn't want me to be too famous too
young.''
</P>
<P>
   75. He later told interviewer Nat Hentoff, ``I'm hardly
surprised that my kind of music is still without, let us say,
official honor at home. Most Americans still take it for granted
that European music _ classical music, if you will _ is the only
really respectable kind.''
</P>
<P>
   76. He added, with a touch of anger, ``What we do, what other
black musicians do, has always been like the kind of man you
wouldn't want your daughter to associate with.''
</P>
<P>
   77. This year's Pulitzers attempted to make belated centennial
amends by giving Ellington a special citation. Duke was unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   78. Duke said, ``I'm a telephone freak, the greatest invention
since peanut brittle.''
</P>
<P>
   79. Despite his reputation for refined elegance, Ellington was a
man of legendary appetite. His typical dinner might start with two
steaks.
</P>
<P>
   80. Then a lobster in butter.
</P>
<P>
   81. Followed by a salad, a bowl of tomatoes and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   82. Dessert: slices of three different cakes, scoops of three
different varieties of ice cream, each set off with a different
topping.
</P>
<P>
   83. His appetite whetted, he might then proceed directly into a
breakfast of pancakes, waffles, ham and eggs, and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   84. At lunch, he was once reported to have eaten 32 hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   85. Somehow, his weight rarely exceeded 210 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   86. Duke said, ``I'm a hotel man. I'd like to live in the best
hotel I can live in, in the best suite, and just live there and
order food, and never eat in the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   87. Said photographer Gordon Parks, ``At his performances we
young blacks sat high in our seats, wanting the whites to see us,
to know that this handsome, elegant, sharply dressed man playing
that beautiful, sophisticated music, was one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   88. In the mid-'60s, he was accused of not being a sufficiently
vocal advocate of civil rights. Duke said, ``People who think that
of me haven't been listening to our music. ... We've been talking
about what it is to be a negro in this country for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   89. The most ambitious work of Ellington's career was ``Black,
Brown and Beige,'' which he debuted at Carnegie Hall in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   90. Ellington envisioned the 44-minute, three-movement suite as
the history of black America set to music.
</P>
<P>
   91. It was poorly received by critics, who felt that Duke had
reached beyond his musical grasp, that his strength was the
short-form melody rather than the longer conceptual piece.
</P>
<P>
   92. In response, he shelved the suite and never again performed
it in its entirety, though he continued to tinker with it and
record selections from it.
</P>
<P>
   93. ``Black, Brown and Beige'' subsequently has been widely
hailed as Ellington's peak musical achievement.
</P>
<P>
   94. He was once stepping into an elevator of a Paris hotel when
he ran into Hubert Humphrey, who said, ``Cab! How good to see
you!''
</P>
<P>
   95. The vice president and former Minnesota senator thought that
Duke Ellington was Cab Calloway.
</P>
<P>
   96. Ellington's signature response to appreciative audiences
was, ``We love you madly.''
</P>
<P>
   97. He performed with his band until March 1974, when he was
hospitalized in New York for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   98. He died of pneumonia two months later, on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   99. More than 65,000 fans came to mourn him at the mortuary,
which kept its doors open around the clock to accommodate the
throng.
</P>
<P>
   100. Right before he died, he supposedly said, ``Kisses, kisses,
kisses.''

 &HT;    Georgia Republicans, some Democrats slam war policy
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Georgia House Republicans marched in lock step
Wednesday in voting to require President Clinton to obtain
congressional approval before sending ground troops into
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney joined the
Republicans, charging that the president has ``taken us on the
slippery slope toward war.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the bill, which was co-sponsored by Rep. Saxby
Chambliss (R-Ga.), was seen by Georgia House Republicans as
necessary because of their growing distrust of the president's
actions in the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust this president,'' Chambliss said. ``We are
saying, come to Congress before you get involved with ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed the House 249-180, would cut off
Pentagon funding for the deployment of troops if Clinton does not
come to Congress for permission first.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation's two other Democrats, Rep. John Lewis and Rep.
Sanford Bishop, oposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 535 members of Congress should try to conduct a
military action,'' Lewis said. ``We cannot stand by and see a
modern-day Holocaust occur.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if war conflicted with his view of fighting racism
through nonviolence, Lewis said, ``I think there comes a time when
things are so bad and evil that it requires action.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) said he wants Clinton to come before
Congress because he lacks faith in the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president has proven himself utterly untrustworthy
whether it's domestic policy or foreign affairs,'' said Barr, the
first House member to call for Clinton's removal from office, in
the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After a vote Wednesday to withdraw troops failed in the House
290-139 (Lewis, Bishop, Chambliss and Johnny Isakson were the only
delegation members to oppose it) and another to declare war failed
by 427-2 (no Georgians supported it), Barr decided to seek a remedy
in the courts to stop Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Barr wrote a letter to Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.), offering to
join him in filing a lawsuit against Clinton for taking military
action without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The suit would ask the Supreme Court to decide whether Clinton
has violated the Constitution. Campbell had suggested the lawsuit
as an alternative if his resolutions seeking to end the military
conflict or declare war failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``American involvement in Kosovo is counterproductive,
detrimental to our national security, and probably
unconstitutional,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotional day of debate, the Georgia delegation
disagreed on how the country should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and McKinney, who have openly sparred with each other in
the past, are joining Republican Reps. John Linder, Jack Kingston,
Charlie Norwood, Mac Collins and Nathan Deal in calling for an end
to U.S. involvement in the NATO action and bringing home the troops
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fixing to get everything out of there,'' said Norwood. ``I
think we are in the middle of the largest foreign policy disaster
of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   A second camp that includes Chambliss and Isakson says the
United States should finish what it has started and continue to
bomb until Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic is ``brought
to his knees,'' as Chambliss put it.
</P>
<P>
   And a third camp, Bishop and Lewis, think that Congress should
leave the war to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the business of Congress to run a war from armchairs
on Capitol Hill,'' Bishop said. Over in the other chamber, Sen.
Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said he would vote to require that the
president ask Congress for permission to send troops.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) says he would vote against ground
troops for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot get drawn into a major war in the Balkans,'' Cleland
said.

 &HT;    Schlotzsky's hopes cold sandwich fare will take off
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport opens
next month, visitors who don't have time to wait three minutes for
a hot Schlotzsky's sandwich will be able to grab a cold one.
Sandwich, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin company, with more than 750 delis in 38 states and 13
counties, is known for its 15 hot muffuletta-style sandwiches. But
that may change. Schlotzsky's has been in the test kitchen cooking
up five new cold sandwiches for people on the run. Departing from
the company's trademark buns, which do not hold well in a cold deli
case, the sandwiches are built on artisan breads.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up cold will be:
</P>
<P>
   _ Roasted vegetables _ peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, onions and
mushrooms marinated in balsamic vinegar and oil _ on square
focaccia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turkey on round rosemary focaccia bread, with mango chutney
and lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roast beef and cheddar on sliced loaf ciabatta bread with
creamy horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turkey on dark nutty health bread with Monterey Jack cheese
and lowfat mayo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ham and swiss on a round ciabatta bread with lowfat mayo or
spicy mustard, lettuce and tomato.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the airport opens, these sandwiches will be in place,''
says Lee Applbaum, Schlotzsky's marketing director.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold sandwiches, made on exotic breads and available with
horseradish sauces, gourmet mustards and spicy ranch dressing, are
a little more upscale than Schlotzsky's traditional hot ones. A
little costlier, too, ranging from $4.75 to $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do sandwiches out of our artisan breads,''
says Schlotzsky's corporate baker Rebecca Rather. One of the
sandwiches is made on the popular health loaf from Schlotzsky's
Bread Alone. Another is layered on wood-baked focaccia. However,
for two of the cold sandwiches, Rather found she preferred the
ciabatta bread baked in convection ovens, with its softer crust, to
the crisper ciabatta from the wood-fired oven.
</P>
<P>
   Flavors, shapes, sizes, texture _ all these qualities figured
into the sandwich development. Then came the experiments with
dressings, mustards and other condiments (many of which will be
available separately) before the final five were determined. (Her
personal favorite of the new cold sandwiches: the roasted veggies
on focaccia.)
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Schlotzsky's has experimented with
cold sandwiches. A year ago, several selections, including a
similar turkey sandwich with peach chutney, were offered but
eventually discontinued. Under ideal conditions, the sandwiches
held up well, but in high volume, Schlotzsky's says they were not
satisfied with the product.
</P>
<P>
   It was back to the culinary drawing board for the new airport
offerings, which will be sold as grab-and-go sandwiches at
Schlotzsky's coffee and pastries counter in the Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But, traditionalists, fear not. The original hot Schlotzsky's
will be on the airport menu, too, in the deli in the West Terminal.
Just allow three minutes in your schedule.

SONY POSTS DECLINE IN PROFIT AS PRODUCT DEMAND FALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a sign of how Japan's faltering economy is hurting
even its healthiest businesses, Sony Corp. reported a nearly 20
percent decline in fiscal-year earnings Wednesday and a net loss in
the final quarter, its first quarterly loss in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The results largely reflected a fall in demand for Sony's
electronics products, which account for two-thirds of its sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, the inventor of the tiny transistor radio, the Walkman and
the Trinitron television, said consolidated profits for the year
ended March 31 were 179 billion yen, or $1.49 billion, down 19.4
percent from a record 222 billion yen the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Sony lost 43.3 billion yen from
operations, compared with earnings of 58.9 billion yen in the
comparable quarter a year earlier and the first operating loss
since the quarter that ended in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has hinted that business in the current quarter will also
suffer and that the poor performance will probably extend through
the summer. By then, analysts say, the company will have started to
profit from new products, such as its Vaio laptop computers and
digital camcorders that use a new kind of silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the worst has probably passed for Sony, and
investors seem to be hopeful. The shares, which gained 140 yen
Wednesday, to 11,700 yen, have risen about 35 percent since March
1, largely on optimism about a planned revamping aimed at making
Sony a pioneer in the ability to link up technology, information
and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results Wednesday were released after the stock
market had closed. Sony's American depositary receipts, traded on
the New York Stock Exchange, fell $2.9375 to $94.5625.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is trying to be a `dot com' company, supplying
networking, hardware and content,'' said Hitoshi Kuriyama, a
consumer technology analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. ``People are
buying Sony because of its future dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said its performance for the year was shaken mainly
in the last half because of weaker economies in Asia and other
emerging markets. Another important factor was the rapid
appreciation of the yen last autumn, the season when sales are
usually strongest for the year. The sudden rise of the yen in early
October made it difficult for Sony and other exporters to offset
the impact of the currency move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony has at least shown itself willing to take radical action
to position itself for the future,'' said Alan Bell, an electronics
analyst in London for Schroders Securities Ltd. ``Investors believe
that these are depressed earnings, and that too much concentration
on short-term earnings is to miss the bigger point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts caution against focusing too much on the
Sony dream, for much needs to happen before computers, televisions,
cellular phones and video games can all communicate with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony is the only company with the ingredients to do that, but
implementation is the next stage,'' said Koichiro Chiwata, a
consumer electronics analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in
Tokyo. &QL;

   BOSTON -- Just about everyone had a prediction Wednesday on how
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would react to the
last-minute stadium plan to keep the New England Patriots in
Massachusetts. Everyone, that is, except Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Muzzled by his contract with Connecticut, Kraft could not
discuss any option other than accepting its offer to build, with
taxpayer money, a 68,000-seat stadium in Hartford. A team spokesman
said Kraft, who was in Boston Wednesday, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is expected to meet with his consultants Thursday in an
effort to sort through the status of the Connecticut deal, which
has been dogged by environmental and logistical problems. Terms of
the contract signed earlier this year allow Kraft to cancel the
project _ without penalty _ if he decides by Sunday that the state
cannot deliver the stadium in time or on budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Governor John G. Rowland called a news conference
at the Capitol to insist that the team would decamp from
Foxborough. ``Well, the Patriots are leaving,'' he declared.
``They're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But among Bay State business and political leaders close to the
situation, there was unbridled optimism the team would remain in
Foxborough. Political leaders crowed about Tuesday's late-night
breakthrough, which provides $70 million in state money for
infrastructure improvements if Kraft agrees to build a new stadium
in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very optimistic this can keep the Patriots in
Massachusetts,'' said Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who
last year won agreement from Kraft for a plan similar to the one
hammered out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with National Football League commissioner Paul
Tagliabue on the telephone, Governor Paul Cellucci also was upbeat.
``Connecticut is much sweeter in terms of money, but the loyal fan
base is here, and this is the sixth largest media market,''
Cellucci said. ``I think that's something the other NFL owners and
Mr. Kraft care a lot about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who many saw as the only
man stading in the way of a Masschusetts stadium agreement last
year, said the new deal is ``in the best interest of the taxpayers
and a good deal for the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers stack up like this: The Nutmeg State has agreed to
spend $374 million in public money to build a stadium along the
banks of the Connecticut River in Hartford. In addition, it would
pick up the tab for any unsold luxury suites and seats for up to 30
years. Those guarantees alone are worth more than $1 billion,
sources familiar with the contract say.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Kraft would invest $75 million in a hotel, NFL
entertainment, and fitness complex as part of the city's Adriaen's
Landing development project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Massachusetts plan, Kraft would finance a new stadium,
estimated at $225 million to $250 million, on his own, though under
recently approved rules the NFL can help with a low-interest loan.
It would also require Kraft to pay $1 million a year to the state
to compensate for some of its spending on roads, sewers, and other
infrastructure. The stadium would be built on land Kraft owns in
Foxborough, and the team would play at Foxboro Stadium until the
new facility was ready, in 2002 or 2003
</P>
<P>
   While the Massachusetts bid pales financially in comparison to
Hartford's, Boston business leaders all but predicted that Kraft
would opt to build a new home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is Robert Kraft is very much a hometown guy,'' said
former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, who has
led the Bay State's bid to keep the team. ``I'm not sure he ever
wanted to leave to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kraft has a decision to make and it's not an easy
one,'' added advertising executive Jack Connors. ``But my guess is
he will end up coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL issued a statement saying it was pleased with the
Massachusetts political agreement, reached after Cellucci,
Birmingham, Finneran, and NFL officials met for several hours over
two days this week.
</P>
<P>
   The league said the accord was a ``step in the right
direction,'' but stressed that long-term commitments by the
business community to luxury suites were essential to suceed in
keeping the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In response, business leaders said they hoped to line up
commitments for up to $15 million luxury box suites over the next
two weeks. Luxury suites would sell from $75,000 to $325,000 for
the best 50-yard-line suites. Advance sales are essential to
financing a new privately funded stadium, and a strong response by
corporations would also be send a signal to Kraft that he can count
on their support at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has left the door open for Kraft to back out of the
stadium deal, considered the most lucrative for any NFL owner. It
has stumbled badly in its attempts to acquire and clean up the
proposed stadium site, and there are serious questions about
whether the state can deliver on its promise of 2002 opening date.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NFL has said it prefers that the Patriots remain
in the Boston television market, the nation's six largest, where
games can generate much higher broadcast revenue than in Hartford,
which ranks just 27th. NFL owners, who split league TV money, are
scheduled to vote on the Connecticut move at their next meeting at
the end of May. It is not clear whether Kraft would decide before
that meeting between his competing offers, or wait to see if the
league approves or rejects Connecticut's.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of my negotiations with the Patriots and Robert Kraft,
it was absolutely clear to me that given his preference Kraft
wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts,'' Birmingham said. ``The
NFL has made it incontrovertibly clear that the league's preference
is to have the Patriots remain in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut remains adamant that the Massachusetts deal is
too little, too late. Jay Malcynsky, a lobbysist representing the
team in Connecticut, said he thought the team would still move to
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kraft told me flat out, he's got the deal he want's and
it's in Hartford,'' said Malcynsky, who has close personal and
political ties to Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcynsky is so close to Rowland some say he's actually the
governor,'' said one person involved in the struggle for the
Patriots. ``It's not surprising he'd say something like that at
this point.... But even though it will cost him a lot of dough, the
smart money is on Kraft staying in Massachusetts.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet chatter is becoming a legal minefield.
</P>
<P>
   In a second major lawsuit by a Massachusetts company against
anonymous chatters on the Internet, Stone &AMP; Webster Inc. is seeking
damages against 20 people it charges made false statements about
the company or disclosed inside information online. Stone &AMP; Webster
believes at least some of the defendants are employees.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases are becoming more common as investors turn to the
World Wide Web for information. Raytheon Co. began a similar action
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Inc., the California-based Internet portal that operates
many financial chat boards, faces so many complaints from other
companies that it recently adopted a new disclaimer for its
financial message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Those services, Yahoo now stresses, are ``for entertainment
purposes only.''
</P>
<P>
   But many companies don't see the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a responsible company you have a reponsibility to people
investing in the stock not to have irresponsbile information going
out,'' said William Zucker, a partner at the law firm of Gadsby &AMP;
Hannah, which represents Stone &AMP; Webster, the Boston engineering
and construction firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are starting to regard all this as material because
so many people log onto the chat rooms,'' said Charles L. Solomont,
law partner at Bingham, Dana who has pursued similar cases on
behalf of other clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people read negative things about their company that
appear truthful, it can hurt the value of the stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Supreme Court rulings have affirmed protections for
certain anonymous speech. In 1995, the high court called
unconstitutional an Ohio ban on anonymous leaflets distributed in
political campaigns; earlier this month, the court affirmed a
ruling that the 1996 Communications Decency Act does not prohibit
certain anonymous messages.
</P>
<P>
   But libel and slander are another matter, and even advocates of
protections for Internet users say that people who post on
electronic message boards should beware that passing on rumors
might come back to haunt them if the subject of the rumor takes
offense.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, filed in Suffolk (Mass.) Superior Court last
Friday, Stone &AMP; Webster charges a group it calls ``John Does 1-10''
made false online statements in 1998 and 1999 intended to defame
the company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, another 10 people the company calls ``Fred Roes''
and believes to be current or former employees, allegedly violated
company policies by disclosing confidential information on the same
message board.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Raytheon case, Stone &AMP; Webster has not yet cited
specific messages it considers improper or the screen names of the
authors who posted them.
</P>
<P>
   But like most of Yahoo's message boards devoted to publicly
traded stocks, musings on the Stone &AMP; Webster board run the gamut
from praise to criticism of the company and its chairman and chief
executive Kerner Smith. Recent comments often related to the
company's stock performance. Since January, shares have fallen from
their January high of $34 3/8. Wednesday they closed at $22 each.
</P>
<P>
   In one post dated April 1, for instance, an anonymous writer
described what was supposedly a confidential memo sent to the
company's top 100 managers regarding problems in Asia. ``The tone
of the letter is downright desperate,'' wrote the person, using the
screen name ``gignol.'' ``I suspect that Kerner will not be with us
very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker declined to discuss specific posts, but said Stone &AMP;
Webster will say just what material it finds objectionable as it
pursues discovery against Yahoo to learn the names of the anonymous
authors. Yahoo is not named as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   While employees might eventually be disciplined, he said, a
chief goal of the suit is to obtain an order prohiting them from
making further, allegedly defamatory, posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people would be posting this stuff if they put
it under their own name,'' Zucker said. ``There's a feeling of
having no responsibility for your actions and no ability to verify
whether what the person is saying is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is also seeking unspecified monetary damages. No
hearings have been scheduled in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In another lawsuit involving allegedly false statements on the
Internet, FedTrust Liquidations, a Washington car dealer, on
Tuesday sued a rival firm in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   FedTrust charges that officials of rival Specialty Car Sales
Inc. of Miami posed as disgruntled FedTrust customers and posted
criticisms of FedTrust on a message board at eBay, a popular
Internet auction site. The lawsuit filed in US District Court for
the District of Columbia says that six winning bidders cancelled
their auto purchases after reading the hostile messages.

3 PRIVATE LAWYERS SHADOW PROSECUTORS IN CASES AGAINST POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just hours after the four police officers accused of
killing Amadou Diallo were arraigned on murder charges in late
March, a team of lawyers convened before television cameras in
lower Manhattan and made their case against the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the findings of what they called ``our pathologist,'' the
lawyers described how and where bullets had punctured Diallo's
body. They said Diallo had been lying on the floor for most of the
41-shot barrage in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
And they attacked the ``blue wall of silence'' with which police
officers often shield their accused colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation had all the hallmarks of a closing argument by
prosecutors, but it was an opening salvo by a team of private
lawyers representing the Diallo family in the civil claim they say
they will eventually file.
</P>
<P>
   With that news conference, Johnnie Cochran, Barry Scheck and
Peter Neufeld served notice that they would go far beyond just
filing a lawsuit _ they would be shadowing the criminal
prosecution, demanding reforms in the Police Department and waging
a public-relations war. Friday, when wrangling over pretrial
motions in the criminal case begins in Bronx Supreme Court, they
will not be in the courtroom, but their presence will be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Diallo case the lawyers' only front. The three men,
who were at the epicenter of a national debate over race and police
with the California trial of O.J. Simpson, have now attached
themselves to a half-dozen headline-grabbing cases in New York and
New Jersey, all of which accuse law enforcement officers of
excessive force or abuse of authority.
</P>
<P>
   The people they represent include Abner Louima, the Haitian
immigrant who last year accused police officers in Brooklyn of
sodomizing him; two New Jersey men, one black, one Hispanic, shot
by state troopers on the turnpike last year after what was alleged
to be a race-based traffic stop, and the family of Thomas Pizzuto,
the Long Island man who died in January after, his family says,
guards at the Nassau County jail beat him and left him to languish.
</P>
<P>
   While all of these cases could yield sizable awards or
settlements, the lawyers say they have taken them on because of the
potential they offer for law enforcement reforms. The cases clearly
have their own momentum for reform, and many changes will likely
come long before the civil cases conclude. But the spotlight that
follows Cochran and his colleagues will help keep attention focused
on the issues the cases raise.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lawyers' involvement is good for the prosecutors,
who have the narrower mission of pursuing the criminal case, is
less clear. The lawyers' expertise and the information they provide
in these cases may benefit prosecutors. But their high-profile
presence may also pose dangers, like creating the perception that
the private lawyers' agenda is driving the public prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Their visibility ``certainly has an effect on public opinion,''
said Gerald Lynch, a former prosecutor who teaches at Columbia Law
School. ``And to the extent that public opinion affects
prosecutors, judges and juries, then there is some impact to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simpson case catapulted Cochran, Scheck and Neufeld to fame,
giving them reputations as formidable lawyers and high-priced hired
guns. That renown also provided them entree to many of these cases,
where they are working with local lawyers who were retained first.
And it gives them considerable access to prosecutors and public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unusual for criminal defense lawyers to suddenly
align themselves with prosecutors, there is a continuum of sorts:
the lawyers turned their defense of Simpson into an assault on the
Los Angeles Police Department, just as they are assailing law
enforcement now.
</P>
<P>
   And it did not start with Simpson. As an assistant district
attorney in Los Angeles, Cochran prosecuted police brutality cases,
and in private practice in California, he won millions of dollars
in judgments against law enforcement agencies in brutality cases.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld and Scheck began their legal careers as Legal Aid
lawyers in the Bronx, and founded the Innocence Project, which has
used DNA testing to free more than 40 inmates wrongfully convicted
of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon, legal experts say, for people who allege
that they were victimized by law enforcement officers to retain a
lawyer early in the process to prod prosecutors to pursue a
criminal case. But the impact on these cases of having lawyers with
such unusually high profiles is hard to predict.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, they can be useful to prosecutors. Scheck and
Neufeld wield considerable expertise in forensic evidence, and all
three are skilled at trial preparation. They have hired their own
investigators and say they will pass on to prosecutors what they
learn and will recommend experts.
</P>
<P>
   But as the civil lawyers marshal evidence and theories, it may
be hard for the actual prosecutors to avoid following in their
tracks. Those tensions were perhaps best displayed by the news
conference after the arraignment of the officers in the Diallo
case, at which the lawyers said they wanted to rebut ``trial
balloons'' floated by the defense lawyers about the circumstances
of Diallo's death. Neufeld decried as ``absurd'' the assertion by
one of the officers' lawyers that police had fired 41 shots because
Diallo did not fall down.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld cited an autopsy the team had commissioned from Dr.
Cyril Wecht, a pathologist, to say that two bullets had perforated
Diallo's spine, which would have made it impossible for him to
remain standing, and that forensic evidence suggested those shots
had been fired early in the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, such rebuttals would be made by prosecutors _ at
trial, which is months away. Prosecutors from Bronx District
Attorney Robert Johnson's office have avoided discussing evidence
in the case; they said they are not happy that the civil lawyers
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's good when evidence is discussed in the
newspaper, period, no matter who's discussing it,'' said Barry
Kluger, the chief assistant to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion also places prosecutors in a difficult position:
most criminal lawyers say it is exceedingly difficult for medical
examiners to determine the sequence of bullets hitting a body, and
people who have seen the official medical examiner's report in the
Diallo case say it draws no such conclusion. Yet by having these
lawyers advance with near-certainty such a sequence, the prosecutor
must either adopt the same theory _ or be in the awkward position
of disagreeing with the Diallo family's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld said that, as the family's representatives, his team was
obligated to rebut what they saw as false assertions.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's office is going out of its way to demonstrate its
independence. Kluger, the chief assistant, said the prosecution had
not and would not share any evidence with the civil lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld and Scheck were also quick to stress the ``one-way''
nature of their relationship with prosecutors, saying that they
share information but get none in return.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say frequent contact between civil lawyers and
prosecutors is not uncommon, or even improper. ``There is probably
more interaction than is generally acknowledged,'' Monroe Freedman,
a professor of legal ethics at Hofstra University, said.
</P>
<P>
   What is important, for tactical reasons, is to maintain at least
a perception of distance. ``It's not a good idea for a prosecutor
to be seen as the pawn of a victim who's after a big judgment,''
Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the police officers on trial in the Louima
criminal case under way in Federal court in Brooklyn, for example,
say they plan to question Louima on whether he was prepared for the
criminal trial by his private lawyers. And potential jurors were
questioned about their perceptions of Louima's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And in cases involving the police or other public entities,
Lynch said, a criminal case can be seen as too closely linked to a
broader reform, or symbolic, agenda. A judge, for example, may not
want his or her verdict to be interpreted as a rebuke of all police
officers or the Police Department's practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough for Bob Johnson,'' Lynch said. ``It can only
make it more complicated if the victim or the victim's lawyers are
also identified with an agenda of reform that you are not
identified with as a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neufeld says that, regardless of the impact on the criminal
case, it is this larger agenda that really interests him and his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The New York cases, they said, will focus on the web of rules
and culture that protect police officers. They pointed to the
48-hour rule, which gives officers the right not to be questioned
for two days after an incident, and the power of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, the police union, whose delegates often
insist that officers under suspicion not be questioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say litigation was a much more powerful reform
tool 10 or 20 years ago, when judges were willing to be more
activist. And often, they say, it is less what happens in court
than the publicity and political pressure resulting from a case
that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think about the courts as a mopping-up
operation,'' said Larry Kramer, a professor at New York University
School of Law. ``The Diallo case will do a lot more because of any
political reaction to it than any judgment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ B-52's vocalist Fred Schneider is
talking about Cher and her recent assault on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that something?'' a reporter asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Schneider responds in his best devilish manner.
``Maybe Sonny will come back, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the B-52's in a nutshell, the group that turned a quirky
sense of humor and a thrift-store idea of fashion into a formula
for pop success. Not once, but twice _ in the late '70s, when they
broke big in the New Wave era with classics like ``Planet Claire''
and ``Rock Lobster,'' and again in the early '90s, when they scored
their biggest hits with ``Roam'' and ``Love Shack.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes yet another B-52's comeback a distinct
possibility. But for now, the band is lying low, coming off the
release last year of a greatest-hits compilation (``Time Capsule:
Songs for a Future Generation'') and heading on tour without
vocalist/percussionist Cindy Wilson. ``Cindy's having a baby, so
she's sort out of commission,'' Schneider explains.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when rock seems to have categorized itself to
extremes _ alt-pop, trip-hop, you name it _ there's a niche clearly
waiting to be filled. Call it the rock-as-camp genre: The B-52's
created it, and they're bound to reclaim the throne one of these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what's already come from the band: songs about dogs
named Quiche Lorraine and parties that never seem to end. To say
nothing of those beehive hairdos _ the name B-52's refers to them.
This was pop that begged not to take itself too seriously, but
wasn't pablum for the masses, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our songs are a little more complex than a lot of people
think,'' says Schneider, speaking by phone from his home outside
New York. ``They think we just write campy little tunes. I haven't
seen anyone write one as good as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Rock Lobster,'' with its organ licks and whacked-out
lyrics. The original version ran more than six minutes _ hardly
what you'd call radio-friendly. Then again, as Schneider is quick
to note about one of the band's more party-oriented tunes, ``They
thought `Love Shack' was also too weird. It shows you how
progressive radio is.''
</P>
<P>
   Partying is indeed the predominant theme in the B-52's music.
But would you expect any less from a group that got its start one
night at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Ga., before that city even
became known as a rock outpost? Original band members included
Schneider, Wilson, vocalist/keyboardist Kate Pierson,
guitarist/keyboardist Keith Strickland and guitarist Ricky Wilson
(Cindy's brother), who died of AIDS in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five of them, musical experience was minimal at best:
Cindy sang in the shower to Petula Clark, Ricky learned to play
guitar from watching a show on public television. As for Schneider,
whose vocal style falls somewhere between singing and speech, he
says, ``I never even would sing around the campfire because I had
such a bad voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the band's playful spirit prevailed. After that initial
restaurant meeting and a few basement rehearsals, they made their
debut at a friend's Valentine's Day party. ``We did the same set of
six songs twice,'' Schneider recalls. ``The rest just snowballed
into one party after another.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's fashion sensibility wasn't a conscious part of the
plan, Schneider insists. Band members shopped in thrift stores
because the clothes were cheap _ ``You could get shirts for a
quarter,'' Schneider says _ and they didn't have much money to
spare. The look just developed into its own funky thing.
</P>
<P>
   Musically speaking, what's the next step for the B-52's?
Schneider points out that the greatest-hits compilation did feature
a couple of new songs, ``Hallucinating Pluto'' and ``Debbie,'' that
follow in the band's dance-rock vein. But given Wilson's pregnancy,
he adds that he's not expecting to head back into the studio
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   As for future fashion statements, well, let's just say Schneider
is looking forward to his stint on jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when they say, `Dress properly.' It's like, `Where's
my First Amendment rights?''' he concludes. ``I'm already planning
my outfits.''

 &HT;    From Stax to `Shaft' to `South Park,' he's still a soul man
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Isaac Hayes talks, children listen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not the real Hayes _ that's Chef, the
kid-friendly, skirt-chasing cool cat of a cafeteria worker who's
one of the main characters in ``South Park,'' Comedy Central's
absurdist animated sitcom. Hayes provides the voice _ the writers
supply the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the unscripted, 56-year-old Hayes is on the other end
of the phone line, you're bound to do a double take. Should you
address him as Chef? Or as the composer of some of the most
inventive soul music known to man, the theme from ``Shaft''
included? The guy brings plenty of history to the table _ and
plenty of bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you forgive me for smacking in your ear while we talk?''
he says in that deep, luxuriant voice of his, apologizing for the
fact that he's grabbing a sandwich in the midst of another
interview-filled, 16-hour day. Hey, no problem, Isaac. We just want
to know what's on your mind.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, he's eager to talk music. ``It's not as
flamboyant as it used to be,'' he explains, referring to his
king-of-soul days in the '70s, when he had nearly an orchestra of
musicians behind him. ``Sometimes I'll do it with horns and
strings, but other times I'll do it via the synthesizer.''
</P>
<P>
   The vintage Isaac Hayes is a musician to be reckoned with. While
audiences may know him best for the ``Shaft'' soundtrack _ that
burst of electric funkiness that earned him an Oscar and a Grammy _
Hayes has countless other singles and albums to his credit. As one
of the session men with the famed Memphis-based Stax label, he
produced, composed and played on dozens of hits for artists like
Wilson Pickett, Lou Rawls and Sam &AMP; Dave: ``Hold On, I'm Coming,''
''Soul Man,'' ``B-A-B-Y,'' ``You Don't Know Like I Know'' are just
a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like a big family,'' Hayes recalls of the Stax era.
``We worked and played. It was all fun. Nobody thought of the
longevity of the music or of writing a standard. We just wrote what
we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to a humorous example. ``Hold On, I'm Coming'' was
actually the cry heard from the Stax bathroom by Hayes' songwriting
partner, David Porter. As Hayes tells it, ``I was playing on a
groove. I struck something and it sounded good. David said, `Hey
man, I gotta go to the restroom.' I called out, `David, hurry up
man, I got something.' He said, `Hold on, I'm coming.' He broke out
of the restroom, saying `That's it. That's the title' with his
pants down to his ankles. He was so excited he didn't care how he
looked. And we worked it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A more serious example from the Stax days, however, was Hayes'
1969 album, ``Hot Buttered Soul.'' At a time when rock bands were
beginning to explore the concept album, here was something more
rare _ an R&AMP;B concept album. The recording contained only four cuts
_ it was like a lengthy jam session captured on vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes admits he didn't see much commercial potential for the
project. ``It was a selfish thing on my part because I felt what I
had to say could not be said in two minutes and 30 seconds,'' he
recalls, commenting on the limitations of the singles format.
``Since I had already been a part of 26 albums, I felt no pressure.
I just wanted to do something that was artistically exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   He never thought that Stax execs would go for it. ``I put them
in the conference room and played it for them. As they sat there,
they listened intently. When the album stopped playing, they still
sat there, looking. I was getting worried,'' Hayes remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they came forward. ``They said, `Isaac, we don't know
what this is. You might not get airplay. But this is a
masterpiece,'' Hayes said. Even through a phone line, you can see a
smile breaking on his face.
</P>
<P>
   To the record-buying public's credit, ``Hot Buttered Soul''
broke the top 100 and established Hayes as a new voice of black
cultural pride. It also paved the way for his biggest success _
namely, the score for the 1971 blaxploitation classic, ``Shaft,''
the soundtrack of which became a No. 1 album. As one critic said,
``It has held up much better than the film.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, Hayes combined his music-making with his
bold ideas about style _ think chain vests and a shaved head. The
message of black power was unmistakable. ``I was trying to send an
image out of a black man standing tall, one who had overcome a lot
of suppression but one who was also was pouring his heart out and
sharing his personal experiences,'' he says. He makes no excuses
for his past extravagances: ``I believe in overkill. If people like
it, I want to feed it to them and give them enough so they know
they've been fed.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, musically speaking, Hayes is thinking more in terms
of collaboratingwith a younger generation of musicians,
particularly in hip hop. That is, when he's not having fun with
``South Park''-related projects like the platinum-selling ``Chef
Aid'' album and its unforgettable cuts, ``Chocolate Salty Balls
(P.S. I Love You)'' and ``Tonight Is Right for Love (with Meredith
Baxter Birney).''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Hayes takes his sudden ``South Park'' fame in
stride. Although his celebrity status waned in the 25 years after
``Shaft,'' he went about making recordings without interruption. He
didn't expect, however, to become a cultural icon once again thanks
to a TV series that's guaranteed to offend everyone. Hayes' ``South
Park'' character has even managed to woo Kathy Lee Gifford to his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did the first episode, when I read it actually, I said
you guys got to be kidding,'' Hayes recalls. ``I was a little
reluctant, a little paranoid by it, but I eventually did it and had
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hayes is hardly as lust-driven as Chef. He spends his
days hosting a morning soul program on a New York radio station,
promoting education through his World Literacy Crusade and telling
the world the virtues of Scientology, his adopted religion (he
admits he thought it was a cultbefore he joined, but now finds it a
spiritual comfort).
</P>
<P>
   As for Chef and his antics, however, he thinks there's something
to be said for the man. ``I like his candor, the freedom of the
character. If he wants to make love, he wants to make love right
now,'' he concludes. ``There's a little Chef in all of us.''

PIONEER SNOW RECOGNIZED BY DRAG RACING HALL
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Snow admittedly did not invent every cutting-edge part that
found its way onto his assortment of Funny Cars and Top Fuel
dragsters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But during a colorful and outspoken 40-year career that
continues today, the Fort Worth businessman/racer never has been
reluctant to bolt on, modify or fabricate a piece that might sling
him down the quarter-mile quicker and faster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow and fellow Texan Richard Tharp were among 14 members of the
class of 1999 who were inducted into the International Drag Racing
Hall of Fame last month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very nice deal,'' said Snow, who was presented by Joe
Amato, a five-time National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel champion,
during formal ceremonies in Gainesville, Fla. The hall is located
at the Museum of Drag Racing, founded by retired Top Fuel legend
``Big Daddy'' Don Garlits in Ocala, Fla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be inducted into that hall of fame,'' said
Snow, who was presented a plaque and ring to commemorate his
achievements. ``A person that has put as many years into drag
racing as I have would be disappointed to have not gotten into it.
And like I told Don Garlits, thanks for putting me in while I can
still walk up there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow may have been the inspiration for the ``win on Sunday, sell
on Monday'' thinking that is the basis for factory participation in
all forms of motorsports. Snow began his drag-racing career with
muscle and high-performance cars he would repair, drive off his
used car lot and take to the local drag strip. A win over the
weekend more often than not would produce an eager buyer at Snow's
office the next morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow moved up the ranks into more exotic machinery but is best
remembered for his pioneering days in the Funny Car ranks. In 1965,
he built the first in a series of ``Rambunctious'' and ``Snowman''
Dodges. Using an injected, late-model Chrysler Hemi V-8, Snow's
first Dodge Dart featured fiberglass doors and front-end predating
the one-piece bodies that have become the norm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then classified by the NHRA as a Fuel Dragster, the car rang up
impressive numbers on gas or fuel, winning Comp and Super
Eliminator titles at NHRA events from 1966 through 1968. That year,
Snow also became the first NHRA Funny Car driver to crack the 200
mph barrier (200.88 mph). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow is the only driver to have won national events in four
categories _ Top Fuel, Funny Car, Competition and Super Eliminator.
But his first love remains those exotic ``Rambunctious'' Funny
Cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was trails we'd never been down before,'' said Snow, who
was among the first to experiment with high-gear, direct-drive
transmissions, rigid suspensions, turbocharging and air induction.
``Back then, we had something different every month that we were
trying. That's when it was fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow also was a pioneer of the team concept, fielding a Top Fuel
car and three Funny Cars in 1972. He switched to Top Fuel in 1981
and racked up consecutive top-10 NHRA points finishes between 1983
and 1991. In October 1988, Snow became the first NHRA driver to
crack the 5-second barrier with a pass in 4.997 seconds at Houston
Raceway Park in Baytown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Snow says that he is ``older than dirt.'' But the man who
made his money in the oil and gas business still is competing in
the NHRA's Federal Mogul Dragster division, as a Sportsman racer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolute hobby,'' Snow said between rounds at the
Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis last weekend.
``And I've got to be a realist. I don't want to spend what little
money I've put aside to retire on. And the odds eventually get you.
I've been pretty lucky not to have gotten hurt real bad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm not trying to blaze any trails, just get out and have a
good time. I don't have to answer to anybody that way.'' &QL; 
HAMLIN ADJUSTS TO EARNHARDT'S STYLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hamlin's first career victory as Dale Earnhardt's crew
chief in Sunday's DieHard 500 is proof that there is more than one
way to run a NASCAR Winston Cup race shop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin joined Earnhardt's crew in June in the celebrated switch
of crew chiefs that also sent Larry McReynolds ``down the hill'' at
Richard Childress Racing and over to Mike Skinner's team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds was diplomatic about the demotion. But Larry Mac
didn't hide the fact that he and Earnhardt clashed over the
seven-time champion's reluctance to spend time at the shop during
the week. McReynolds also suggested that Earnhardt had gotten a
little too comfortable with what had gotten him here, that he was
reluctant to try new ideas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds couldn't deal with all of the above during a tenure
that produced Earnhardt's emotional first victory in the 1998
season-opening Daytona 500. That was Earnhardt's only victory in
the previous 100 races heading into the Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway, where ``The Intimidator'' led his first laps of 1999
and gave Hamlin a new profile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When it (the switch) all came about, it was like, `This isn't
what I want to do, Richard,' '' Hamlin said. ``I liked the
low-profile thing being with Mike Skinner and starting a team from
nothing and working up. Hopefully, Mike and I would get our first
win together. That's how I always envisioned it, and I really
wanted it to happen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skinner and Hamlin did win a NASCAR exhibition road race in
Japan in November 1997. But Sunday's restrictor-plate gem produced
Earnhardt's 72nd career victory and took the heat off the crew of
his No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media, people in the grandstands, everybody wants us to be
able to say: `What's wrong?' And there's not anything wrong,''
Hamlin said. ``Dale has the same desire he's always had to drive
and win races. The team is just as strong and pumped up as its ever
been. The competition level is just so great that one minor thing
is a major setback.''
</P>
<P>
   And just for the record, how often does Dale Earnhardt actually
show up at RCR to lay hands on his race car?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale comes to the shop maybe once a month, or more, if
needed,'' Hamlin said. ``To me, it's no big deal.''
QUICK HITS
IRL RACE GAINS BACKER
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has signed on as ``presenting sponsor'' for the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League's night event at Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth on June 12. Formerly known as the True Value 500K, the
event is now the Longhorn 500 Presented by MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, the IRL will share billing with
NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series. The Pronto Auto Parts 400K is
scheduled for the night of June 11. PACE CARS ON THE BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   Two Indianapolis 500 pace cars, a 1982 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 and
1986 Corvette, are among the inventory being offered in the Leake
Car Collectors Auction during the ``Star-Telegram'' AutoFest
featuring the Pate Swap Meet at TMS this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Show hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today through Saturday, and 8
a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $6 for adults. NHRA rumors
flying
</P>
<P>
   Rumors surrounding the make-up of the 2000 National Hot Rod
Association season were circulating during the Castrol Nationals at
the Texas Motorplex in Ennis last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The rumored changes are that Houston Raceway Park in Baytown
will lose its spring race after 12 years, leaving it with a fall
date; Route 66 Raceway near Chicago will be granted a second date;
and Bruton Smith's Las Vegas Motor Speedway will get its first
national event.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes would bump the schedule to 23 events, not
including the nonpoints Winston Showdown at Smith's revamped
Bristol (Tenn.) Dragway. LITTLE AL PLANS RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr., who suffered a fractured right ankle in the CART
FedEx season opener March 21 at Homestead, Fla., is planning to
return for the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix in Nazareth, Pa., this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Unser Jr. ran 49 miles of testing at Gateway International
Raceway near St. Louis on Monday, a session cut short by rain. As
an oval that requires a minimum of shifting, Nazareth is not
expected to overly test Unser's ankle-strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to watch two races from the sidelines and I'd rather not
make it three,'' said Unser, driver of the Marlboro Penske
Mercedes. IRL tunes up for Indy
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League teams get their last tune-up before the
Indianapolis 500 at the VisionAire 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Concord, N.C., on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   LMS is a 1.5-mile trioval banked at 24-degrees, a layout that
bears little resemblance to Indy's flat, 2.5-mile rectangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indy is such a creature of its own, as far as setup and how
quickly the track changes,'' IRL regular Scott Sharp said. ``I
don't think your setup at Charlotte will help at Indy. However,
it's really critical that our series is in front of the fans more
often. Hopefully, this'll show the fans we're only a few weeks from
Indy, and these are the guys who will be comprising the field.''
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. Driving a car is like sex. Everybody thinks
they're good at it.''

WITH ITS RICH RESOURCES, CALL LAKE PARKER PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEE VINING, Calif. _ Parker Lake is full of surprises, as a pair
of intrepid fishermen discovered during a recent foul-weather
camping trip to the postcard-worthy backcountry site in the Eastern
Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how close _ just 2.2 miles _ it is for anglers who
don't mind hike-in fishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how mellow the climb _ just 400 feet of elevation
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how early the thaw _ at 8,318 feet, the lake is
ice-free.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how few anglers target it _ most anglers
 &UR; !ital! &LR; do &UR; !off! &LR;  mind hike-in fishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, surprising in how big and tough are the brown
trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in there has got my pole,'' said Doug Wildason of Wildomar
in Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   His hiking buddy, Jeff Christiansen of Van Nuys, chuckled at the
recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Wildason had caught and released a 3-pound brown on his first
cast of Saturday's trout-season opener after awaking to a snowy,
windswept morning. The anglers favored Power Bait and inflated
night crawlers, but little was hitting after the initial hook-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting there relaxing and watching our poles because
they were motionless for the longest time,'' Wildason said. ``We
didn't have any bites for a while, but when the second one hit,
whack, phshh, my pole just flew off. We saw the fish jump but it
was hard to tell what size it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Their tough-luck story would only get worse, but more on that
later.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Lake is indeed home to bruiser browns, with some
measuring to 20 inches or longer; smaller browns and brook trout
reside in the outlet stream, Parker Creek. While the lake is
favored by bait-and-hardware types, it also sees plenty of
fly-anglers who often work their way up the creek to its source
using a mix of dry flies and nymph patterns on 3- to 5-weight rods.
</P>
<P>
   I carried a fly rod and a bait pole Sunday but was luckless on
the creek and blown off the lake by an unrelenting wind that put a
serious chill on the sun-drenched outing.
</P>
<P>
   While Parker Lake Trail offers one of the Eastern Sierra's
earliest backcountry fishing opportunities, it appears it was a
little too soon for much fly-fishing success in the creek. The
water remained cold and most of its fish were content to laze
around in deeper holes or under fallen trees, their cold-blooded
metabolisms not permitting any pursuit of the flies presented to
them even if they had the urge.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked, from the size No. 16 attractor patterns _ namely
royal stimulators and Sierra bright dots _ to deceivers such as an
Adams, mosquito imitations and emerger nymphs. You could blame my
fishing prowess, but no so fast; three fly-anglers in my group were
skunked on the day. One colorful brook was taken on a worm just
below the lake. The lake was worse; flies were useless in the wind,
and the lures got no attention.
</P>
<P>
   But like the locals say about the weather in the Eastern Sierra,
change comes very quickly, and the fish will undoubtedly be more
receptive when the climate warms.
</P>
<P>
   Braving snow flurries and strong winds a day earlier, Wildason
and Christiansen got a glimpse of what Parker Lake is like when
it's on. They landed several nice browns and Wildason took a
bruiser that he said measured from the ground to just above his
knee. (For reference, that distance is 24 inches on my leg.)
</P>
<P>
   But disaster struck again. ``I had it on the stringer sitting
there underneath my pole holder, and I went to adjust my pole
holder and it went vrooo with my stringer,'' said Wildason, who had
a witness in Christiansen but left his camera at camp. ``It was the
nicest one I ever caught, and it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't wish his luck on anyone. At least the anglers count
themselves fortunate for finding such a secluded spot, one that
they have visited several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get away from the crowds, this is the only way to do it
now,'' Christiansen said of such hike-in spots as Parker Lake,
which sits in an impressive basin surrounded by precipitous walls
of granite. ``It's the best scenery of the lakes in the (June Lake)
Loop.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as fortunately, most anglers, hikers and campers will
have an easy time with the mild grade on the 4.4-mile round-trip
into the Inyo National Forest and Ansel Adams Wilderness. Waders
are a great benefit, and packing in a float tube shouldn't be too
much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I took my young children _ Dillon, 3, and a baby,
Rebecca, in the backpack _ and Dillon was able to walk all the way
to the lake,'' said Donna Bertolina of Mammoth Lakes, manager of
the Mammoth Lakes Visitor Center. ``In the fall it's really pretty
because the aspen trees have orange and yellow leaves. It's one of
the best times to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The region is steeped in cultural _ and controversial _ history.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Lake was named after some early settlers in the Mono
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   For eons Parker Creek fed Mono Lake via Rush Creek. But for
nearly a half-century, Parker Creek was disconnected from Rush
Creek and Mono Lake by the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power; its waters were diverted to the Los Angeles Aqueduct from
1941 to 1990, when the great Mono Lake debate came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing-conservation group CalTrout and the Mono Lake
Committee successfully sued the DWP to rewater the creek in an
attempt to re-establish its fisheries and replenish Mono Lake. (The
litigation impacted the lowest stretches of Parker Creek, well
downstream from the lake and the portion of the creek profiled
here.)
</P>
<P>
   Anglers report the fishery upstream is as healthy as ever. Just
keep a sharp eye on your fishing rod and stringer.

 &HT;    HOUSE DECLINES TO SUPPORT KOSOVO AIR STRIKES
 &HT;    Eds: This is an alternative lede for papers wishing to emphasize
the vote on air strikes.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, in a 213-213 vote Wednesday night,
declined to support the U.S.-led NATO air strikes now under way
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise vote came on a measure identical to one the Senate
had broadly supported last month. Some Democrats expressed outrage,
while the Clinton administration said it would proceed with the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was the last of several Wednesday on U.S.
participation in the five-week-old conflict, which is aimed at
returning ethnic Albanians to the province of Kosovo under the
protection of an international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Before splitting on air strikes, the House voted to require
President Clinton to seek Congress's approval before sending ground
troops into combat against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But the House refused either to order Clinton to withdraw U.S.
forces from the Balkans or to formally declare war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote on air strikes came just hours after Clinton had
appeared outside the White House to request congressional support
for the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are speaking with a single
voice,'' Clinton said. ``America must continue to speak with a
single voice as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House deadlocked on the resolution offered by Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., despite a supporting vote from Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gratuitous authorization,'' Rep. Doug Bereuter,
R-Neb., said in the debate leading up to the vote. ``Bombing for
peace is wrong and it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hastert said, ``The speaker has been telling the
president all along that he needs to make his case to the American
people and to the Congress. This vote shows how he has to continue
to make that case.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said later, ``The House today voted no
on going forward, no on going back and they tied on standing
still,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ``We will
continue to prosecute the air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., called the House vote an ``appalling
lack of judgment and an appalling abandonment of the troops in the
field. It is a day which this House will profoundly regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's series of votes marked the first formal House
response to the Yugoslavia fighting. They came only after Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Calif., had single-handedly forced the House leadership
to schedule a debate on the war using the provisions of the War
Powers Act of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers first voted 249-180 to deny funding for ground
troops unless the president wins authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the action on ground troops was
uncertain, since the Senate would have to pass a similar bill,
which could then be vetoed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House then rejected a measure to require Clinton to bring
home the U.S. forces involved in the NATO operation, 290-139. It
also trounced a proposal, with only two ``yes'' votes, to make a
formal declaration of war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the emotional daylong debate aired long simmering
disputes over the the U.S. role in the Balkans, the
administration's conduct of the war, and whether Congress has a
constitutional duty to play a role in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not even be in the Balkans,'' said House Armed
Services Chairman Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C. ``The national security
of the United States is not at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the mission countered that Americans had an
obligation to stop the assaults on ethnic Albanians by the forces
of Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic. ``The voices of
appeasement and isolationism are reverberating in these halls,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who fled the Nazis during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The president had attempted to pre-empt the House action by
reassuring lawmakers in person and in a letter stating that he
would seek their consent before deciding to wage a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told his colleagues
that it was unnecessary to pass a law requiring authorization to
expand the air assault into a land operation. ``The president said
he would not as a practical matter ask for an introduction of
ground troops without coming here and taking the time to ask us for
a vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance was not enough for some members. Rep. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., one of the managers who conducted the impeachment
trial in the Senate against Clinton, told his colleagues: ``I do
not have the confidence'' that Clinton will seek a vote before
ordering troops into ground action, he said. ``Now's the time to
speak, more than less, sooner rather than later, before we get a
lot of people killed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Office was not sure he would still have a job on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight Tuesday, Parr drove to Sheriff John Stone's home
and dragged him over to Columbine High School here for an impromptu
news conference. Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news
outlets around the world read an Associated Press story quoting
Stone extensively about the massacre at Columbine last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of
evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had
announced to the world hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has
made a mistake,'' Parr, a 20-year veteran of police work who has
been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the
massacre, said on Wednesday. ``I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so delicately, Parr and Steve Davis, a sheriff's deputy who
serves as the department spokesman, spent most of Wednesday
clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the
police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a
teacher and 12 classmates last Tuesday before turning their guns on
themselves. The department is also being questioned about its
handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that
is now under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements: Three
students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last
Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation, but
in fact have been cleared. The videotape showing the carnage in the
cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen
firing at the students. There is no evidence that Harris and his
friend Dylan Klebold, the other gunman, tried to escape and were
stopped by sheriff's deputies. Investigators are eager to make
arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff can't know every single detail in a case this
huge,'' Parr said gently, noting that there are 35 investigators
from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads,
plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school.
``We're doing the best we can,'' he added. ``And we're going to
learn from this. Believe me, we're going to learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of untangling confused news reports came as the
authorities announced that Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old Columbine
senior who went to the prom with Klebold, bought three of the four
guns used in the attack, not two as they said on Tuesday. Miss
Anderson, who is being treated as a witness, not a suspect, bought
the two shotguns and a rifle, the police said. The source of the
semiautomatic TEC-9 handgun used in the killing spree remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department source also confirmed on Wednesday that
Harris, 18, was rejected from the United States Marine Corps
because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are warned that if Luvox is combined with other drugs,
including alcohol, it can cause extreme agitation progressing to
delirium and coma, and death. The package insert also carries a
warning about suicide. ``The possibility of suicide attempt is
inherent in patients with depressive symptoms, whether these occur
in primary depression or in association with another primary
disorder such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,'' it reads. ``Close
supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial drug
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office said that no drugs or alcohol were found in
Harris' body during an autopsy, but would not specify whether they
had looked for Luvox. Some friends of Harris said they believed he
might have tried to go off the drug, perhaps after his rejection by
the Marines just five days before he and his best friend stormed
onto the Columbine campus with guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a bunch of cases where people have been on Lithium
and the like and have stopped and committed crimes,'' Mark Pautler,
the chief deputy district attorney for Jefferson County, said on
Wednesday, referring to another common antidepressant. ``We're
looking into everything that might be the cause and might be
preventable in the future, but at this time were not looking at
what would have caused them to commit the crime, as much as whether
anyone else would be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that
others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly
mission and have ``high hopes'' for future arrests. But so far, no
suspects have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crucial pieces of evidence in last Tuesday's shocking
spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria,
where the carnage began, that are being enhanced and reviewed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ``Some of the things we hope
to see from that tape are the gunmen, activities that were taking
place, shooting, any explosive devices that may have been
distributed, exploded, the movement of people,'' Parr said. ``If we
had a third suspect on that videotape, that person would be in jail
today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the painstaking investigation continued here , the copycat
crimes did also. There were bomb threats Wednesday at several
schools around the country and in the Denver area. In Arvada, a
community near here, students were evacuated but no explosions were
reported or bombs found during an hour-long police search.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the sorrowful townwide funeral procession
continued as Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old freshman who loved the
movie ``Star Wars,'' was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of few news developments, much attention was focused on
the misstatements made by Stone, who spent 12 years as a Jefferson
County Commissioner before being elected in November to head the
agency of 325 sworn officers patrolling 750 square miles with a
population of 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it
has a similar number of officers as one of New York's largest
precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many
television cameras ask thousands of questions. In addition to
Wednesday's clarifications, and the revised death toll, the
department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of
when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen
were shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving a lot of interviews,'' said Parr, who was
the department's media spokesman for three years before Davis took
over in January 1988. ``Occasionally we'll have
misunderstandings.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not blame The A.P. or the news organizations,
including The New York Times, that reported the sheriff's comments.
''Apparently what the sheriff was hoping to communicate wasn't
understood in the light that the sheriff was trying to get
across,'' Parr said. ``It was just a misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the
department's history; the last media swarm was when the scion of
the Coors brewing company was killed in the county in the 1960's,
long before the days of 24-hour television news channels. There
were seven murders in the county all of 1998, and four each of the
previous years. Most of the experience Parr and Officer Davis have
had with disasters involved fires and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore., where there were deadly school shootings last
year, said they, too, were overwhelmed by the onslaught of
journalists as well as the horde of investigators from various
agencies they had to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for nothing like this,'' said Terry Long,
chief deputy sheriff for McCracken County, Ky. ``All the best
preparation goes right out the windown when something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davidson of the Arkansas State Police said a school
shooting ``is one of the most chaotic situations that any emergency
personnel is ever going to enter into.'' Sheriff Jack McCann of
Craighead County, the other lead agency in the Jonesboro
investigation, said he often had to send officers out to the field
to shoo away reporters, and that it was sometimes difficult to get
accurate information from young witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson, McCann added, is ``to not say it can
never happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen here,'' he said. ``It can happen anywhere, and
it's going to happen.''

TEXAS SENATE GIVES BLESSING TO SCHOOL FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate put its stamp of approval
Wednesday on a $2.6 billion school funding proposal designed to
raise teacher pay and help schools pay off debt while also
promising local property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill represents the single largest infusion of new money
into public education in Texas history,'' said Education Committee
Chairman Sen. Teel Bivins, the chief author of Senate Bill 4.
</P>
<P>
   One of its key features is a $700 million set-aside for a new
funding formula that would help school districts retire existing
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``School facilities are the most persistent issue this
Legislature has failed to address in the last 50 years,'' Bivins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spending plan, however, is so delicate that a compromise
that could easily evaporate in the upper chamber if substantial
changes are made by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we run the risk of losing a majority vote'' if the
House makes many changes, said Bivins, R-Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Republicans that were dying to vote against the bill,''
he added. ``They said, `Go ahead and make one more amendment, and
we're going to go off the reservation.' And (some) Democrats felt
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Approved unanimously on a voice vote by the Senate, the measure
now goes to the House, where Rep. Paul Sadler, D-Henderson and
chairman of the Public Education Committee, was quick to criticize
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't do the things that I think we should do,''
Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do are some very specific programs that improve
student learning,'' Sadler added. ``And I think that's what the
public wants. And so, we're going to have to find a way to fund
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not had a surplus in almost a decade. We have a chance
to do some things that would really benefit our kids and our
education system, and we should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Senate bill's shortcomings, he said, are its failure
to guarantee every teacher a pay raise, failure to provide programs
such as mandatory kindergarten and others aimed at keeping high
school freshmen from dropping out. Earlier this week he laid out
his school funding plan, a substantially costlier proposal that
addresses all those matters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Senate Bill 4 would raise the minimum teacher pay scale
$4,000 for each of 20 steps, only about half of Texas teachers
would benefit from that provision. That's because most Texas school
districts use local tax funds to pay teachers more than the state
minimum. Only those teachers in districts paying the minimum or
slightly more would see substantial pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to guarantee that all teachers who already earn
more than the state base pay also get a pay raise, the Senate plan
would require that school districts put at least 60 percent of
their new funding into teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   That pass-through provision, however, would amount to as little
as $400 or $500 a year in some districts, according to Bivins
spokeswoman Cathy Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Cootes, spokeswoman for the Texas State Teacher
Association, however, said TSTA fears the pass-through provision
would allow districts to use all the pass-through money to raise
salaries of just a few teachers. For example, she said, a district
that wanted to attract science and math teachers might be able to
use all the new salary money to increase pay only for teachers in
those subject areas.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the preliminary Sadler plan would guarantee every
teacher a $3,000 pay raise, regardless of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 4 also would put about $1 billion into facilities
funding and other measures that Bivins insists amount to a property
tax cut. Another $125 million has already been set aside in the
state budget to help districts with declining property values.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler has criticized Bivins' portrayal of Senate Bill 4 as
providing $1 billion in tax relief as a sham, contending that the
only real tax relief comes from a $700 million program aimed at
helping school districts pay off existing debt to build school
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said such criticisms amount to splitting hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is under this bill, the property taxpayers will
have a billion more dollars in their pocket,'' he said. ``I call
that a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the consternation in Wednesday's nearly three-hour
debate came from those who wanted to put more money into teacher
pay raises and less into property tax cuts. They argued that an
additional $100 million that was put into facilities funding plans
under an amendment came from money that originally had been
earmarked for teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   Texas teacher salaries have lagged behind the national average,
and teacher groups have been calling for a $6,000 across-the-board
increase to get classroom teachers to that level.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, lost in his bid to amend Senate
Bill 4 so that it would put more money toward teacher salaries and
less toward facilities and tax cuts, and he suggested that Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential ambitions were driving the tax-cut
measures.
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election campaign, Bush pledged to seek $2 billion
in property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest to you the only thing that has happened ... has been
New Hampshire,'' Shapleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of this compromise is the delicately crafted money
allocation balance between kids and tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average Texas teacher salary was $32,000, while
the national average in 1996-97 was $38,000, said John Cole,
president of the Texas Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still going to be way below the national average and
everyone should understand that,'' Cole said. ``Still, (Senate Bill
4) is a step in the right direction, and we hope we're going to get
a better deal'' in the Texas House.

 &HT;    Teacher raises weighed against Texas tax cut
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A ``delicate balance'' between $1.7 billion in
teacher pay raises and $1 billion in property tax cuts cleared the
Senate on Wednesday, but the Republican sponsor warned that
significant House changes could topple the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, who had to rewrite the proposal more than once
just to get it out of the Senate, said he believes that the bill
has been changed as much as possible. But Rep. Paul Sadler, Bivins'
counterpart in the House, said the bill still needs work, adding
that House lawmakers have yet to go to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, University of Texas government Professor Bruce
Buchanan said the compromise away from Gov. George W. Bush's call
for $2 billion in property tax cuts doesn't appear threatening to
the governor, who's likely to run for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any kind of tax cut at all, it seems Bush is in a
position to defend himself. The amount of tax cuts only becomes
important if he sticks to his number too long,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Bush's office said the governor remained
committed to his $2 billion even though legislative leaders like
Bivins and the Senate's chief budget-writer, Sen. Bill Ratliff
(R-Mount Pleasant), have said there's not enough money or support
for $2 billion in property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Bush will reach a point where he has to let go of
his proposal ``when everybody on his side says it's hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't perceive that moment has arrived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler (D-Henderson) said the House is considering changes to
the bill that will have to be ironed out with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been compromising with themselves,'' Sadler said of
Senate members. ``Hello, there's another chamber. I think there are
some things that we need to do to benefit education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said Senate Bill 4, which cleared the Senate on a voice
vote, contains $1.7 billion in new money for teacher compensation
and $1 billion to cut local school property taxes. Sadler has said
he believes the tax cuts add up to less than $1 billion and has
proposed a plan that has about $500 million in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between Bivins and Sadler had Bivins and others talking
about a special session, another wrinkle that could test Bush's
leadership before his expected bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could very easily run into serious resistance on one side
or the other if ... the mix changed substantially,'' Bivins said.
``It's a pretty delicate balance we've got here. If it's attempted
to be pushed very far one way or the other we run the risk of
losing a majority vote. Special sessions are always possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said if the House and Senate come close to a deal, Bush
could benefit from a special session because it would allow him to
show leadership on the issue and allow him to walk away with tax
cuts and teacher pay raises, another item on his legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   If the chambers remain far apart on the pay raise-tax cut
matter, Bush might be better served by blaming the failure on
lawmakers than by trying unsuccessfully to broker a deal during a
closely watched special session.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding a special session, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said
only that the governor will continue to work with lawmakers to
improve education funding and pass teacher pay raises and property
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the legislative process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   While important to Bush's future, the bill also impacts the rest
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNabb, a spokeswoman for the Association of Texas
Professional Educators, said the group is happy that more money has
been put toward teacher compensation ``but we would still like to
see raises be across the board.'' She said teachers and
administrators in her group are willing to pass up property tax
cuts in order to get pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   As it passed the Senate, the bill would guarantee at least
$4,000 pay raises for teachers paid the minimum allowed for their
experience level. That, however, covers less than half of the
state's 260,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires all school districts to give 60 percent of new
money to teachers, so all of them will get some kind of raise, but
it won't be equal and could be very little for teachers in
districts that get very little state money.
</P>
<P>
   Property taxpayers also would get various levels of tax cuts
under the bill based in part on the amount of debt their districts
have related to school buildings. Much of the tax cutting efforts
in the bill are in programs to help pay for school buildings,
meaning that local taxes collected for that purpose can be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect bill,'' Bivins said.

WITH ITS RICH RESOURCES, CALL LAKE PARKER PLACE

By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEE VINING, Calif. _ Parker Lake is full of surprises, as a pair
of intrepid fishermen discovered during a recent foul-weather
camping trip to the postcard-worthy backcountry site in the Eastern
Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how close _ just 2.2 miles _ it is for anglers who
don't mind hike-in fishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how mellow the climb _ just 400 feet of elevation
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how early the thaw _ at 8,318 feet, the lake is
ice-free.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising in how few anglers target it _ most anglers
 &UR; !ital! &LR; do &UR; !off! &LR;  mind hike-in fishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, surprising in how big and tough are the brown
trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in there has got my pole,'' said Doug Wildason of Wildomar
in Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   His hiking buddy, Jeff Christiansen of Van Nuys, chuckled at the
recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Wildason had caught and released a 3-pound brown on his first
cast of Saturday's trout-season opener after awaking to a snowy,
windswept morning. The anglers favored Power Bait and inflated
night crawlers, but little was hitting after the initial hook-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting there relaxing and watching our poles because
they were motionless for the longest time,'' Wildason said. ``We
didn't have any bites for a while, but when the second one hit,
whack, phshh, my pole just flew off. We saw the fish jump but it
was hard to tell what size it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Their tough-luck story would only get worse, but more on that
later.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Lake is indeed home to bruiser browns, with some
measuring to 20 inches or longer; smaller browns and brook trout
reside in the outlet stream, Parker Creek. While the lake is
favored by bait-and-hardware types, it also sees plenty of
fly-anglers who often work their way up the creek to its source
using a mix of dry flies and nymph patterns on 3- to 5-weight rods.
</P>
<P>
   I carried a fly rod and a bait pole Sunday but was luckless on
the creek and blown off the lake by an unrelenting wind that put a
serious chill on the sun-drenched outing.
</P>
<P>
   While Parker Lake Trail offers one of the Eastern Sierra's
earliest backcountry fishing opportunities, it appears it was a
little too soon for much fly-fishing success in the creek. The
water remained cold and most of its fish were content to laze
around in deeper holes or under fallen trees, their cold-blooded
metabolisms not permitting any pursuit of the flies presented to
them even if they had the urge.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked, from the size No. 16 attractor patterns _ namely
royal stimulators and Sierra bright dots _ to deceivers such as an
Adams, mosquito imitations and emerger nymphs. You could blame my
fishing prowess, but no so fast; three fly-anglers in my group were
skunked on the day. One colorful brook was taken on a worm just
below the lake. The lake was worse; flies were useless in the wind,
and the lures got no attention.
</P>
<P>
   But like the locals say about the weather in the Eastern Sierra,
change comes very quickly, and the fish will undoubtedly be more
receptive when the climate warms.
</P>
<P>
   Braving snow flurries and strong winds a day earlier, Wildason
and Christiansen got a glimpse of what Parker Lake is like when
it's on. They landed several nice browns and Wildason took a
bruiser that he said measured from the ground to just above his
knee. (For reference, that distance is 24 inches on my leg.)
</P>
<P>
   But disaster struck again. ``I had it on the stringer sitting
there underneath my pole holder, and I went to adjust my pole
holder and it went vrooo with my stringer,'' said Wildason, who had
a witness in Christiansen but left his camera at camp. ``It was the
nicest one I ever caught, and it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't wish his luck on anyone. At least the anglers count
themselves fortunate for finding such a secluded spot, one that
they have visited several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get away from the crowds, this is the only way to do it
now,'' Christiansen said of such hike-in spots as Parker Lake,
which sits in an impressive basin surrounded by precipitous walls
of granite. ``It's the best scenery of the lakes in the (June Lake)
Loop.''
</P>
<P>
   And, just as fortunately, most anglers, hikers and campers will
have an easy time with the mild grade on the 4.4-mile round-trip
into the Inyo National Forest and Ansel Adams Wilderness. Waders
are a great benefit, and packing in a float tube shouldn't be too
much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I took my young children _ Dillon, 3, and a baby,
Rebecca, in the backpack _ and Dillon was able to walk all the way
to the lake,'' said Donna Bertolina of Mammoth Lakes, manager of
the Mammoth Lakes Visitor Center. ``In the fall it's really pretty
because the aspen trees have orange and yellow leaves. It's one of
the best times to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The region is steeped in cultural _ and controversial _ history.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Lake was named after some early settlers in the Mono
Basin.
</P>
<P>
   For eons Parker Creek fed Mono Lake via Rush Creek. But for
nearly a half-century, Parker Creek was disconnected from Rush
Creek and Mono Lake by the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power; its waters were diverted to the Los Angeles Aqueduct from
1941 to 1990, when the great Mono Lake debate came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing-conservation group CalTrout and the Mono Lake
Committee successfully sued the DWP to rewater the creek in an
attempt to re-establish its fisheries and replenish Mono Lake. (The
litigation impacted the lowest stretches of Parker Creek, well
downstream from the lake and the portion of the creek profiled
here.)
</P>
<P>
   Anglers report the fishery upstream is as healthy as ever. Just
keep a sharp eye on your fishing rod and stringer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING ...
</P>
<P>
   Parker Lake and Parker Creek are situated west of Grant Lake and
the Eastern Sierra's June Lake Loop. Travel highways 14 and 395
some 320 miles from the San Fernando Valley to the northern
junction of the loop and turn left on Highway 158. Drive less than
1{ miles and veer right onto Parker Lake Road, then follow signs
along the dirt road 2{ miles to Parker Lake Trailhead. Parking is
free.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing: Five trout can be taken daily, 10 may be in possession.
(Special regulations apply to Parker Creek farther downstream;
consult the Department of Fish and Game's ``1999 California Sport
Fishing Regulations'' handbook.)
</P>
<P>
   Camping: A wilderness permit _ available free of charge from any
Inyo National Forest ranger station _ is required for overnight
stays. Camp 100 feet from water sources; keep fires small and in
existing fire rings.

 JACKSON PANEL BEGINS MISSION TO FREE 3 GIs  
(af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson and a dozen religious
leaders left Wednesday night for Belgrade to seek the release of
three American soldiers held captive by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that our going will open up lines of
communication, and in the end we may be able to talk it out and not
just fight it out,'' Jackson said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they did not approve of
the trip and told Jackson that he did not have the authority to
negotiate on behalf of the administration and could not guarantee
his safety.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has stressed that the NATO conditions for a
cease-fire are not negotiable. Officials also said they were
concerned that Milosevic would exploit Jackson for propaganda
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always run the risk when Milosevic hears from multiple
voices, that the message is not clear,'' Joe Lockhart, President
Clinton's spokesman, said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
met with Jackson and others for 45 minutes Wednesday afternoon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said after the meeting, ``Berger made it clear that if
he had his druthers, he'd rather we didn't go because it's
dangerous and he doesn't want Milosevic to get mixed messages.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was to include the Rev. Joan Campbell,
general-secretary of the National Council of Churches, the Rev.
Leonid Kishkovsky of the Orthodox Church in America, a Russian
Orthodox priest from New York, and Rabbi Steven B. Jacobs of Los
Angeles, a Reform rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   It also included Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., and Landrum
Bolling, senior adviser of Conflict Management Group in Cambridge,
Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from President Clinton's statement on
Kosovo and questions and answers Wednesday at the White House, as
recorded by The New York Times, and a letter he wrote to House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert :
</P>
<P>
   Statement by Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   I just had a good meeting with a large bipartisan delegation
from both houses of Congress on Kosovo. It was our fourth meeting
since the airstrikes began. We spoke about the NATO summit, its
unity and determination to achieve our objectives in Kosovo, about
the progress of our military campaign and the intensification of
economic sanctions, about the humanitarian challenge that we face
and the work that we and our allies are doing to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   Just on Monday, some 3,500 Kosovar refugees in trains and buses
arrived in Montenegro. Yesterday about 5,000 entered Macedonia.
Almost 3,000 arrived in Albania exhausted, hungry, shaken, all by
the violence and abuse they experienced on the way.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, 1.8 million ethnic Albanians lived in Kosovo.
Nearly one and a half million have been displaced since the start
of the crisis. ...
</P>
<P>
   Our humanitarian coordinator, Brian Atwood, who just returned
from the region, has described an elderly Albanian woman he met in
a camp outside Tirana. She saw all the male members of her family
and most of the men in her village rounded up by Serbian
authorities, tied up, doused with gasoline and set on fire in front
of their families. It's the kind of story that would be too
horrible to believe if it were not so consistent with what so many
other refugees have been saying.
</P>
<P>
   What we need to remember is that this is the result of a
meticulously planned campaign, not an isolated incident of
out-of-control rage. A campaign organized by the government of
Belgrade for a specific political purpose _ to maintain its grip
over Kosovo by ridding the land of its people.
</P>
<P>
   This policy must be defeated, and it will be defeated. That was
the clear message of the NATO summit. Nineteen democratically
elected NATO leaders came together to demonstrate their unity and
determination to prevail. We agreed to intensify the air campaign,
and that is what NATO is doing, both against military targets in
Kosovo and against the infrastructure of political and military
power in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Our partners in southeastern Europe, the front-line states who
are risking so much and who have borne such a heavy burden, have
followed through on their pledges of support.
</P>
<P>
   We are also providing more funds to the U.S. High Commissioner
for Refugees and to NGO's to deliver food and supplies to the
refugees. Our Defense Department has found a site for the facility
it will build in Albania for up to 20,000 refugees. We hope it will
begin taking in refugees in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to members of Congress about all these efforts today. I
told them that now is the time to pass the supplemental funding for
Kosovo that I requested nine days ago. We needed to maintain our
military readiness. Just as important, we need to sustain
humanitarian relief and support for the front-line nations that
have absorbed the brunt of this emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Let me stress that my request fully funds our military and
humanitarian needs in Kosovo. The Congress should resist the
temptation to add unrelated expenditures, even important ones,
which could delay the process, because that would undermine the
very goals that this funding is intended to meet. We must get a
Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now.
</P>
<P>
   We also talked about other legislative initiatives pending on
Kosovo in the Congress. I stressed that the 19 NATO allies are
speaking with a single voice. America must continue to speak with a
single voice, as well. I told them we would welcome the support of
the Congress, so that Mr. Milosevic will have no doubt that we have
the determination and the patience to persevere until we prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Each day our military campaign takes a toll on Serbia's
machinery of repression. The Serbian leadership has failed to
divide us and will not outlast us. The combined military might and
moral determination of Europe and North America will endure.
</P>
<P>
   We know what the final outcome will be. The Serbian forces will
leave Kosovo. An international security force will deploy to
protect all the people there, Serbs as well as Albanians. And the
refugees will return with security and self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, do you see any signs that Milosevic is losing
his grip, Sir? Any signs at all?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: We have some indications that there are differences of
opinion, obviously, developing in Belgrade. And we saw some of it
public this week. There are some things that we know that I _ I
think I should not comment on.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing I want to tell the American people is we know
objectively what damage has been done. We know now we're going to
be in a position to fly around the clock at lower altitudes from
all directions in better weather. Historically, the weather is
better in May than in April, better in June than in May, better in
July than in June.
</P>
<P>
   And I feel very strongly that we should stay with and be very
strong in determination to pursue our strategy as well as the very
important decisions we made at the NATO conference to intensify the
economic pressure. And I believe that if we do these things, we
will be successful. I am determined to do it. I believe our allies
are all determined to do it. I think when they left here, they were
more determined than when they came.
</P>
<P>
   As to the question the gentleman asked about the troops, keep in
mind, the fact that they have mobilized more troops is an
indication of the trouble they're having. If they had no problems,
they wouldn't need the troops. The initial state of play on the
ground was they had 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo and nearly
300 tanks. So we always knew that if they were willing to take the
bombing in the beginning, they could do what they have done. Now,
we have to stay with it to reverse that, and we can and we will if
we stay with it. I'm determined to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Letter to Hastert
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Speaker:
</P>
<P>
   I appreciate the opportunity to continue to consult closely with
the Congress regarding events in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented unity of the NATO members is reflected in our
agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify the air
campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the NATO alliance
to prevail. I am confident we will do so through use of air power.
</P>
<P>
   However, were I to change my policy with regard to the
introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would fully
consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to our differing
constitutional views on the use of force, I would ask for
congressional support before introducing U.S. ground forces into
Kosovo into a nonpermissive environment. Milosevic can have no
doubt about the resolve of the United States to address the
security threat to the Balkans and the humanitarian crisis in
Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed to go home to a safe and
secure environment.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton

PAT SCHROEDER: OUT OF THE HOUSE, BUT STILL FOCUSED ON THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consider the following tableaux, circa 1956.
</P>
<P>
   It is Sunday night in suburbia, and Mom, Dad and the kids are
together around the TV. They are watching Ed Sullivan and the
featured guest is Elvis Presley. An intergenerational
misunderstanding ensues. In our day we had real music, says Mom. In
our day, we didn't wear tight jeans, says Dad. The kids roll their
eyes. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who fled what she called the
``food fight'' in Congress in 1996 and now runs the Association of
American Publishers, paints this picture, as dated as a Norman
Rockwell cover, as she sips coffee behind the New York Public
Library, under a canopy of budding green.
</P>
<P>
   She is musing on the recent school massacre in Colorado, asking
what had changed in the last 40-odd years to turn children of
upper-middle-class suburbia into mass murderers. ``How did we get
here?'' she asks. ``Times are good. What is the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   She answers her own question, at least in part, by imagining
today's upscale family. Mom and Dad are in the master suite of a
capacious home, with a movie on the VCR. The kids are in their
rooms, each with its own computer and TV. One is playing video
games. One watches MTV. Another surfs the Internet. Nobody is
arguing. Nobody is talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beautiful family of America living the American
dream,'' Ms. Schroeder says. ``But we need some ways to relate to
each other as human beings. We need to work on getting connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder, 58, master of the irreverent sound bite, hems and
haws uncharacteristically. She has just finished a glib lecture to
library donors, who enjoyed all her old chestnuts, like the one
about having both a brain and a uterus.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, Ms. Schroeder returns to the nagging questions of
Columbine High School in a suburban Denver district adjacent to the
one she represented for 24 years. She observes that technology can
be divisive, segregating adults and teen-agers as rock music and
drugs once did. And for misfit teen-agers the technology can be
dangerous, if they seek community in chat rooms where people sow
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They no longer feel so isolated,'' she says. ``But they still
aren't looking anybody in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology has also changed our expectations of war, Ms.
Schroeder says, as she watches the conflict in the Balkans from the
sidelines, rather than from her seat on the House Armed Services
Committee. ``How accepting we've become with these 10,000-foot
aerial views,'' she says. ``Since the Gulf War, we've approached
this as a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she balks at being viewed as a Luddite, despite fumbling
for change to make a telephone call while others at the cafe use
Startacs. After all, the trade association has recently pushed a
treaty through Congress that protects intellectual property in the
era of electronic publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But megabytes of information on the Internet are no substitute
for books. ``Knowledge is not wisdom,'' she says. Thus, her current
project is an advertising campaign encouraging 18- to 34-year-olds
to read. In this vein, she is a great fan of Oprah Winfrey's book
clubs and the coffee bars in Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are among the few civil institutions left,'' she says,
``Places to go to see other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schroeder's biography is a template for its time. She was a
gangly tomboy, a standout student at the University of Minnesota
and one of 15 women in a class of more than 500 at the Harvard Law
School. It was her husband, Jim, a devotee of Adlai Stevenson, who
pushed her into politics in 1972, the year of the Nixon landslide.
Like Stevenson, she expected to talk sense and lose. Instead, in an
upset worthy of Frank Capra, Ms. Schroeder, with two children in
tow, went to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There she met with cruelty and condescension, and also great
success. Her legislative resume was heavy on family-friendly issues
long before they were trendy, like the Family and Medical Leave
Act, research on women's health and improved benefits for soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   She quit Congress in exasperation during the reign of Newt
Gingrich, in time to miss the impeachment shambles, and spent a
year teaching at Princeton University. Then she wrote a memoir.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Schroeder retired she said she was ``looking forward to
reading books, not bills.'' Still, running a staid association
seems an unexpected encore for a firebrand.
</P>
<P>
   She explains the move by saying that literacy and the First
Amendment are ``issues that have sung for me forever.'' She also
says she hated the commute from Princeton to Washington, where her
husband practices law. Plus, with offices in Washington and New
York City, the job allows her to visit her 32-year-old son, who
works at American Express, without ``hovering.'' She dodges a
question about other offers.
</P>
<P>
   The slower pace is timely, because Ms. Schroeder's parents, both
85, are ailing, her father with lung cancer and her mother with
Alzheimer's disease. Her brother lives with them in Florida, and
she visits each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   She describes her time there _ paying bills, buying groceries
and persuading her father he is too old to drive _ as ``a Salvador
Dali painting.'' This weekend, her 28-year-old daughter, a doctoral
student in England, will fly in to take her mother's place while
she attends a conference. It sounds like Ms. Schroeder's
congressional agenda incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to reality,'' she says.

COURT PAPERS CLAIM MICROSOFT PLOTTED AGAINST NOVELL  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST, MICROSOFT-DOCUMENTS) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To break the spirit of Novell Corp., its Utah-based archrival in
the network software market, Microsoft Corp. in 1994 considered a
recommendation that it lock up sales accounts at both the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Brigham Young University,
documents filed Wednesday in federal court contend.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, Mike
Murray, a high-ranking Microsoft executive, wrote that at a retreat
for company executives he had proposed that while the accounts were
not Novell's largest, they were important psychologically and
emotionally. ``The influence of the LDS church in the Utah economy
and culture is difficult to appreciate from a distance,'' Murray
wrote. ``I recommend we throw some significant weight at this
account.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was part of 188 pages of evidence filed in federal
court in Salt Lake City by Caldera, a software company that is
suing Microsoft for as much as $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail message added: ``In addition, it would be great for
Billg to make time for a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with church
leaders. It may be possible to leverage your mother's membership on
the KIRO board.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mrs. Gates, who has since died, was on the board of
KIRO, a Seattle TV station owned by a church subsidiary, Bonneville
Communications. In the end, Gates never visited Salt Lake City for
this purpose and his mother never intervened, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera contends that Microsoft set out to destroy public demand
for DR-DOS, an operating system that competed against Microsoft's
MS-DOS. Caldera was formed by Novell's former chairman, Ray Noorda,
who filed the lawsuit in July 1996 after acquiring DR-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera contends that Microsoft integrated MS-DOS with its
Windows graphical user interface in part to damage its competitors.
Microsoft's own filings contend that DR-DOS was a flawed product
and that its customers were provided with inadequate technical
support.
</P>
<P>
   The filings are aimed at defining the scope of claims that will
be allowed at a trial now scheduled to begin next January. Until
now, Microsoft has been successful at keeping much of the pretrial
evidence sealed under a broad court order.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera executives said they believe the evidence drawn from
more than 1.5 million pages of documents filed in the case
demonstrates that Microsoft used misleading product announcements
to dampen DR-DOS sales and that it made false and misleading
statements about DR-DOS to sow what Caldera called FUD _ for fear,
uncertainty and doubt _ in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera also said the evidence showed that Microsoft developed
intentional incompatibilities to make it appear to be difficult for
DR-DOS to work with Windows and that it used ``per-processor'' and
other exclusionary licensing terms to block DR-DOS in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't just random e-mails,'' said Bryan Sparks, chief
executive of Caldera. ``We think this material is significant, and
much of this has never been seen before because it's been under
protective order.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Microsoft spokesman said all accusations raised by the
company had previously been reviewed and rejected by the Justice
Department. ``This is an attempt by Caldera to rewrite the history
of the high-tech industry by pasting together these handpicked
excerpts,'' said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in many cases the Caldera document took the e-mail
comments of Microsoft executives out of context. For example, one
excerpt from an e-mail sent by James Allchin, the Microsoft
executive who now heads the company's Windows 2000 effort, states:
``If you're going to kill someone there isn't much reason to get
all worked up about it and angry _ you just pull the trigger. Any
discussions beforehand are a waste of time. We need to smile at
Novell while we pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But taken in context, Murray said, Allchin was writing an appeal
to instruct Microsoft executives to stop ``trash talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying we should just compete in a way that is more
professional,'' he said. ``He was saying this is hurting us with
the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caldera document asserts Microsoft integrated MS-DOS and
Windows in an effort to damage competitors' operating systems. The
document quotes Nathan Mhyrvold, Microsoft's chief technology
officer, as arguing for integrating the two products for a
strategic reason: ``We put a bullet in the head of our would-be
competitors on DOS, like DRI, Desqview, DOS extenders etc.'' DRI
was Digital Research Inc., the company that developed DR-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   The Caldera accusation is not supported by history, Murray said:
``This is them excerpting a small snippet of a memo and trying to
create a narrative that does not reflect the facts of the
situation. Even the Department of Justice has acknowledged that
Windows 95 is a completely new operating system.''

ANY IMPROVEMENT BY VICAR SEEN AS PLUS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Carl Nafzger has been commenting this week
that he expects Vicar, the 3-year-old he trains, to improve by five
lengths in Saturday's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas has set his sights lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd settle for five inches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, chosen Tuesday for induction into the National Racing
Hall of Fame, saddles Cat Thief and Charismatic in search of his
fourth Derby victory. Only two other trainers _ Dick Thompson and
Ben Jones _ have won that many.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief has frustrated Lukas with his penchant for near-wins.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the Fountain of Youth in February by a neck, and was
beaten only a half-length in the Florida Derby, both times by
Vicar. And in the Blue Grass Stakes three weeks ago, he finished 1
1/4 lengths behind Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas blamed some of Cat Thief's reluctance to win on an
obstinate personality inherited from close ancestors Alydar and
Storm Cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a double dose of stupid,'' Lukas said. Valhol trainer
eating again Now that Valhol is safely in the field courtesy of an
Arkansas judge's decree, trainer Dallas Keen can enjoy his meals
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't been much fun,'' the Cameron native said
Wednesday. ``Food wasn't even tasting good. Maybe now I can put
some of this weight back on that I've lost the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Valhol will be the third Derby mount for jockey Willie Martinez,
who replaces embattled Billy Patin, accused of carrying an
electrical device in the gelding's surprise April 10 Arkansas Derby
victory. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Lemon Drop Kid was the lone Derby entrant to record an
official workout Wednesday. He went a half-mile in 48 1-5 seconds
under jockey Jose Santos.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``dosage index'' is claimed by proponents to
mathematically calculate a 3-year-old's chances to win the Derby
based on pedigree, but Real Quiet foiled the system last year. Four
of this year's entrants are dosage non-qualifiers: Menifee,
Charismatic, First American and Worldly Manner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting knocked out of the Derby lineup by Excellent Meeting
is all part of the game, says Etbauer's owner, Hays Biggs of
Springdale, Ark. But Biggs was less philosophical about the judge's
ruling Tuesday that allowed Valhol into the Derby field, which also
contributed to Etbauer's exclusion. ``I'm not the least bit happy
with that business,'' Biggs said. ``But I don't want to comment
further.'' nn

BAFFERT'S DERBY CHANCES BOOSTED BY FILLY'S ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert spent much of Tuesday morning
biting his tongue and explaining why he probably wouldn't be
running Excellent Meeting in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, he happily explained why he probably will.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert finally talked the owners of the filly into taking a
shot at Saturday's legendary race at Churchill Downs. He also has
two other entrants in the capacity 20-horse field, as he bids to
become the first trainer to win the Derby three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This filly is doing great,'' Baffert said, ``and she's earned
her way into the Derby. She's good enough to win. Her last works
have been outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't run her in the Derby if I didn't think she had a
chance to win. She deserves the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, to be ridden by Kent Desormeaux, will be part
of a betting entry with Santa Anita Derby winner General Challenge
and jockey Gary Stevens. Both horses are owned by John and Betty
Mabee of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's third horse will be Prime Timber, ridden by David
Flores.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of filly Excellent Meeting and gelding General
Challenge was established as the 3-to-1 program favorite, even
though only three fillies have won the Derby in its 124-year
history, and geldings are 0-for-72 since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber is the second favorite at 7-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, the televised Kentucky Derby
draw was conducted under a format in which owners and trainers of
the horses chose their own post positions in an order determined at
random. Unlike the first time, when a redraw was necessary,
Wednesday's procedure went without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting will start from post No. 6. Prime Timber has
No. 14 and General Challenge breaks from No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Among Derby qualifiers, the extreme outside post positions went
to Lemon Drop Kid (No. 20) and Menifee (No. 19). But though they
are clearly disadvantaged, all hope is not lost for them. Clyde Van
Dusen, also the last gelding to win the Derby, scored from post 20
in 1929. And in the most recent 20-horse lineup, the 1984 Derby's
first four finishers started from posts 15, 19, 14 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol, the Arkansas Derby winner who made it into the race on a
judge's order, is one of four horses grouped in the mutuel field.
Other field horses are K One King, Ecton Park, Kimberlite Pipe and
Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first Churchill Downs appearance this week was Sheik
Mohammed al Maktoum of Dubai, who picked post No. 5 for Aljabr and
No. 12 for Wordly Manner.
</P>
<P>
   Another filly in the race is Three Ring from post No. 2. The
last time two fillies started in the same year was also 1984, when
the D. Wayne Lukas-trained duo of Life's Magic and Althea ran
eighth and 19th.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers in the entry process were Etbauer and Torrid
Sand, excluded from the field because of a lack of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Etbauer was on the bubble until Wednesday morning's decision to
enter Excellent Meeting knocked him out of the race, which is
limited to the top 20 earners, according to track rules. nn

 FDA Snubs Scios Drug, Shares Take Beating
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Shares in Scios Inc. fell more than 60 percent yesterday after the
Mountain View company said the Food and Drug Administration had
rejected its proposed drug for congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so close, that was the heartbreaking part of it,''
Scios chief executive Richard Brewer said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Scios shares plummeted $5.88 to close at $3.81, making it the
biggest percentage loser on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Scios had been seeking FDA permission to sell Natrecor, a drug
that relaxes blood vessels to ease the buildup of fluids in the
chest that can put a painful, and potentially deadly, squeeze on
the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Scios had hoped that Natrecor could generate sales of up to $300
million and make the money-losing company profitable at long last.
</P>
<P>
   FDA approval had seemed imminent. In January, an FDA advisory
committee recommended approval of Natrecor on a 5-to-3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But in a six-page letter faxed to Scios late Tuesday, FDA
officials explained why they had rejected the firm's request to
sell Natrecor.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the agency decided Scios had not tested Natrecor on
enough patients. The company had given the proposed drug to 500
people with congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the letter indicated the FDA feared that Natrecor
might relax the blood vessels too much, causing dangerously low
blood pressure that could bring on strokes or other conditions in
some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He said Scios officials will meet with the FDA next week to see
what sort of tests the agency might seek to alleviate these
concerns about possible side effects. Even if the company is
ultimately successful, it could easily take a year to perform the
additional tests.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Scios said it had a net loss of $9.9 million (26
cents per share) in the quarter ended March 31 compared to net
income of $1.3 million (3 cents) in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the decrease in earnings was due in part to
restructuring charges. Scios laid off a third of its workforce in
March.

MILLIONS IN LILCO SEVERANCE CANNOT BE CLAIMED BY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ The state attorney general's office has
determined that it is legally impossible to get back any of the $67
million in severance pay given last year to Dr. William J.
Catacosinos and 25 other top officials of Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said Wednesday that although a
nearly yearlong investigation into the breakup of Lilco found that
Catacosinos had engaged in a ``pattern of deception'' in the size
of the severance package and under what circumstances it would be
paid, the severance agreement included ironclad protection against
any liability.
</P>
<P>
   And since the money for Catacosinos' severance pay did not come
out of the pockets of Lilco ratepayers, Spitzer said he decided to
conclude his investigation without taking any further action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just a golden parachute given to Catacosinos, but
a parachute encrusted with rubies and diamonds and pearls,'' said
Spitzer on releasing the results of the investigation, which was
initiated by his predecessor, Dennis C. Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I would love to go after Catacosinos, it wouldn't
do us any good because, unfortunately, he was not only greedy, but
smart,'' Spitzer said. The results of the investigation were first
reported in Wednesday's Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the investigation determined that Catacosinos, the
former chief executive officer of Lilco, was protected by corporate
indemnification agreements and releases that kept him free from any
cost, liability or legal expense relating to his conduct as an
officer or director of Lilco when Lilco was partly taken over in
May 1998 by the Long Island Power Authority, a specially formed
state public benefit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The state issued $2.5 billion in municipal bonds to complete the
transaction. Lilco's electrical generating and gas distribution
systems were merged with Brooklyn Union Gas in a company now called
Keyspan.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Lilco was disbanded, it was revealed that the company
had awarded its top executives severance packages totaling more
than $67 million, including $42 million to Catacosinos. The
payments were made even though Catacosinos and his fellow officers
were assured of similar positions with the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 lawsuits were filed by former Lilco and Brooklyn
Union Gas shareholders protesting the severance payments. The
results of the attorney general's investigation were released
Wednesday at a hearing in state supreme court here, in support of a
proposed settlement that would pay shareholders $7.9 million to
resolve the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Franck Schellace, law secretary to Justice Ute Wolff Lally, said
the agreement had been worked out during the last several months,
including an agreement by Keyspan to pay $1.5 million to the state
attorney general's office. Spitzer said the money would be used to
cover the costs of the investigation by his office as well as
future programs for investor protection and education.
</P>
<P>
   Keyspan reimbursed the attorney general's office because, under
the merger agreement, it assumed all responsibility for legal fees
related to Catacosinos' employment.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Oestreich, the lead attorney for the class-action
plaintiffs, said the attorney general's report, in effect, ``put
the state's blessing on the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary approval of the settlement was granted by Justice
Lally. She ordered that all former shareholders be notified of the
settlement, and set June 30 as the date for a hearing on final
approval. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Spitzer said the investigation concluded that Lilco's officers
and directors had failed to make full or timely disclosures to its
shareholders about the severance packages. He said the disclosures
were incomplete and obscure, and conflicted, in part, with the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Lilco's officers not only withheld information from
its board, but also that the board then failed to ask appropriate
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Catacosinos ``intentionally concealed facts about
the packages'' from Lilco's board and Lilco's partners during the
state takeover transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Catacosinos and his cronies in Lilco had Long
Island residents paying the highest electric rates in the
country,'' Spitzer said. ``Then to add insult to injury, they had
the gall to rip off their shareholders for tens of millions of
dollars for all of their supposed `hard work.' About the only good
news to come from this sorry, sordid affair is that Lilco's
customers did not pay for this outrageous giveaway.''

KENTUCKY DERBY UNDER CLOUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A minor scandal erupted Wednesday when the
local newspaper revealed that one of the entrants in this week's
race is diesel-powered.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the race is only the Kentucky Derby Festival's
Great Steamboat Race up the Mississippi River. And the entrant in
question is the Spirit of Jefferson, whose paddle wheel turns out
to be merely ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Kentucky Derby itself is mixed up in scandal,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Normally you come to Churchill Downs in the spring to forget
about the seamy side of horse racing. To forget that a shot at big
money and instant glory can make people do stupid things with
syringes and miniature cattle prods. To forget there are cheap
little tracks where a horseman stands to rake in more money by
losing at an opportune time than by winning. To forget the image of
racing, burned into TV viewers' subconscious by a dozen detective
shows in the '70s and '80s, as a world full of drawling con men in
beat-up cowboy hats. To forget that the sport is founded on animal
exploitation _ however benignly intentioned _ and on gambling.
</P>
<P>
   To forget about shady affairs like the Arkansas Derby, won three
weeks ago by the upstart Valhol, whose jockey Billy Patin stands
accused of carrying an illegal electrical stimulating device in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby is supposed to be above all that, to show
thoroughbred racing in its most delicate light.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this week it's impossible to ignore the
not-at-all-grainy videotape that seems to show Patin dropping a
small object from his left hand in the precise area beyond the
Oaklawn Park finish line where a track employee later found a
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to read about Valhol's owner having to go to
court to pry the $300,000 winner's purse away from the Arkansas
racing commission (which wanted to hold it pending an
investigation) and thus qualify for the Kentucky Derby field.
</P>
<P>
   And it's impossible not to wonder if something like this could
happen in Saturday's Kentucky Derby itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing isn't the greatest if you're Churchill Downs and
you're trying to promote the Derby,'' said Keith Chamblin, the
Hollywood Park marketing vice president who is moving into a
similar job with the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol's trainer, Dallas Keen, who will surely face official
questions about his own innocence in the matter, is reflective
enough to know ``it doesn't look good for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   But how bad does it have to look?
</P>
<P>
   The counterintuitive theory is that the Valhol incident and its
fallout could be a boon to racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody thinks it (that racetrack cheating is common),
then it's probably best if it comes out to a head and is dealt with
strictly,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux, who rode 1998 Kentucky
Derby winner Real Quiet and was aboard Arkansas Derby runner-up
Certain.
</P>
<P>
   That is: If the guilty are punished appropriately, the sport
will show the skeptics that it demands integrity and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can take a real negative incident into a positive
for horse racing ... if it's handled correctly,'' Chamblin said.
``People who know a little about our sport know how highly
regulated it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby itself will be run under the watchful eyes of
more than a dozen ABC-TV and racetrack patrol cameras, not to
mention state officials with binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a horse in this race could have a fly land on
him without somebody noticing,'' said NTRA spokesman Chip Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble in the Arkansas situation is that it has not been
handled correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Oaklawn Park management went public with its request for a state
investigation before informing even Valhol's owner of the
suspicion. The track appeared spiteful, as if it was out to get the
people who had the audacity to win its biggest race with a maiden
gelding. The state commission ordered the purse withheld. In doing
so, it violated due process and its own regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they handled it lousy. That's a flat way of saying
it,'' said Carl Nafzger, trainer of Derby contender Vicar.
</P>
<P>
   And by allowing the first hearings to be delayed until four days
after the Kentucky Derby, the Arkansas commission leaves bettors to
wonder just what to make of Valhol's 30-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's a true race,'' Desormeaux said provocatively, ``this
horse will gallop (to victory) in the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing's spin controllers wish their sport weren't held to
different standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the captain of the Atlanta Falcons gets picked up for
soliciting a prostitute the night before the Super Bowl, nobody
says, `The Super Bowl is ruined,' '' Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   But they might say it if one of the teams was suspected of
cheating to win its conference-championship game. And if football
explicitly invited fans to bet on the game and expect an honest
result.
</P>
<P>
   When the Great Steamboat Race is touched by scandal, you laugh
and go on. When it's the Kentucky Derby, you can't.

THAT SILENCE IN ALBANY? BUDGET TALKS. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even for Albany, this is bad.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget will be a month overdue Friday, a milestone
that would have made lawmakers blush a decade ago, but has become
ho-hum. What amazes and concerns many legislators, lobbyists and
advocates this year is not so much the lateness, as the absence of
serious budget negotiations among legislative leaders and Gov.
George Pataki. The talk of the Capitol is that there is no talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen an April like this, where, four weeks into the
fiscal year, there's a complete vacuum,'' said Andrew Rein, senior
research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit
group that closely follows the process. ``It's phenomenal and
disturbing. There's one major thing they have to get done every
year, and nobody's even really talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The usual barriers stand in the way of progress, from serious
disagreement over how much to spend, particularly on education and
health care, to Pataki's ever-chillier relationship with the
Legislature. Nor is there evidence that the public much cares about
late budgets, making it easier for lawmakers to go past the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the more important brake on budget progress this
year is a series of fundamental changes the governor is pressing in
the way budgets are proposed, negotiated and completed, part of a
campaign to seize much greater power over the final product and
marginalize the Legislature. Those changes have left the
Legislature reeling, unsure how to proceed, and desperately
searching _ so far unsuccessfully _ for a way to reassert its
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has implications not just for the budget, the main
business of the Legislature, but for nearly every issue taken up
here. In Albany, most significant legislation is held hostage
through budget negotiations, as factions use the budget as leverage
on unrelated matters, and then disposed of in a flurry of
deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   But the later the budget goes, the harder it becomes to take
care of other business before the Legislature's annual session
draws to its scheduled close in June. Not coincidentally, the very
late budgets of recent years have been accompanied by a steep
decline in the number of bills enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here a lot of years, and I thought the last few
years were bad, but I've never seen such a lack of movement, on the
budget or anything else,'' said Lester Shulklapper, who has been a
lobbyist in Albany for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, experience has shown that when motivated, New York's
lawmakers can break the logjams and pass a budget in as little as
three weeks. No one here rules out something like that happening
soon, but no one expects it, either.
</P>
<P>
   His words drawn out by a protracted sigh, Assemblyman Herman
Farrell, the normally ebullient Manhattan Democrat who heads the
Ways and Means Committee, which drafts spending bills, said, ``I
think it could run very, very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Republican state
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno have been carping at each
other, and at Pataki, each trying to fix blame somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the governor, I talk to Shelly, and I think they
talk to each other,'' Bruno said. ``I don't know.'' But he conceded
that those conversations had been neither frequent nor productive.
His assessment of the situation? ``It's a cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there was any progress, he said, ``No, there
really isn't. Not a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, takes the unusual position that the
stalemate has nothing to do with him, but is entirely up to the
Legislature to resolve. Asked this week whether there was anything
he could do to get the process moving, he said, ``Not that I'm
aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver and Pataki have not met face to face since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   New York already has a record of budget tardiness unimaginable
in any other state. For 15 straight years, lawmakers have failed to
enact a budget by the April 1 deadline, going as late as 126 days
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Pataki has proposed a $72.7 billion budget, keeping
the spending increase within the rate of inflation by cutting
education and health care programs. The Democrats who control the
Assembly want to spend $2 billion to $4 billion more, depending on
whose figures one believes, and the Senate Republicans are between
the two, but closer to the governor's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, budgets were negotiated by the governor and the
two legislative leaders in closed-door meetings, a process derided
as secretive and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki repeatedly prodded the Legislature to do what Congress
does: have members of both houses meet in conference committees to
hammer out their differences, then pass a budget and send it to
him. Last year, the Assembly and Senate finally took him up on the
idea, and it was, at first, viewed as a great success. Rather than
only two legislators being directly involved in the negotiations,
dozens had a hand in it.
</P>
<P>
   But the new approach turned out to be a coup for the governor.
Under the old system, he was obliged to negotiate, and then to
abide by the resulting compromises. In the new system, he was freed
of both duties.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature sent him its budget last year, he vetoed
1,300 spending line items, well more than $1 billion. It was a
stinging defeat for the Legislature, particularly the Democrats who
control the Assembly, whose pet projects were the bulk of the veto
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative leaders say they do not want to return to the
old ``three men in a room'' practice, and if they tried, they would
risk not only harsh criticism but possible rebellion among their
colleagues. They also want to avoid a repeat of last year's fiasco,
but don't know how.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki gave them a couple of new things to worry about this
year.
</P>
<P>
   First, he insisted that in exchange for approving a pay raise
for the state's elected officials, that legislators' salaries be
withheld as long as the budget is late. Many legislators, including
some who voted for the law, complain that it gives the governor
great power to outwait them, and could cause the Legislature to
cave in after a time.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Pataki dramatically changed the way his budget bills
were drafted, making it much harder for the Legislature to make the
kinds of alterations that were once considered standard. Some
legislators say the changes are illegal, though no court challenge
has been mounted. Legislative leaders are still debating how to
counter the governor's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor wants to establish the imperial governorship,''
Farrell said. ``He's created a series of really deep, institutional
problems for us, and he's convinced we'll collapse under the
pressure. He's decided this is the year to break us.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bruno and Silver are mired in a spat over whose fault
it is that they have not yet begun conference committee meetings,
and there is ample evidence that neither is in a hurry to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone making plans for the summer is going to have to
reconsider,'' Shulklapper said.

ONE DEAD, ONE WOUNDED IN CANADIAN SCHOOL SHOOTING; BOY, 14, IS
HELD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy shot two students, killing one, at a Canadian
high school Wednesday, the police said. It was the most serious of
a rash of incidents since the Littleton, Colo., massacre last week
in which young people have been charged with stockpiling weapons or
preparing to use them at their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn Wednesday, five boys were charged with conspiracy in
connection with compiling a list of victims to be killed during an
attack timed for the school's June 26 commencement.
</P>
<P>
   In Taber, Alberta, a town of about 8,000 about an hour's drive
north of Montana, the police took a 14-year-old boy into custody
after he shot two 11th-graders during lunchtime at the W.R. Myers
High School, The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The
CBC reported that some students said the gunman was a former
student who wore a blue trench coat Wednesday and carried a
.22-caliber rifle. The suspect's name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects in the Littleton shooting were reportedly
members of a group called the ``trench coat mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, five male students, all 13, were arrested at
McKinley Junior High School after school when a student overheard
them discussing a bomb assault on the school, a New York police
spokesman said. A search of their bodies turned up instructions on
how to make bombs, as well as a list of people to be killed. The
teen-agers were charged with conspiracy. Their names were not
released because they are minors. A search of the school found no
bombs.
 &UR;  &LR;  In Oak Lawn, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, a 15-year-old boy was
arrested and charged Wednesday with assault and disorderly conduct
after an ax, knives, a rifle, shotguns, and 150 rounds of
ammunition were reportedly found in his home. A fellow student at
South Side Baptist Church School reported overhearing the suspect,
who had been suspended, making a threat to blow up the school.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central Valley of California, several schools received
threats. In Coalinga, a student was arrested for reportedly
threatening to burn down the middle school and another student for
allegedly threatening to blow up the high school. They were booked
on charges of making terrorist threats. And in Clovis, Calif., a
boy was arrested Wednesday for threatening a teacher at Alta Sierra
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrests and threats follow a wave of similar
incidents in recent days that have struck around the country after
the Littleton shootings. For example, in Chicago a 15-year-old boy
was caught with a .22-caliber gun taped to his ankle, prompting
public demands to install metal detectors in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania officials reported at least 52 bomb scares and
other threats at schools in 22 counties. Near Philadelphia, a
16-year-old was reportedly turned in by his mother after he
threatened her with a reference to the Littleton tragedy. Law
enforcement officials later discovered a homemade videotape showing
the teen-ager building what appeared to be a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, about 12,600 high school students were evacuated
and missed at least part of the day's classes on Monday after an
unidentified caller said a bomb had been placed in one of the
city's 13 public high schools. There was a second wave of threats
on Tuesday but officials let each school decide whether to suspend
classes.
</P>
<P>
   In Longwood, in central Florida, a 13-year-old Rock Lake Middle
School student was arrested on Tuesday after officials said he
threatened to place a bomb at the school and kill eighth-graders
who had picked on him.

 &HT;    Tuberville touts tough stance at Auburn helm
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ Auburn's football players knew things were going
to be different in January when it came time for voluntary
offseason workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The first big change? The workouts weren't voluntary anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're motivated to do a lot of things when you're the age of
our players,'' new coach Tommy Tuberville said. ``Working out in
January ain't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of sleeping in before the first class on those cold,
frosty mornings, the Tigers were enjoying sunrise services with
Kevin Yoxall, the new strength and conditioning coach. This guy,
the players said, could wilt a Marine drill instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times a week at 6 o'clock in the morning,'' quarterback
Gabe Gross said. ``He would run us until we couldn't run any more.
And then we would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I've never been through anything like it,'' offensive
guard Kendall Simmons said. ``There were guys on this team I
thought could run forever, and they are sucking wind. It was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville, the former head coach at Mississippi, took over the
Auburn program Nov. 29. By the end of spring practice April 24 he
had put his stamp on it by significantly increasing the level of
physical conditioning and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Go to class. You miss class and you earn an extra session with
Yoxall's Dawn Patrol. Be on time. Don't think you can be on time?
Try running the steps of Jordan-Hare Stadium in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Tuberville made it clear from day 1 who was in charge
and how it was going to be,'' Gross said. ``I saw guys look around
and say, `Man, this guy is serious!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to let them know exactly what our philosophy
was and get them all in the same boat,'' Tuberville said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of former coach Terry Bowden, Auburn was a
divided football team. The defense, which was pretty good, stayed
mad at the offense, which wasn't. The coaches of the respective
units weren't real chummy, either, and the animosity spread to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there was a lot of bickering going on,'' Simmons said.
``The defense was playing their game, and the offense was doing the
same. It was really frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough year to be an Auburn Tiger with the departure
of Bowden during the middle of last season, then Auburn's decision
to buy its way out of the opening game with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   But Camp Tuberville has served the dual purpose of unifying the
players and getting them in excellent shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what this football team needed,'' offensive
tackle Jeno James said. ``These guys have been through so much
negative stuff, and a lot of it didn't have anything to do with us.
We needed something to bring us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are better in the Auburn football family, but they are
far from perfect. Two players, running back Demontray Carter and
wide receiver Reggie Worthy, have been charged with misdemeanor
harassment of a female student. That followed a charge of
second-degree rape against wide receiver Clifton Robinson and the
arrest last spring of former wide receiver Robert Baker, who was
charged with cocaine trafficking. No decision has been made on
Carter, Worthy or Robinson. Baker has returned to school but is not
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn will need all the unity it can get if the Tigers hope to
compete in the SEC West. The defense will be pretty good, with
eight returning starters led by end Leonardo Carson and tackle
Jimmy Brumbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The offense still has serious problems. The unit struggled this
spring with Tuberville's new system. It has no real playmakers, and
only one guy who caught a pass last season, running back Markeith
Cooper, returns.
</P>
<P>
   To win, Auburn will have to rely on its defense and kicker Rob
Bironas, who will be busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go before we're a good football team.
There's no doubt about that,'' Tuberville said. ``But when you try
to do what we've done, you've got to crawl before you can walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we wanted to do this spring was get our guys to
buy into what we're doing and believe in it. I think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step? Work 'em like crazy this summer and hit the
ground running Aug. 16, when the Tigers have their first practice
for the Sept. 4 opener with Appalachian State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people don't think we'll be that good, but we're
going to fool them,'' Gross said. ``This team is hungry again, and
it wants to win. We've worked too hard for it not to pay off.''

SKINNER NOT GETTING MUCH SHUT-EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Los Angeles Clippers made Brian Skinner
the 22nd selection in the 1998 NBA Draft, a few talent sharpies
believed the 6-foot-9, 255-pound Baylor forward could be a
``sleeper'' pick.
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Well, not lately.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Skinner's wife, Rebecca, gave birth to seven-pound,
eight-ounce Avery Anne Alexes Skinner. Dad celebrated by scoring
nine points and grabbing seven rebounds in 19 minutes during the
Clips' near-miss comeback against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But Skinner, who said he'd slept a combined 10 hours over the
previous three nights, still isn't getting much shut-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me? No, but they (mother and daughter) are asleep a lot,''
said Skinner, who didn't exactly need a wake-up call for his best
on-court performance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His show of strength against San Antonio was good news for the
Clippers. Skinner's emergence could provide insurance for power
forward Maurice Taylor and center Michael Olowokandi in the event
that current low-post handyman Lorenzen Wright - who'll be a free
agent when the season ends - leaves for greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to contribute like I did,'' Skinner said. ``I think
I've learned a lot this year. I've learned what to do and not to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's learned there's no substitute for practical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, you have to be on the court to really learn
how to play,'' he said. ``You have to play and figure out what to
do for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   As a first-round pick with two more years on his Clippers
contract, Skinner could figure prominently in their future.
</P>
<P>
   `Captain' comeback: Point guard Sherman Douglas, whose sprained
left ankle kept him in street clothes during the loss to San
Antonio, is listed as ``day to day'' for tonight's game at
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to play,'' Douglas said while making a quick,
sure-footed getaway from the Sports Arena after Wednesday's
workout.
</P>
<P>
   Filling in for Douglas, who turned the ankle in last Saturday's
victory over Vancouver, is Troy Hudson. Hudson played all 48
minutes in Monday's loss to the Spurs.

 &HT;    Lopez not throwing away blame
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After leading all National League starting catchers
last season at throwing out potential base stealers, Javy Lopez
found himself in a strange routine Wednesday. He was on the field
long before the rest of the Braves, working on his throws down to
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we lost the game (Tuesday night), bad throws by
me,'' he said. ``Believe me, that was the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing out a career-high 33.8 percent of attempted
steals in 1998, Lopez has stopped just four of 16 thefts thus far,
a drop-off the coaching staff attributes to an old habit. Lopez has
habitually flipped the ball from his mitt to his right hand before
throwing, but when the transfer reaches six inches or more, the
margin for error is negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always flipped it but there are degrees to flipping,''
said third-base coach Ned Yost, who worked with both Lopez and
Eddie Perez for 15 minutes. ``Sometimes he'll want to flip it from
here (holding his hands six inches apart). Whenever you do that,
everything's got to go perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez allowed Mike Benjamin to steal second in the eighth inning
Tuesday, just one of the elements to Pittsburgh's three-run burst
that decided the game. Always possessing above-average arm
strength, Lopez made his defensive strides last season with
improved technique. Wednesday was a refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' he said, ``they're stealing my underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Home is where the bat is
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive about Brian Jordan's fast start with the
Braves is that April has traditionally been a poor month for him.
Over the last five years, he has hit .289 in the first month, his
lowest of the season, with a total of eight homers in 298 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Wednesday's play with six homers in his first 75
Atlanta at-bats while ranking in the top 10 in 11 NL offensive
categories. He was second in the league in RBI (21), multi-hit
games (10), runs (19), total bases (53), slugging percentage (.707)
and extra-base hits (14) as a leading player of the month
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, for one, is not surprised, saying, ``He's a good RBI
guy. He's always able to get 'em in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has several explanations. His offseason training regimen
with Bob Kersee has him in the best condition of his career. He is
completely over his back and wrist problems. And don't
underestimate the importance of finally playing in the city where
he has kept his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away a lot of stress,'' Jordan said. ``When you're
away from your family, away from the kids, you're wondering about
what they're doing every day. Now that I'm home, it's fun. I can
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan vs. LHP
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko made his second start of the year against a
left-hander in Pittsburgh's Chris Peters, having gone 2-for-5
against lefties thus far. His .400 start interrupted by two weeks
with a sore hamstring, Klesko is still recovering his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people come back after missing a month and start
raking,'' he said. ``I've been hitting in the cage but it's
different. You're not seeing breaking balls and change of speed in
the cage. It'll all come. I just have to get more at-bats.

MAN'S LEGS ARE SEVERED AFTER BEING PUSHED IN FRONT OF SUBWAY TRAIN

   NEW YORK _ In front of scores of horrified commuters, a man had
his legs severed Wednesday when he was pushed in front of an
oncoming subway train in a crowded midtown Manhattan station at the
height of the evening rush hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the victim appeared to have been randomly shoved
in front of an uptown No. 6 train in the 51st Street station, one
of the busiest in the subway system, at 5:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A group of passengers seized and held down the accused attacker,
Julio Perez, 43, who the police said may be homeless and mentally
ill. Perez was being questioned at a nearby precinct station house
and had not been charged as of Wednesday night with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses on the platform said Perez had been acting
strangely moments before the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Edgar Rivera, 46, of the Bronx, was taken to
Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors were trying to reattach his
legs Wednesday night. Rivera also suffered severe head wounds after
he was struck by the train, which witnesses said screeched to a
halt as he was sprawled on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Perez and Rivera did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this year that a subway rider has been
pushed from a platform by a stranger. In January, Kendra Webdale, a
32-year-old receptionist, was killed after she was shoved in front
of a train at the 23rd Street station in the Chelsea section of
Manhattan. The police arrested Andrew Goldstein, who had been
undergoing treatment for schizophrenia. He is awaiting trial on
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's incident occurred as thousands of commuters
were pouring into the subway station; service on the uptown No. 6
line was suspended for two hours as police investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said that the suspect's odd behavior was
especially disturbing because of the crowds of commuters on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people like that all the time in the subway, but
usually you can just move away,'' said Barbara Fisher, 48, an
insurance executive who was standing nearby. ``In this case, there
was nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said that when one man asked Perez to move away from
him, he became agitated. ``He punched the wall,'' said one witness,
a 40-year-old engineer from the Bronx who identified himself only
as Josh. ``Then he swung around and five seconds later he just
pushed this guy. I saw him lose his balance. He yelled `Oh my God,'
and then he fell.''
</P>
<P>
   With only seconds before the train's arrival, witnesses said
that Rivera crawled to the platform's edge and kneeled down with
his face to the wall and his legs draped over the tracks. Two cars
passed over Rivera, who was pulled from between the second and
third cars.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said that Rivera's right leg was severed at
mid-thigh and the left below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who saw the first two cars of the train pass over
Rivera thought he could not possibly have survived, said Fire Capt.
Fred Ill, who was one of the first rescuers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were reporting to us that he was dead,'' Ill said.
``But when I looked down between the two cars and shined the
flashlight down at him, his eyes opened up and he looked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ill said it took three men to pull Rivera from between the cars
and up onto the platform. His legs, Ill said, ``were both just
laying there. It was tangled and mangled. It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ill said Rivera remained conscious but was unable to
speak during the rescue. ``I spoke to him but all he could do was
moan,'' Ill said. ``His eyes were aware, but I think he was really
going into shock.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Subway pushings are relatively rare, but the random nature of
the attacks represent the worst fears of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the attack on Ms. Webdale, the most recent victim was a
50-year-old woman who was pushed to the tracks and injured in 1997
by a man who was apparently angry because he thought she had made
him miss his train.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a 20-year-old aspiring model from Brooklyn died after
being pushed in front of a train by a youth who was trying to mug
her. The year before, a 63-year-old woman was killed at Herald
Square when she was pushed in front of a train by a man who had
recently escaped from a state psychiatric center.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, as they were turned away from the entrance to
the station, commuters said they were shocked by another random
pushing so soon after the one that killed Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes you think twice about going into the subway,''
said Gaby Baxter, 35, a paralegal from Westchester County. ``As it
is, I am always afraid on the platform and I stand as close to the
wall as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complained that the Lexington Avenue line on which the
No. 6 train runs had become increasingly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so chaotic that it makes nice people very nasty,'' said
Kevin Morrison, 30, a legal assistant who lives in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn. ``It's gotten to the point that I'd rather
walk out of my way than take the Lex.''

CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO SPEED TEACHER CREDENTIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Teachers with emergency credentials will be able
to get fully certified in 18 months without ever stepping into a
classroom under a $5 million initiative announced Wednesday by Gov.
Gray Davis and California State University Chancellor Charles B.
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   California State University, Northridge, was one of five CSU
campuses that conducted the program last year on a pilot basis.
Under the direction of CSU faculty serving as mentors, participants
will earn credit through a distance-learning program based on
online courses and assignments via workbooks, audio and video
materials, and CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The program, christened CalStateTEACH, will begin Sept. 1 with
its first round of participants and is expected to draw 500
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an exciting program,'' Reed said Wednesday after
the announcement. ``They need access to the Internet, a video
recorder. That's it. They can do it early in the morning or late in
the evening, on their own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only way a prospective teacher could get fully
certified in a relatively short amount of time -- 12 months -- is
by enrolling full-time for a year at a university. On average,
teachers working on emergency permits take four to five years to
get their credentials, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The program is based on the British Open University and is
intended to meet an exploding need for teachers. The designers
included an assessment component to ensure that teachers from the
new program are as prepared as those trained in the classroom, said
Delia Rudiger, assistant to the CSUN provost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reasonable question to ask,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said a teacher certified through the CalStateTEACH program
will be better prepared than their full-time counterparts due to
the increased mentoring and hands-on experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even better,'' Reed said. ``They will be out in the
classroom and they will have the mentors working with them. One of
our faculty members will be assigned to every 20 participants.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 public elementary teachers in the state --
including 4,570 teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District
-- are now working on emergency status.
</P>
<P>
   Education experts estimate California will need a total of
300,000 credentialed teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade
over the next decade due to teacher retirement, the push for
class-size reduction in all grades and increased student growth.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher students in groups of 18 to 20 will be assigned a
mentor, who will serve as an adviser, coach and evaluator. To be
eligible for the program, applicants must be teaching at the
kindergarten to sixth-grade level and should already have passed
the California Basic Education Skills Test. The cost of tuition for
the 38-credit program would be about $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million will cover the cost to start up the program,
including expenses such as materials and salaries of mentors.
Afterward, the program is expected to be self-supported through
student fees.
</P>
<P>
   The second group will be admitted in September 2000, but
subsequent groups will be admitted every six months.

OIL OFFICIALS DEFEND GAS PRICES TO CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY AND RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- As some consumers prepare to boycott
gasoline stations Friday to protest high prices, oil company
executives told a state legislative hearing Wednesday prices are
unlikely to fall soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although short-term supply shortages did occur and drove up
prices, those problems have been resolved, the industry
representatives told lawmakers. But they offered no forecast of
when frustrated consumers might see lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``As competition continues in the street, (prices) will come
down further,'' said Chris Noble, senior vice president of retail
marketing for Atlantic Richfield Co. in an interview following the
hearing. ``We would advise consumers to shop around for where the
cheapest prices are.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senate committees jointly held the hearing to investigate
why gas prices spiked to historic levels this month. In Southern
California, the price rose more than 42 cents a gallon for
self-serve unleaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Los Angeles, the City Council voted 10-0 Wednesday
to go on record in support of the grass-roots ``gas out'' planned
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only way we, as consumers, can show our anger,''
Councilman Joel Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   The one-day boycott has been promoted on the Internet by angry
consumers who also are trading information on gas stations with the
lowest prices. Councilwoman Laura Chick said the protest would send
a signal to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a more powerful and effective way to get a
message to the oil companies,'' Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, senators said the testimony from oil executives
-- who cited refinery fires and other production difficulties --
didn't fully explain why prices have been high for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers pointed to data compiled by the California Energy
Commission that showed there had been enough gasoline to meet
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you raised prices because you could,'' said state
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who chaired the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company officials confirmed Energy Commission figures that
showed profits for refineries escalated dramatically during the
price hikes. Refineries received 70 cents for each gallon of gas in
April compared to 28 cents in February.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis DeCota, the executive director of the California Service
Station and Automotive Repair Association, disagreed that refinery
troubles and other manufacturing problems were to blame. Instead,
he said it was the lack of competition in the industry during an
era of bigger companies and mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies with refineries are able to force their service
stations to buy fuel only from them, instead of seeking out the
lowest priced gas, DeCota said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil companies control gas prices in this state with an
iron fist,'' DeCota said.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated lawmakers warned oil company officials that they
will need to loosen their grip or the state will make it illegal
for them to own gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   Already, legislation has been introduced by state Sen. Steve
Peace, D-La Mesa, that would allow gas station owners to buy their
fuel from other suppliers.

MARINE PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO REFUSING ANTHRAX SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A U.S. Marine from the suburban Los Angeles
community of Sherman Oaks pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges
he refused the anthrax vaccine, one of the first court-martial
cases to be prosecuted in a small but growing armed services
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Roman J. Lezo is one of 14 Marines stationed in Kaneohe,
Hawaii, refusing to take the series of six shots, base officials
said. Thirteen others have been given administrative punishment,
but Lezo faces three serious charges that jeopardize his military
future.
</P>
<P>
   Lezo said he believes he is being unfairly prosecuted because he
has spoken publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't join the Marines to get kicked out. I've been told
they're trying to make an example out of me,'' Lezo said. ``I
dedicated some of the best years of my life to my country and I
feel betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Base spokesman Maj. Jeff Nyhart said Lezo has been
administratively sanctioned for his refusal. But the Marines chose
to pursue the case in court because of an additional charge of
disobeying an order, not related to the anthrax charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with him going public,'' Nyhart said.
``It is his right, and I hope he brings that point forth during
this hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Lezo faces six months in jail, loss of two-thirds
of his pay and a dishonorable discharge with a felony on his
record, Nyhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lezo is charged with disobeying a lawful order from a commanding
officer and dereliction of duty. He also faces a charge of failure
to obey an order from a noncommanding officer, which is not related
to the anthrax case. He said someone ordered him to take off his
backpack without identifying himself as an officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine's first court date is scheduled for June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Lezo's hearing comes as debate over the vaccine's effects mount,
with more than 200 troops choosing punishment or resignation rather
than take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Once a lance corporal with a secret security clearance, Lezo has
already been demoted, given extra duties, been confined to his
barracks and lost half of his pay prior to Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a Marine at the Twentynine Palms Air Ground
Combat Center was court-martialed, sentenced to 30 days in the brig
and given a bad-conduct discharge. Nineteen other Marines there
face court-martials and five others have received administrative
punishment, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a bacterium used as a biological warfare agent --
considered the deadliest ever developed -- with a 90 percent
fatality rate if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine in
the 1970s, no long-term effects have been reported, said Virginia
Stephanakis, spokeswoman for the Army Surgeon General's Office at
the Pentagon. As of Wednesday, only 50 of the 273,000 vaccinated
troops have suffered short-term side effects.

 &HT;    Braves rally, give Glavine first win
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The search for The Real Tom Glavine continues. And he
was believed to be nearby, judging by his pitching line. In the
meantime, the Braves committed an outright robbery Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the ninth down two runs, Atlanta rallied as Andruw
Jones sent a soft two-out single up the middle off reliever Mike
Williams, scoring Keith Lockhart with the game-winner in a 5-4
victory. Another small crowd of 29,615 was on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones delivered a critical two-run double off Jason
Christiansen, scoring Gerald Williams and Bret Boone to tie it 4-4.
After winning just two games last season when trailing after eight
innings, the Braves have done it three times in their first 20
games.
</P>
<P>
   The heroics made a winner of Glavine (1-3), who finished the
night by pitching seven shutout innings and avoided the first 0-4
start of his career. After being slapped around in the four-run
second, he delivered some of his best work of the season, limiting
the Pirates to two singles over the next six innings and retiring
10 straight during one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   With Chris Peters allowing one earned run over six innings, the
Braves labored to make up the deficit, stranding four men in
scoring position between the fourth and seventh innings alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko delivered his second RBI of the evening in the
fourth, when his sacrifice fly to center scored Brian Jordan to
close to the gap to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta closed to 4-1 in the second inning, Javy Lopez drawing a
walk and taking third when third baseman Ed Sprague failed to
handle a high chopper by Andruw Jones and committed his seventh
error of the season. Klesko brought in Lopez with a ground-out to
second.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine was in trouble almost right away. He escaped the first
inning after yielding a pair of singles but was then raked for four
hits and a quick 4-0 disadvantage in the second.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Wednesday that NATO's
bombardment and economic pressure on Yugoslavia would persist for
many more months and called on Congress to quickly pass his request
for $6 billion in emergency funds to pay the mounting costs of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day, our military campaign takes a toll on Serbia's
machinery of repression,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden statement
after a meeting on the Balkan conflict with 46 members of Congress.
``The Serbian leadership has failed to divide us and will not
outlast us. The combined military might and moral determination of
Europe and North America will endure.''
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, the House dealt the White House a sharp rebuke,
voting not only to ban use of ground troops without congressional
approval but rejecting a symbolic resolution supporting the air
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that additional air power was arriving in the
region and allied pilots were beginning to fly around the clock on
missions to destroy Serb troops who are terrorizing the ethnic
Albanian population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia. The Serbs
have already driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovo's people out of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the air campaign, now at the end of its fifth
week, had been hampered by rain and clouds and said the pace would
now pick up as the skies clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the weather is better in May than in April,
better in June than in May, better in July than in June,'' Clinton
said in a clear sign that he intends to continue the air war for
months. ``And I feel very strongly that we should stay with and be
very strong in determination to pursue our strategy, as well as the
very important decisions we made at the NATO conference to
intensify the economic pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that signs of dissension were beginning to
appear in Belgrade, including public criticism by senior officials
of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, said that Clinton pleaded for
forbearance from lawmakers during their meeting, saying they had to
give air power time to work to undermine Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the administration's ``gradualism and
incrementalism'' were frustrating many in Congress, who want
quicker consideration of the use of ground troops to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said absolutely we have to be patient,'' Ms. Snowe said.
``But he gave no indication how long it would last.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snowe and other members of Congress who attended Wednesday's
session with the president said he repeated his determination not
to dispatch ground troops to fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``He
indicated that he intended a stepped-up prosecution of the air war
and the blockade of oil supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members said that Clinton's aims _ the removal of Serb
forces from Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees _ could not be achieved with air power
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said that the administration had
been sending confusing signals about the the goals of the war, its
costs and the administration's plans for relocating refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The messages coming out of the White House have a great deal
of ambiguity,'' Callahan said. ``But it's very obvious to me that
this is going to be a prolonged and costly endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the lawmakers to move quickly on his funding
request, which would provide money to replace munitions already
used and to build weapon stockpiles for a lengthy air campaign. The
administration's $6 billion package also includes about $1 billion
for food and shelter for refugees displaced by the fighting in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that Congress should resist the temptation to
attach to the legislation money for unrelated activities, no matter
how worthy, because it would slow the bill's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk
now,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Draft proposals in the Senate and the House would add $6 billion
to $7 billion in Pentagon programs, bringing the emergency spending
bill requested by Clinton to roughly $12 billion to $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional add-ons include projects arguably unconnected
to NATO's operations in the Balkans. For example, the House bill
would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction
programs sought by the military to increase soldiers' morale and
efficiency, such as refurbishing 50-year-old barracks, building car
washes and garages, and paving parking lots at bases in Germany.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Republicans are eager to approve them as a show of support
for the military, and to bolster their argument that Clinton has
starved the Pentagon. But the emergency money must come from
surplus Social Security revenues, which both parties have pledged
to keep their hands off.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Republican senators, loath to break their vows of
fiscal abstinence, are ready to break with their colleagues instead
of supporting a $12 billion emergency bill, according to senior
aides. They want the spending limited to what the president has
requested. Others want to see even more money added to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Given the intensity of the internal debate, it will be at least
two weeks before any money is approved.
</P>
<P>
   In his White House remarks, Clinton said that the terror in
Kosovo was the product of a ``meticulously planned'' campaign by
Milosevic's Serb troops to drive the ethnic Albanian majority out
of the province. ``A campaign organized by the government of
Belgrade for a specific political purpose _ to maintain its grip
over Kosovo by ridding the land of its people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the expulsions began, ethnic Albanians made up about 90
percent of Kosovo's population of two million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited continuing reports of atrocities, including one
unconfirmed report brought to him by Brian Atwood, the
administration's humanitarian coordinator for the region. Atwood,
who just returned from Albania, said he had been told of one
village in Kosovo where most of the men were rounded up, tied
together and burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of story that would be too horrible to believe
if it were not so consistent with what so many refugees have been
saying,'' the president said.

HOUSE DENIES SUPPORT FOR AIRSTRIKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for President Clinton, the
Republican-controlled House denied support for the ongoing NATO air
campaign against Yugoslavia and approved a measure requiring
congressional authorization before committing U.S. ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-sponsored resolution of support for the NATO air
operation, which was approved by the Senate weeks ago, was defeated
on a vote of 213-213 and took both Democratic and Republican
leaders by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the House passed 249-180 a measure that would
withhold funding for a commitment of ground troops unless
specifically approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was only symbolic, the vote not to support the air
campaign angered a number of Democrats who contended that it was
incumbent on Congress to back the military operation as long as
U.S. forces are in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said the votes represented an
``appalling lack of judgment and an appalling abandonment of the
troops in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a day which this House will profoundly regret,'' Obey
said, calling it ironic that Congress also defeated a measure
offered Wednesday calling for withdrawal of U.S. forces from the
NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   He asked how the House on one hand could reject a resolution of
support for the NATO campaign while being on the verge of approving
an expanded emergency funding bill to help pay for the U.S. portion
of the allied operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I seen such confusion,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans, recalling the mistakes of Vietnam, called
the votes an honorable attempt by some lawmakers to prevent what
they believe could be a prolonged and costly U.S. commitment in the
Balkans and to ensure that Congress is involved in any decision to
expand the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been messy,'' observed Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
``but I am very proud that this House went on the record ... .''
</P>
<P>
   The votes, aimed at limiting Clinton's ability to widen the
offensive against Yugoslav forces, came despite his appeal that
lawmakers avoid a divisive debate on Kosovo that might be construed
by the Belgrade government as a lack of U.S. resolve to continue
the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to head off the debate, Clinton told lawmakers in
a meeting at the White House that he still believes ground troops
won't be needed. But if they are, he pledged in a letter to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., to seek the consent of Congress
before any ground invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the House turned aside his appeal in an attempt to
force him to comply with the terms of the 1973 War Powers Act that
requires the president and Congress to agree when committing U.S.
forces to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``War is too important to be commenced by one person,'' said
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., noting that presidents tend ``to act
... before bothering to consult'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill prohibiting the commitment of ground troops
passed by a large margin, it must still win approval from the
Senate and be signed by the president before becoming law. The
Senate is expected to debate the possible commitment of ground
troops in a foreign relations committee hearing today. But the
measure the committee will consider would authorize the president
to use ``all necessary force'' to bring the Kosovo conflict to a
quick end.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign resolution and the bill requiring congressional
approval for the use of ground troops were two of four measures
debated by the House on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated 427-2 a controversial measure declaring war
against Yugoslavia, offered by Campbell in an attempt to invoke the
War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   A second Campbell measure requiring withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from the NATO operation went down 290-139.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the chance to say no before we get in too deep. We
don't have to do this war,'' Campbell said, pleading with his
colleagues ``to have the courage'' to avoid another Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The debate Wednesday was rife with comparisons to the Vietnam
conflict, including expressions of concern about Americans
returning home from the Balkans in ``body bags'' or being caught
and held for years as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to speak in opposition to U.S. military involvement in
the Balkans, Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, referred to the nearly
seven years he spent as a POW in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer in Kosovo is not to waste American lives. The
answer is to stop the bombing and help the refugees. We don't need
another (Vietnam Memorial) wall,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Kosovo conflict as ``a Balkan quagmire,'' House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said that the NATO air campaign
had accomplished nothing so far. He blamed the refugee crisis and
the intensified Serb offensive in Kosovo against ethnic Albanians
on the allied bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it worth it to stay in Vietnam just to save face?'' DeLay
asked his colleagues at one point, urging them to support the
withdrawal of U.S. forces from the NATO operation.``This is a
centuries-old civil war that we will become embroiled in
indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, suggested that the United States and
its NATO allies do not have ``the will to win'' because they have
refused to make killing Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic a key
objective of their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've increased human suffering, not stopped it. We've
increased instability in the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, rising to express support for the NATO
campaign, cautioned their colleagues against any action that would
send ``the wrong message'' to Milosevic about U.S. resolve in
preventing him from displacing the ethnic Albanian population of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., noted that Americans, by twice
electing Clinton as their commander-in-chief, had also granted him
the authority ``to do what he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others pleaded with their colleagues not to turn their
backs on Kosovar Albanians who are being killed, raped and stripped
of their identity papers in their own homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard some refer to this as another Vietnam. But I see
Kosovo as another Cambodia or Rwanda ... Another killing field,''
said Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Before the debate, Clinton met with 46 Republican and Democrat
lawmakers in hope of convincing them to speak with ``a single
voice'' on the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The president also used his meeting to urge the quick approval
of a $6 billion emergency funding request he sent to Congress nine
days ago to finance the U.S. portion of the NATO operation.
Republicans in both the House and Senate are trying to double the
amount of the request by adding money for military programs that
the administration does not consider necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me stress that my request fully funds our military and
humanitarian needs in Kosovo,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate are expected to act on the funding
measure sometime next week. But some administration officials are
worried that it's being loaded up with ``pork barrel'' spending
designed to please defense lobbyists.

 McKesson Stock Falls by Half  /S.F. firm overstated new unit's
sales 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; (c) 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
McKesson HBOC Inc. lost nearly half its value on Wall Street
yesterday after the San Francisco drug distributor said it had
overstated the revenues of its new software division.
</P>
<P>
   Investors slammed McKesson's shares down $31.25 to $34.50, which
slashed more than $9 billion off its market value. McKesson was the
most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock plunge came after the company released the results of
a year-end audit that revealed that HBO &AMP; Co., McKesson's newly
acquired &UR;  &LR; software division, had prematurely booked $42.2 million
in sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, before customers
had taken final delivery of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Although $42.2 million is a relatively small slice of
McKessonHBOC's more than $23 billion in revenues, investors reacted
viciously because HBOC had been seen as the fastest-growing,
most-profitable part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the restatement in sales forced McKessonHBOC to reduce
the fiscal 1999 earnings it reported just last week from 84 cents
per share to 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of growing 21 percent during the fourth quarter, the
company said its software revenues actually declined 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said yesterday's revelation was particularly
embarrassing because it came just three months after McKesson
merged with HBOC in a $14 billion deal that was controversial from
its outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are such different companies, it was hard for many in
the investor community to understand the merger,'' said Christopher
McFadden, who follows McKesson for Wheat First Union Capital in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson is the nation's largest distributor of drugs to
hospitals, pharmacies and retail chains like Wal-Mart and Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's HBOC distributes software and services to help
hospitals keep track of patient records and collect bills.
</P>
<P>
   The McKesson side of the business contributed more than $20
billion in revenues, compared to just $1.8 billion for HBOC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disparity in revenues, HBOC contributed 50 to 55
percent of the merged company's profits, before yesterday's
restatement, said analyst Leonard Yaffe of NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even after yesterday's restatement, Yaffe still expects HBOC
will deliver at least half of the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole rationale for the merger between McKesson and HBOC
was to get the faster revenue growth and fatter margins of the
software business,'' said Robert Gold, an analyst with S&AMP;P Equity
Group in New York. ``Now the best case we're seeing is a 5 percent
revenue growth for HBOC, versus double-digit growth we'd been told
to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   McKessonHBOC spokesman Larry Kurtz explained that the audit, by
McKesson's accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, uncovered the
premature bookings.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found that in about a dozen instances, HBOC
salespeople had booked sales with customers who still had
contingencies on their orders. For example, Kurtz said, a sale
might be contingent on demonstrating that the software doesn't have
a Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said the restated revenues of $42.2 million include $26.2
million recorded in the fourth quarter, after McKesson merged with
HBOC, and $16 million recorded in the three quarters before the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   He said McKesson's auditors are still checking to see if any
other software deals were booked prematurely, holding open the
possibility of another earnings restatement.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz declined comment on just who might be to blame for the
accounting errors. Albert Bergonzi heads the software division that
booked the premature sales. Bergonzi had been president of HBOC
before the merger. He reports to Mark Pulido, who was chief
executive of McKesson before the merger, and who retains that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the merged company's top management team is Charles
McCall, now chairman of McKessonHBOC. McCall had been chief
executive of HBOC before the merger and Bergonzi's superior.
</P>
<P>
   Nine law firms already have signaled their intent to file
shareholder class-action lawsuits against McKessonHBOC.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, other software firms, including Bay Area
database vendors Informix and Sybase, have been forced to restate
earnings because of questionable sales bookings. Gold, the S&AMP;P
analyst, said yesterday's news came as a shock to people like
himself who know more about drug distribution than software sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's `Welcome to the software world,''' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Yaffe, the NationsBanc analyst, thinks investors overreacted
to yesterday's news. ``We feel the stock should be bought based on
where it traded yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gold, the S&AMP;P analyst, cautioned that McKessonHBOC is still
continuing the audit and could have more bad news to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Sgt. Jim Parr of the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Office was not sure he would still have a job on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight Tuesday, Parr drove to Sheriff John Stone's home
and dragged him over to Columbine High School here for an impromptu
news conference. Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news
outlets around the world read an Associated Press story quoting
Stone extensively about the massacre at Columbine last week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of
evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had
announced to the world hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has
made a mistake,'' Parr, a 20-year veteran of police work who has
been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the
massacre, said on Wednesday. ``I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not
going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so delicately, Parr and Steve Davis, a sheriff's deputy who
serves as the department spokesman, spent most of Wednesday
clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the
police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a
teacher and 12 classmates last Tuesday before turning their guns on
themselves. The department is also being questioned about its
handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that
is now under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements: Three
students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last
Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation, but
in fact have been cleared. The videotape showing the carnage in the
cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen
firing at the students. There is no evidence that Harris and his
friend Dylan Klebold, the other gunman, tried to escape and were
stopped by sheriff's deputies. Investigators are eager to make
arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff can't know every single detail in a case this
huge,'' Parr said gently, noting that there are 35 investigators
from a half-dozen police agencies chasing down hundreds of leads,
plus another 40 officers analyzing evidence inside the school.
``We're doing the best we can,'' he added. ``And we're going to
learn from this. Believe me, we're going to learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of untangling confused news reports came as the
authorities announced that Robyn Anderson, an 18-year-old Columbine
senior who went to the prom with Klebold, bought three of the four
guns used in the attack, not two as they said on Tuesday. Miss
Anderson, who is being treated as a witness, not a suspect, bought
the two shotguns and a rifle, the police said. The source of the
semiautomatic TEC-9 handgun used in the killing spree remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department source also confirmed on Wednesday that
Harris, 18, was rejected from the United States Marine Corps
because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Marines exclude
thousands of potential recruits each year for a variety of medical
reasons, including taking certain prescribed medications.
</P>
<P>
   Patients taking Luvox are warned that if combined with other
drugs, including alcohol, it can cause extreme agitation
progressing to delirium, coma, and death. The package insert also
carries a warning about suicide. ``The possibility of suicide
attempt is inherent in patients with depressive symptoms, whether
these occur in primary depression or in association with another
primary disorder such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,'' it reads.
``Close supervision of high risk patients should accompany initial
drug therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   The coroner's office said that no drugs or alcohol were found in
Harris' body during an autopsy, but would not specify whether they
had looked for Luvox. Some friends of Harris said they believed he
might have tried to go off the drug, perhaps after his rejection by
the Marines just five days before he and his best friend stormed
onto the Columbine campus with guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a bunch of cases where people have been on Lithium
and the like and have stopped and committed crimes,'' Mark Pautler,
the chief deputy district attorney for Jefferson County, said on
Wednesday, referring to another common antidepressant. ``We're
looking into everything that might be the cause and might be
preventable in the future, but at this time were not looking at
what would have caused them to commit the crime, as much as whether
anyone else would be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that
others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly
mission and have ``high hopes'' for future arrests. But so far, no
suspects have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crucial pieces of evidence in last Tuesday's shocking
spree are videotapes taken from security cameras in the cafeteria,
where the carnage began, that are being enhanced and reviewed by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ``Some of the things we hope
to see from that tape are the gunmen, activities that were taking
place, shooting, any explosive devices that may have been
distributed, exploded, the movement of people,'' Parr said. ``If we
had a third suspect on that videotape, that person would be in jail
today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the painstaking investigation continued here , the copycat
crimes did also. There were bomb threats Wednesday at several
schools around the country and in the Denver area. In Arvada, a
community near here, students were evacuated but no explosions were
reported or bombs found during an hour-long police search.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the sorrowful townwide funeral procession
continued Wednesday as 1,000 people at Trinity Christian Church
remembered Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old freshman who loved the
movie ``Star Wars'' and dreamed of becoming a Navy fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   And in Waterford, Wis., 450 people gathered at the United
Methodist Church to bury John Tomlin, 16, in a green-and-gold
coffin _ the colors of his beloved Green Bay Packers. His family
moved to Colorado from Wisconsin four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in a day of few news developments, much attention was
focused on the misstatements made by Stone, who spent 12 years as a
Jefferson County Commissioner before being elected in November to
head the agency of 325 sworn officers patrolling 750 square miles
with a population of 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a trying week for the relatively small agency _ it
has a similar number of officers as one of New York's largest
precincts _ as hundreds of journalists with almost as many
television cameras ask thousands of questions. In addition to
Wednesday's clarifications, and the revised death toll, the
department has also made several adjustments to the timetable of
when police officers arrived on the scene and how long the gunmen
were shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving a lot of interviews,'' said Parr, who was
the department's media spokesman for three years before Davis took
over in January 1988. ``Occasionally we'll have
misunderstandings.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not blame The A.P. or the news organizations,
including The New York Times, that reported the sheriff's comments.
''Apparently what the sheriff was hoping to communicate wasn't
understood in the light that the sheriff was trying to get
across,'' Parr said. ``It was just a misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is by far the most grisly and high-profile crime in the
department's history; the last media swarm was when the scion of
the Coors brewing company was killed in the county in the 1960's,
long before the days of 24-hour television news channels. There
were seven murders in the county all of 1998, and four each of the
previous years. Most of the experience Parr and Officer Davis have
had with disasters involved fires and floods.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro, Ark., and
Springfield, Ore., where there were deadly school shootings last
year, said they, too, were overwhelmed by the onslaught of
journalists as well as the horde of investigators from various
agencies they had to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prepare for nothing like this,'' said Terry Long,
chief deputy sheriff for McCracken County, Ky. ``All the best
preparation goes right out the windown when something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davidson of the Arkansas State Police said a school
shooting ``is one of the most chaotic situations that any emergency
personnel is ever going to enter into.'' Sheriff Jack McCann of
Craighead County, the other lead agency in the Jonesboro
investigation, said he often had to send officers out to the field
to shoo away reporters, and that it was sometimes difficult to get
accurate information from young witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson, McCann added, is ``to not say it can
never happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen here,'' he said. ``It can happen anywhere, and
it's going to happen.''

   TRADING BY HEDGE FUNDS MAY FACE TOUGHER SCRUTINY
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to introduce legislation soon

pools for the wealthy known as hedge funds, will give the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission enhanced powers to examine the dealings of Wall
Street trading firms.

MAX HUTCHINSON, 73, ART DEALER; BROKERED MAJOR POLLOCK SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Hutchinson, an art dealer and gallery owner who was
instrumental in the sale of Jackson Pollock's large, drip painting
``Blue Poles,'' to the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra,
died April 23 at Community General Hospital of Sullivan County in
Harris, N.Y. He was 73 and had lived in Kenoza Lake, N.Y., since
1986.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver failure, said his companion, Marion Kaselle.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his career in the late 1970s, Hutchinson had
two galleries in the Soho section of Manhattan, one in Houston and
another in Melbourne. In New York he often acted as an agent for
the National Gallery of Australia, whose director, James Mollison,
had once worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   In this capacity he repeatedly approached the collector Ben
Heller about Pollock's ``Blue Poles,'' which Heller had owned since
the mid-1950s. In 1974, Heller agreed to sell the painting for $2
million. At the time, it was an astounding price commanded only by
Old Master paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditure required a vote by the Australian Parliament,
and when it was approved, a storm of protest intensified by
articles and editorials in the Australian newspapers brought down
the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Hutchinson later
sued one of the newspaper owners, Rupert Murdoch, for libel, and
won. ``Blue Poles'' returned to the United States for the first
time last fall, for the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, who was born in Melbourne in 1925, earned a degree
in chemical engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute of
Technology and served as a pilot in the Australian air force in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A natural athlete, he was a prominent cricket player in high
school. After the war he competed as a wrestler and played
exhibition baseball in the 1948 Olympics in Melbourne, receiving a
contract offer from the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He established a successful exposition design company that
branched out into furniture design and gained a knowledge of
fabrication that proved valuable when he became involved with
large-scale sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, one of his company's designers, Clement Meadmore, who
was also a sculptor, suggested that the company showroom, which was
empty, might make a good gallery for Australian artists.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson was quickly hooked. In short order he named the
showroom Gallery A, became an art dealer, and opened a second
Gallery A in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   He would later say that he was the first Australian dealer not
to show paintings of koalas. He was also the first to show American
artists, including James Rosenquist, Alan Shields, Jake Berthot,
Harvey Quaytman and Natvar Bhavsar.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to New York in 1967, Hutchinson quickly recognized the
potential affinity between large-scale artworks and the cavernous
loft buildings in the neighborhood then known as the Cast Iron
District, soon to be dubbed Soho.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened a gallery at 127 Greene St. in 1968, the Paula
Cooper Gallery and Ivan Karp's OK Harris Gallery were his only
counterparts in Soho. The artists he exhibited included Meadmore,
Milton Resnick, Charles Ginnever, Carolee Schneemann, Michelle
Stuart and Helene Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 he mounted the first exhibition of drawings and
paintings by the sculptor Louise Bourgeois, some of which dated
from the late 1940s. In 1974 he opened an additional gallery,
Sculpture Now, at 142 Greene St., where he was able to exhibit
large-scale sculpture. The space was subsequently taken over by Leo
Castelli and is presently occupied by Pace Wildenstein. Hutchinson
had his gallery in Houston from 1977 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson maintained a final New York gallery at 138 Greene
Street until the mid-1980s. In 1984 he bought an 88-acre farm near
Kenoza Lake, where he established Sculpture Fields Inc. He reshaped
the land, built three miles of road, created two ponds for
water-related sculpture, and exhibited work by a long list of
sculptors including Ginnever, William Tucker, Mel Chin, Christy
Rupp and Jackie Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Kaselle, Hutchinson is survived by his
estranged wife, Cherell, of Melbourne; two daughters, Simone
Hutchinson Whitwell and Tanya Hutchinson Barry, of Melbourne; two
sons, Rowan Hutchinson of Brisbane and Daniel Crespi of Sydney, and
four grandchildren.

MORGAN THE JOURNEYMAN, WITH EMPHASIS ON JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Mike Morgan speaks as rapidly as he pitches,
firing one thought after another, rushing through conversation and
changing topics as quickly and seamlessly as he has changed teams.
</P>
<P>
   In one long, continuous answer to a question posed to him
Tuesday afternoon _ Why did he come back for his 22nd season in pro
ball? _ Morgan mentioned his two daughters, the business of
baseball and how he won't let it get to him, run support, his love
of team, friends, and in summation, his two daughters again.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is 39 years old and has seemingly been in the wrong place
at the wrong time for most of his career, but he's not slowing
down, not now, not when he has found a place where his skills are
best suited. He is 4-0 for the Texas Rangers and will try to become
the American League's first five-game winner Thursday against the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning about this game, still trying to make
adjustments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Manager Johnny Oates said: ``He's been a big plus for us.
He's kept us in every game he's pitched for us, be it starting or
relieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is pitching for his 11th team, a record not just in
baseball but in major league sports, and he has a place in baseball
history, for sure, although his legacy is difficult to define.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this season, Morgan had the lowest winning percentage
(.416) of any pitcher with at least 275 decisions in his career,
according to Jim Henzler of Stats Inc.; Morgan has since climbed to
a .424 percentage (125-170), ahead of Pedro Ramos (.422).
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair to write Morgan off merely as someone who
lost a lot of games and played for a lot of teams. The first decade
of his career could be used as an example of how to mishandle a
young, talented pitcher, and Morgan always has been good enough and
earned enough respect to merit opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was drafted out of high school in 1978 by Charlie Finley,
the owner of the Oakland Athletics, who had dismantled his
championship team rather than pay its free agents. With a bad team,
he sought methods of luring fans to the park. One way, he thought,
was to promote Morgan to the big leagues. Immediately. A week after
his high school graduation, Morgan made his debut, with absolutely
no idea how to pitch in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Morgan thought it was great. He and his friends
were thrilled with the idea that he was playing major league ball.
In retrospect, Morgan said, ``I should've been in rookie ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan floundered, predictably; before his first start, his
catcher, Jim Essian, told Morgan he would help nurse him through
the game by using all of his pitches. ``Don't worry,'' Morgan said,
``all I throw is a fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has wondered occasionally how much the force-feeding
retarded his development. As with most players, he needed years in
the minors, in a low-pressure environment where he could learn.
Finley traded him to the Yankees, where the principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, was concerned about winning exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan floundered with the Yankees, predictably, and was traded
to Toronto and Seattle; everywhere Morgan went, everybody told him
what good stuff he had, that he should be better than he was, that
others with half his ability were winning. Morgan was losing a lot:
In his first 10 seasons in the big leagues, Morgan's highest
winning percentage was .500 _ he went 1-1 for Seattle in 1985.
Every other year, he had a losing record, his reputation growing.
</P>
<P>
   But after Morgan joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1989, he
said, he learned how to treat pitching as a profession. Ron
Perranoski, the Dodgers' pitching coach, shifted his position on
the mound, to take better advantage of the movement of Morgan's
fastball. His confidence grew, and ``finally, I began to see with
my own two eyes what everybody had been telling me'' _ that he
could be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan had his first winning season in 1991, going 14-10 for the
Dodgers, and was 16-8 for the Cubs in 1992. Two years later, he
went on the disabled list three times _ he has been on the disabled
list 16 times in his career _ and he became a journeyman, bouncing
from one team to another.
</P>
<P>
   He moved from the Minnesota Twins to the Chicago Cubs last
season, and he surrendered Mark McGwire's 61st home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still got people out,'' said Morgan, who believed he would
have won more than four games last summer if he had been supported
by better defense and offense. ``I threw the ball better last year
than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was uncertain whether he would play in 1999, but once he
saw the way pitchers were coveted in the free-agent market, Morgan
hungered to get back. Many teams called in the off-season, he said,
but he was looking for the right situation, a club that could
provide ample run support and give him a chance to win when he
pitched into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before spring training, Morgan signed with the Texas
Rangers, who had perhaps the most dynamic offense in the league,
and for the first time in his career, he is 4-0. The other day, Joe
Girardi _ a teammate of Morgan in Chicago _ waved to him across the
field and held up four fingers. Four fingers for four victories.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan held a finger to his lips: Sshhh. With his history _ his
place in history _ it's something he doesn't want to expound upon.

NO SIGN OF DETENTE BETWEEN GIULIANI, SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said Wednesday that he
intended to keep working in New York despite tensions with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, as the mayor repeatedly declined to say that he
still had confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Though Giuliani was instrumental in hiring Crew three and a half
years ago and has been one of his biggest boosters since then, the
deep chasm opened between them recently over school vouchers and
the structure of the Board of Education showed no signs of closing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work for the man, I work for the board,'' Crew said of
Giuliani after a meeting of the seven-member Board of Education
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was going to resign over his dispute with the mayor,
Crew replied, in a jaunty, self-confident tone: ``No. Not at all.''
Asked if he was being pushed out of office by the mayor, he said
defiantly: ``No, I'm not being pushed.'' If anything, he added, he
was more determined than ever to stay on the job and continue his
efforts to improve city schools.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Giuliani refused to answer questions about whether
he continued to support the chancellor. But he said it would not be
his fault if Crew decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be responsible for it _ nope,'' Giuliani said,
bringing a sharper edge to his remarks after two days of
maintaining a subdued tone. ``People have to make their own
decisions about what jobs they want, what jobs they don't want. ''
</P>
<P>
   But both the chancellor and the mayor made it clear that they
would stand firm _ the mayor at City Hall, pressing his agenda for
what he called radical reform, and Crew at 110 Livingston St., the
school system headquarters in Brooklyn, defending his record. It
was a marked difference in a relationship that until two months ago
aides to both men had described as warm and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crew and the mayor have had a strong working
partnership since Crew arrived in New York in October 1995, they
have been unable to reconcile their deep philosophical differences
over vouchers and control of the school system. Their battle
escalated last week, when Giuliani said the entire school system
was ``dysfunctional'' and ``should be blown up,'' and Crew reacted
by sending a passionate letter accusing Giuliani of ``reckless''
and ``destructive'' remarks that essentially wrote off the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani has argued that vouchers that would send about
3,000 poor children to private and parochial schools would create
competition that would improve the school system, Crew has said the
vouchers would be a severe financial and moral blow to the system.
Under the mayor's plan, the vouchers would be paid for by taxpayer
money, and administered by City Hall. Crew has said he supports a
change in the structure of the Board of Education, but believes
that putting it under the direct control of the mayor would make it
too political.

BASKETBALL COLUMN: EWING OUGHT TO SIT, FOR SAKE OF THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the New York Knicks played at Charlotte on
Monday night, Dave Checketts brought up a sensitive subject with
Jeff Van Gundy. He discussed the issue of whether the coach should
consider resting Patrick Ewing for the remainder of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving up on the season when I say this by any
stretch, but Patrick needs a good off season when he's not sitting
at the bargaining table and he doesn't have that load on his
mind,'' Checketts said. ``He needs a good off season of
conditioning and getting ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But saying all that, I still believe that if we can get him at
80 or 90 percent of what he's capable of doing and get a good
playoff position, there isn't anybody we can't beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts has been taking the team's pulse since this three-game
road trip began Sunday in Miami, sitting with players on the team
plane, chatting with them after practice and essentially
determining what is salvageable from this disappointing season and
what is not.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Madison Square Garden president seems to be
expanding his duties again. Since demoting Ernie Grunfeld last
week, he has already taken on the duality of social conscience and
general manager. Now, with Ewing, he is trying his hand at team
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Knicks tried and failed to get their third straight
victory without Ewing on Wednesday night in their desperate march
toward the playoffs, losing to the Hawks, 76-73, it is reasonable
to wonder whether Ewing should play again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who may suit up again as early as tonight at home against
Philadelphia, might think the thought absurd. He would take it as a
blow to his ego and pride, and assume you believed he was a
detriment to a free-flowing offense.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the reason. If the Knicks ever want to win
anything of substance before Ewing retires after 2001, he needs to
be healthy. And if he is taking chances on a sore Achilles' tendon
in a season the Knicks need to write off as a learning experience,
the player who limps into the post-season is risking further injury
and hurting the Knicks in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts is paid to be a big-picture person, to see beyond
these comeback victories of late. He does need eight games at the
end of the season to confirm his worst fears about this franchise.
The first 42 games on television explained that to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's fate may already be decided. Unless he culls
something extraordinary out of the post-season, his days in New
York may finally come to an end. Perhaps Checketts' decision to
spend this much time around the team of late is to let him gauge
what Van Gundy means to the Knicks before he decides his coach's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some things are obvious. This whole notion of giving
the Knicks a year to come together is not a great one. They need to
go after a point guard as soon as the season ends, giving up
anything they can to convince Seattle to part with the disenchanted
Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs could be trade
bait, but whatever Checketts does, he needs to find someone with
the same court vision the franchise was supposed to have when it
made questionable decisions this past off season.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past decade, the Knicks have used April and May
to turn the Garden into a noisy den of possibility and hope. And as
this current group of players appears to find its rhythm, that
feeling is beginning to build again.
</P>
<P>
   But this team has neither the personnel nor the heart to sustain
that momentum. Checketts can't admit that for obvious reasons, but
that is the hard and plain truth. And that is why Ewing should take
his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost threw it out there just to say, is it worthwhile just
resting him now,'' Checketts said. ``But I think in his view, and
in Patrick's view, if he can help us, if that one extra game can
make a difference _ or two extra games _ could mean a different
playoff seeding, I think we have to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has missed 11 out of 46 games, nearly one-fourth of the
season. He would miss almost one-third of the season if he didn't
play the remaining four games. The team is already playing well
without him. Maybe, for once in a career, he should let his
teammates carry the piano upstairs. And play only when he is
healthy and ready.

PRINCIPALS OVER POLITICS 
TIPTOEING THROUGH THE ALUMINUM 
SOME DVORAK FOR HAVEL
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with ELISABETH BUMILLER AND DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe they both want to be a senator for six years,
but Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will settle
for being principal for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Both will take charge of public schools in New York City on
Thursday, Mrs. Clinton at the Virgil I. Grissom Junior High School
226 in Ozone Park, Queens, and Giuliani at Public School 123 in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as part of a nationwide program that
encourages public officials, executives and celebrities to become
involved in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani are considering running for Senate
next year, so naturally, aides to both said Wednesday that politics
was the last thing on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is in the schools all the time, not only when he's
running for office,'' said Cristyne Lategano, Giuliani's
communications director. ``This shouldn't be a political event, and
we hope that it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said much the same
thing. ``Mrs. Clinton has been interested in big public school
systems around the country for most of her adult life,'' Ms. Berry
said. ``This is a way for her to show her interest in a big public
school system.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing else? ``Not from our point of view,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips for Sale on Park Avenue
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulips and the color red are my passion,'' the sculptor Edwina
Sandys said Tuesday, looking out at the three she had installed on
Park Avenue at 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Installed, not planted. She made these tulips herself out of
aluminum. They are 12 feet tall and overshadow the garden-variety
tulips that are planted every spring in the same median strip under
a bequest from the philanthropist Mary Lasker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sandys, a granddaughter of Sir Winston Churchill, presided
at a kind of dedication ceremony inside the Alfred Dunhill store,
whose big plate glass windows face the tulips. Looking out from
inside were the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the president of the
Interfaith Center of New York and the dean emeritus of the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine; the jewelry designer Kenneth Jay
Lane, and the novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford, who said: ``I'm a
huge admirer of her grandfather. I always mention him and quote him
in my books.''
</P>
<P>
   The parks commissioner, Henry Stern, called Mrs. Sandys' tulips
``first-rate sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the installation is for sale and added, ``If
anyone is good enough to buy it and give it to us, we'll find a
wonderful place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``With the approval of the Art
Commission, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   This was apparently a reference to a lawsuit filed by Reba White
Williams, the former president of the commission, who accused Mayor
Giuliani of allowing Stern to install yardarms on flagpoles in
parks without the commission's approval.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the mayor, Stern, several other city officials and
a couple of celebrities went to Central Park to dedicate 2,000
trees that will be planted by the beginning of next year, which is,
of course, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was as indefatigably earnest as ever, lecturing the crowd
of schoolchildren on red oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nicholas Scoppetta, who heads the Administration for
Children's Services, stepped up to the microphone. ``I really don't
have anything to say,'' he said, ``but I couldn't pass up the
opportunity to be on the same bill and say I played Central Park
with Isabella Rossellini and Ron Silver.''

   What does the guy at at the Baldwin play when a VIP walks in?
Michael Garin, the pianist at Monkey Bar, a restaurant at 60 E.
54th St., tried ``O Lovely Moon'' by the Czech composer Antonin
Dvorak when Vaclav Havel, the president of the Czech Republic,
walked in on Tuesday with his wife, Dagmar, and the director Milos
Forman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four chords and Mrs. Havel went, `Yeah,' like, `You are not
asleep at the switch, man,''' Garin said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same evening, Garin asked one of Havel's security
agents, who was hanging out at the piano, if there was anything he
wanted to hear. ``How about, `The Party's Over?''' the agent said.

CHARLES PILLARD, 80; LED ELECTRICIANS UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles H. Pillard, the strong-willed president of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for two decades,
died April 26 in a hospital in Buffalo, N.Y. He was 80 and had
lived in Orchard Park, a suburb of Buffalo, since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Pillard, a native of Buffalo, graduated from high school, worked
for a time as an electrician, became an official of the IBEW and
rose steadily in its ranks. He was the union's president from 1968
until 1986, when he retired after a dispute with another union that
was on strike at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement the IBEW was the nation's sixth largest, with
869,000 members. The only unions with more members were the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the National Education
Association, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the United
Automobile Workers and the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   During Pillard's presidency, his union's membership reached 1
million. It is now about 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The union is the biggest of the electrical unions and represents
workers in utilities and in the broadcasting, railroad and
construction industries. When Pillard was president of the union,
he also was a vice president and a member of the executive council
of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Pillard could be contentious. In a letter to The Wall Street
Journal in 1984 he asserted, ``Blaming labor for the rising costs
of nuclear power plants is like placing the blame for the Johnstown
flood on a leaky faucet in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also sometimes outspoken about politics. In 1982 he
declared that the Reagan administration had ``given new life to the
extremists of the right _ the very same forces that organized labor
threw out of the government 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pillard was president, the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers won a lawsuit against the Nixon administration
about elements in the federal wage-control system that, the union
contended, penalized the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Pillard retired after a rancorous dispute between his union and
the Communications Workers of America about negotiations on new
contracts with regional telephone companies and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the electrical workers union continued to work at
AT&AMP;T factories while the communications workers were on strike. The
CWA's president, Morton Bahr, later contended that Pillard's union
had committed ``fratricide'' in the labor movement. Bahr told
reporters that both unions could have gained more from AT&AMP;T if they
had presented a united front.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering News-Record, a McGraw-Hill publication, said in 1996
that before Pillard was succeeded as president by John J. Barry,
``few things better symbolized intransigence in the building trades
than Charles H. Pillard'' and his position on a labor issue
involving 10-hour work shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Pillard served in the Army in the Pacific and Europe in World
War II, rising to captain. He won awards from the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith and other organizations, and served on
several federal panels, including a presidential advisory committee
for trade negotiations and a presidential committee on employment
of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Helen May
Bratten; two daughters, Jane Carollo of Orchard Park and Linda Voye
of Amherst, N.Y.; two brothers, Francis Bieber of Tonawanda, N.Y.,
and Jack Bieber of Cheektowaga, N.Y.; a sister, Gloria Cook of
Houston, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

OUTDOORS: SPINEFISH APLENTY IN WATERS OF THE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAY OTTULICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember the time several years ago I sat in a car in upstate
New York as we wound up the twisting two lanes of a small gorge
between the Hudson and the flanks of the Catskill Mountains. Gazing
down and taking inventory, in fly-fishing guide fashion, of the
frantic frothing waters rushing between deep dark pools, I asked
nonchalantly how the fishing was.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was quick and unexpected: ``There's no fish in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since I was just on a short visit, and this was the East, I
swallowed all my usual questions and chalked the reason up to some
type of invisible pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as I continue my flyrod explorations of these wild lands
and waterways that flow from trout water to tide water, I've
discovered rivers, creeks and kills literally teeming with wild
fish. Some are natives, others invaders, and yet I've respectively
come to group them under the sobriquet of ``spinefish,'' in honor
of their warm-water habitats, their aggressive behavior, and for
the intimidating dorsal fins of sharp, skin-piercing spines that
jut fiercely above their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The king of these spinefish and one of the most renowned flyrod
catches in this part of the world is the anadromous Morone
Saxatilis, or striped bass. Returning after 24 years spent in
Montana, I've really noticed the change in New York, the clearer
air the cleaner water. Federal laws and the efforts of the Hudson
Estuary Fisheries Recovery Program and other dedicated
organizations are making the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass once again ascend the Hudson estuary from the
Atlantic in the spring, voraciously pursuing blueback herring,
alewife and shad until they too succumb to reproductive urges at
the convergence of optimal temperature and length of daylight. A
cool spring keeps them in the estuary the longest and within
casting distance of flyrodders along some of the spawning
tributaries entering the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Stripers will shadow bluebacks (which like fast currents and
rocky bottoms) in these creeks and kills at least up to the first
barrier (they won't leap like salmon) and have been caught as far
as eight miles from the estuary. Stripers commonly reach weights up
to 30-plus pounds, a strong and formidable fish on a flyrod that
had better be at the least an 8 weight with a good reel.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Micropterus Dolomieu _ the smallmouth or black
bass, which are found in all the same lies as trout and will
aggressively attack streamer and dry flies. Premium habitats are
fast, big-boulder, pocket-water runs and deep pools over broken
ledge rock.
</P>
<P>
   Smallmouths, interestingly, have been taking over habitat and
replacing largemouth bass in the Hudson River as water quality and
clarity have improved. With light rods 3 or 4 weight, the
consistent hookups, and the real possibility of a two- to
four-pound fish makes smallmouthing for me as good as some of the
fly-fishing I've had in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The blocky shaped, red-eyed, brassy brown Ambloplites rupestris,
or rock bass, a native to the Hudson drainage, are found side by
side with smallmouth in fast-current, rocky-bottomed streams where
there is plenty of shelter. When hooked, these ubiquitous fish
initially put up a scrappy fight but play out very quickly. Again,
use light rods, fast-stripped streamers, or twitch-and-drift dries.
</P>
<P>
   The slow-current, deep-water belly sections of pools, with their
bottoms of sand- or silt-covered rubble, are home to the Lepomis
auritus: the redbreast sunfish or ``pool robin.'' Though small to
moderate in size, they are aggressive feeders, shooting up like
bullets from the depths to take dry flies in splashy rises off the
surface. They are very somber shaded above, but their breast colors
_ yellowish in females and reddish in males _ become positively
vibrant during the breeding season. Use light rods, fine leaders,
with either nymphs, small streamers or dry flies, for these feisty
5- to 8-inch pan fish.
</P>
<P>
   I still hear people say from time to time, ``There's no fish in
there.'' Now, I realize what they really mean is, ``There's no
trout in there.'' And if these anglers continue to choose to fish
stockies over wild fish, their experiences will be a bit
diminished, and my favorite haunts will stay a bit wilder for a
little longer. &QL;

VALHOL SURVIVES FIGHT JUST TO ENTER KENTUCKY DERBY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Even if it took a court fight, the Valhol camp
is grateful that its horse is in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Dallas Keen said Wednesday that his horse deserved the
ruling by an Arkansas court on Tuesday that released the Arkansas
Derby purse of $300,000 to the owner, James Jackson. The purse had
been held up by Oaklawn Park pending an investigation into the
possible use of an electrical buzzer by the jockey, Billy Patin, to
get the gelding to run faster.
</P>
<P>
   Patin has been replaced as the jockey by Willie Martinez, who
worked the horse half a mile Tuesday morning in 48 1/5 seconds.
``Willie's excited about this horse,'' Keen said. ``He's been
watching tapes of his races to get familiar with him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the legal decision that put Valhol in the Derby, Keen
said: ``The law was clear, and we felt confident leaving the
courtroom that the decision would be favorable. This horse deserves
the opportunity to run in the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jackson nor Keen was discouraged by Valhol's being
lumped with four other horses in the mutuel field. ``He was 107-1
in Louisiana,'' Keen said of Valhol's fourth-place showing, ``and
31-1 in the Arkansas Derby. He's never let us down yet. He won't
embarrass us on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Godolphin stable isn't sure who will ride its second Derby
entry, Aljabr. It had hoped to tab last year's Derby winner, Kent
Desormeaux, but he is the regular rider on the filly entered by Bob
Baffert, Excellent Meeting. The European rider Daragh O'Donahue was
flown in for the race. But the trainer Saeed bin Suroor made it
clear that Desormeaux would ride Aljabr if Baffert scratched
Excellent Meeting.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A full field of 20 horses was entered
Wednesday in the 125th Kentucky Derby and, for the first time in 15
years, it included two fillies, Three Ring and Excellent Meeting,
who was named half of the favored entry with her stablemate General
Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The race was considered wide open, and the draw for post
positions did nothing to dispel the fact that no dominant
3-year-old horse had surfaced in the prep races of the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, who was named this morning for the Derby on
Saturday and who is still entered in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies
on Friday, was made part of a powerful pair entered by Bob Baffert
at 3-1 as he shoots for his third consecutive victory in America's
most prestigious race.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time in 15 years that 20 horses were
booked into the two starting gates at Churchill Downs: 14 in the
main gate, 6 in the auxiliary gate. And the two fillies fared well
in that respect: Excellent Meeting drew the No. 6 spot, the same
post she drew in the Oaks, and Three Ring drew No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most highly prized horses in the country drew
unfavorable positions: Prime Timber, the third of Baffert's stars
from California, got the 14th slot and General Challenge got the
15th. Farther outside to their right came Vicar, winner of the
Florida Derby, in No. 18; Menifee, winner of the Blue Grass Stakes,
in No. 19, and Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Futurity, No.
20.
</P>
<P>
   The two mystery horses from Dubai were personally entered by
their owner, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and both did all
right: Aljabr was placed fifth from the rail, Worldly Manner 12th.
The entry was listed at 12-1.
</P>
<P>
   The draw was conducted for the third year under a new system
that reduces the random selection of post positions of years past.
For most races, the horse is assigned his post in the gate
according to the number drawn from a box. Under the new system, the
draw from the box determines the selection order by the owners and
trainers.
</P>
<P>
   So, Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Lemon Drop Kid, drew No. 20
and was the last to make his selection. Naturally, only one post
position was left, the one on the far outside. ``After much
deliberation,'' Schulhofer announced with a straight face to the
crowd assembled in the track's museum, ``we'll pick No. 20.''
</P>
<P>
   A kind of gallows humor descended on several other trainers,
too, including Baffert, who said: ``It could be worse. We could be
back in California watching on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The rail position, often shunned because it subjects the horse
to heavy traffic pressure from others trying to rush to the inside,
was avoided until Nick Zito got to make his selections, both of
which were favorable. He picked No. 4 for Stephen Got Even, winner
of the Turfway Stakes, and No. 1 for Adonis, winner of the Wood
Memorial. ``To tell the truth,'' he said, ``I don't want to be near
Baffert.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, turning serious, said: ``There is no ideal post
position. The horse still has to break, and that's the most
important thing. If you don't break in this race, you'll find
yourself behind 12 horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent Meeting has the same style that Real Quiet has. She
can take dirt kicked in her face. With the others, I didn't want to
get picked off, so I took 14 and 15. You can get hit on only one
side out there. And I didn't want Prime Timber to stand in the gate
too long; he gets antsy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baffert was asked if Excellent Meeting's favorable post may
decide whether she skips the Oaks and run in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how a filly will run,'' he replied. ``I wish
Three Ring had run in the Florida Derby. On paper, Excellent
Meeting looks great. Right now, I'm going to the Derby with her.
But John Mabee might show up at the barn tomorrow and change his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time two fillies ran in the Derby was 1984, when the
trainer D. Wayne Lukas sent out Life's Magic and Althea.
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue surrounding Excellent Meeting thickened Wednesday
morning when Baffert announced that he would cross-enter her in the
Derby the day after the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   He made the decision after meeting with the filly's owners,
Betty and John Mabee of Golden Eagle Farm in California, and
indicated that he was following his strategic plan: taking out
insurance in case he didn't like the post position in either race.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting drew the sixth spot in a field of eight in the
starting gate for the Oaks. She would break just to the right of
Silverbulletday, a star filly also trained by Baffert but owned by
Mike Pegram, who owned Real Quiet, last year's Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This filly is doing great,'' Baffert said, ``and she earned
her way into the Derby. She's good enough to win. Entering her in
the Derby keeps our options open. A lot can happen between now and
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's decision also meant that Excellent Meeting would bump
Etbauer from the Derby. The colt won the Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn
Park, and stood last in the line of 20 candidates for the Derby
with $75,000 in winnings in graded stakes. Excellent Meeting, with
more than $1 million in earnings, thereby qualified for one of the
20 slots and Etbauer fell to No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   So, no matter which race Excellent Meeting started, Etbauer was
out of the Derby. The rules do not allow replacements for scratched
horses.

NOW COMES HARD PART FOR LAKERS _ WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In a season of bad starts and worse
finishes, the Los Angeles Lakers start anew once more tonight,
emboldened by a team bloodletting meeting and two solid days of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the events of the past two days _ the intense
players-only meeting, the airing of issues and grievances, the
renewed dedication to defense _ translates into better play will be
evident soon. The Portland Trail Blazers, newly crowned champs of
the Pacific Division, come to the Forum tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are as optimistic as any team riding a three-game
losing streak can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that we feel is there's nowhere to go but up,'' Kobe
Bryant said. ``There's no time to be down. The more down we get on
ourselves, the worse it's gonna get. So we have to pick ourselves
up and keep on trying, keep on playing hard.... Hopefully, the
longer you struggle, the greater you become.''
</P>
<P>
   For two straight days in practice, they have. In this condensed
50-game season, just practicing two consecutive days has been a
rarity and a luxury, and that alone should help.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the two best practices we've had all year,'' coach
Kurt Rambis said. ``Are these two practices gonna cure all of our
ills? Probably not. But it is a steppingstone in the right
direction....
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody clearing the air, they feel good. It's like
a burden that's been released getting things off their chest. There
may have been pent-up emotions or feelings, and now they're out in
the open and everybody feels good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal said it will all be pointless if the team
doesn't pull together come tipoff. As for whether all the talking
helps, O'Neal said flatly, ``not to me. It doesn't help our
standings. We gotta go out and get it done now.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Forum walls, observers expect a total meltdown as
the Lakers head into the postseason. In the Lakers locker room,
they're doing all they can to fight that negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's us against the world,'' J.R. Reid said. ``When we get
down to it, it's just gonna be the coaches and the players in this
locker room. So that's the only guys we can depend on, and we need
to re-establish that trust with each other from that meeting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Derek Fisher: ``We haven't given up, and we won't give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Del speaks: Del Harris, fired as head coach Feb. 24, said the
Lakers ``hung me out all summer'' by not extending his contract and
decided back then that this would be his last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact I did get fired last year,'' he said Wednesday on
ESPN's ``UpClose.'' ``They should have extended me last year, along
with (executive Jerry) West and (GM Mitch) Kupchak and Rambis....
Or they should have fired me, one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was brought back to finish out his contract, then fired
when the team started out 6-6. He said he has no regrets but said
the team acted hastily in dismissing him at a time the Lakers were
banged up and had not yet signed Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have stayed the course with the old fella,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers management ``failed to recognize what we had done over
the last four years in going from a lottery team to 48 (wins), 53,
57, 61 wins and having a tremendous season last year that was
unrecognized and unappreciated,'' said Harris, who decided then
that ``it was best that I ... move on.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 29:
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting a war in consultation with Congress is not always
easy for the White House, but it is necessary under the
Constitution. Given the sensitive military and diplomatic ground in
Kosovo, the House is for the most part steering a reasonable if
spendthrift course this week in acting on several measures
involving the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were right on Wednesday to insist that President
Clinton seek congressional approval if he decides to order ground
troops into combat. The measure was advanced by Republican leaders
but supported by 45 Democrats in a 249-to-180 vote that Democratic
opponents mischaracterized as a message of weakness to Slobodan
Milosevic. Clinton says he has no intention of invading Kosovo or
Serbia, and NATO has made no preparations to do so, beyond the
drafting of contingency plans. If sentiment within the alliance
changes, Clinton would be well advised to start moving troops and
weapons to the Balkans to keep the option open and to increase the
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should not limit Clinton's hand on such preparations.
But if the president chooses to send ground forces into battle, he
will need the full support of Congress and the American people.
Yesterday he assured the House he would seek congressional support.
To act without it would invite the kind of division and political
unrest that developed during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The House also properly rejected an appeal from Rep. Tom
Campbell of California to issue a formal declaration of war against
Yugoslavia. With diplomacy at a delicate stage, the act of
declaring war would escalate the conflict and harden Serbian
resistance to a political settlement. Diplomatic efforts are likely
to intensify now that Russia has taken a lead role in trying to
mediate the conflict. Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, plans
to travel to Moscow on Thursday, following the visit there earlier
this week by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.

   It is regrettable that the House could not muster a majority to
support a resolution in favor of the air war. The House is also
fumbling a defense-spending measure. It should quickly approve
Clinton's $6 billion emergency request to pay for the air war and
assistance for hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven
from Kosovo by Serbian forces. Instead the House is moving to
provide more than double that amount, with additional money for a
military pay raise, construction projects and other matters that
should be considered as part of the normal Pentagon budget. The
Senate is likely to do the same. Using the war to circumvent budget
limitations is a misuse of congressional power and will not help
NATO prevail in Yugoslavia. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharp challenge to President Clinton, the
House voted Wednesday to bar the president from sending ground
troops to Yugoslavia without congressional approval and then on a
tie vote refused to support NATO air strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The votes came during a day of heated and sometimes anguished
speeches that showcased deep divisions in Congress over the
escalating conflict in the Balkans. The all-day session marked the
first formal congressional debate since NATO began its bombing
campaign on March 24 to drive the forces of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic out of Kosovo. The Senate had voted on March 23
to approve the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 249-180 to require the president to seek
congressional approval for ground forces. Forty-five Democrats and
an independent joined 203 Republicans to support the measure.
Sixteen Republicans and 164 Democrats opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the surprise came when the House finished its deliberations
by failing to pass a Democratic resolution intended to give
symbolic support to the president's air campaign. The measure
failed in a tie vote of 213-213 even though Speaker Dennis Hastert
threw his support behind it. In all, 31 Republicans broke with
their party to back the air campaign and 26 Democrats voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it would press ahead with the air strikes.
``The House today voted `no' on going forward, `no' on going back
and they tied on standing still,'' said Jake Siewert, a White House
spokesman. ``We will continue to prosecute the air campaign and to
stop the violence being perpetrated by Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the rebuke of the president on air strikes, Hastert
said, ``I would hope that the president would take this diverse
debate as a signal that he should better explain the goals, the
costs and the long-term strategy of why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   The House votes should have no immediate practical effect on the
White House conduct of the war, since the president has said
repeatedly there are no plans to use ground troops, and since he
does not need the House's moral support to continue air strikes.
And it is not clear what the Senate, which voted in support of air
strikes on March 23, will do.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate does not have to take up the House measure on ground
troops. But in an effort to take their own stand on the Balkan
policy, the Republican and Democratic leaders were working behind
the scenes to see if they could draft bipartisan language on
Kosovo. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has introduced his own
resolution authorizing Clinton to use ``all necessary force'' to
win in the Balkans, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has
objected to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday,
Clinton once again said he had no plans for ground troops and vowed
that he would seek congressional ``support'' if he changed that
stance. But he would not seek congressional approval, his spokesman
Joe Lockhart said, arguing that such a step would raise a host of
constitutional questions.
</P>
<P>
   While Lockhart stopped short of a veto threat, Democrats in the
House said the president would veto any measure requiring such
approval of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long day of debate, some House members invoked
the quagmire of Vietnam to call for America to withdraw from the
Balkans. Others drew comparisons with World War II and the
Holocaust to argue for the air campaign to go on. And Rep. Gene
Taylor, D-Miss., urged the rare step of a full declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that in voting for war I will share the responsibility
for those young Americans who may die,'' Taylor said. ``But to do
anything else is much worse. The best course of action for this
nation is to use the overwhelming military might we have at our
disposal to end this war swiftly and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had tried in the past to discourage such open
debate in Congress about the Kosovo conflict in the hopes of
sending a united message to Yugoslavia and to present a unified
voice of support for the troops. Until now, the Republican
leadership had also shied away from such a debate, with some senior
Republicans calculating that their party would be best served by
distancing itself from the conflict and letting President Clinton
take any blame for involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen argued in a letter to Hastert that a prohibition on
ground troops ``could be misinterpreted as a U.S. retrenchment''
from its solidarity with NATO, and would impede the president in
his role as commander in chief. But the Administration's effort to
influence the House vote was low key and the White House was not
demanding party-line support.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's debates were forced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif.,
who used his prerogatives under the Vietnam-era War Powers
resolution to force votes on what he has called an unconstitutional
war, undeclared by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we're at war,'' said Campbell, who is a law professor.
``We're on the verge of ground troops. The framers were quite clear
that war was too important to be decided by one individual. Ground
troops are very seriously being considered. Therefore we must
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Working its way through an array of proposals, the House
rejected the measure to issue a formal declaration of war against
Yugoslavia by a vote of 2-427. The House also declined, by a vote
of 139-290, to call for an immediate withdrawal of all American
forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans poured out their reservations about a conflict
they said had ill-defined goals and was not in the nation's vital
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it worth it to stay in Vietnam to save face?'' asked Rep.
Tom DeLay, the majority whip. Sharply criticizing the NATO bombing
campaign, DeLay said, ``What good has been accomplished so far?
Absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who, like McCain, is seeking the
Republican presidential nomination, said, ``The fact is the civil
war in Kosovo has been raging since 1389.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich added, ``The fact is our intervening in the middle of an
ethnic civil war that has been going on for six centuries is not
likely to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., predicted that if Congress did
not act, the president ``will commit our grandchildren to policing
the Balkans. Not because we are threatened. Not because we are
under attack. But simply to enforce a new world order.''
</P>
<P>
   The many Democrats who rallied around Clinton invoked memories
of the Holocaust. They said the ban on ground troops without
authorization would hamstring NATO commanders, force the courts to
decide what constituted ground troops and sent the wrong message to
Milosevic. Some said the bill's restrictions on what it termed
``ground elements'' were so vague that they could be interpreted as
banning financing for the support troops already in Albania and the
Balkan region with the Apache helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to say to him today, `we don't know what
we're doing, we probably won't be for ground troops?''' implored
Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, ``You want to take that
option off the table? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic whip said, ``Some say the
suffering Kosovars are not America's responsibility. That the gang
rapes, the burned villages, the mass graves are not our problem.''
He added ``We are a superpower at the peak of our prosperity and
strength. What is America supposed to do? Look the other way?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Democrats agreed. ``We cannot win peace through
war,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. ``The failure of the
bombing campaign is proof.''

EEOC SAYS EMPLOYER SHOULD PAY FOR WOMAN'S INFERTILITY TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision hailed as a major legal victory for infertile
couples, a federal agency has ruled that a national publishing
company violated disabilities laws by refusing to pay for an
employee's infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Rochelle Saks, a 37-year-old bookstore manager in
White Plains, sued last year when the company's medical plan said
she must pay almost $20,000 to the doctor who treated her for
hormonal imbalance, artificially inseminated her with her husband's
sperm and provided care when she had a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   After several months of battle with her employer, the Franklin
Covey Co., a publisher of motivational books and educational
materials, Ms. Saks was reimbursed by the medical plan for about
$3,000 of those bills, according to a ruling by the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission that was issued on Tuesday and
provided Wednesday by Ms. Saks' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, a first of its kind in New York and possibly in the
country, said that the company had not provided ``substantial''
infertility-related benefits and that ``exclusion of medically
necessary treatments for infertility'' violated parts of the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined Wednesday to answer questions about the
case, but released a statement saying, `This is an insurance
industrywide issue, and it's only the beginning of an EEOC
administrative process that will continue to evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saks' case and a trickle of similar complaints around the
country have begun to come before the employment commission mostly
as the result of an unrelated Supreme Court decision last summer
that declared reproduction a ``major life activity'' and ruled that
those who could not bear children were protected under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Grossman, a supervisory trial lawyer for the
employment commission's New York district office, said she was
prohibited under federal law from commenting on Ms. Saks' case
while it was still being investigated. The ruling now gives the
company the chance to enter into discussions to settle Ms. Saks'
complaint, and if an agreement cannot be reached, the case will
move to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Grossman did say that few infertility coverage cases
have advanced from the administrative realm to court, where a
ruling by a federal judge could have a huge impact on whether
companies and insurers must pay for infertility procedures.

COMMENTARY: THE DEADLIEST DOWNLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf to correct spelling of Wen Ho Lee) (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During President Clinton's watch, America's most
vital nuclear secrets _ guarded intensely for five decades _ have
been allowed to spill out all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago I surmised that what now worried our scientists
most was the possible theft of the ``Lagrangian codes'' from our
national laboratories. These are the supercomputer programs that _
when fed secret data ``benchmarks'' from all our nuclear tests _
enable foreign scientists to simulate our explosions and erase our
lead.
</P>
<P>
   We are now informed by The New York Times'
Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative team that the codes _ ``legacy
codes,'' as they are known at Los Alamos _ were allegedly
downloaded by Wen Ho Lee in 1994. Our nuclear genie is out of the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People's Republic of China is the number one
proliferator,'' said Rep. Chris Cox, chairman of the select
committee on Chinagate. ``Now the secrets are out there in the
stream of commerce, and probably on to Iran and North Korea and
Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   The hemorrhage is horrendous. How did it happen? The Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence is grilling FBI Director Louis
Freeh Thursday in secret, but here are some facts:
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting Lee at Los Alamos to be a spy for China, FBI agents
in 1997 alerted the White House and went to the Department of
Justice's Office of Intelligence Policy Review to request
application to a special court for a wiretap under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act. But Acting Director Gerald Schroeder
and his aide Alan Kornblum decided the evidence was insufficient
and refused to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then went over Schroeder's head to the office of Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder, and was turned down again. The FBI
never returned with new evidence to Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Did Freeh appeal to Janet Reno about ``over-lawyering'' in a
national security case, or was he too browbeaten to try? The bureau
learned that when it comes to China, Reno Justice assigns only its
most incompetent operatives and penalizes prosecutors who target
Asian financing of the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Justice makes some 700 court applications a year for
taps under that surveillance law. Maybe once or twice a year, says
a Justice intelligence official, it finally refuses the FBI's
request that it apply. This case, involving an embarrassment to
China when Clinton was proclaiming ``strategic partnership,'' was
the one.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Congress should examine the ultra-gentle prosecution
of a Los Alamos nuclear simulation scientist, Peter Lee, who was
let off with a year in a halfway house. The sentencing judge was
never told all Justice knew of his spying.
</P>
<P>
   With his Chinese chickens coming home to roost, Clinton has been
desperately trying to keep a lid on China-gate. His first reaction
_ that it happened back in the '80s and had nothing to do with him
_ has been overtaken by eventful truth.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 weeks he ducked a meeting with Cox and Norman Dicks of
the House committee seeking security clearance of their 1,000-page
report on China's penetration of our scientific and political
worlds. Last week they met in a ``sober'' session; Cox expects his
slightly sanitized report to be made public by May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after that, we'll see what the president's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board comes up with. Its chairman, former
Sen. Warren Rudman, was incensed by a prediction in this space of a
whitewash: ``It will be a hard-hitting report about security at the
labs,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Rudman has hired nine new investigators and may come up with
recommendations about locking the barn door now that the secrets of
almost every nuclear test we have undertaken are on their way to
Baghdad or Pyongyang via Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   As the dangerous duping of this administration unfolds, keep in
mind Beijing's grand design: Use Asian fund-raisers to influence
White House policy to sell China advanced computer and missile
technology. Simultaneously, use spies to steal both the secret
codes to program those supercomputers and to steal the data
benchmarks enabling them to simulate our nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the downloading of our secrets, American cities will
be less safe in two years than they were at the height of the Cold
War. We owe it to ourselves to find out who let it happen and why.

NETS SEND A MESSAGE FOR THREE QUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ For three quarters, the Nets defied the
odds. With precision, hustle and heart they put a team fighting
desperately for playoff position in jeopardy. Perhaps that is all
one can ask of a club that is bereft of healthy big men and playing
for nothing more than pride.
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth quarter grew old, the undermanned Nets lost
strength, enabling the Detroit Pistons to pull away for a 101-93
victory before 17,795 fans at The Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, who trailed throughout the first half and for most
of the third period, outscored the Nets by 23-15 in the final
quarter to prevail. The victory was large for Detroit, which
improved to 26-20 and moved two games ahead of the eighth-place
Knicks (24-22) in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are tied for sixth with the Milwaukee Bucks. But the
Nets almost felt victorious themselves. After being destroyed on
Tuesday by the Miami Heat, they were encouraged by how close they
came to winning with Jamie Feick and Mark Hendrickson manning the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard for a team with a 14-32 record to send a
message, Kendall Gill, who battled neck-and-neck all night with
Grant Hill, believes the Nets did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let people know that hey, we're here and that next
year we're going to be a team to be reckoned with,'' Gill said.
``We're going to have everybody with us and they know that over
there in the other locker room. They're thinking, `These guys are
almost beating us and they don't have four or five of their guys.
What's going to happen next year?' We know that that thought is
over there in their minds and that's the same thought that we're
trying to put in everybody's minds that we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill's boldness came from playing Hill to a near draw. The Nets'
swingman scored 22 points and made five steals, compared with
Hill's 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Though he had six
turnovers, Hill emerged as the winner by scoring 7 fourth-quarter
points.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Gill and the Nets had Detroit fearing the worst.
Stephon Marbury played another strong game, finishing with 21
points and 12 assists, and had 20 and 10, respectively, through
three periods. His play, along with the contributions of Gill,
Kittles (14 points), Feick (13 points, 16 rebounds) and Hendrickson
(12 points, eight rebounds), allowed the Nets to enter the fourth
quarter tied at 78-78.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Jud Buechler hit his first of two late 3-pointers to
break an 81-81 tie early in the fourth, and the Pistons moved ahead
by 5 points before the Nets pulled within 3 at 90-87. Marbury had a
chance to take them closer but missed two free throws with 4
minutes 22 seconds left. Then Hill scored two quick baskets, and
Buechler drilled his final 3-pointer to seal it.
