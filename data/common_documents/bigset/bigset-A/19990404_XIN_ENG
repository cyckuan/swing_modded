<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Asia Tour Termed as Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- President Hosni Mubarak's upcoming
Asia tour is "of special and vital importance" in light of the
current international and regional developments, a senior Egyptian
official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz
expressed hope that the visit would yield positive results
regarding the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is due to start visits to China, South Korea and Japan
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In general, "the Asian stance is good" vis a vis the peace
process, el-Baz said, adding that China "fully supports" the Arab
rights and Japan "sympathizes with" the Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
During his visits in the three countries, Mubarak will try to
see what they could offer to help salvage the stalled Mideast
peace process, el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel came to a
halt in December when Israel shelved the Wye peace accord signed
last October after carrying out the first of the three-phased
withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said the Egyptian president will also discuss with the
leaders of the three Asian countries various ways of enhancing
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital" to promote the economic, technological and
industrial cooperation between Egypt and each of the three
countries, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Patriarch Appeals for Stopping War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Patriarch of the Romanian
Orthodox Church Teoctist appealed on Saturday for putting an end
to the war in Yugoslavia, stressing that "dialogue is the only
form by which the Kosovo residents can come to coexist
peacefully".
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of the bloodshed, notably during the
celebration of the Resurrection, will be a bad point for mankind,
with nefarious consequences for its future existence," said
Teoctist.
</P>
<P>
"Living at full intensity the tragedy of the war in Yugoslavia,
the Romanian nation, the Christian world in general, cannot feel
the joy of the Resurrection at its fullest. Innocent people are
mercilessly killed and entire populations seek refuge," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the sacred name of life and peace, respect of man and the
nations' sovereignty, we insistently ask the parties involved to
stop the war in Yugoslavia. This appeal of our Church will join
the cries of pain expressed the world over for ending the war and
returning to the table of dialogue in order to solve the Kosovo
crisis," continued Patrch of the Romanian Orthodox Church
Teoctist.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Orthodox Church enjoys the allegiance of more than
80 percent of Romania's population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No-limits for Bombing against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Following the missile strikes
against Belgrade's downtown buildings, the Clinton
administration declared on Saturday that "no target is
off-limits" in the vicious NATO bombing to try to force
Yugoslavia to concede the sovereignty of Kosovo to the Western
powers in their so-called "peacekeeping efforts".
</P>
<P>
"The message is that no target is off-limits ... including
downtown Belgrade," National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO escalated its air war against Yugoslavia last
night with seven cruise missiles fired by two U.S. warships,
hitting Yugoslav government buildings, signaling the Western
desperation in its attempt to force Belgrade into accepting its
deal.
</P>
<P>
"As we move toward in the days to come, we will continue to
intensify the strikes to make clear to (Yugoslav President
Slobodan) Milosevic our determination to significantly degrade
his military capability," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton acknowledged in his weekly address
on Saturday that the Operation of Allied Force was "a difficult
and dangerous one."
</P>
<P>
But he insisted to go ahead with the bombing, saying: "looking
away simply is not a option."

<HEADLINE> Peace Only Solution to Mideast Issues: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah Khatib said Saturday that peace is the "only option" to solve
all issues confronting the Middle East region, Jordan`s official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the meeting with a visiting
U.S. Congress delegation led by head of the International
Relations Committee of the House Benjamin Gilman.
</P>
<P>
Khatib briefed the American delegation, which is on its Mideast
tour, on Jordan`s stance in the Mideast affairs, stressing that a
peaceful solution is the only way of solving crises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Amman has, on many occasions, termed peace as a strategic
choice by Jordan and other Arab countries to solve the
Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second Arab country after Egypt to sign a peace
treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gilman, a Republican from New York, highly appreciated
Jordan`s pivotal role and efforts in achieving a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressman Saturday also met Jordanian Chairman of
the Joint Staffs Abdel Hafez Meri Ka`abneh to discuss the
development and modernization drive of the Jordanian army.
</P>
<P>
Washington regards Jordan as its staunch ally in the Arab world
and has promised some 300 million U.S. dollars of economic
and military aid in 1999.

<HEADLINE> UK Proposes Refugee Places in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Saturday that the
international community should set up a sanctuary in Macedonia for
Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
"This place of refuge would be created, protected and supplied
by NATO troops," British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement issued Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he had already begun talks with the Macedonian
government, NATO and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) about setting up the sanctuary as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim will be to meet all the immediate needs of the
hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children trying
to flee Kosovo," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be jointly run by NATO and the UNHCR," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of refugees fled or are still trying to flee
Kosovo after NATO began to airstrike that region. They were
stranded at the borders between Yugoslavia and Neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia said on Saturday it was unable to cope with the wave
of refugees and would only let in the most frail and those who
could go on to other countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns NATO Airstrikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi cabinet meeting chaired
by President Saddam Hussein on Saturday reiterated its
condemnation of the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting and carried by the Iraqi
News Agency termed the NATO claims that it is protecting Muslims
in Kosovo as a "flagrant and hypocritic lie and a pretext that
nobody believes."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. and Israel harbor historical
antagonism against Muslims and Islam religion, which has been
proved by the nine years of continuous aggression against the
Iraqi people, the Palestinians and criminal acts against other
Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
"The use of Muslim card by NATO in Kosovo is a cover for an
unjustified aggression on an independent and sovereign country,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's aggression aims to arouse the Arab and Muslims
emotions against Yugoslavia and lessening their opposition to the
aggressive crimes committed by the U.S. and Israel, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the NATO aggression is to divide Yugoslavia
completely, for Yugoslavia does not consent to the U.S. policy,"
the statement said, adding that the same has happened and is
happening in Iraq and other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li Peng
met a group of Turkish businessmen here Saturday and encouraged
them to increase exchanges with their Chinese counterparts for
further developing the economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, pointed out that in the socialist
market economy of China, it is the enterprises that decide and
carry out the specific cooperation projects while the government's
role is only to provide guiding policies.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he encouraged businessmen from China and Turkey to
increase their exchanges and expand the scope of their
cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Friday on a five-day visit, also said that
China noticed the trade deficit Turkey is suffering in trade with
China and will take positive actions to reduce it gradually.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Turkey amounted to 700 million
U.S. dollars in 1998, marking a big increase from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing trade and
economic cooperation with Turkey, which is not only beneficial to
the development of the respective economy of the two countries,
but also helps deepen the mutual understanding and friendship
between China and Turkey, Li said.

HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The world short-course swimming
championships seemed to calm down into the third day with no new
world records smashed here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Swimmers rewrote five championship records Saturday after
breaking a string of five world records in the first two days of
the meet.
</P>
<P>
Australians, who stole the limelight in the past two days,
claimed none gold on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World record holder James Hickman set a championship record by
finishing the men's 200 meter butterfly at 1:52.71 on Saturday,
and claimed the gold. The British swimmer created a world record
of 1:51.76 in Paris last year.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Voelker of Germany snapped women's 50 meter backstroke
title within a time of 27.63 seconds, shaving 0.14 seconds off the
championship record set by Mai Nakamura in the morning heat.
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was to win tonight," said Voelker, who set
a world record of 27.27 in the event last December, "a world
record would have been a bonus but all I wanted to do was to win."
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jani Sievinen won the gold medal in men's 100 meter
individual medley and set a championship record of 54.18 seconds.
He holds a three-year-old world record of 53.10 seconds in the

<P>
After the competition, Sievinen said: "It was great to break a
record, and I am happy to win it."
</P>
<P>
The other two championship records were created by two Swedish
swimmers in the semi-finals Saturday. Johanna Sjoberg finished the
women's 100 meter butterfly at 57.78 seconds, 0.01 second better
than the edition set by American Jennifer Thompson in Goeteborg in
1997. In men's 100 meter freestyle semi-finals, Lars Frolander
touched 47.49 seconds, upgrading the previous mark of 47.74 set by
Fernando Scherer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Chen Hua, who took a gold in 800 meter freestyle on
Friday and is hot favorite to win the women's 400 meter freestyle
title, was disqualified in the final for "a foul start" though she
finished the second.
</P>
<P>
Nadejda Chemezova of Russia clinched the triumph in the race by
clocking 4:05.23.
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared before the race. During the warm-up I was
watching the Chinese girl and they looked like they were in really
good form, but during the race around the 250 meter mark I knew
that I could really go for it," said the Russian.
</P>
<P>
Inge De Bruijn of Holland upstaged American Jennifer Thompson
to claim the women's 50 meter freestyle gold. The Dutch European
champion surged away from the start and clocked 24.35 seconds to
touch clear of the American, who finished second in 24.57.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who took two golds on Friday, said: "I knew Inge
would win tonight."
</P>

Sweden was disqualified in women's 4x100m relay freestyle
finals, while China and the U.S. were both disqualified in the

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinian
students held a demonstration in Nablus Saturday, urging the
Yugoslav government to help end the Kosovo refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the students also urged the United States and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to stop immediately
their airstrikes against Yugoslavia, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, the
students from the Nablus University took to the streets and
voiced their concern about the safety of the Kosovo Albanians, who
were forced to leave their home towns and seek refuge in
neighboring Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We concerned about the hardships of the Kosovo Albanians
because they are our Muslim brothers and sisters and the parties
concerned should take immediate actions to end this crisis," the
radio quoted some students as saying.
</P>
<P>
The students sharply criticized NATO's military actions
against Yugoslavia, saying such military actions could not help
end the Kosovo crisis but force more Kosovars to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Nablus is one of the major Palestinian towns in the north of
the West Bank. So far, neither the Palestinian National Authority
nor any other Palestinian officials came out to comment about the
ongoing NATO's airstrikes, which entered its 11th day on
Saturday.

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the
University of Texas at Austin said that they use a sticky

</P>
<P>
Writing in the latest issue of Journal of Neuroscience,
George Bittner and his colleagues of the University said that
they applied a sticky solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to
the cut ends of nerve axons for a minute or two. They then
washed this solution off and finally soaked the nerve ends in
calcium salt solutions, and within minutes the nerves were
transmitting signals.
</P>
<P>
Their technique has worked in a range of animals from
crayfish to guinea pigs, they said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this technique may offer hope to the
paralyzed and others with nerve injuries.

Previously some scientists thought that nerve cells could not

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Saturday called on influential countries in the world to
help settle the Kosovo crisis through political efforts.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal in separate phone conversations with
his Vatican and Greek counterparts Jean-Louis Tauran and George
Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the military operation by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia, which was conducted
without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council, will not
be able to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said political negotiations are valuable and constructive
means to settle the crisis in the Balkans, according to the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
NATO began bombing Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24 after the
organization claimed diplomatic efforts were exhausted on solving
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that through regular contacts and cooperation,
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Vatican
will be able to help settle the crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced grave concern over the ongoing massacre,
displacement and ethnic cleansing of the Albanian Muslims in
Kosovo. Belgrade should respond positively to the call of the
international community to respect the rights of the Muslims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the OIC contact group is expected to hold
its session in Geneva Wednesday to seek ways of ending the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was planned after Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, who is also OIC chairman, last Wednesday called on
leaders of the Islamic countries to direct their efforts to help
put an end to the human disaster.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Leaves for Saudi Arabia on Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
left here Sunday for Saudi Arabia on a three-day state visit
aimed at amending bilateral ties affected by the 1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was expected to meet Saudi King Fahd to exchange
views on issues of mutual concern and discuss ways of
strengthening bilateral ties in all fields, Jordanian officials
said before the king`s departure.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told Jordanian reporters earlier this week that his
planned visit to Saudi Arabia would be a very important
opportunity for the two countries to discuss bilateral and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had been the largest donor country to Jordan
before the Gulf Crisis during which Jordan was found sympathetic
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh has suspended its annual economic aid of nearly 200
million U.S. dollars and cut its oil supply to Jordan after the
Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Currently Amman depends on Iraq as its only source for cheap
oil and oil products, and get some 90,000 barrels per day from
Baghdad under the United Nations oil-for-food agreement with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan`s Relations with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Iraq`s arch
Arab foes, have been warming up since February 7 when Abdullah
took the Jordanian throne hours after his father King Hussein
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials complained that Saudi Arabia had
failed to translate its financial aid pledges to the kingdom made
during Hussein`s funeral into concrete action.

<HEADLINE> French Communists Support Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (FCP)
has expressed its support to the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state in the territories, reported the Voice of
Palestine (VOP) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
FCP is the first European political party that openly embraces
Palestinian statehood, an ultimate objective of the star-crossed
Middle East peace process initiated early this decade.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian People Party in the West Bank city of Ramallah
received on Sunday a letter from the FCP, in which it says it
strongly supports the Palestinian people to declare an independent
state any time in the future, VOP said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the letter holds the Israeli government led by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for the current deadlock
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel, accusing the Palestinian side for not fulfilling its
commitments such as fighting terrorism, stopped implementing the
Wye peace agreement in late December.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, singed by Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat last October in Washington, asks Israeli to hand
over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's heads of government also adopted a
resolution in Berlin in March, expressing their support to the
right of self-determination of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also set a one-year time limit for Israel and
the Palestinians to finish the final-status talks and said Israel
would have no power to "veto" an independent Palestinian state in
the territories beyond the period.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said on many occasions that he would declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year, when the
five-year transitional period of the Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank now under its control in reprisal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat recently concluded his consultations over this issue
with some Arab and European nations and also held talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 23 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went to Jordan on Sunday to discuss the statehood issue
with the Jordanian leaders. He is scheduled to travel to Russia,
Turkey, China and Japan for the same purpose in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Russia Raps U.S. for Sanctions on Russian Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry Sunday
denounced the United States for imposing sanctions on three
Russian firms, which reportedly sold anti-tank missiles to Syria,
a nation on the so-called U.S. list of "terrorism sponsors."
</P>
<P>
This is an "unfriendly move" and Russia reserves the right to
take corresponding measures, said the ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as another strike on the bilateral relations
which is being tested by U.S.-led NATO military attack on
Yugoslavia, the ministry said the move clearly shows that the U.S.
is once again trying to replace international agreements with its
internal laws and demonstrating disrespect for international norms
and principles of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department Friday declared that it would ban
purchases from and exports to the Tula Design Bureau, the Volsk
Mechanical Plant and the Central Research Institute for Machine-
Tool Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly told the U.S. at official occasions that
"Russian-Syrian cooperation does not fall under any international
sanctions, does not go against any non-proliferation or export
control agreements, and doesn't disturb the balance of power in
the Middle East," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation cannot match the military cooperation of the U.
S. with other countries in this region no matter in terms of the
nature or the scale.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev denounced
the sanctions as groundless and said Russia would not back down
from contacts with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Second Night NATO Bombing Causes Heavy Damages in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The hospital of the Yugoslav
Military Medical Academy was damaged by powerful explosions in its
vicinity early Sunday in the second night of NATO air raids on
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Radoslav Svicevic, a psychologist of the hospital
located in the southeastern part of the Yugoslav capital, showed
reporters sections of one missile, which was manufactured on June
27, 1996, with the serial number of 14172-76B38064-1.
</P>
<P>
Shrapnels could be seen scattered inside the compound of the
hospital, one of the best in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The ceilings and the wall of one storage room on the second
floor underground were damaged by the shockwave of the four
explosions, bottles of medicines shattered on the ground.
</P>
<P>
On the same floor was the ward for intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
One of the glass panels of the canteen facing the detonations
on the fifth floor was totally smashed. Bits of broken glass
could be seen scattered on the balcony and the floor near the
radiators.
</P>
<P>
NATO missiles also hit a heating plant in new Belgrade at
around 04:35 (02:35GMT) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke could still be seen hovering over the plant at
around noon.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two cruise missiles hit two government buildings
in downtown Belgrade, or what is known as old Belgrade. One of
the buildings already collapsed due to the ensuing fire and
scorching heat.
</P>
<P>
Up till Saturday, NATO air strikes had been focusing on
military targets throughout the Balkan country. NATO bombing had
once been intended to hit an airfield outside the city of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Center of Belgrade did not give out any detail on
the casualties and damage to the heating plant.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the country also came under NATO airstrikes
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency reported that civilian targets in
Pancevo, Kraljevo and Cacak were attacked in the early hours.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, NATO aircraft fired two missiles on the
Beopetrol oil dump in Bogutovac, about 180 kilometers of Belgrade,
wounding two Beopetrol employees and a Bogutovac railway worker,
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
In Pancevo, four employees of a refinery were wounded in a NATO
air raid.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and seven wounded in a NATO bombing on
Cacak, a city 160 kilometers south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The main target of the 30-minute attack, which was launched at
03:17 (01:17GMT), was the Sloboda factory. Fifteen detonations
were heard in the town during the attack, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The plant was first attacked on March 28 and March 30, and 80
percent of the sprawling compound was destroyed in the two raids,
leaving 5,000 workers jobless and 20,000 people without source of
incomes.

<HEADLINE> UK's Cook Expects Libya to Hand Over Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Saturday that he was confident Libya would stick to
the agreed timetable for handing over the two 1988 Lockerbie
bombing suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard that the Libyan government intends to meet that
timetable. I am watching carefully over the weekend to make sure
that everything is in place for the handover," Cook told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain was ready to put the two on trial when they
arrive in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Final preparations for the handover of the Lockerbie bombing
suspects are under way before their trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Scottish police officers had already arrived in
the Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, ready to set a trial there for
the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
The suspects will be escorted by the UN's chief legal adviser,
Hans Corell, who left his New York home to escort them on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie in 1988, killing 270 people. The United States and
Britain accused two Libyan agents of responsibility to the bombing
and request their extradition to face charges.
</P>
<P>
After years of negotiations and pressure applied through United
Nations sanctions, Libya agreed to hand over the suspects by 6
April.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of an agreement reached with Libya's leader
Colonel Gaddafi, the men will be sent for trial before a unique
Scottish court of three judges at the Camp Zeist Airbase in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The base will become Scottish territory for the duration of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, which include flight and arms embargoes, will be
fully lifted 90 days later if the Libyans fully comply with U.N.
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Official Stresses Afforestation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese official today
called for greater efforts to increase China's forest cover to
over 19 percent and bring about a marked improvement in the
country's eco-environment in the forthcoming 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said the CPC Central Committee and
Central Government attach great importance to improving eco-
environment which is crucial to the subsistence and development of
the Chinese nation in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Significant achievements have been made in afforestation over
the past two decades, said Wen, also member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), in a speech at a recent plenary session of the National
Afforestation Committee, the copy of which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
Major achievements in afforestation include the building of the
"three-north" forest shelter belt in north China, the forest
protection network along the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze River and the forest belt along the coast.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the latest statistics, he said that 34.25 million
hectares of trees have been planted in the country, with the
current national average forest cover standing at 13.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice-premier pointed out that there are two major
problems challenging the national endeavor to improve eco-
environment.
</P>
<P>
According to him, no significant improvements have been made in
the situation of low forest and vegetation cover and decreasing
timber storage in quite a number of localities with poor natural
and ecological conditions.
</P>
<P>
In some other localities with growing economy and population,
no attention has been paid to protecting resources and environment,
which has led to decrease in vegetation, deteriorating soil
erosion and desertification, We said.

political resolution to the Yugoslav crisis and stressed that
Belarus morally has the right to provide Yugoslavia with military
aid.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko told the press in Minsk that Belarus is preparing to
put forward suggestions on ending NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia though the military alliance has always little trust in
his country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that constructive suggestion from any side to the
crisis should be given consideration for the current
international situation is in danger.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out, NATO's rejection of the proposal for
holding conducting constructive dialogue on the Yugoslav crisis,
initiated by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, shows that
it would accept no suggestions from Russia at all. This, said
Lukashenko, will destroy any step towards the solving of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' biggest concern now is to provide Yugoslavia with
humanitarian aid and many entrepreneurs are already moving quickly
in response to the government's relevant calls, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Although no country has lifted the arms embargo on Yugoslavia,
Belarus has the right to give it military aid because NATO's
aggression of Yugoslavia has rendered many international treaties
meaningless, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if NATO ground troops enter Yugoslavia,
NATO will suffer much more loss given the fact that Yugoslavia has
only mobilized 12 percent of its air force against the NATO
bombings.

<HEADLINE> France to Continue Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 4 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to continue the
participation in the NATO operation against Yugoslavia, while
sending an emergency aid to Kosovo refugees fleeing their homeland,
the government announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac expressed solidarity with NATO
allies in their strikes against Belgrade during the telephone
conversation with heads of state of the United States, Britain and
Germany over the weekend, according to the Elysee presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
In the conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the two
agreed that NATO should pursue with determination the military
action against the "repressive machine" of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and British Prime Ministers Tony Blair expressed their "
indignation in front of the gravity of the humanitarian situation
deliberately created by Serb forces," said officials of the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Kosovo "has reinforced the determination
of France and Britain to pursue the action in course," they said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the humanitarian situation of Kosovo
refugees calls for "an emergency and exceptional effort" to help
the tens of thousands of people who have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
Chirac Sunday called Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and expressed
his support to the German initiative in the name of the European
Union to mobilize and coordinate efforts to help Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said in an interview
published by the newspaper Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that
France will remain determined and will accentuate pressure on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
France is sending an emergency humanitarian aid to Kosovo
refugees in operation "Humanitarian Trident," with 40 tons of
tents and food rations for 5,000 people being sent each day.
</P>
<P>
Three helicopters and two transport aircraft of the French army
are shuttling between France and northern Albania to transport the
cargoes, said French officials.

<P>
The State Council, in a national plan concerning ecological
environment drafted last year, suggests that 50 years be used to
mobilize and organize all the people to step up protection of
natural forests, wild animals and plant resources.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for growing more trees, controlling soil
erosion, preventing and treating desertification, improving
ecological environment and production and living conditions, and
completing a group of key projects for reversing the trend of
worsening ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also urged that more efforts be made to
basically bring soil erosion under control, plant forests and
grass in all suitable land, restore degraded grassland and improve
ecological environment in most areas of the country by the middle
of next century.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2010, China will control soil erosion in an area
of 600,000 sq km, desertification in 22 million hectares of land
and degraded grassland in an area of 33 million hectares, while
adding 39 million hectares of forests, Wen said.

<P>
To realize the set goal for afforestation and solve the
problems, the vice-premier urged that nine principles be followed
in a bid to improve the nation's ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the nine principles, the entire society and people
should be mobilized to grow trees and grass, and forest should be
protected and managed according to law.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should continue to offer preferential
policies to farmers who plant trees and grass in barren hills and
land, while more training courses on afforestation should be held.
</P>
<P>
A unified plan for afforestation in localities should be made
and adhered to on a long-term basis regardless of the change of
local leaders, with efforts focused on key areas.
</P>
<P>
Equal emphasis should be placed on ecological improvement and
protection of resource environment, the combination of
afforestation with economic and social development, and the
introduction of a responsibility system among the Party and
government departments.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will be a century of ecological civilization,
the vice-premier said, adding that afforesting the nation's
territory and improving the ecological environment will be a
critical concern over the subsistence and long-term development of
the entire Chinese nation.

an end to the current Kosovo crisis and restore peace and

Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the statement said, the cabinet took note
of an order by Kuwaiti Emir Jaber to send urgent relief to the
Kosovar refugees who were forced out Kosovo as the massive NATO
air strikes against Yugoslavia continue.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees have been flooding
the neighboring countries of Yugoslavia, following 11 days of air
strikes by U.S.-led NATO forces.
</P>

The cabinet appealed to all human societies and charity
organizations in and outside Kuwait to provide every possible aid
to confront the tragic situation in the troubled region of Kosovo,

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Become World's Largest Aloe Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Southernmost China's Hainan
Province will become the world's largest aloe producer, according
to scientists attending an on-going symposium on aloe production
held here.
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the International Society of Aloe Science
regarded China and the Eastern Europe as the two major aloe
producers in the world, and they held that Hainan will become the
world's largest aloe producer if China increases investment and
steps up technical research.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is privileged with a suitable climate and fertile land
for aloe growing as well as developed transportation facilities,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The society has also reached an agreement with a local company
on a 200-million-yuan investment on development of aloe products
in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has become China's largest aloe producer with more than
200 hectares of aloe-growing lands.
</P>
<P>
There is a huge potential in the aloe market since the aloe
products have become more and more popular in medical and beauty
cultural uses, according to scientists from different countries.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts pointed out that aloe production and
processing of aloe products are at a primary level in China now
and attention must be paid to prevent irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and Specialists from the International Society of
Aloe Science including Gene Hale and Ray Henry are here to give
lectures on research of aloe production to their Chinese
colleagues at the request of the Hainan provincial department of
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs, experts and government officials from provinces
include Hainan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan
and Guangdong attended the three-day symposium.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has donated one
million U.S. dollars to Tanzania to alleviate food shortage in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Ambassador to Tanzania, Sten Rylander, said
Saturday that the donation is in response to the appeal to
international societies for food aid made by Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
Rylander said the funds will be channeled through the World
Food Program (WFP) as part of the program's emergency operation in
areas facing food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said since famine seems to occur annually in
certain regions of Tanzania, short-term measures of emergency food
distribution has to be combined with a long-term strategy to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Tanzania government to draw up a food strategy as
well as use the country's Strategic Grain Reserve in case of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
Rylander assured the Tanzanian prime minister of Sweden's
willingness to participate in the strategic planning if Tanzania
wants assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Tanzanians have been suffering from
hunger since a drought hit the country last October and resulted
in severe food shortage in most regions of the country, the WFP
said.

<P>
 KAMPALA, April 3 (xinhua) -- Thursday's sudden closure of
Uganda's Greenland Bank Limited (GBL) by the central bank will
surely affect the sales at the ongoing international trade fair at
Uganda Manufacturers' Association (UMA) show grounds, a senior
official from Uganda's chamber of commerce has said.
</P>
<P>
 Boney Katatumba, chairman of Uganda Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (UNCCI), said this in a press statement released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 He described the closure of GBL as unfortunate and untimely.
The decision by the Bank of Uganda to close the bank completely
will reduce the number of showgoers because many potentials
customers' money was trapped in the bank.
</P>
<P>
 Although the central bank had assured the 120,000 depositors
of the ill-fated bank that their money was safe, they rushed to
the bank's main branch on Kampala road demanding money on the eve
of long Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
the week-long trade fair opened Friday at low ebb although
its organizers said they were confident more customers would come
in due course.
</P>
<P>
The bank closure and the arrest of the bank's Managing
Director Sulaiman Kiggundu caused a stampede in the city; The
capital city's Crusader newspaper had to suspend publication due
to financial problms arising from the bank closure.
</P>
<P>
The GBL was closed for misanagement and large inside
lending. The central bank said that GBL made operational losses of
one billion shillings (one million U.S. dollars ) over the last
two months alone.

<HEADLINE> Japan Helps Tanzania Control Mercury Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Permanent secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and
Minerals, Patrick Rutabanzibwa, said in a statement here Saturday
that the ministry, in collaboration with the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), has been working on
a pollution-reducing project since last August.
</P>
<P>
Rutabanzibwa said the project addresses small-scale miners
around Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake,
by providing them with information and intensive training on
extracting gold without releasing mercury to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Mercury is used excessively in the region for recovering gold,
said Rutabanzibwa, noting that the Tanzanian government is paying
great attention to mercury's severe impact on human health and
environment.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning effect of mercury includes organic disfunctions
and irreversible neurological damages to human body.
</P>
<P>
Rutabanzibwa said the first phase of the project which has been
 completed focused on training some of the small-scale miners,
expecting them to pass the knowledge to others.
</P>
<P>
"The second phase aims at reaching the miners at their areas
and training them in the use of safe and efficient equipment for
mining and processing gold ores," he said, adding that emphasis
will be laid on mercury-free technologies which have been
successfully applied in other developing countries such as the
phillipines and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China will donate 200,000 U.S.
dollars to Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Foundation, according to diplomatic notes signed here Sunday by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
China's Ambassador to Indonesia Chen Shiqiu and Chairman of the
Board of Trustees of the ASEAN Ridzwan Dzafir signed the notes at
a ceremony held here. China's contribution to ASEAN was declared
last December.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Foundation, which was established on December 15,

initiative of ASEAN leaders and retains a relationship of close
cooperation with the ASEAN Standing Committee, the ASEAN
Secretariat and other ASEAN bodies.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the foundation is to assist ASEAN in its mission of
fostering a life of peace and prosperity for all the people of
ASEAN by contributing to ASEAN's development strategy of close
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Chen Shiqiu said at the ceremony that since

Fund operational budget for the crisis-hit countries and has
contributed over 4 billion U.S. dollars in total from its
reserves, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India, Nepal End Meeting on Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Bangladesh,
India and Nepal concluded here Sunday their two-day conference on
regional cooperation in harnessing the eastern Himalayan rivers by
adopting a five-point Kathmandu Declaration.
</P>
<P>
At the non-official meeting, the participants presented papers
on different subjects in harnessing the Ganges, Brahmaputra and
Meghna (GBM), which included possibilities of augmenting the lean
season flows of the Ganges, water-based integrated development of
the region and water quality in the region.
</P>
<P>
Other papers covered cooperation in flood disaster management,
the GBM region energy cooperation, seismic hazards and monitoring
in the region, dam safety, environmental consideration and
rehabilitation of displaced people, development of inland water
transport in the region and cooperation on the Teesta, one of the
tributaries to the Brahmaputra.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommended to the governments of the GBM region
to establish a suitable institutional framework, either under the
auspices of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
or otherwise, to further cooperation and collaboration in the GBM
region in sustainable water-based integrated development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal,
which formed the Growth Quadrangle for joint efforts in harnessing
the eastern Himalayan rivers, had met two times.
</P>
<P>
The conference suggested that due priority be given to the
enhancement of knowledge related to the multifarious dimensions of
water and its utilization, the building of capability within and
outside the official levels and the widening and deepening of
processes of consultation with and participation by all concerned,
emphasizing the values of transparency, stakeholder participation
and gender equity.
</P>
<P>
The conference strongly urged the people of the region and
their political leaders to look beyond the past and join hands
with trust and vision in planning prosperity together by taking
pragmatic initiatives and decision.
</P>
<P>
It also urged that in the utilization and management of water
resources, institutional and management aspects be given due
importance, and the primacy and centrality of the people
recognized, whose ultimate objective must remain poverty
alleviation and improvement in the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the Institute for Integrated
Development Studies in Kathmandu in cooperation with the
Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad in Dhaka and the Center for Policy
Research in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The participants resolved that the three non-governmental
organizations should continue to work, using all possible
mechanisms, at a non-official level to facilitate, accelerate,
supplement and deepen the inter-governmental processes.
</P>
<P>
The conference was the final dissemination conference as part
of the joint study undertaken by the three institutions.
</P>
<P>
The participants included politicians, academicians,
journalists, representatives of the private sector and experts
from Bangladesh, India and Nepal.

<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A ceramic exhibition named "Time
Capsules" by an Israeli artist Yael Fraiberg Atzmony opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Over ten simple ceramic pieces are on display, the shape of
which derives from descriptions in the Bible and archaeological
discoveries, according to Atzmony. However, the distinctive colors
and patterns endow the ceramics with a taste of modern time.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of hosting an exhibition in the motherland of
ceramics -- China, a place enjoying the most profound culture and
history in the world," said Atzmony.
</P>
<P>
Atzmony now teaches in Israel's most renowned Bezalel Academy
of Art and Design, and has several of her works collected, for
instance by the Picasso Museum in France.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pays Brief Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Amman Sunday to brief Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on his recent meetings with world leaders on the
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, King Abdullah reiterated Jordan's support
for the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, including
the establishment of an independent state, Radio Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
He called on parties concerned to abide by signed peace
agreements to revitalize the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
which remained deadlocked since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been accusing each other of
failing to implement the latest United States-brokered Wye River
agreement, which called for further Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank and Palestinian crackdown on anti-Israel terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Arafat also discussed ways of strengthening
bilateral cooperation, Radio Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been on a busy diplomatic agenda to visit Arab and
Western countries to rally support for his plan over Palestinian
statehood.
</P>
<P>
He had announced to declare an independent state on May 4, when
the interim period set in the 1993 Oslo Peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians expires.
</P>
<P>
But he was under mounting international pressure to postpone
the proclamation of the independent state to avoid further
complicating the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to annex part of the West Bank if the
Palestinians announce statehood unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Jordan along with Egypt have already said they would recognize
the Palestinian state whenever it is proclaimed, but stressed the
timing for the state is an "internal affair" of the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Noise Labeling to Become Compulsory in India Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Noise labeling showing the level
of noise produced will soon be made compulsory for appliances and
equipment from mixers to bulldozers, a senior official said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A decision to this effect has been taken recently by the
National Committee on Noise Control Board, committee chairman M.
L. Munjal said.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at forcing manufacturers to adopt noise
abatement technologies to produce appliances that would be quieter
and to enable consumers to buy products which are least noisy.
Noise pollution was a proven health hazard, he said.
</P>
<P>
The "no-noise" techniques developed at the Indian Institute of
Science had already been introduced in a new model of "Indica"
car.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A new opposition party, named
Parti
Keadilan Nasional or National Justice Party (KeADILan) was
launched here
Sunday by its president, Wan Azizah Ismail, wife of former deputy

<P>
The party is previously known as Ikatan Masyarakat Islam

Wan Azizah said the new party was not a splinter group of Umno

needs for
justice and reforms.
</P>
<P>
She said the task at hand now was to beef up the party and
welcomed

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Power Affects Bangladeshi Agriculture, Fishery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Loadshedding has become more
frequent in Bangladesh with the temperature on the rise, affecting
the country's agriculture and fishery.
</P>
<P>
The cultivation of the irrigational crops in the country has
been severely affected by the shortage of power. In Nawabganj,
some 240 kilometers northwest of here, parts of the paddy field
have dried up because of the absence of timely irrigation,
according to reports reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials there said a vast area in the district
was brought under irrigational rice cultivation this year, which
was to be fed with water from power-driven deep tube wells, to
make up the loss of crops sustained during last year's floods.
</P>
<P>
However, little rain over the country since November last year,
coupled with frequent loadshedding, has made the prospect of a
good harvest extremely unlikely, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
And in the 21 districts in southwestern Bangladesh's Khulna and
Barisal divisions, the daily supply of power was only 190 to 200
megawatts, far short of the required 360 megawatts, Power
Development Board sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of maunds of fish were rotting every day in the
coastal districts because the fish could not be preserved for want
of ice, said fishermen and fish traders, who were among those
worst hit.
</P>
<P>
They added that they were losing millions of taka daily as a
result of insufficient supply of power. Ice factory owners also
complained, saying that irregular power supply had kept ice
factories in the region inoperative for days.
</P>
<P>
The peak-hour requirement is 2,300 megawatts in this South
Asian nation against the available power generation capacity of
1,900-2,000 megawatts.

<HEADLINE>   $1.3-Million Property Lost to Fire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Goods worth over three billion Kwacha (about
1.3 million U.S. dollars) were destroyed by fire gutting a warehouse here
Saturday, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the goods destroyed are deep freezers, fridges, mattresses,
cookers, videos and hi-fi music systems.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigade battled with the fire that started around 11 hours and went
on until later afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was yet to be established but a Supreme Furnishers
source has suspected arson, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
"We suspect our competitors because they don't like it that we are
offering them stiff competition," the source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
But general manager of the firm Smart Mwitwa said he can't comment
now.
</P>
<P>
Another director at the firm which owns the premises, a Mrs. Clonell,
angrily chased away pressmen from the scene.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of property has been damaged and all you are interested in is
getting news," she said.

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Kosovo Refugees Die in Kukes, Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 Kosovo refugees have
died from starvation and cold weather in the Albanian town of
Kukes, Albanian newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official figures released by Albania show that 165,000 and
55,000 Kosovo refugees had entered Albania and Macedonia
respectively since NATO launched air raids on Serbian targets on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 refugees were staying in the small Albanian town
of Kukes, which found it helpless in providing food and
accommodation for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
In the litter-strewn main square, refugees wait for buses,
trucks, cars and horse-drawn carts to transport them further into
Albania, further away from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, which had already received 55,000 Kosovo refugees,
was expecting more refugees as 50,000 Kosovars were waiting to
enter the country at the Bllace checkpoint on its border with
Kosovo, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Seven of them had died recently, a Macedonian news agency
report said.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov held an emergency meeting on
Saturday, at which it was decided to limit the number of Kosovo
refugees who would be allowed to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Kiprijanova said
Saturday at a press conference that the influx of Kosovo refugees
will threaten security and public order in Macedonia and cause an
economic collapse and political turmoil.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Kerry McCoy gave the United
States the title at the World Cup Wrestling after pinning Iran's
Ebrahim Mehraban in the final heavyweight match here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
McCoy pinned Mehraban after 1:03 to cap the United States' 4-0
finish in the two-day, round-robin event.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which finished 3-1, finished in the second spot while
Cuba (2-2) was third, with Germany (1-3) and Canada (0-4) taking
the final two positions.
</P>
<P>
Under the tournament format, the five teams competed in a
series of dual meets over two days. The teams were chosen based on
the performance of their wrestlers at the World Championships last
September in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Six teams were supposed to compete, but the defending champion
Russian team did not arrive. The conflict in Kosovo led to the
closure of the U.S. embassy in Moscow, and the wrestlers' visas
were inside the embassy and could not be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dominated the World Cup in the 1990s,
winning seven of nine team titles, including Saturday's victory.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Australians Protest Outside US Consulate-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- About 500 Serbian Australians
protested Sunday outside the United States Consulate General
building in Melbourne, the second in two days.
</P>
<P>
Placards and banners, as at past demonstrations, likened
United States President Bill Clinton to Hitler.
</P>
<P>
A police spokeswoman told the Australian Associated Press that
bricks and other items were thrown but there had been no arrests.
</P>
<P>
The protest was the third outside the inner city building since
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began.
</P>
<P>
During last Sunday's protest by about 6,000 Serbians windows
were also smashed when bricks and rocks were thrown, but on
Saturday just one egg was thrown by some of the 1,000 protesters
after pleas from Serbian leaders for non-violent protest.
</P>
<P>
Eggs were again thrown Sunday, while speakers blamed the exodus
of refugees from Kosovo on the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Serbians also rallied Saturday in support of
Yugoslavia in Brisbane, the third largest city of Australia.

<HEADLINE> Hendra-like Virus Under Control in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Health and Environment
Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said that Singapore has managed to contain
the import of the Hendra-like virus, according to a report
released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yeo told reporters at a community event that the situation in
Singapore has stabilized, mainly because the government had
implemented a ban on the import of live pigs.
</P>
<P>
He said the ban, beginning from March 19, would be lifted once
the government is confident the viral outbreak in Malaysia has
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Those who were affected at the start of the viral outbreak in
Singapore were people who worked at abattoirs, said Yeo, adding
that other Singaporeans were not at risk of contracting the virus.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also urged Singaporeans to switch to chilled or frozen pork
sold at descent outlets.
</P>
<P>
The Hendra-like virus, along with Japanese encephalitis which
was first detected in Malaysia in October, has killed at least 80
Malaysians and one Singaporean.
</P>
<P>
Singaporeans have turned to alternatives such as chicken and
beef other than pork for fear of contracting the pig disease, thus
leading to higher chicken prices and the disappearance of pork in
the markets.
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the newly-detected virus except that it
is similar to the Hendra virus, a member of the Paramyxo family,
which caused the deaths of two people and 15 horses in Australia
in 1994-95.

<HEADLINE> Forty-three Filipinos Get Death in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Forty-three persons, including a
woman, were meted out death sentences in March, bringing to 990
the total number of inmates on death row, the Citizens' DrugWatch
Foundation reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 43, DrugWatch said 16 were convicted of rape, 12 of
murder, 10 of kidnapping for ransom, four of robbery with homicide
and one of parricide.
</P>
<P>
Senator Loren Legarda, DrugWatch executive council member, said
that among those who drew death verdicts last month were a
29-year-old woman who, aided by two male cousins, strangled and
stabbed to death her husband in Quezon City, and a former security
guard who raped and then killed a 13-year-old schoolgirl in
Malolos Bulacan.
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced to death last month, Legarda said, were a
30-year- old man who murdered a family of three, including a
four-month-old infant, in Cabanatuan City, and two men who
massacred and robbed another family of three, including a
seven-year-old boy, in Malolos, Bulacan.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said the latest convicts also include eight men who
kidnapped a three-year-old son of a Chinese-Filipino trader in
Paranaque City and two men who killed a policeman during a robbery
of a passenger bus at the North Expressway in Plaridel, Bulacan.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said death row now has 541 convicted rapists, 59 of
whom killed their victims.

<HEADLINE> Libya Invites Arabs to Witness Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Libya has invited Arab dignitaries
to witness the handover of two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie
bombing, an Arab League official said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Assistant Secretary General Ahmed Ben Heli told
reporters that the league's delegation would fly later in the day
to Tunisia's airport of Jerba, from where they would be driven to
the Libyan capital Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Ben Heli would represent Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid in the delegation.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Algeria, Egypt, Mauritania, Morocco, Syria
and Tunisia would also attend the handover of the suspects to a
United Nations representative, he said.
</P>
<P>
The six Arab countries formed a contact group set up by the
league in 1992 to help negotiate a solution to the Lockerbie
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi, have been accused by the United States and Britain of
bombing the Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988,
killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya agreed last week to surrender the two suspects by April 6
to a court in the Netherlands to stand trial under Scottish law
after receiving guarantees for a fair trial for the suspects.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu's Visit to Promote Sino-U.S. Ties: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Part One)
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit of Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji to the United States will provide an important
opportunity for further promoting the development of relations
between the two countries, Chinese Ambassador to the United States
Li Zhaoxing said here on the eve of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Li, in an interview with Chinese newsmen here, expressed his
confidence that with joint efforts of both sides, Premier Zhu's
visit will be a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's visit, scheduled for April 6 to 14 at the invitation of
President Bill Clinton, will help enhance the mutual understanding
between the two countries and peoples, expand cooperation of
mutual benefit and boost their constructive strategic partnership,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that during the visit, Zhu will discuss
with Clinton bilateral relations as well as international and
regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The premier will also meet other U.S. leaders and
representatives from various walks of life, and visit some
institutions of economy, finance, research, education and culture.
In addition, he will also co-chair the second Sino-U.S. Conference
on Environment and Development with U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since the two countries established diplomatic
ties 20 years ago, Sino-U.S. bilateral relations have gone through
ups and downs but have progressed in general.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a successful state
visit to the United States when heads of the two states decided to
set up a constructive strategic partnership between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's visit to China in 1998, the U.S. president
reiterated America's commitment to the principles in the three
communiques governing Sino-U.S. ties and the "three No's" policy
on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that a good Sino-U.S. relationship is in the
common interest of the two peoples," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past two years, the two countries have
cooperated effectively on the extension and signing of the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
and played a crucial role in trying to prevent a nuclear arms race
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also had close consultations on dealing with
the Asian financial crisis and played an active role in
stabilizing the situation on the Korean peninsula, fighting
international terrorism and trans-national crimes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that there exist some differences
between China and the United States, especially over non-
interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
We maintained that international disputes should be resolved
peacefully in line with the spirit of the U.N. Charter and on the
basis of generally recognized norms of international relations,
rather than resorting to force or threatening to use force, he
said. China opposes any interference in other countries' internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On trade relations between the two countries, the ambassador
said, the United States has become China's second largest trade
partner and China is the fourth largest trade partner of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has funded 26,000 projects in China with a
total contract investment of over 45.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade ties are mutually beneficial as U.S. export to China
provides about 300,000 jobs for American people and China's export
to the United States generates one million jobs. Cheap but quality
Chinese commodities help American consumers save about 10 billion
dollars each year, the ambassador said quoting international
observers.
</P>
<P>
China's 1998 trade surplus with the United States was about 21
billion dollars while the United States put the figure as high as
57 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many factors contribute to the difference, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the calculation methods adopted by China and the
United States are different. The United States includes
commodities exported from Hong Kong and their added value when
calculating its trade volume with China but China does not. What
is more important, the United States has imposed restrictions on
export to China, depriving some U.S. companies of access to China
market.

(Part Two)
</P>
<P>
On the so-called "China Threat" drummed up by some U.S. media,
the ambassador said, "Our top priority is economic construction,
which requires a long-term peaceful environment. What China hates
to see is war, threat of war and tense situation."
</P>
<P>
China's defense policy is defensive, and its defense budget,
which equals to only about three percent of that of the United
States, is the lowest among all the big countries, the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
China cut its armed forces by one million years before the end
of Cold War, and another half million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China needs peace, loves peace and is willing to co-exist
peacefully with all other countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the alleged "theft of U.S. nuclear technology", Li said it
has almost become a rule that whenever the Sino-U.S. relations go
smoothly, some forces in the United States will be unhappy and try
to stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said all exchanges between China and the United
States are conducted in accordance with bilateral agreements. The
exchange and cooperation between the concerned labs of the two
countries, which were undertaken at the U.S. request in the 1990s,
followed the principles of equality, mutual benefit and
transparency.
</P>
<P>
Now even some American scientists pointed out that the so-
called "spy case" is propaganda with ulterior motives in American
party politics, and is an insult to Chinese scientists and also a
show of chauvinism of arrogance and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. decision to study the inclusion of Taiwan into the
Theater Missile Defense System (TMD), Li said that it is a show of
the Cold-War mentality.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the Taiwan issue is
China's internal affairs and no foreign country has the right to
meddle in, said the Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has always been the most important and most
sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations and the three communiques
governing Sino-U.S.relations have provided the guiding principles
for properly dealing with this issue, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations will develop on a healthy and stable
footing only if these principles are strictly abided by, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Tibet issue, Li said that as early as 600 years before
Texas 1845), Oregon (1846), New Mexico and Utah (1848 California (
1850 were included into the United States, Tibet became an
inalienable part of the Chinese territory and China exercised its
sovereignty effectively on Tibet ever since.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. politicians try to interfere in China's internal
affair, infringe on China's sovereignty and destabilize China by
supporting Dalai Lama's activities aimed at splitting China, the
Chinese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
On why the United States intensified its attack on China's
human rights condition, Li said that this is because China's human
rights condition is improving as the country is growing stronger
day by day.
</P>
<P>
Anti-China forces in the United States resorted to fabrication
and smear campaign, and even indulged in open confrontation with
China though they knew it would lead to nowhere, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government always respects the general
purport of promoting and protecting human rights and basic freedom
as advocated by the U.N. Charter the relevant international human
rights instruments.
</P>
<P>
China protects human rights and basic freedoms of its people in
accordance with its own constitution and relevant laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has joined two more international conventions on human
rights than the United States does, Li Zhaoxing said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the two countries that have stayed
out of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children and
one of the few countries left without joining the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the United States urged China time and again to
ratify the International Convention on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the International Convention on Civil and
International Rights signed one or two years ago, exposing the
ridiculous double standards adopted by the United States on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not ratified the International Convention
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which it signed 22 years
ago.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Poverty Eradication Program Targets Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said has said that his administration's poverty eradication
program is targeting the countryside in view of the rural poor's
rising poverty index.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremonies of the Regional Dialogue on
Services for the Urban Poor in the Presidential Palace, Estrada
said three government agencies are at the forefront of the
strategy to eradicate -- not just alleviate -- poverty by
modernizing the countryside and attaining food security.
</P>
<P>
These are the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian
Reform, and Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said these departments will spearhead agricultural
modernization "within the context of sustainable development,
provide low-cost mass housing, ensure active participation of
local government units, private sector and the people themselves,
and protect the poor against crime and violence."
</P>
<P>
Although the national poverty index went down to 32.1 percent
as of December 1997, the rural poor poverty index actually
increased during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To counterbalance this inequity, we will modernize the
agriculture and fishing industry," Estrada said. "Advanced and
more efficient tools and implements will be provided, as well as
modern technology and skills will be adopted to increase better
production."
</P>
<P>
The president said his administration is "abandoning the usual
theories of 'trickle down and cascade effect' because these start
from the top and hardly reach the poor."
</P>
<P>
"The government will pursue a poverty eradication program and
not merely poverty alleviation. The administration will press to
eradicate absolute poverty and cut the gap between the rich and
the poor," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Needs to Pay off Billions in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran needs to pay off 5.63 billion
U.S. dollars of its arrears in the new Iranian calendar year which
started on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Iran's total foreign debts stood at 11.815 billion dollars in
the 11th month of the last Iranian year, according to a report
from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).
</P>
<P>
Iran failed to pay off its due debts of 3.395 billion dollars
in the past Iranian year, because its oil incomes dropped by some
3 billion dollars from the budget projection as a result of the
sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
So far the Iranian authorities have not announced the
country's oil incomes in the past Iranian year, but oil experts
put the figure around 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CBI Governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh said in February that
Tehran had reached agreements with its trade partners to
reschedule two billion U.S. dollars of its debts.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country had received a new credit of 1.3
billion dollars to ease the financial pressures on the government
caused by the fall in oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Rebels to Release Hostages as Promised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government warned
Sunday that it will resume military operations against a rebel
group if it fails to release the five abducted military and police
officers before April 19 as promised.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Front (NDF) promised earlier that it
would release the hostages any time between March 22 and April 19,
following talks between an independent third-party group and NDF
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Their deadline is April 19, and hopefully, they may release
one hostage tomorrow. They release them one by one," President
Joseph Estrada told reporters here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that if the rebel group breaks its promise the
government will resume military operations after April 19.
</P>
<P>
One police inspector and three military officers, including one
brigadier general, were abducted by the rebels in the past two
months, while one military officer was taken captive a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that his government is ready to resume the formal
peace talks as long as the rebels show sincerity in pursuing the
peace process by effecting the safe and unconditional release of
the officers.
</P>
<P>
The government indefinitely suspended formal peace talks with
the rebel group following the abduction of military and police
officers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Keeping Single-digit Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- With the inflation rate finally
tapering off to single digit in February, the Philippine
government is confident it will be able to keep inflation to an
average of 8-9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The February inflation rate slowed to 9.9 percent for the first
time in nearly a year, raising hopes that the surge in consumer
prices has abated, hopefully for good.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) traced the
downturn in the inflation rate largely to the stabilizing food
prices, particularly of rice, the nation's main staple.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the slowdown, the PMS noted, inflation rate rose to
double digit -- 10.3 percent in May 1998 and 11.6 percent in
January 1999 -- based on the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
One encouraging note in the government's price stabilization
drive is the fact that for the whole of 1998, the inflation rate
averaged at 9 percent, slightly lower than the 9.75 projection, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of inflation, which in layman's language is
defined as the continued rise in price levels, was attributed
largely to the El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena and the
depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the National Food Authority observed that
the price of rice has remained stable in the first quarter due to
adequate stock inventory and improved distribution of the staple
under the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
Director General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and
Development Authority said earlier the government hopes to keep
inflation within single-digit this year, possibly within the 8-9
percent range.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the Estrada administration is confident that
inflation will continue to taper off in the years ahead as the
government productivity enhancement programs ordered by President
Estrada in both agriculture and industry continue to take hold.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the ultimate response to the inflation problem is
to improve productivity and do away with supply scarcities that
cause consumer prices to rise.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Gives Closure Orders to Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police on Sunday handed
over closure orders to three Palestinian office in East Jerusalem
for their "close cooperations" with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The three Palestinian offices asked to be shut down are the
office of the Palestinian News Agency, the Palestinian Prisoners
Society and an office in charge of Christian affairs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Monday during a high-level meeting of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this decision of the Israeli government, Minister
of the Jerusalem Affairs of the PNA Faisal Husseini said that no
matter what happens, the Orient House and other Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem will function as usual and remain open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
The PNA sharply criticized this decision on Thursday, terming
it as "aggressive measures against Palestinian national institutions
in East Jerusalem" and "a challenge to international legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
This decision of the Israeli government was taken due to the
increased palestinian political and diplomatic activities in East
Jerusalem and such a motive was apparently aimed at thwarting such
Palestinian activities there.
</P>
<P>
Last week, foreign diplomats based in Jerusalem were invited
to a meeting in the Orient House to be briefed on the current
development in the Mideast peace process despite Israel's strong
objections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, diplomats from the European Union nations
stationed in Jerusalem were asked again to the Orient House
and the Palestinian officials there expressed their gratitude to
them for the EU's support to the right of self-determination
of the Palestinian people in declaring an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
EU rejects Israel's claim that Jerusalem is Israel's sovereign
capital, saying the Jerusalem issue, under the related resolutions
of the United Nations and the Oslo Accords, should be settled
through final-status talks between Israelis and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Skies Less Friendly to Israeli Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has changed its policy of
allowing Israeli civilian aircraft to fly to and from southern
Israel by using a route over the Jordanian territory.
</P>
<P>
In a further sign of deterioration of bilateral aviation ties,
a planned March visit to Israel by a Jordanian delegation over
aviation matters failed to take place, the Ha'aretz daily reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's foreign affairs and transport ministries are now
operating through diplomatic channels to persuade Amman to resume
a tacit air traffic arrangement between the two countries that
existed until late Jordanian King Hussein's death.
</P>
<P>
Under King Hussein's reign, Israeli civilian aircraft flying
between central Israel and Eliat in the south were allowed to fly
over Jordan, using a route known as J-10, when there was heavy
traffic on the Israeli flight route in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flight route becomes particularly overloaded when
the Israeli air force carries on exercises, and the tacit
arrangement allowed Israel's civilian aircraft to use the
alternative Jordanian route at such times.
</P>
<P>
Israel failed to institutionalize the arrangement with King
Hussein after Abdullah Bin Hussein stepped to the Jordanian throne.
</P>
<P>
Israeli aviation officials have expressed concern over the new
Jordanian stance for fear that there will be a freeze in aviation
ties between the two countries.

it failed to do so.

WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Kendall Gill tied an NBA record
with 11 steals and recorded his first triple-double in more than
three years as the New Jersey Nets posted an 88-77 victory over
the slumping Miami Heat tonight in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Gill tied the league mark set by Larry Kenon of the San Antonio

his triple-double since December 12, 1995 as a member of the
Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
Keith Van Horn had 27 points and 10 rebounds and Stephon
Marbury added 21 for New Jersey, which has won consecutive games
for the first time this season and improved to 4-7 under interim
coach Don Casey.
</P>
<P>
Van Horn was just 6-of-24 from the field, but 15-of-15 from the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
The Heat have lost four in a row for the first time since April
2-8, 1996 and fell 2 1/2 games behind first-place Orlando in the
Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey posted its first win in three meetings with the Heat
this season. Miami ripped the Nets 102-76 in the previous game on
March 14, leading to the firing of former New Jersey coach John
Calipari.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Olympic hero Somluck
Kamsing won the featherweight gold medal and the trophy for best
boxer as the 21st National Boxing Championships of the country
drew to a close in the northern province of Nakhon Sawan on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post reported Sunday that Vorapoj Petchkum, who won
the flyweight gold, received the best rookie award of 5,000 baht (
135 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Royal Thai Army team's total of 54 points ensured that they
won the team award of 100,000 baht (2,702 dollars), with the Royal
Thai Navy team following with 50 points and 50,000 baht (1,351
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Atlanta gold medallist Somluck had at first promised 500,000
baht(13,513 dollars) to anyone who could beat him and then
subsequently upped the amount to one million baht (27,027 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sithipong Jantasit from the northeastern Khon Kaen province had
the chance to pick up the massive bonus on Saturday but he had a
height disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
Somluck said after the match that the fight was quite
comfortable for him. "But I had to do my best as I did not want to
pay out one million baht," the Bangkok Post quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the battle of the welterweight category, Chakr won the gold
medal.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Unjustified: Australian Peace Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian peace campaigners
Sunday condemned NATO bombing in Yugoslavia, describing it as
unjustified, illegal and responsible for the humanitarian crisis
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Denis Doherty, a spokesman for the Australian Anti-Bases
Coalition (AABCC), an umbrella group for more than 90
Australia-based action groups including environmental, student and
trade union groups, also called on the Australian government to
immediately recall Australian troops involved in NATO action in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for NATO bombing, and therefore
there is no justification for any Australian Defense Force
personnel to be involved, regardless of how indirectly that
involvement is," Doherty told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Australian government to dissociate our country
from the illegal bombing of a sovereign country which is being
conducted without United Nations' sanction and is contrary to
international law,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Doherty said the NATO action was directly responsible for the
humanitarian crisis in Yugoslavia and condemned recent bombing of
infrastructure there.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's one accomplishment in this region has been to cause a
massive humanitarian catastrophe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Further violations of international law are now being
inflicted with the bombing of infrastructure such as bridges,
water, electricity and sewerage plants," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Every humanitarian government must now call on the U.S. and
NATO states to cease their illegal bombing of Yugoslavia," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The peace movement declares that Australian government support
for this military outrage, which has more to do with American and
European political interests than genuine humanitarian concerns,
is not in our name," Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 Australian Defense Force personnel stationed with
British or American units in Europe on exchange.

<P>
QINGDAO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao, the port city in east
China's Shandong Province, has just set up a private technology
industrial park to increase the private economy.
</P>
<P>
The Yinhe New Technology Co. and 11 other individually-owned
businesses have already moved to the park.
</P>
<P>
The 2-sq km Qingdao Private Technology Industrial Park is in
the state-level Qingdao High-Tech Industry Zone, which is home to
613 overseas-funded enterprises with a total of close to 1.5
billion U.S. dollars worth of investment contracts.
</P>
<P>
The new park is open to all industries and projects that meet
central Government regulations. The local government has announced
a series of preferential policies for land use and tax breaks to
encourage individuals and private enterprises to come.
</P>
<P>
All private enterprises in China came under joint ownership
with the State in the 1950s and did not emerge again until the
late 1970s when the government began its reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
In March of this year, China's lawmakers added the self-
employed and private business sector to the Chinese Constitution
as an important component of the country's socialist market
economy.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Manila Seeks Ways to Keep PAL Flying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said here Sunday that his administration is studying easier terms
for Philippine Airlines (PAL) to pay off its 237 million peso (6.2
million U.S. dollars) of debts to the government in a bid to keep
the airline flying.
</P>
<P>
The government's main concern now is to make sure that PAL
continues to operate to prevent disruption of businesses
throughout the country, Estrada told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is for PAL to continue flying. If PAL stops,
it affects not only big businesses but small ones as well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
might consider deferring the collection of PAL's 237 million peso
obligation to the government.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the government would collect immediately.
Perhaps the SEC may consider extending the term of the loan, or
find ways to restructure it so that PAL could continue to
operate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Estrada said, PAL must continue to fly because it is
the nation's flag carrier, and holds the distinction of being
Asia's first commercial airline.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old PAL owes the government an outstanding balance
of 236.9 million pesos, excluding interest and guarantee fees.
</P>
<P>
The interim rehabilitation receiver of PAL submitted its
revised rehabilitation plan to the SEC on March 15. The plan is
now under review by some 9,000 of PAL's creditors all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
The major creditors, such as the European Export Credit
Agencies and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which account for two
thirds of PAL's 2.2 billion dollars of debt, have given
conditional approval for the plan.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has until April 15 to decide on whether or not to
approve PAL's rehabilitation plan, or to order the airline's
liquidation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Closes Five Border Places With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has closed the border in
five districts with Myanmar following the killing of nine Thai
villagers, Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the border in Mae Ai, Fang, Chaiprakarn, Chaiang
Dao and Wiang Hae districts was intended to halt cross-border
travel of people of the two countries until the situation has
returned to normal, Thailand's Third Army Region was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The nine Thai villagers were killed last week near the border
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Thai border officials as saying the
killings took place in an area notorious as a drugs transit route
used by ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the nine men were captured by people allegedly
belonging to the Wa drug group in Myanmar before they were killed.
Their bodies were found in the Fang district of Chiang Mai
province in northern Thailand, about three kilometers from the
border.
</P>
<P>
But Lt-Gen. Sommai Vichavorn, the regional army commander, said
it was too early to point an accusing finger at any particular
group of people for perpetrating the murder. He said it might be
possible that the villagers were killed because they accidentally
stumbled on the drug caravan.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Faces Malnutrition of Mothers: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 4 (Xinhua) -- One out of every three Sri Lankan
mothers suffers from malnutrition while one out of five babies
records a low birth weight, said a latest research carried out by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's health indicators show a high standard in
nourishment and infant mortality. Yet, compared with other nations
in South Asia, malnourishment among mothers and low birth weight
among babies deserve immediate action, said the research.
</P>
<P>
Mothers usually suffer from difficulties during pregnancy and
deliver low birth weight babies as a result of malnourishment.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to low level of iron in the blood and iodine
deficiencies, two out of three Sri Lankan mothers are suffering
from anemia," said Coline Glennie, UNICEF representative in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Glennie said that unlike other health problems, malnutrition
was not visible.
</P>
<P>
"It slowly and silently takes its toll, causing much damage to
healthy growth and development of babies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Glennie said that low weight babies are vulnerable to various
infections and they are unable to grow up according to normal
growth patterns.
</P>
<P>
They are also prone to chronic diseases in later life such as
heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Out of one million children under three years of age in Sri
Lanka, more than one in three are underweight for their age," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To create an awareness among the public on the need to uplift
nutrition levels, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health and the UNICEF
declared a National Nutrition Week under the theme of "Better
birth weight, better life" which ended on March 28.
</P>
<P>
During the week, educational programs were carried out in
schools islandwide to target children, which amount to 25 percent
of the total population of 18.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Australia Slaughters Chickens to Contain Fatal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- About 27,000 chickens are being
slaughtered by farmers on the central coast of Australia's New
South Wales state in a bid to contain an outbreak of Newcastle
disease, a highly infectious disease which causes rapid death in
birds.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities began the slaughter of 27,000 birds on an
infected property to control the disease Saturday with more than
8,000 birds killed on the same day and the rest expected to be
destroyed Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio said the outbreak
would cause millions of dollars in losses in production or exports
as some countries may impose temporary ban on imports of
Australian chickens and their products.
</P>
<P>
China banned the import of chickens and their products from
Australia last year following an outbreak of the disease in the
state.
</P>
<P>
But the state's Department of Agriculture said Sunday the
disease was contained.
</P>
<P>
None of the 27 poultry farms tested for the fatal disease
returned a positive result, New South Wales chief veterinary
officer Dick Jane said.
</P>
<P>
The highly contagious viral disease was positively diagnosed
Thursday at the Mangrove Mountain pullet-rearing farm of Frank
Pirovic and Sons.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jane said the farm would be banned from trading for three
months while it underwent strict monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring the disease status of nearby poultry flocks will
continue, to make sure there has been no spread of the virus," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There were three outbreaks of Newcastle disease in the state
last year.
</P>
<P>
The disease was discovered at three separate farms, including
two in the Sydney area.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missiles Hit Power Station in New Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO missiles attacked a power
station in Novi Belgrade at around 04:35 (02:35 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Flames as high as 30 meters could be seen shooting upward and a
thick pall of smoke blocked the view of the moon.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and ambulances with medical teams were seen
rushing to the scene of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Fire was raging against the backdrop of two tall chimneys,
three vulcanization towers and some cranes inside the plant.
</P>
<P>
Police have blocked access to the plant.
</P>
<P>
This was the second direct attack on the capital of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two cruise missiles hit two government buildings
in downtown Belgrade, known as Old Belgrade. One of the
buildings already collapsed due to the ensuing fire and scorching
heat.
</P>
<P>
Up until Saturday, NATO air strikes had been focusing on
military targets throughout the Balkan country. NATO bombing once
tried to hit an airfield outside the city of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Center of Belgrade did not reveal details on
casualties and damage to the power station.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the country also came under NATO air attack
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency reported that civilian targets in
Pancevo, Kraljevo and Cacak were attacked in the early hours.
</P>
<P>
An electricity-generating station in Pancevo, a police academy
in Banjica and a military facility in Topcider were hit, Tanjug
said, quoting emergency centers.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
At around 03:17 local time (01:17 GMT) NATO attacked Cacak, a
city about 160 kilometers south of Belgrade. Twelve blasts were
heard, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
It said the Sloboda household appliances plant, which was
attacked on March 28 and March 30, again came under NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
When more than 100 foreign reporters visited the site on March
31, the general manager said 80 percent of the sprawling plant was
destroyed in the first two attacks, leaving 5,000 workers jobless
and 20,000 people without source of incomes.

<HEADLINE> Over 80,000 People Protest Against NATO in Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 80,000 people from all
parts of Italy held rallies and demonstrations here on Saturday
afternoon to protect against NATO's bombardment on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, organized by the Italian Communists' Party,
Green Party and trade unions, started from the Rome's Central
Republic Plaza and ended at the city's south gate of St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
Waving banners saying "Stop the War" and carrying a two-meter
puppet of Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema holding a cruise missile
in his hand, protesters shouted slogans condemning the government
for taking part in the NATO action.
</P>
<P>
When demonstrators arrived at the street of Celio Vibenna near
Rome's famous Colosseum, about two thousands of participants lay
down in the street in a mock death for 5 minutes in protest of
NATO bombing on Belgrade Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Protesters then gathered at the gate of St. Paul to hear
speeches by public figures representing different groups united by
the peace cause.
</P>
<P>
The former veteran Communist Pietro Ingrao in his speech asked
all Italian social forces to join in the peace protesting
movements to stop the war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in the Italian northern city of Milan, about 200
Serbs gathered outside the U.S. consulate to shout their anger
against Washington's major role in the NATO's attacks against
Yugoslavia.

<P>
In northeastern Italy about 500 people marched to the gates of
the Aviano NATO air-base, from which many of the bombing flights
to Yugoslavia departed.
</P>
<P>
Protesters sprayed anti-American slogans on the outside walls
of the U.S. Air Force offices in Aviano NATO air-base.

<HEADLINE> International Auto Show Opens In New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 New York International
Automobile Show opened here Saturday with innovation in styling,
quality and safety for public test.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 of the most innovative new vehicles on the market
are displayed at the Jacob Javits Convention Center. About one
million people are expected to visit the show, which will last
until April 11.
</P>
<P>
"This year, we're thrilled to celebrate the show's 99th
anniversary," said John LaSorsa, chairman of the Auto Show
Committee. "We promise some exciting glimpses into the future and
some fond memories from the past."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. auto industry has been brilliant because of the
booming economy in the past 8 years. The total new-vehicles market
has stayed over 15 million units in the country for the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
Ford and other car makers in the world introduced midsize cars
to compete in the American market, where close to 100 billion U.S.
dollars are sold each year in this market segment. Ford unveiled
the new Taurus in an effort to avoid violating Federal fuel-
economy laws and meet consumers' demand.
</P>
<P>
James O'Conner, Ford's president for Ford brand cars and light
trucks, said the company offered the comfort, competitive price
and numerous safety features that consumers want in midsize cars.
"More than the styling, it's the total package: quality, value,
safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ford, G.M., Nissan and other auto makers also show sport
utility vehicles with open pickup-truck beds at back. Soaring
sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans, pickups and crossover
vehicles in recent years have produced a wave of innovation in
these market segments.
</P>
<P>
Trucks already account for more than 50 percent of the U.S.
market. Auto experts believe the number of truck models will
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
It is the last major American auto show in the century. The
show also has a big display called The Century of the Automobiles,
in celebration of the Auto Show's centennial in 2000.

<HEADLINE> First Cornea Bank Established in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's youngest municipality of
Chongqing, in southwest China, recently set up its first cornea
bank in the No.1 Hospital attached to the Chongqing Medical
Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the bank, which has been
established with technical aids from two overseas ophthalmology
organizations, will collect and store corneas, and carry out
researches on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing municipality, approximately 100,000 residents are
blind from cornea diseases, and 60 percent of them can be cured by
means of corneas transplant. Nevertheless, owing to a lack of
corneas, many cornea transplanting surgeries cannot be carried out
as expected, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
By now, some 1,000 residents of the city, most of whom young
people, have handed in applications to express their willingness
to donate their corneas after their deaths.

BANGKOK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's ruling Democrat Party
has re-elected Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai as its top leader and
chosen Abhisit Vejjajiva as its deputy leader, Sunday's Bangkok
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Chuan was elected the party's top leader
with an overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
The party, at its general assembly Saturday, also elected a
49-member executive board, endorsing the re-election of several
key party figures, including Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart as secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The meeting sent a subtle message on the party's readiness to
battle for a fresh mandate to lead the next coalition.
</P>
<P>
Abhisit, minister of the Prime Minister's Office, was
considered as a rising star in the party and the designated
campaign manager to consolidate the somewhat fickle Bangkok
voters.
</P>
<P>
Dropped from the power structure altogether, however, was MP
Boonchu Rojanastien who had openly criticized Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda and his economic reform package.

<P>
HANOI, April 4 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam's Association for the
Disabled and Orphans has issued a statement, condemning NATO's use
of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam's humanitarian organization pointed out that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an independent and sovereign
nation and a member of the United Nations, and NATO's use of force
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a gross violation of
the UN Conventions as well as international laws, according to
Vietnam News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Association for the Disabled and Orphans said as it
is working hard to alleviate the plight of disabled people,
especially women and children, victims of war, it, therefore,
profoundly sympathizes with the Yugoslav people who are suffering
from the devastation and killings by NATO's airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
The association demanded an immediate stop to such crimes.
</P>
<P>
The association called on NATO to sit down for negotiations
with Yugoslavia in search of a peaceful and fair solution to the
Kosovo crisis for the sake of peace and stability in the world.

-- Efforts to secure the release of Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo
and four other military and police personnel held hostage by New
People's Army hit another snag after the National Democratic Front
accused President Estrada of "treachery" for the continued

<HEADLINE> Southwest Residential Areas Arise in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Analysts warn of a cautious
attitude towards residential housing development in southwestern
Beijing, although the local government has attached great
importance to the area's renovation.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily Business Weekly quoted Yin Weihong of the
Beijing Achievement Commerce and Investments Consultants Co. Ltd.
as saying that few residents capable of buying a house would
choose to live in the city's southwest because of the region's
backwardness in terms of its economy, culture and commerce.
</P>
<P>
But a number of residential housing projects have begun to
spring up in the area as a result of the smooth progress of the
city's renovation program.
</P>
<P>
According to a study done by Yin's company, 25 residential
housing projects with a combined floor area of four million square
meters will be built there.
</P>
<P>
"About one million sq m of residential housing are currently
under construction or have been finished," said Yin, who is
director of the company's marketing department.
</P>
<P>
The opening of several major roads including the second and
third ring roads, Guang'an Menwai Street, coupled with the
improvement of public facilities in the area, like the operation
of the Beijing West Railway Station, are the major factors
attracting developers to invest in the area's residential housing,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yin agreed the opening of the second-hand housing
market would also help spur housing sales in the region, adding
that the southwest region would become an ideal living place in
the next 10 or more years.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Focus on "Doable" Education Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A multisectoral body created last
year by Philippine President Estrada to study the country's school
system will focus on a dozen "doable" reforms to reverse the
decline of Philippine education and gird up Filipino students and
teachers to the emerging Knowledge or Information Society.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Victor Ordonez of the Presidential Commission on
Education Reforms (PCER) said at a recent PCER meeting that each
of the commission's six working groups should focus on a pair of
"doable" reforms, instead of tackling a wide range of issues "only
to end up with nothing."
</P>
<P>
President Estrada created PCER as a study group with one year
to pry into the country's school system and come up with a package
of reforms similar to that endorsed by the Congressional
Commission on Education (Edcom) in 1991.
</P>
<P>
PCER has formed working groups to tackle the six priority areas
-- governance, finance, quality assessment, teacher training,
medium of instruction and information technology education.
</P>
<P>
It will wrap up its first-quarter tasks with a workshop for all
its members on April 22-23.
</P>
<P>
Edcom, which was chaired by then senator Edgardo Angara, drew
up in 1991 a slew of education-reform proposals at the end of its
year-long probe of the ills plaguing Philippine education.
</P>
<P>
Most of Edcom's proposals were eventually adopted as education
policies of the previous Aquino and later Ramos administrations.
</P>
<P>
These include the laws creating the Commission on Higher
Education and the Technical Education and Skills Development
Authority, establishing dual-training and the National Science and
Technology Scholarship Program, lengthening the school calendar,
and almost tripling the salary of public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Although President Estrada acknowledged the comprehensive
nature of the Edcom report, he said last year that a new inquiry
is needed because of the dramatic changes that have swept the
world from the time the congressional body conducted its study
almost a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
One of these fast-changing developments, he said, is the rise
of the Internet and the so-called Information Superhighway.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts Minus 0.18 Percent Inflation in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted a monthly
inflation of minus 0.18 percent in March as a result of a drop in
the prices of main commodities, Antara News Agency Sunday quoted
the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three months in 1999 the inflation rate has
shown a downward trend and even a deflation in March," BPS chief
Sugito Suwito said.
</P>
<P>
The March deflation was attributable to a drop in spending on
foodstuffs and processed food, beverages, cigarettes and tobacco
which posted a month-on-month inflation of minus 0.61 percent and
0.04 percent respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spending on housing recorded a month-on-month
inflation of 0.12 percent, garments 0.02 percent, health 0.04
percent, education, recreation and sports 0.01 percent and
transportation and telecommunication 0.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, spending on house rentals and construction
materials such as roofing, plywood and cement, contributed 0.02
percent and 0.01 percent respectively to the March inflation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said the increase in the price of housing last month was
triggered by the increase in the price of building materials.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia recorded a month-on-month inflation of 2.97 percent
and 1.26 percent respectively in January and February this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.1
degrees on the Richter scale hit South Honduras and the capital of
Tegucigalpa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The jolts injured at least one person and damaged several homes
in an island and a coast village as well as the electricity
distribution network there, said a Honduras Red Cross spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The quake provoked panic among the local inhabitants, he said.
</P>
<P>
It occurred just after 04:00 local time (10:00 GMT) and had its
epicenter in the Nicaraguan Pacific zone .
</P>
<P>
The tremor was felt more intensive in the Coyolito and Amapala
communities and caused more disorder among local Hondurans and
tourists.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no official report on the quake because
the seismograph, placed in the Geophysics Department of the
National Autonomous University of Honduras -- the only earthquake
research institution in the state, has been closed due to the Holy
Week holiday.
</P>
<P>
At least six earthquakes of medium intensity have occurred
since last Friday and the people fear that the tremor could have
bigger repercussions.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has delivered the second
vessel, a vehicle carrier, to a Singapore marine company.
</P>
<P>
The MV Jaya transporter, built by the state-run Myanma
Shipyards for the Jaya Marine Lines Pte Ltd. of Singapore, was
launched here Saturday, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The carrier, 56.45 meters long and 12 meters wide and 3.4

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Exports, Imports in 1998 Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's exports and imports in
1998 decreased by 8.6 percent and 34.4 percent respectively from
1997, Antara News Agency Sunday quoted the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports in 1998 decreased by 8.6 percent to 48.85
billion U.S. dollars from 53.44 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
BPS chief Sugito Suwito said the decline was caused by a 32.2
percent drop in oil and gas exports from 11.62 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 to 7.87 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil and non-gas exports were 2.02 percent down from 41.82
billion U.S. dollars to 40.96 billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the country's exports would face greater
challenges as the total export value in January 1999 only amounted
to 3 billion U.S. dollars, lower than the minimum level reached in
1997 and 1998, Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
The main destination of Indonesian exports was Japan which in
1998 absorbed 18.7 percent of Indonesian exports, followed by the
United States (14.4 percent) and Singapore (11.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis in Japan has reduced the country's ability
to absorb imported goods. On the contrary, a better economy in the
United States has encouraged it to import more goods," Sugito
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's imports in 1998 decreased by 34.4
percent from 41.68 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to 27.34 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of oil and gas dropped by 32.4 percent from 3.92
billion U.S. dollars to 2.65 billion dollars. Non-oil and non-gas
imports decreased by 34.6 percent from 37.76 billion U.S. dollars
to 24.68 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease in imports meant a saving of foreign exchange but
created problems in the real sector which needs imported raw
materials," Sugito said.
</P>
<P>
Like its exports, Indonesia's imports in 1999 are expected to
face challenges as imports in January 1999 only reached 1.80
billion U.S. dollars, down from the figures for the corresponding
month in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's imports in 1998 came mostly from Japan (15.7
percent), the United States (12.9 percent) and Singapore (9.3
percent).

<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambridge University coasted home
to win the Boat Race for the seventh year in succession, finishing
11 seconds ahead of Oxford University in the world most famous
rowing race.
</P>
<P>
The inexperienced underdogs proved the pundits wrong, finishing
the 145th university showdown on the River Thames in 16 minutes 41
seconds -- the second quickest time.
</P>
<P>
The Light Blues forged ahead and took full advantage when
umpire Mark Evans ordered Oxford cox Neil O'Donnell to veer away
to avoid a clash of oars.
</P>
<P>
For Cambridge, Vian Sharif steered perfectly. At the end of the
race the 19-year-old was embraced by all the crew, then hurled
victoriously into the river.
</P>
<P>
The two crews had started well and were going stroke-for-stroke
in the early stages but Cambridge were a second up after the first
mile.
</P>
<P>
At Hammersmith Bridge the light Blues continued their advantage
and managed to get clear water ahead of their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Oxford's work began to look tatty and by Chiswick Steps
Cambridge had stretched their lead to more than seven seconds. By
Barnes Bridge the advantage was looking ominous for Oxford and the
writing was on the wall.
</P>
<P>
At the finish Oxford had almost collapsed and the Light Blues
completed their win with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
It was Cambridge's 76th win. Oxford have won 68 times and one
contest ended in a dead heat.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Lauds Hero Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We need to work hard to train and support more hero soldiers
like Li Xiangqun," wrote President Jiang, who is also chairman of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 300,000 troops were mobilized to tackle the
floods in the central and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and
along the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in the northeast of China.
</P>
<P>
Li, a solider with the Guangzhou Military Command Area, which
was a main force in flood control in the Yangtze River area, was
among the 20-odd troops who lost their lives in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Central Military Commission issued an
order signed by President Jiang awarding Li the honorary title of
"A hero solider of the new era."
</P>
<P>
Li was born in southern island province of Hainan in 1978, the
year that marked the start of the country's socialist market
economic reforms. Through this reform period Li's family benefited
and currently run two clothing factories, a further two shops and
own a number of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Li joined a unit of the People's Liberation Army in Guilin,
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,' two years ago and
was sent to the flood control site eight days prior to his death.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua commentary issued today compared Li Xiangqun with Lei
Feng, an outstanding soldier in the 1960s, best known for his
years of performing good deeds for others.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six years ago the late Chairman Mao Zedong called on the
people across the entire nation to learn from Lei Feng, who also
died in the course of duty, at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian, both vice-chairmen of the
Central Military Commission, have also written inscriptions
praising hero soldier Li.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Exports Down in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- China's textile exports continued
to drop in the first two months of this year, reaching 6.04
billion U.S. dollars, down 22.32 percent from the same period of
1998, the China Daily's Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Customs Offices reported more than one
fourth decline in clothing and accessories exports, and mainland's
clothing exports to Hong Kong and Macao plummeted 61 percent to 0.
7 billion U.S. dollars in the January-to-Feburary period this year.
</P>
<P>
Average unit prices of Chinese textile products have also gone
down in the grim international market, according to Fan Min, a
division chief of the Industry Administration Department of the
State Textile Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said the shrinkage in price make many Chinese township
enterprises, whose products account for a considerable proportion
of clothing exports, to temporally stop their production.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's general trade of clothing exports also
decreased from 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first two months of
last year to 1.36 billion U.S. dollars in the same period of this
year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the official pointed out that the current decline
doesn't indicate the development trend in this year's clothing
exports.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the exports will roughly equal to or went down
slightly from last year since the government's various supporting
measures such as allowing producers to purchase cotton directly
from growers, which results in lower cost and increased
competition in exports price.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Rapid 1st-Quarter Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"All the stimulus measures introduced in the second half of
last year are working," said Li Shantong, director of the
Development and Forecasting Department of the State Council
Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
She said the country's active fiscal policy, with expanded
expenditures on infrastructure at its core, would remain a
significant force buoying economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The official forecast growth rate for 1999 is 7 percent,
against the 7.8 percent achieved last year. "The growth rate for
the year as a whole will remain high, possibly around 8 percent."
said she.
</P>
<P>
Hu Shaowei, a researcher at the center, said he expected the
index to linger in negative territory in the remaining part of the
year while moving closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index (RPI) sank 2.8 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, the RPI had been falling for 18
consecutive months -- a fact cited by many economists as evidence
that China was under deflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
M2, the broadest measurement of money supply that covers cash
and all sorts of deposits, grew 18 percent year-on-year by the end
of February, as compared to 15.3 percent by the end of last year,
according to statistics from the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, central bank governor Dai Xianglong has also
warned against the emergence of deflation.
</P>
<P>
As price indices continue to drop, some analysts are suggesting
the country still has room for new interest rate cuts, since lower
interest rates would ease the interest burden on enterprises and
encourage investment.
</P>
<P>
But both Li and Hu, citing the muted reaction by consumers and
firms alike to last year's three rounds of interest rate cuts,
were doubtful over the effectiveness of new interest rate cuts in
stimulating demand.

<HEADLINE> Tenth World Youth Championship Kicks off in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The 10th World Youth Soccer
Championship kicked off at the National Stadium in Lagos on
Saturday, realizing the dream of Nigerians to host the meet after
a wait of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony held on Saturday afternoon,
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulasami Abubakar expressed his

The head of state traced the history of the application for
hosting the game to 1987 by the Nigerian government and the nation
was granted the hosting right in 1995 by the Federation of
International Football Association (FIFA).
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the offer was withdrawn ostensibly on health
grounds," he noted, adding that "I am proud to state that this
time around, Nigeria has been able to meet, if not surpass, FIFA's
very high standards."
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar said that Nigeria has made a lot of sacrifice
in its efforts to host this game. "We have taken all the pains
and risks in order to demonstrate our faith in the principles of
love, peace and tranquility," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his
thanks to the people and government of Nigeria for their "
wonderful achievement" in preparing for the three-week

<HEADLINE> Criticism Rises in German Ruling Parties Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, April 3 (Xinhua) -- As the NATO is intensifying air
strikes against Yugoslavia, the coalition governing German cabinet
faces stronger criticism from its own members on Germany's policy
of taking part in NATO actions.
</P>
<P>
Key figures of the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) warned
the government against the air raids. Benjamin Mikfeld, member of
the SPD executive circle, said that 50 percent of the party
members were against the government's policy.
</P>
<P>
Vice parliamentary fraction chief of SPD, Michael Mueller, on
Saturday told the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper that endless bombing
would not lead to peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If we destroy everything in Yugoslavia, we can not get peace,"
Mueller said, "and the people must know where to find the end of
the bombing."
</P>
<P>
Hermann Scheer, another member of the SPD leadership, suggested
that United Nations (UN) general secretary Kofi Annan be named as
independent mediator and an entirely new peaceful bill be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution is impossible without consideration for the
emotion of the Serb people, Scheer said.
</P>
<P>
The Greens Party, junior partner in Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's coalition, also faces widespread anger among party
members over NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
The party leadership on Friday called for a ceasefire and a
fresh diplomatic initiative aimed at reaching a negotiated
solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Greens, traditionally a pacifist and environmentalist
party, has planned a special congress on Kosovo crisis on May 13.
</P>
<P>
Several regional associations of the Greens have called for the
congress to discuss divisions in the party over NATO operations.
</P>
<P>
Roland Appel, a spokesman for the Green fraction in the
regional parliament in Duesseldorf, said there was a real threat
that the party might split in two over the Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Japan Helps Tanzania Control Mercury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (xinhua)-- Japan has donated
330,000 US dollars to Tanzania in support of the
country's efforts to reduce mercury pollution in the
goldfields near the Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry of
Energy and Minerals, Patrick Rutabanzibwa, said in a
statement here Saturday that the ministry, in
collaboration with the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO), has been working on a
pollution-reducing project since last August.
</P>
<P>
Rutabanzibwa said the project addresses small-scale
miners around Lake Victoria, the world's second largest
freshwater lake, by providing them with information and
intensive training on extracting gold without releasing
mercury to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Mercury is used excessively in the region for
recovering gold, said Rutabanzibwa, noting that the
Tanzanian government is paying great attention to
mercury's severe impact on human health and environment.
</P>
<P>
The poisoning effect of mercury includes organic
disfunctions and irreversible neurological damages to
human body.
</P>
<P>
Rutabanzibwa said the first phase of the project
which has been completed focused on training some of the
small-scale miners, expecting them to pass the
knowledge to others.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bank Closure Surely Affects Trade Fair Sales: official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (xinhua) -- Thursday's sudden
closure of Uganda's Greenland Bank Limited (GBL) by the
central bank will surely affect the sales at the ongoing
international trade fair at Uganda Manufacturers'
Association (UMA) show grounds, a senior official from
Uganda's chamber of commerce has said.
</P>
<P>
Boney Katatumba, chairman of Uganda Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (UNCCI), said this in a press
statement released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He described the closure of GBL as unfortunate and
untimely. The decision by the Bank of Uganda to close
the bank completely will reduce the number of showgoers
because many potentials customers' money was trapped in
the bank.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank had assured the 120,000
depositors of the ill-fated bank that their money was
safe, they rushed to the bank's main branch on Kampala
road demanding money on the eve of long Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
the week-long trade fair opened Friday at low ebb
although its organizers said they were confident more
customers would come in due course.
</P>
<P>
The bank closure and the arrest of the bank's
Managing Director Sulaiman Kiggundu caused a stampede
in the city; The capital city's Crusader newspaper had
to suspend publication due to financial problms arising
from the bank closure.
</P>
<P>
The GBL was closed for misanagement and large inside
lending. The central bank said that GBL made
operational losses of one billion shillings (one million
U.S. dollars ) over the last two months alone.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Water Plant Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The construction work of
Bangladesh's first major water treatment plant started here on
Sunday in a bid to reduce dependence on the depleting ground water
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The project, funded by the World Bank, Japan and France, was
aimed at providing surface water to residents of Dhaka and
reducing dependence on the ground water.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the plant, at a cost of about 156
million U.S. dollars, by the year 2001, "the current water
shortage in the city would be removed to a large extent," said
Zillur Rahman, minister for Local Government, Rural Development
and Cooperatives, at the earth-breaking ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to completely solve the water problems in the
capital through erecting more such surface water plants in
phases," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project was part of the government's mid-term planning to
resolve the water problems in the backdrop of increasing
population in the city, according to Rahman.
</P>
<P>
The plant would produce 225 million liters of water per day on
completion of phase one in the year 2001, and another 225 million
liters when it goes in full operation in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's capital city Dhaka has been facing an acute
shortage of water, particularly in the summer between March and
May. The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewage Authority (WASA) supplies
960-980 million liters of water daily while the city's maximum
estimated demand stands at 1,400 million liters of water a day.
</P>
<P>
Some 98 percent of WASA's total water supply comes from ground
water and only 2 percent from rivers through three existing small
surface water treatment plants, according to WASA officials.
