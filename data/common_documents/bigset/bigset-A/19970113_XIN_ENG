<HEADLINE> South-South Cooperation Has Bright Prospect: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Trade,
Finance and Investment will be convened in San Jose, Costa Rica,
from January 13 to 15 at the initiative of the Group of 77 and
China and supported by the government of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
This is a conference to be held to strengthen unity and
cooperation among developing countries, Wang Xuexian, China's
deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang said that expansion of South-South cooperation
is of special significance under the current international
situation.
</P>
<P>
As the world economy is undergoing a profound and complicated
change with globalization and liberalization moving forward
consistently, economic interdependence deepens among all countries
while competition turns more fierce. The change has provided
opportunities for economic growth and given challenges to all
countries, especially developing countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the irrational international economic order still exists,
developing countries remain at a position disadvantageous to them
and the gap between the South and North widens. While the
developing world as a whole has not got rid of poverty and
backwardness, a considerable number of developing countries are
confronted with the risk of marginalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wang said, some developed countries are
reluctant to honor their commitments on international development
cooperation. The official development aid of developed countries
dropped to 0.29 percent of their gross national product in 1995,
far from the target of 0.7 percent of their GNP set by the United
Nations. It is the lowest in the last two decades or more, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Under such a situation, developing countries have to strengthen
unity and enhance their capacity of collective self-reliance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The San Jose conference will bring together representatives of
governments, the private sector, the business community and
non-governmental organizations from the 132 member states of the
Group of 77 and China to discuss the important issues of economic
development. It will play an important role in strengthening
South-South cooperation, improving their external economic
environment and promoting establishment of a new international
economic order, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries share historical experience and stand at
about the same economic development level while each has its own
advantages in natural resources, output and technical know-how.
They can learn experience from each other in the process of
economic development. Expansion of trade, investment and technical
exchange among developing countries has a bright prospect, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said South-South cooperation is both complementary to
South-North cooperation and a driving force to promote South-North
cooperation. In a long view, the world economy is integrated and a
healthy development of developing countries will benefit the whole
international community, including the developed countries, he
noted. Based on this consensus, some developed countries have
supported a number of programs of South-South cooperation and the
"tri-lateral" cooperation shows a new economic relationship and
advantages already, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that strengthening friendly cooperation with other
developing countries is a starting point of China's foreign
policy. China has made efforts to expand cooperation with other
developing countries based on the principles of equality, mutual
benefit, practicality, effectiveness, flexibility and common
development.
</P>
<P>
With a formula "the Group of 77 and China," developing
countries have strengthened coordination and supported each other
on the international arena in recent years and achieved positive
results in improving their status in negotiation and protecting
the interests of the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has attached great importance to the San Jose conference
and the Chinese delegation will make its contributions to the
success of the conference, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Puts Forward Draft for Ending Tajik War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has put
forward a draft document for ending the civil war in Tajikistan, a
U.N. special envoy said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem, Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-
General on Tajikistan, said at a press conference that the
draft was drawn on some agreements of the Tajik government and
Islamic opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to go into detail about the draft
document, which was presented to the two warring parties at
the negotiating table in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the content of the draft is "confidential," but
he expressed confidence that the two warring parties would achieve
 some results in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As to the on-going negotiations, he said, the two parties face
difficulties in making compromises on number of issues such as
creation of a national reconciliation commission and formation of
the future government.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the two warring parties are deadlocked on
the above issues.
</P>
<P>
But, Merrem said that "we are trying to make visible progress
in the negotiation between the two parties on the following
issues -- the total number of opposition groups in the government
and the security arrangement in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted there are still some visible
disagreements between the two parties. He said that the
negotiations have been held in Tehran for one week and another
week is needed.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the Tajik government and Islamic opposition
began their two-week negotiations focusing on the creation of a
reconciliation commission and participation of the opposition
in the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition group asked for a share of 40 percent first in
the national reconciliation commission and then in the
government. However, the Tajik government did not accept the
demand.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government troops and the opposition forces have
fought each other for four years and thousands of people have
been killed in the civil war.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Visits Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
arrived in the Gaza Strip this afternoon for talks with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in
an effort to bolster the sluggish peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, accompanied by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti and three Jordanian ministers, reviewed an honor guard
of the Palestinian police upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
This is the king's first trip to the Gaza Strip since it was
seized by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king then joined Arafat and other PNA senior
officials for dinner to break the daily fasting observed by
Moslems in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which started last
week.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher, who is a member
of the king's entourage, said that the king's meeting with Arafat
is an attempt to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Recent developments are not encouraging," Muasher said, adding
that there exists a real danger to the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifa'i added that
Hussein's visit to the Gaza Strip "is part of Jordanian
effort to keep the momentum of the peace process going
forward."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, senior PNA officials also said that the
visit by Hussein is part of the Egyptian-Jordanian-Palestinian
consultations on the peace process.

</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed following sessions of the

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Blooming Globally But Pitfalls Exist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Stock markets have been
blooming globally in the past several years but pitfalls for
investors exist, the Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
About 60 securities markets have emerged or are about to open
in countries around the world from Albania in Europe and Uganda in
Africa since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Even the French, who are not notably enamored of free markets,
recently created Le Nouveau Marche, modeled after Nasdaq in the
U.S. and intended to attract public money to help finance young
high-technology companies, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the U.S. government is also helping to
jump-start financial markets around the globe. The U.S. Agency for
International Development spent 23 million U.S. dollars in Romania
to help establish the stock market in the country.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that this is good news because it opens
opportunities for investors that previously didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
But they warned that investors should be aware in investing the
new stock markets because these markets often rise and fall in
line with the enthusiasm of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that the danger is that people may be
investing in countries and companies that they have little
understanding of.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Due To Invite PAC To Join S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will invite the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to
join his government when he meets new PAC Leader Stanley Mogoba
later this week, a high-ranking official said today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Parks Mankahlana told reporters that
Mandela is due to meet Mogoba in Johannesburg on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has offered former PAC Leader Clarence Mkwetuto to
join the South African national unity government several times,
but the PAC failed to give a positive response, said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's repeated invitation to PAC is not only aimed at
recognizing the organization's role in national politics, but
also at promoting national unity and reconciliation, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, born in April 1959, is a major political party of the
black people in South Africa, it joined multi-party negotiations
in April 1993, but failed to win a seat in the government after
the 1994 national election.

<HEADLINE> Experts Defuse Mortar Bombs After Raid on Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British army bomb-disposal
experts defused two mortar bombs today following a failed attack
on a village police station in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland,
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
A mortar was fired Saturday night from a van left outside the
unstaffed police station in the small village of Tempo, but failed
to explode. Its firing mechanism set the van alight.
</P>
<P>
Children attending music classes next door escaped unhurt, and
no one was injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack so
far, but security sources blamed the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
amid heightened fears of a new bombing offensive in the province.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth such outrage since the start of the new
year. It increased fears that the IRA is deliberately targeting
the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in its new terror campaign and
confirmed the RUC belief that there is little likelihood of an IRA
cease-fire in the immediate future.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Celebrates ANC's 85th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today called upon all political parties to make
more efforts for maintaining national unity when addressing a
mass rally marking the 85th anniversary of the ruling African
National Congress (ANC) party.
</P>
<P>
National reconciliation and reconstruction are the most
important tasks for the ANC and its political allies, he said in
the Botshabeloa stadium near Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the achievement the government has made for
national democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We have defeated apartheid because we have always tried to...
build (on) each other," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He called on ANC members to work hard in their constituencies
and to "put politics above personalities, programs above
individualism".
</P>
<P>
The ANC, founded in 1912 near Bloemfontein and banned most of
the time during the apartheid era, is the biggest black political
party in the country before coming into power in May 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Earn 1.4 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 1996 marketing
season for large-scale agricultural production netted about 1.4
billion U.S. Dollars, the Zimbabwe News Agnecy reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted President of the Zimbabwe Commercial
Farmers' Union, Nick Swanepoel, as saying that tobacco sales made
for 44 percent of the marketed agricultural yield.
</P>
<P>
"The relative good rainfall season of 1995/96 restored a great
deal of confidence amongst farmers and considerably improved the
water resources on farms," said Swanepoel.
</P>
<P>
Improved water facilities, he said, have made some 53,000
hectares of cereal crops fully irrigated during the dry season of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Swanepoel warned the proposed hike on primary
produce taxation would have a negative impact on the government's
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Such a bill was withdrawn from parliament last year and
Agriculture Minister Denis Norman said the government need to
make further consultations.

The newspaper said while the U.S. claims that it understands
the reasons behind the Turkish incursion into northern Iraq to
attack Turkey's Kurdish Workers Party, the Clinton administration
gives itself the right to interfere with Iraq's internal affairs,
to commit aggression against it and set up centers of intelligence
under the pretext of "providing comfort" for Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should have encouraged, rather than tried to stop,
the dialogue between the Iraqi government and the warring
Kurdish parties in the light of its concern over the security,
stability and peace of the world, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper denounced the U.S. attitude as a flagrant example of
a double-standard policy.

<HEADLINE> World Population Growth Slumps for 1st Time in 80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- World population growth is
slowing because of better birth control, Professor Bill Gould of
Liverpool University told the Geographers' Conference.
</P>
<P>
It is the first recorded decline in growth, except for the
Black Death and the flu epidemic at the end of World War One.
</P>
<P>
The number of births has been falling, a trend that includes
all African countries for the first time, the professor said at
the conference in Exeter University recently.
</P>
<P>
The last estimate of the world population six years ago was
nearly 5.5 billion. Subsequent censuses showed little evidence of
the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The reported fall had been made possible by the greater
availability of contraceptives, more family planning centers,
better education of girls and women, and a growing recognition
that children cost money, Gould said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest declines had been a result of government programs,
he said, citing Bangladesh (with a population of 118.7 million),
where fertility had fallen from seven children per woman in 1970
to about four in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"That is a bit of a miracle, the result of a vigorous
government program of education and health programs," Professor
Gould said.
</P>
<P>
Equally rapid falls have been recorded in China, Indonesia,
Brazil and Mexico. East Asia has shown the steepest falls, with
fertility now between two and three children per woman, the
conference was told.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gould said that even though population growth
continued, if fertility decline continued at these rates, the
world population would eventually stabilize.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans To Set up Relics Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government will
allocate 34 million Birr (about 5.2 million U.S.Dollars) for
construction of a relics preservation research laboratory,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Bekele Abebaw, representative of the Research
Laboratory Department in Ethiopia's Relics Research and Preservation
Agency as saying that the setting up of relics preservation
research laboratory is a priority task to prevent damages that may
happen to antiquities.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the agency, Bekele said, the
laboratory will contribute a great deal to preventing man made and
natural damage on the relics, facilitating researches on
both mobile and immobile relics besides serving as a training
center for professionals.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, over 330,000 Birr (about 51,000 U.S.
Dollars) has been expended to launch the study. The study is meant
to implement a resolution passed two decades ago by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
which demanded Ethiopia to be the center for the African relics
preservation laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is an ancient country with a written history of 3,000
years. The discovery of one of the earliest and most complete
hominoids (dinkenesh or lucy, 3.5 million years old), ancient cave
paintings and tools testify the country is one of the cradles of
life and man.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Hit Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Many parts of Greece were hit
today by heavy rains and extensive flooding, which have reportedly
claimed the lives of three people.
</P>
<P>
In northeastern Peloponese, the prefecture of Argolida has
experienced unprecedented rainfall which swelled the waters of the
Xerias River and flooded 2,500 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
The rain has caused extensive damage to power and
telecommunications networks in the region as well as many farm
dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture administration has declared a state of emergency
and mobilized its entire personell for the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
In the prefecture of Corinth, roads have turned to rivers. A
bus with 15 passengers was swept away by a torrent and there are
initial reports of three fatalities, while tens of people stranded
on rooftops and in cars await rescue.
</P>
<P>
In Greater Athens area, the continuous rainfall has caused
flooding of many roads and homes as well as two subway stations
and a bus depot. The Kifissos River has overflowed flooding the
intersection of two of the capital's main arteries, road Kiffissou
and road Kavalas, with traffic chaos as a result.
</P>
<P>
The Athens fire brigade has been placed in full alert along
with teams of the Environment and Planning Ministry and the
Municipality of Athens to assist residents and keep the road
network open. Problems became more acute by the large amounts of
garbage accumulated on the streets of the capital due to a
municipal strike. The garbage is swept by waters and is blocking
storm water drains along the roads.
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service is forecasting little change for
the next 12 hours, when the rain front is expected to move east
and affect Crete and other islands of the Aegean.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross is leaving for Washington tonight without an agreement
on Hebron between Israelis and the Palestinians which he has been
brokering for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Richard Scorza, a spokesman of the U.S. Embassy to Israel, said
that Ross, as mediator, had accomplished his task and the
remaining issues are left for the Israelis and Palestinians to
solve.
</P>
<P>
Ross admitted failure in bridging the gap between the two
sides in Cairo Saturday after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point rests with a timetable for further Israeli
troop withdrawal from the occupied West Bank. The Palestinians
demand that Israel complete the third and final phase of
withdrawal by September 1997 as defined in the Oslo 2 agreement
signed in Washington on September 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
While Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu wanted to
postpone the date until the spring of 1999. The U.S. offered a
compromise proposal that the date be fixed some time in between.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who spent Saturday
in Cairo at the U.S.-Egyptian-Palestinian trilateral meeting, said
that the Israeli government should stop its attempt to change
the existing agreement and commit itself to the clauses of the
agreement signed. Now the ball is still in Israel's court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to change the downward trend, Ross
met with King Hussein of Jordan in Amman telling the monarch
that he was heading home without reaching an agreement on partial
Israeli troop withdrawal from Hebron. The king piloted a
helicopter to Gaza this afternoon in an effort to help avert
a crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Ross would change his mind should
the two sides request him to stay on as he did once
before on previous visits.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jerusalem do not discount the speculation of a
three-way summit between King Hussein, Netanyahu and Arafat at
the end of the king's visit to Gaza tonight, according to a
report of Israel Television.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks with Greek Foreign Minister Theodor Pangalos
here today over bilateral relations and the recent political
crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos arrived here earlier in the day on a one-day visit at
the invitation of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Milosevic and Pangalos exchanged views on the
latest developments and issues vital to the promotion of
Yugoslav-Greek relations and joint efforts in strengthening
regional stability and confidence among the states and peoples in
the region, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the latest developments in Serbia
concerning the daily protest of the opposition over the government
election fraud.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that issues concerning the development of
a country should be solved in a country's legitimate institutions
and that a harmonious development of a country was in the best
interests of all that urge stable and prosperous inter-state
relations based on equality, partnership and non-interference in a
country's internal affairs, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told reporters after the meeting with both President
Milosevic and opposition leaders that the Serbian government
should accept the proposal of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and recognize the victory of the
opposition in the November local elections. The OSCE delegation
said in a fact-finding report that the opposition won local
elections in most big cities in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno claims winning 14 out of 18
biggest cities in local elections on November 17 and has organized
demonstrations over the past eight weeks to protest the annulment
of the election results.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos's visit was part of regular contacts and a high-level
political dialogue between the two friendly countries, the
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said.

JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Jordanian King Hussein will meet tonight at
the Kiriya in Tel Aviv, according to a dramatic announcement of
the prime minister's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
The one-sentence announcement, which said the two leaders would
meet at 22:00, came after King Hussein held talks with
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat in Gaza this evening.
</P>

U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross met with the king in
Amman, telling the monarch that he was heading back to
Washington without reaching agreement on partial Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials indicated that King Hussein visited Arafat
in an effort to rescue the peace process which is in crisis, as
Arafat put it.

The Palestinians demand that Israel complete the third and

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- All Rwandan refugee
camps in the northwestern Tanzanian region of Kagera have been
closed for environmental rehabilitation, the Tanzanian Minister
for Home Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, said
in a statement that the camps were closed after over 500,000
Rwandan refugees left for home last month.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is still examining applications of
some Rwandan refugees for further permission on living in the
country, Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
"The government examines their applications through its
National Eligibility Committee," he added.
</P>
<P>
The applicants have been temporarily permitted to stay at
Mwisa camp in Karagwe district, when their applications are
considered.
</P>
<P>
"Those camped at Mwisa are waiting for their fates to be
decided on," he said, adding that those sneaked up into Kigoma
and Kagera reserve forests are illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue hunting for them," said Mohamed,
noting once they are netted, they will be punished accordingly.
</P>
<P>
However, he said all refugees left Tanzania voluntarily and
there were no refugee intimidators.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed urged people to refrain from harbouring refugees,
claiming it is a criminal offence.
</P>
<P>
But refugees from eastern Zairean are regarded by the
Tanzanian government as asylum seekers fleeing violence and
therefore can be registered in camps immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 200,000 Burundian refugees are camped in
Kigoma, Tabora, Rukwa and Kagera regions and Some of them are
living illegally in villages and towns of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told that some 30,000 Burundian refugees have already gone

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Ross' Failure Not Drag Peace Back to Zero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today blamed Israel for delay in sealing a deal on implementing
the Hebron pullback but said that he did not believe that the
peace process was back to square one.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat was commenting to reporters here on
the failed mission of U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross
who had been mediating between the Israelis and the Palestinians
in the region for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
He has managed to mediate a solution between Palestinians and
Israelis on a partial Israeli pullout from Hebron but failed to
resolve the issue of Israel's handover of rural areas of the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters here that to continue the steps towards
Israeli withdrawal from the remaining areas and embark on the
final phase talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, are
"the main issues and principal requirements for success."
</P>
<P>
Moussa criticized Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
for the current peace deadlock. "The continued Israeli
intransigence and hardline policies that contradict the original
agreement and attempts to pressure Palestinians are the reasons
behind the delay in reaching an agreement and starting future
steps," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also warned against attempts to derail the peace
process, saying a tense climate would aggravate the unbalanced
situation between Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Ross admitted failure in bridging the gap between the two
sides here Saturday after his hour-long meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, who also met with PA leader Yasser
Arafat earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort to reverse the trend, Ross met with
King Hussein of Jordan in Amman, who flew to Gaza today to meet
with Arafat to help avert a crisis.

further searches, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Crashing on the edge of a cliff, 1,828 meters above sea level,

the bomber wreckage was scattered across a 5-meter-broad and

500-meter-high fault and crack.
</P>
<P>
Five identification plates indicating the identities of five

American servicemen and some remains of the victims have already

been found by local people.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was first spotted on October 2 by two farmers, who

were looking for medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, local government took measures to protect the

site and clear the articles.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin informed US President Bill

Clinton of the discovery of the wreckage in Xing'an county when

they attended an APEC meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, who is also vice-chairman

of China's Central Military Commission and state councillor,

passed on some of the victims' belongings to US Secretary of

Defense William Perry when he visited the United States at the end

of last year.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations show that the bomber was subordinate

to "Flying Tigers", headed by US retired Major General Claire Lee

Chennault.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a part of US No. 375 bomber squadron, the plane took

off from No. 14 air base in Liuzhou at 4:30 P.M. on August 31,

1944 to bomb the Japanese warships berthed at a port in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On its way back to the base, the plane with a crew of 10,

disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Approves Outline of New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian parliament today

approved the outline of the 63-billion-dollar budget for new

Iranian fiscal year starting from March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Iranian

government plans to earn 1.75 billion U.S. dollars from

exporting oil products.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the oil export revenue will increase to 2

billion dollars if the Bandar Abbas Oil Refinery starts operation

in the new year.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not mention the total oil export revenue

targeted in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government plans to earn a total of 17.7 billion

dollars of foreign exchange, a 10.8 percent rise over that of

this year.
</P>
<P>
The new year budget was presented by President Akbar Hashemi

Rafsanjani to the parliament in November.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Mirzadeh, Vice-President and Head of Plan and Budget

organization, said at the open session of the parliament that

eradication of poverty, establishment of social justice and

reinforcing agricultural sector are among the main features of

the budget for the new Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the bill sets public revenues and

other financial sources at 25 billion U.S. dollars and the

specific revenues of ministries and government organizations at

2.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The budget for state companies, banks and profit organizations

affiliated to the government is 39.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mirzadeh said the rate of inflation will be reduced to 16

percent from this year's 23 percent and the rise in the gross

national product will be five percent compared with the current

rate of 4.7 percent, he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Teams Discover Four Engines of Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Foreign Ministry

spokesman announced today four engines of destroyed missiles were

discovered in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This discovery adds more credibility to Iraq's statements on

the overall missiles destruction, the spokesmen said, adding that

the allegations of hiding a number of missiles by Iraq are

groundless.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation carried out by Iraqi authorities and the

United Nations special commission (UNSCOM) teams found the four

engines of missiles which were destroyed few years ago. Some

destroyed missiles were discovered in the same sites in 1992,

according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The uncovered engines are the very ones the UNSCOM was

accusing Iraq of concealing, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held in December 1996 between Iraqi Deputy Prime

Minister Tariq Aziz and UNSCOM executive chairman Rolf Ekeus,

Aziz proposed that excavation process should be done jointly

between Iraq and UNSCOM's teams in the sites where these missiles

have already been destroyed in accordance with the provisions of

U.N. resolution 637, the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
The process began last Tuesday, but so far only four

destroyed missile engines have been discovered, and the work is

underway to get the mission wrapped up, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNSCOM chief insisted that Iraq still has 16 to

25 missiles which should be destroyed according to concerned

resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Africa Will Be Fastest Growth Areas: EIU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Most of the world's fastest

growing countries next year will be from Asia and Africa, while

the slowest will be Russia and some Eastern European countries and

members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and

Development (OECD), a report said.
</P>
<P>
World growth will be 2.9 percent, according to the report

released today by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). The

fastest growing country will be Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Next come China, growing at 9.3 percent, Vietnam, at 8.5

percent, and Malaysia, at 8 percent. Only two countries will

shrink: Tajikistan, by 7.5 percent and Libya, by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Countries with the slowest growth rates are Russia, Bulgaria,

Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, each forecast to have a 1

percent increase in GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among the more surprising slow-growth countries are

Switzerland, at 1.3 percent, and Italy, at 1.6 percent. Also among

the 20 slowest countries are the US, Japan and Germany, with

growth rates barely over 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report blames the slowdown in the US recovery, the phasing

out of fiscal stimulation in Japan, and Germany's preparations for

European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for Latin America and the Caribbean are "slightly

disappointing," with GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent for the

region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the population is rising so quickly there, this will

translate into a living standards increase of only 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japan's November Current Account Surplus Down 15.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus

fell 15.4 percent from a year earlier to 664.1 billion yen (6.04

billion U.S. dollars) on a continued increase in imports of

petroleum-related products and increased spending by Japanese

traveling abroad, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trade, Japan's surplus dropped 32.8

percent to 302.4 billion yen (2.75 billion dollars), the ministry

said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan posted a surplus of 859.8 billion yen (7.82 billion

dollars) in merchandise trade, down 3.4 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 11 percent to 3,856.9 billion yen (35.06 billion

dollars), while imports increased 16 percent to 2,997.1 billion

yen (27.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Services trade, meanwhile, left a deficit of 557.4 billion yen

(5.07 billion dollars), compared with the 440.1 billion yen (4

billion dollar) deficit a year before, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's monthly current account surplus has continued to

decrease since December 1994, except for August of 1995.
</P>
<P>
November's decline of 15.4 percent, however, was the smallest

in eight months as automobile and other exports rose amid the

yen's fall against the dollar. A weaker yen makes

dollar-denominated Japanese exports more competitive on the global

market.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and

services as well as investment income and other monetary

transfers.

<HEADLINE> Huge Savings Necessary for China: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's enormous savings

deposits are a powerful driving force behind the country's economic

growth and are unlikely to cause inflationary pressures, experts

said today.
</P>
<P>
"A rapidly-growing amount of individual savings deposits is

both a result of a sustained and rapid development of the Chinese

economy, and a driving force for further economic growth," Li Yang,

director of the Financial Research Center of the Chinese Academy

of Social Sciences, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits at Chinese banks reached 3.85 trillion yuan

(about 464 billion US dollars) by the end of 1996, up 30 percent

over a year ago, central bank governor Dai Xianglong announced

today at a national conference on financial work.
</P>
<P>
Tao Liming, deputy director of the International Finance

Research Institute of the Bank of China, noted that savings

provide a major and stable financial source for bank credits, and

for the country's economic construction as well.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that savings deposits account for

nearly 60 percent of China's outstanding banks deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained a savings rate of around 35 percent, and

its total savings have been expanding substantially over the

recent years, prompting concerns in Western media that the huge

savings deposits will produce inflationary pressures and can turn

out to be a "tiger in a cage" that will someday disrupt the market.
</P>
<P>
A high savings rate blesses a country with a great potential in

raising funds by its own, and also means less dependence on

international capital.
</P>
<P>
"The source of bank credits will become affected without a fairly

high individual savings rate and most enterprises, especially

state-owned firms, will simply be unable to survive due to a lack

of operating funds, " Tao warned.
</P>
<P>
"For a large developing country like China, it's out of the

question to rely solely on overseas capital for modernization,"

Tao said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, we must first of all rely on ourselves for funding."
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World Bank's resident mission in

China, echoed Tao, saying a high savings rate is an important

factor for the sustained and rapid development of the Chinese

economy. He dismissed the concern that China's huge savings will

cause inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any direct link between a high savings rate and

inflation," the banker said.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that what does constitute a problem is that

China's huge savings deposits have not been used efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The overall poor performance of enterprises, administrative

intervention in banking operations, and an interest rate system

that is not based on market forces, have combined to result in loss

and waste of savings resources, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the credit scale is tightly controled and the

economic return on bank loans is poor, a surge in personal savings

does translate into greater financial risks and a bigger interest

payment burden for banks," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, China should accelerate its pace of

developing money and capital markets, improve the financial asset

structure of individuals, and divert more money to other

investment alternatives, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that China should continue to take resolute

measures to rein in inflation in order to prevent the huge savings

from flooding the commodities market and driving up inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there is little stimulus to boost consumption

demand, but a rebound of inflation can send people into a new

cycle of buying sprees," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate measured by the retail price index was

six percent last year, down from 14.8 in 1995 and a record 21.7

percent in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Kills Two More, Traps 103,000 Herdsmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Another two people have been

killed by unprecedented snow in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur

Autonomous Region, bringing the death toll to 14, officials

sources said today.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of January 6, five gold miners from the

region's Altay Prefecture were hit by the fierce snowstorm as

they descended a mountain.
</P>
<P>
The extreme cold killed two of them, seriously injured two

others, and slightly injured the fifth.
</P>
<P>
The three survivors have been transferred safely to the home of

a herdsman. The government has sent a team to rescue the three

victims, but the rescuers have been unable to reach the herdsman's

home because the snow is more than a meter deep.
</P>
<P>
From December 24 to January 6, the snowstorm killed 12 people,

left four missing, seriously injured six people and slightly

injured one other person. The fatalities and casualties were

caused mainly by avalanches and the deadly freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
So far, the snowstorms have caused losses of more than 100

million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) in the prefecture,

killed 6,800 head of farm animals, wrecked or damaged 6,000 rooms

belonging to 2,300 herdsmen's' families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many herdsmen and their families living at the foot

of the Altay Mountains are in a critical situation. The snow is

up to two meters deep, cutting off every traffic route or way

in. In some areas the snow is more than 2.4 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
At least 30,000 people among herdsmen's families have run out

of food, and as many as 103,000 people are trapped in the

mountains by the snow.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from the Altay Prefectural Committee of the

Chinese Communist Party have vowed to do their utmost to di relief

work and reduce the losses from the unprecedented

snowstorms.

<HEADLINE> Syria Assures Iran of Strategic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria today assured Iran of

"friendly and strategic ties" between the two countries despite

its support to the United Arab Emirates(UAE) in the dispute with

Iran over islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported Syrian Vice-President

Abdel Halim Khaddam today delivered an oral message from Syrian

President Hafez al-Assad to Iranian President Akbar Hashemi

Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president stressed the "friendly and strategic

ties" between the two countries stemming from common regional

and international viewpoints and from religious, cultural and

historical commonalities.
</P>
<P>
Assad also stressed the necessity of strengthening cooperation

 and exchanging views regarding bilateral, regional and

international issues.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iran's First Vice-President Hassan

Habibi and foreign ministers of Iran and Syria were also present

at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam briefed Rafsanjani on the latest developments in the

region and the results of the recent Cairo meeting of the eight

member states of the Damascus Declaration which ended on December

29. The member states of the declaration voiced support for UAE

sovereignty over the three islands in the gulf, which are

controlled by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also praised Iran's role in strengthening peace

and cooperation in the region and expressed his country's

interest in exchanging views on the regional issues,

particularly the developments in the occupied Palestine, the

Arab-Israeli peace, Lebanon and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani spoke highly of the Syrian role in the forefront

of struggle against the "Zionist state's aggression". He also

reviewed the two countries' "progressive and humanist policies"

in regard to regional and international issues and their good

cooperation in political, economic, cultural and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the close relations between the two countries

provide a suitable backing for the further deepening of their

"friendly and brotherly relations".
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president noted that the Israeli regime is

intensifying its "aggressive and dominating policies" over the

region, particularly over Lebanon and Syria in collaboration

with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the countries in the region should try

to avoid raising minor issues so as to make full use of their

means "in confronting the heinous policies" of the Israeli

regime and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the visiting Syrian vice-president had

already concluded his two-day visit to Tehran and left for home

after having taken part in the joint commission of the two

countries.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived here yesterday afternoon on a two-day

official visit to Tehran amid a wave of criticism by Iranian

media for Damascus' recent anti-Iranian stances.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Iran's strategic ally in the Middle East, joined Egypt

and six Persian Gulf Arab countries meeting in Cairo last week

to criticize Iran for its deployment of ground-to-ground

missiles on three Persian Gulf islands under Iranian control but

also claimed by the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The signatories to the declaration affirmed the UAE's right

to the sovereignty of Abu Mussa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb

islands and urged Iran to end its "occupation" of them.
</P>
<P>
They also said Tehran posed a "direct threat" to the Arab

monarchies across the Persian Gulf and their strategic sites.
</P>
<P>
Damascus's endorsement of the statement provoked an outcry in

the Iranian press, which said Syria had "Stabbed Iran in the

back."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials had said earlier that the Cairo meeting

would be on the top of the agenda for the bilateral talks

between Iranian and Syrian officials, but the report did not

mention it.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus declaration was signed in 1991 after the Gulf

War to facilitate economic and security cooperation between Arab

members of the U.S.-led coalition which drove Iraqi troops from

Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It groups Egypt, Syria and the six members of the Gulf

Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi

Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Hold Third Meeting to Solve Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A special committee formed

by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in charge of resolving

differences between two of its member states Bahrain and Qatar

will hold a third meeting in a further effort aimed at working

out a solution.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be convened after the second meeting of the

committee failed to reach any agreement Sunday, according to Saudi

Press Agency reports, which are monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The reports, citing sources close to the committee in Saudi

Arabian capital Riyadh today, said that the foreign ministers of

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman failed to

agree on the minutes that were supposed to be signed by the

foreign ministers of Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute has existed between Qatar and Bahrain

for years over the islands of Hawar, Fasht al-Dibal and the

Jaradah reefs. The three islands, reportedly rich in gas and oil,

lie just 1.5 to five kilometers off Qatar's coast and 25 to 30

kilometers from Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting was based on a recommendation made last

Tuesday to allow the foreign ministers of Qatar and Bahrain time

to refer to their respective governments the draft of the minutes

that propose clearing of the atmosphere between the two countries

as a prelude for settling their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the four-member committee, held in Riyadh

last Tuesday, discussed a problem-solving mechanism regarding the

strained Bahrain-Qatar ties mainly over border disputes.
</P>
<P>
As part of the mechanism, the commission was trying to

persuade Manama and Doha to sign a memorandum, which stipulates a

halt to media campaigns, resumption of dialogue and a pledge to

refrain from hosting each other's opponents.
</P>
<P>
The seven-point memorandum was drafted by regional power Saudi

Arabia that heads the committee. But the planned document was not

signed after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minutes represent a step forward to the target of the

Saudi initiated mediation for settling differences between Qatar

and Bahrain. The dispute is blocking an ambitious project to set

up a Gulf gas pipeline network put on the cards for several years.
</P>
<P>
The project, aimed to distribute natural gas from Qatar's

mammoth North Field, was floated in the early 1990s but was held

up due to financial problems and the conflict between the two

neighbors over the islands.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Singapore Agree to Boost Business Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Japan decided

here today to push forward their bilateral economic and business

cooperation as prime ministers of the two countries agreed to set

up two committees to this effect.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Singapore Foreign Ministry said that during

their talks this afternoon, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and his

Japanese counterpart Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed on the establishment

of a Japan-Singapore Business Council aimed at closer links

between the private sectors of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a Japan-Singapore Action Agenda

Committee (JSAAC) to follow up on a range of bilateral cooperation

proposals discussed at the second Japan-Singapore Symposium in

Singapore in November 1996 and the subsequent symposia.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Hashimoto and Goh endorsed the establishment of

a new framework for providing technical cooperation to third

countries based on the principle of equal partnership, and for

broadening bilateral cooperation in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and Singapore officials will work out the details of

this new technical assistance program for Asia Pacific and African

developing countries, which will be implemented this year, the

spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed on an exchange program for

Japanese and Singapore officials to increase direct contact and

understanding.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on regional and international issues

during their talks, which the spokesman said were "conducted in a

warm and friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto assured Goh of Japan's commitment to the continued

peace and stability in the region, and expressed Japan's wish to

place greater attention on Southeast Asia to further strengthen

Japan-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) relations,

the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two prime ministers recognized that it would be

useful for ASEAN and Japan to have more consultations at the

highest levels and agreed that it was time to broaden the scope of

ASEAN-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, ASEAN and Japan will explore new areas of

cooperation which are mutually beneficial, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here Sunday on a three-day official visit to

Singapore, his first as prime minister of Japan. He will leave for

home on Tuesday after delivering a policy speech on strengthening

relations between ASEAN and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcome dinner in honor of Hashimoto, Goh Chok

Tong said Japan can help sustain and strengthen peace and

stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that as the region is aware that Japan

perceives its society to be unique, Japan should also emphasize

its interdependence and interconnectedness with its Asian

neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"With a good feel and understanding for the sensitivities and

concerns of its Asian neighbors, Japan's leadership will be viewed

more positively," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the last stop of Hashimoto's five-nation Southeast

Asian tour, which also brought him to Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia,

and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary of Hong Kong is

 committed to establishing a court system which will be capable of

 operating in both English and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Each step taken in setting up the dual system of courts is a

cautious one, said Justice Power, the acting chief justice who

delivered a speech today at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Legal

 Year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong enacted the first bilingual ordinance in 1989 to lay

the foundation for greater use of Chinese in courts. By July 1,

1997, all of Hong Kong's ordinance will be bilingual.
</P>
<P>
The acting chief justice reviewed the process of using the

Chinese language in courts. At present, more than 60 percent of

cases are heard in Chinese in the magistrates' court while more

than 90 percent are heard in Chinese in the Labor and Small Claims

 Tribunals.
</P>
<P>
Since Chinese was authorized to be used in the District Court

in February 1995, 549 cases have been conducted in Chinese. In the

 High Court civil jurisdiction, five cases have already been heard

 and four criminal appeals have been set for hearing in Chinese in

 the Court of Appeal.

MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Minibus fares rose today from

1,500 to 2,000 Meticais (a US Dollar equals to 12,000 Meticais)

in Mozampique's capital of Maputo, said the Noticias

newspaper.
</P>

The hike, due to the mounting cost of transportation, has

nothing with Friday's triple increase of bus fares to 1,500

Meticais, Eugenio Filimone, the Chairman of Maputo Transporters

Association, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It seems residents do not complain much and crowded

minibuses are shuttling to and fro on the Kaunda Avenue in the

downtown area.

<HEADLINE> Tremor Felt in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A tremor occurred in Egypt at

noon today and was lightly felt by Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
Ramses Nashed, Head of the Seismological Section of the

National Institute for Astronomical and Geophysical Research, said

that the tremor measured 5.9 on the Richter scale at the epicenter

some 50 kilometers south of the Cyprus island.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Egypt felt the intensity of the

earthquake, but the waves of the shock were absorbed by the

Mediterranean Sea waters and reached the Greater Cairo weak, the

Egyptian MENA news agency quoted the expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Helwan Observatory of Egypt, located some 20 kilometers

south of the downtown of the capital, received identical

information from Jordan and France regarding the tremor.
</P>
<P>
Some inhabitants in Cairo felt shaking and spotted ceiling

lights swaying as the quake occurred at about 12:30 local

time (10:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Egypt sits on a belt with relatively frequent earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The last earthquake struck Egypt with a magnitude of 5.7 struck

Egypt on October 9, 1996, sending frightened Caireens into the

streets. It was also felt in Cyprus, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and

the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
On November 22, 1995, an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the

Richter scale hit Egypt and a number of other Middle East

countries. Several people were killed and some buildings damaged.
</P>
<P>
A quake measuring 5.9 shook Cairo on October 12, 1992, killing

more than 450 people and injuring some 4,000. Its epicenter was in

Fayoum, only 100 kilometers southwest of the capital.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Sound Political Ties with Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today

called for a sound political relationship with Germany to boost

trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the link should be on the basis of equality and mutual

benefit to avoid any disturbances to bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement this afternoon during a meeting in

Beijing with Heinrich Von Pierer, president of the renowned German

corporation Siemens AG.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said the Chinese government values its relationship

with Germany, with a hope that Siemens will continue its efforts

to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that German enterprises, particularly Siemens, have

obtained many projects in China's economic construction. Some

German companies have won the trust of their Chinese customers by

their sincere attitude towards cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Siemens, which has enjoyed a long history of business with

China, is one of China's major cooperation partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Premier, power and transportation industries

are the forerunners in China's national

economy. Telecommunications are also an important area. Foreign

business people have good opportunities in those spheres, with

equally strong competition.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that German enterprises will view their

cooperation with China from a long-term and strategic view, and

participate in equal competition by using their own advantages to

succeed.
</P>
<P>
Von Pierer said he shared Li's comments that sound political

ties are the prerequisite for sound economic cooperation, adding

that Siemens wishes to make contributions to the smooth

development of political and economic relations between the two

countries.
</P>
<P>
He was satisfied with Siemens' cooperation with China, saying

the two sides are undertaking cooperation in energy,

telecommunications and other areas, with joint ventures in China

also making remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
Siemens is full of confidence with its future cooperation in

China, added the company president.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Proposes Referendum on Russia-Belarus Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

has sent a message to his Belarus counterpart Alexander

Lukashenko, putting forth a strategic idea of a possible

referendum on unification of their two countries, a Kremlin

spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Press Secretary of the Russian President,

told a news briefing in the Kremlin that Yeltsin believes the two

former Soviet republics can be unified "in some form or other."
</P>
<P>
In his message, Yeltsin outlined a comprehensive program of

measures to speed up and deepen integration between the two

countries, the spokesman said, without giving details.
</P>
<P>
According to Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin also claimed that

Russian-Belarus Community works, and this should entail more

serious steps to broaden integration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Lukashenko reached agreement last spring that

Russia and Belarus would form a new-type "state union," which

reports here say does not mean a full unification of the two

countries, but indicates the most close ties between the two

countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Yeltsin's health, Yastrzhembsky said that the

president's "state of health is satisfactory and stable. The

temperature and other indicators are normal."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has hospitalized with pneumonia since January 8, over

two weeks after he returned to the Kremlin following a heart

bypass surgery he underwent on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it would be wrong to make haste about

releasing the president from the hospital now.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to let him recover fully and resume work in

full strength," Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship to Be Lifted out of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A famous warship that sank in the

China's Yangtze River during a Japanese attack in 1938 will be

lifted out of water before the Spring Festival (February 7), ten

days ahead of schedule, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Li Daqiang, deputy governor of central China's Hubei

Province, and also head of the group of officials supervising the

salvage project, said that the salvage work of the "Chungshan"

Warship will be completed earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
The warship, built in 1913, was named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen,

the forerunner of the Chinese democratic revolution, and was

involved in many historic incidents in the first half of the 20th

century.
</P>
<P>
"The day when the ship is hoisted from the water is being

brought closer because of the skills of the divers, and the clear

and warm weather," Li added.
</P>
<P>
The salvage operation started on November 12, 1996, and

most of the work has been completed.
</P>
<P>
With sand and mud removed from the wreckage, steel cables have

been placed under the sunken cruiser to form a steel net to lift

it out of water in one piece.
</P>
<P>
"The body of the warship has been raised out of the bed of the

Yangtze River, and the warship's forehead is just about five

meters under the surface of the water," Li Guanghui, director of

the salvage project said at the spot.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Chinese History sent a team of archaeologists to

the salvage spot. The archaeologists will shoot a film of the

warship underwater, and finish the first underwater archaeological

operation in China's history.
</P>
<P>
After the ship is salvaged, the "Chungshan" cruiser will be

sent to a shipyard to be restored to its former glory. It will

eventually look just as it did in 1925.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser warship will later be placed in Jinkou Township,

where it was sunk by Japanese bombers nearly six decades ago.
</P>
<P>
A museum will be built to complement the cruiser warship in the

township.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Big Growth of Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from the General

Administration of Customs show that China levied 85.07 billion

yuan in tariffs last year, up 21.75 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
China cut the customs duties on both imports and exports in

1996, and required traders in export processing to reserve a fund

in banks to encourage exports.
</P>
<P>
The country also adjusted policies to grant more duty-free

status or duty reductions.
</P>
<P>
All the measures were aimed to increase the country's tariffs,

a Chinese customs official said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, customs authorities also made efforts to

build up an effective information network for commodity prices on

the world market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 16 customs in China levied more than one billion

yuan in tariffs each, with Shanghai Customs hitting 21.9 billion

yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Almost Meets Macro-Economic Control Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China has largely met its

targets for macro-economic control, and this year will continue to

pursue a moderately tight monetary policy, the country's central

bank governor said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to our efforts in the past three or more years, we have

basically met our targets for macro-economic control focusing on

curbing inflation," Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's

Bank of China, told a national meeting on financial work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that cash plus demand deposits of enterprises,

China's measure of narrow money (M1), were valued at over 2.85

trillion yuan at the end of 1996, up 18.9 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The supply of broad money (M2), cash plus all sorts of

deposits, grew 25.3 percent year-on-year to more than 7.6 trillion

yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Both of the two indices grew by rates very close to the

targets we set at the beginning of 1996," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
China's targets for the two indicators were 18 percent and 25

percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's cash supply was up 11.6 percent to 91.7 billion yuan in

1996, compared with the 100 billion yuan limit imposed by the

State Council.
</P>
<P>
Deposits in China's banking system rose 1.48 trillion yuan, or

27.5 percent last year, while loans increased 1.06 trillion yuan,

or 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves expanded by 31.5 billion US

dollars to 105 billion US dollars by the end of last year, Dai

revealed, adding that the RMB yuan was stable throughout the

year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor also said that 1996 was a year that

marked evident progress in China's efforts to improve its

macro-financial control methods, improve financial regulation and

supervision, and further financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
China successfully employed monetary tools to fine tune the

money supply, Dai said, pointing to the fact that discount loans

to state-owned commercial banks dropped by a net 61.6 billion

yuan last year, despite the central bank's buying of hard currency

with 276.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that China last year issued more than 50 new

laws and regulations to enhance financial regulation, and the

central bank revoked the licenses of a number of illegal

financials institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Financial violations have been investigated and punished," Dai

said.
</P>
<P>
Financial reforms were deepened last year, he said, adding that

a total of 1,000 small-scale, inefficient subsidiaries of

state-owned commercial banks were cancelled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bills discounted last year were valued at 354.5 billion yuan in

January-November last year. Five major commercial banks wrote off

23.4 billion yuan in dead and bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that this year China will continue to strictly follow

a moderately tight monetary policy to keep the price increase

range lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
"Also this year, we will take effective measures to rectify

the financial order, and prevent and ward off financial risks," Dai

said.

<HEADLINE> S.African Police Chief Urges to Protect Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Police

Commissioner George Fivaz on Monday called for a revision of law to

make policemen on duty safer.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a spate of murders of policemen, Fivaz told reporters

that policemen were at a tactical disadvantage in which they could

only point their firearms once under direct threat.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that if this situation is remedied, the South

African police service will be in a far better position to counter

attacks on its personnel," Fivaz said.
</P>
<P>
The police chief called on policemen to maintain constant vigilance

and to use their training and equipment wherever possible to prevent

attacks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is on its hard way to national reconciliation

and democracy, has been battling against increasing crimes ever since

the abolition of apartheid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said while policemen have maintained upper hand

in the war against crimes throughout the country, they have also paid

heavy prices.
</P>
<P>
At least 427 policemen were killed and more wounded when they were

either on or off duty in the past two years, said the latest statistics

issued by the police.
</P>
<P>
In addition to dealing with bloody murders, the South African

police is also facing cash-strapped and understaffed problems.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted Pat Bosman, Chief of Police Financial Services,

as saying on Sunday that almost 1300 policemen will leave the force

this year while there will be no one to replace them. enditem

<HEADLINE> Japan, Singapore Agree to Boost Business Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Japan decided

here today to push forward their bilateral economic and business

cooperation as prime ministers of the two countries agreed to set

up two committees to this effect.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Singapore Foreign Ministry said that during

their talks this afternoon, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and his

Japanese counterpart Ryutaro Hashimoto agreed on the establishment

of a Japan-Singapore Business Council aimed at closer links

between the private sectors of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a Japan-Singapore Action Agenda

Committee (JSAAC) to follow up on a range of bilateral cooperation

proposals discussed at the second Japan-Singapore Symposium in

Singapore in November 1996 and the subsequent symposia.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Hashimoto and Goh endorsed the establishment of

a new framework for providing technical cooperation to third

countries based on the principle of equal partnership, and for

broadening bilateral cooperation in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and Singapore officials will work out the details of

this new technical assistance program for Asia Pacific and African

developing countries, which will be implemented this year, the

spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed on an exchange program for

Japanese and Singapore officials to increase direct contact and

understanding between government officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on regional and international issues

during their talks, which the spokesman said were "conducted in a

warm and friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto assured Goh of Japan's commitment to the continued

peace and stability in the region, and expressed Japan's wish to

place greater attention on Southeast Asia to further strengthen

Japan-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) relations,

the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two prime ministers recognized that it would be

useful for ASEAN and Japan to have more consultations at the

highest levels and agreed that it was time to broaden the scope of

ASEAN-Japan relations.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, ASEAN and Japan will explore new areas of

cooperation which are mutually beneficial, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here Sunday on a three-day official visit to

Singapore, his first as prime minister of Japan. He will leave for

home on Tuesday after delivering a policy speech on strengthening

relations between ASEAN and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a welcome dinner in honor of Hashimoto, Goh Chok

Tong said Japan can help sustain and strengthen peace and

stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that as the region is aware that Japan

perceives its society to be unique, Japan should also emphasize

its interdependence and interconnectedness with its Asian

neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"With a good feel and understanding for the sensitivities and

concerns of its Asian neighbors, Japan's leadership will be viewed

more positively," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the last stop of Hashimoto's five-nation Southeast

Asian tour, which also brought him to Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia,

and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> US National Punished for Smuggling Garbage into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- An American national was

sentenced to a ten-year jail term, and fined 500,000 yuan (about

60,000 US dollars) today for smuggling waste garbage into China

from the US.
</P>
<P>
William Ping Chen was handed the sentence by the Shanghai No.1

Intermediary People's Court in the first ruling. Chen was also

ordered to be deported.
</P>
<P>
In order to seek profit, William Ping Chen, 56, also known as

Bill Chen or Chen Pingyi, shipped from the United States a total

of 238 tons of domestic garbage and medical waste in 16 containers

into Shanghai between July and December of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was chairman of a Shanghai-based Sino-US paper making

company, imported the garbage into the city's Wusong Port and

Waigaoqiao Port Area.
</P>
<P>
He had claimed the imports were waste paper and mixed paper,

under the name of the "China Exports Commodity Base Construction

Anhui Company" and the "Zhejiang Provincial Animal By-products

Imports and Exports Corporation."
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings by the Shanghai Municipal Environmental

Protection Bureau, and the opposition from Chinese employees, Chen

shipped the garbage by sea on five occasions, and was finally

seized by the Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau and

Shanghai Customs Office.
</P>
<P>
After examination, the Shanghai Imports and Exports Commodity

Inspection Bureau and Shanghai Municipal Environmental Protection

Bureau found that the garbage was pollutive to the environment

and was prohibited from being imported under Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
The court held hearings on December 2 last year into Chen's

case, in which he entrusted two defence lawyers. The

U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai sent representatives to attend

the hearings. Chen candidly confessed his offence.
</P>
<P>
After hearing his case, the court ruled that the garbage Chen

had illegally imported damaged China's environment and threatened

the health of its people.
</P>
<P>
The court concluded that he had committed the crime of

smuggling and should be punished according to the Criminal Law of

the People's Republic of China, and a regulation adopted by the

Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on punishing

the crime of smuggling.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Pakistani Prime

Minister Nawaz Sharif and visiting British Prime Minister John

Major met here today and exchanged views on matters of mutual

interest.
</P>
<P>
Major stressed that one of the important purposes of his

three-day official visit to Pakistan is to encourage British

investment in Pakistan, according to a press release issued by

Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz Group) (PML-N).
</P>
<P>
He said there would be a "scope for substantial British

investment in Pakistan" if the country can have a strong and

stable government after the forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the second largest investor in Pakistan after the

United States.
</P>
<P>
PML (N) President Nawaz noted that Pakistan's economic policies

when he was the prime minister had opened up the country's economy

through deregulation and privatization and helped open doors to

foreign private investment in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, former Pakistani prime minister and chairperson

of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), called on Major on Sunday

evening.
</P>
<P>
PPP and PML (N) are the two largest political parties in

Pakistan to contest the elections scheduled for February 3.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Briefed on Jordan's Mediations in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua)-- Jordanian Prime Minister

Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti today conveyed a message to Egyptian

President Hosni Mubarak from King Hussein whose shuttle mediations

Sunday seemed to have worked after the U.S. efforts collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who arrived here this morning on a lightning visit to

Egypt, briefed Mubarak on the outcome of the intense mediations by

Hussein in a bid to salvage the negotiations between the

Palestinian National Authority and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr

Moussa and Presidential Political Advisor Osama el-Baz also

attended the Mubarak-Kabariti meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch flew to Israel Sunday night to meet Prime

Minister Binyamin Netanyahu after talks with Palestinian leader

Yasser Arafat in Gaza to find ways to sidestep difficulties

blocking a comprehensive deal on expanding Palestinian self-rule

in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in Gaza, a spokesman for Arafat said the king

has persuaded the Palestinian leader to accept a prolonged Israeli

pullback from West Bank rural areas and intended to present

Netanyahu with a "new formula" for breaking the Hebron

deadlock. But he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross' three-week diplomacy nearly

sewed up a deal to launch Palestinian self-rule in 80 percent of

Hebron before Israel last Tuesday demanded further withdrawals be

completed in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian turned down the proposal and the

U.S. compromise date of 1998, demanding for strict implementation

by Israeli of the Oslo II Accords, which envision three pullbacks

to be finished in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Following the 90-minute talks with Hussein, Netanyahu voiced

confidence that "the end of negotiations" is in sight, "because of

the important initiative His Majesty took we have made

considerable progress."
</P>
<P>
He also lauded the Jordanian monarch as "a great friend of

Israel and a great friend of peace." Jordan made peace with Israel

in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Palestinian and Israeli negotiators

resumed talks in Jerusalem today to draft arrangements in the

post-Hebron redeployment stages under Jordanian compromise

agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dany Levy, Israeli Cabinet Secretary who is member of the

negotiating team, was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that the

deal would be initialed today unless new demands are raised.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Impeachment Move Against Him Won't Prosper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos

said here today that the impeachment move against him in the

Senate over the national computerized identification (ID) system

would not prosper.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed the impeachment threat as a "non-issue"

and branded it "nothing new."
</P>
<P>
He denied that he violated any power by issuing an

administrative order to adopt the national ID system.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople warned last Saturday

that Ramos could face impeachment unless he withdraws his order

for the implementation of the ID system.
</P>
<P>
"The president usurped the legislative power long after he had

lost his law-making power under the 1987 Constitution," Ople said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition against the ID system mounted as several

militant groups threatened to launch massive protests. They

charged that the new scheme "is a prelude to martial law which

limits civil and political liberties."
</P>
<P>
However, Solicitor General Silvestre Bello shared the same view

with President Ramos that the initial public rejection of the

system and the impeachment move would eventually die down.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos had created an inter-agency coordinating

committee to draw up the implementing guidelines and oversee the

implementation of the system, with Executive Secretary Ruben

Torres as chairman.
</P>
<P>
Citing the advantages of a single national identification

system, Ramos said this would allow Filipino citizens and foreign

residents to conveniently transact business with basic services

and social security agencies.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Continue Defense Program: Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will

not play along with Turkey's efforts to create tension on the

island after its decision to purchase Russian-made S-300

anti-aircraft missiles, Defense Minister Costas Eliades has said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Sunday night at the Larnaca Airport shortly

before departure for Athens, where he is expected to discuss

defense issues and latest development on the island with Greek

leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency today quoted Eliades as saying that the

Cyprus government will continue its defense military program in

an effort to avert any external threats against the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they are

deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' deal to buy Russian missiles, officially announced

last week, has been criticized not only by Turkey, but also by the

United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reported decision of Turkish Foreign

Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish army commander Ismail Hakki

Karadayin to visit the Turkish-controlled northern part of

Cyprus, Eliades said it was another attempt on the part of

Turkey to create tension.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister noted that the issue of Turkish threats

against Cyprus will be discussed during his meetings with the

leadership of the National Defense Ministry in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Eliades is accompanied by National Guard Commander Nicolaos

Vorvolakos and the president and members of the House of

Representatives Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops

landed and seized northern third of the island following an

Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November

1993 to face possible Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the

Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of

the island would mean war between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Leaders on Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today

called on local leaders to remain sober-minded in the drive to

boost the country's grain production.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a top-level conference in Beijing, Jiang, who is

also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central

Committee, urged leaders not to be blinded by optimism because of

good grain harvests during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He noted: "The Party's leadership over agriculture and rural

work must be strengthened, the good situation in agricultural

development maintained and promoted, and this year's basic task

for agriculture and rural work must be accomplished."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with leaders from

central authorities and local governments attending the Central

Rural Working Conference that concluded this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-premier Zhu Rongji also made

important speeches about agriculture at the meeting, which was

presided over by Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun.
</P>
<P>
After listening to the reports, Jiang praised rural officials

for their strenuous efforts in boosting agricultural production

and developing rural economies.
</P>
<P>
He said that good grain harvests in recent years, and the

all-round development of the rural economy have played a vital role in

ensuring adequate supplies of farm products, reining in inflation,

improving macro-economic conditions, and promoting sound growth

of the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We must make a full appraisal of the arduousness of increasing

this year's grain output, and never treat it lightly," Jiang

stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged Party members to go all out to fulfill the task of

achieving sustained growth of agriculture this year.
</P>
<P>
The leader stressed the importance of ensuring a sustained and

steady increase in grain and other major farm products, as well as

in farmers' income, stepping up the construction of water

conservancy facilities, and maintaining the stability of the rural

society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged party committees at various levels to put

agriculture in first place in economic work, continuously increase

input in agriculture, strengthen the Party's grassroots

organizations in rural areas, and carry forward the Party's fine

tradition and style of work.

<P>
Speaking at the conference, Premier Li Peng noted that an

important task now facing China is the promotion of steady growth

in agriculture following good harvests for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments at various levels to unswervingly follow

the principle of boosting agricultural and grain production,

protect farmers' initiative, expand channels of grain circulation,

and optimize the grain circulation system.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Premier said, efforts must be made to support

state farms to enter the grain market, and to encourage grain-use

firms to buy grain directly in grain production areas.
</P>
<P>
Calling the integration of trade, industry and agriculture as

"a new growth area" in the rural economy, Li urged local

governments to list the job of promoting its development as a

major task in the coming years, and to support it through various

channels.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to raise the overall quality and

economic efficiency of township-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the township enterprises should make full use of local

resources, and promote cooperation between east and west China.
</P>
<P>
He also called for advanced agricultural technology to become

more widespread, noting that agricultural output is sure to

increase substantially if current advanced techniques are brought

fully into use.
</P>
<P>
The development of rural collective economies should rely on

industries based on local resources and labor-intensive

industries, such as crop cultivation, livestock breeding, farm

products processing and transporting, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that

the stability and continuity of the government's agricultural

policy should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
"China's grain is not in surplus, " Zhu said," we should

analyze the reasons for the good grain harvests in an objective

way."
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to do a good job in purchasing

and storing grain to maintain the stability of grain prices, and

to protect the interests of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Some temporary problems cropping after good harvests are sure

to be solved if various policies are implemented to the letter,

Zhu said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq

Leghari and visiting British Prime Minister John Major held

wide-ranging talks here today on their countries' economic

cooperation, Pakistan's political situation and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour-long meeting, Leghari reiterated his "firm

resolve to ensure that elections are held as scheduled on February

3," said a press release issued after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said many steps have been taken by the caretaker

government to strengthen the office of the Chief Election

Commissioner and to ensure a peaceful, orderly and totally free

and fair election process.
</P>
<P>
He told Major that international observers have also been

invited to monitor the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president dissolved the National Assembly and

dismissed the government of Benazir Bhutto on November 5 last

year.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has announced that general elections

for the national and provincial assemblies will be held on

February 3.
</P>
<P>
Leghari described Pakistan's relations with Britain as

excellent and praised the British government for being the second

biggest investor in his country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the 20-member business delegation

accompanying Major would have "meaningful discussions" with their

Pakistani counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Major, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day official visit to

Pakistan, said Britain is deeply concerned over the potential

danger posed by the current situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all Afghan parties would cooperate with the U.N.

process to achieve a lasting solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Leghari agreed that "The continuing instability in that country

was not only a threat to the region, but to international peace as

well."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Pakistan is opposed to all outside

interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs and is seeking a

peaceful solution based on the participation of all the parties

concerned.
</P>
<P>
On the Indo-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir, Major said the

solution of the Kashmir problem would unleash the potential for

the development of the region and could lure in multiplying

foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"The British government understood the rationale for the

positions taken by the parties concerned and if there were

prospects for a solution, Britain would be happy to play its part

in helping to achieve a solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the last leg of Major's South Asia tour, which also

took him to India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
A business delegation, including top executives from British

companies, is visiting South Asia to explore the potential of

trade between Britain and the region.

TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Olympic Committe

(JOC) president Hironoshin Furuhashi slapped the organisers

of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Japan Monday for dismissing

speed skating as an uninteresting sport.
</P>
<P>
"I called on the NAOC (Nagano Olympic Organising Committee) to

correct their attitude," Furuhashi said.
</P>
<P>
"They lack close communications with associations of Olympic

sports," he said. "A lack of mutual understanding produces

remarks which can be misunderstood."
</P>
<P>
Nagano governor Goro Yoshimura, who is also vice chairman of

the organising committee, stirred controversy last week when he

commented on winter sports.
</P>
<P>
As protests from skating officials grew, Yoshimura retracted

what he called "careless" remarks and apologised later for

causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
The gaffe has added controversy to organisational problems,

including red-tape, local apathy and shortages of hotels, which

have dogged preparations for the Games due to open in 13 months.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Buy Iraqi Oil at Higher Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will pay Iraq for oil

imports at a higher price than what they have agreed upon,

Jordan's official news agency Petra reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was decided at a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister

Abdul Karim Kabariti with visiting Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister

Tariq Aziz here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Both sided agreed that Jordan will pay for the oil at a price

higher than before and Iraq will pay for Jordanian food,

medicine and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Jordan at first proposed that it will provide Iraq with food

and medicine in exchange for Iraq's oil at a low price, but Iraq

has refused the idea.
</P>
<P>
Petra also reported that a new agreement will be signed on

bilateral trade during Aziz' stay here.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first official visit to Jordan by a

high-ranking Iraqi official since the bilateral ties cooled down

last year when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law fled

to the kingdom for asylum.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq have been discussing the oil agreement since

December and technical experts are currently continuing

negotiations Baghdad, Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last week, both sides agreed that Iraq will in 1997 supply

Jordan with 75,000 barrels of oil, half of them free of charge and

the other half sold at a favorable price of 15.25 U.S. dollars a

barrel. The price used to be anywhere between five dollars to 13

dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also reportedly complied with Jordan's demand to increase

its oil supply by 7 percent in 1997 over 1996. However, this

quota will be sold to Amman at the price set by the international

market.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil supply to Jordan is exempt from the United

Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stopped over in Jordan en route to France, where he is

expected to hold talks with French Prime Minister Alain Juppe

and Foreign Minister Herve de Charette.
</P>
<P>
It will be Aziz's third visit to France since the 1991 Gulf

War, following France's decision last month to withdraw from a

new Turkey-based multinational air force to protect Kurds in

northern Iraq.

MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos

today rallied the private sector and the general public behind the

government's efforts to protect children from all forms of abuses.
</P>
<P>
He made the call during an hour-long dialogue in the

Presidential Palace with some 50 abused children under the custody

of various social welfare institutions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"We must all pull our talents, dedication, and resources

together in government, the private sector and the concerned

citizenry to ensure the protection of children from abuse," he

said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been taking various measures to

protect Filipino children from all kinds of abuses and

exploitation during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Ramos noted that the government prohibited the employment of

children under 15 years of age, assisted a total of 1,390 sexually

exploited and abused children, mobilized media in the campaign

against child abuse and provided basic services to children of

poor families.
</P>
<P>
In inviting the children, Ramos fulfilled the wishes of ten of

them who earlier wrote him letters, asking for a chance to see him

in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Most of those whose letters were read and answered by Ramos

were victims of parental abuses. Some of the children sought

financial assistance for their education while others asked for

low-cost housing for their families.

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister

Ryutaro Hashimoto called here today for greater joint efforts by

the ASEAN nations and Japan to add breadth and depth to their

relations which have so far centered on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hashimoto said both sides must

address welfare, drugs and environmental protection issues. Japan

could share with Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)

countries its experiences so that the ASEAN would not repeat the

same mistakes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister arrived here on Sunday on a

three-day official visit, the first as chief of the Japanese

government. Singapore is the last stop of Hashimoto's five-nation

Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Brunei, Malaysia,

Indonesia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said leaders of the five ASEAN countries he had just

visited, including Singapore, were receptive to his idea of an

annual informal summit meeting between ASEAN and Japanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would send his deputies to Thailand and the

Philippines, two ASEAN member countries which Hashimoto did not

visit this time, to brief them on the proposal, before they agree

on how the summit will take shape.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also said his talks with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

this afternoon were "very constructive." They discussed the

Asia-Europe Foundation, which was proposed by Goh last March, he

said, adding that Japan has promised to give 2 million U.S.

dollars to the foundation by the end of March this year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Crime Rate Falls to 15-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's crime rate

dropped to a 15-year low at 1,253 per 100,000 people in 1996,

making it one of the safest cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
The rate represented a 16-percent decrease from 1,493 per

100,000 people in 1995, said Commissioner of Police Eddie Hui

Ki-on, who gave a review of Hong Kong's crime situation in 1996

here today.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong continued to be one of the world's safest cities

thanks to our fundamental policing philosophy of ground coverage,

patrolling the streets and maintaining a highly visible law

enforcement presence," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by police show that the number of violent

crimes reported stood at 15,191 cases in 1996, down 11 percent

from the previous year. The total number of crimes last year was

79,050, a decline of 14 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hui said: "We continue to build a strong relationship with law

enforcement agencies around the world, and with China in

particular."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Police have developed working-level contacts with

their counterparts in the Chinese mainland, sharing intelligence

and helping each other with on-going investigations into such

crimes as drug smuggling, cross-border fraud and illegal

immigration.
</P>
<P>
Hui said the police force would drop its "royal" title from

July 1, 1997, and there would be some minor changes in the

insignia. He emphasized that the force would continue to be solely

responsible for the maintenance of law and order in Hong Kong

after the handover.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The gambling business dropped by

some six percent in 1996 compared with the previous year, a Macao

casino magnate said.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho, president of the Macao Tourism and Amusement

Company Limited, told reporters at a welfare fair on Sunday that

casino business made a recovery in the latter half of 1996 and the

year's business dropped by 6 percent, compared with an expected

decline of 10 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Gambling income decreased by over 10 percent in 1996, mainly

because of a worsening security environment, the magnate said,

adding that the business recovered after police deployed personnel

in casinos, improving order there.
</P>
<P>
Ho denied rumors that he is opening casinos in Canada, but

confirmed that his company has planned to start a new casino in a

major hotel in Macao, bringing the total number of casinos to 10.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The business receipts in most

of Hong Kong's service industries continued to show year-on-year

increases in value terms in the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released today show that the financing

industry, except banking, registered the fastest growth of 24

percent, while communications and business services industries

also jumped by 19 percent and 15 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The official release attributed the strong growth in business

receipts in the financing industry to the soaring stock market

turnover.
</P>
<P>
It said the significant increase in the communications industry

was related to the rapid expansion of mobile telephone services

while the growth in the business services industry was

attributable to marked increases in demand for legal services and

various miscellaneous business services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, considerable gains in business receipts were also

registered in banking industry, hotels and transport.
</P>
<P>
Yet business receipts in the wholesale industry dropped by three

percent in value terms, which was mainly due to a fall in business

receipts in the wholesale of raw materials and semi-manufactures.

NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- India wants to resume

foreign-secretary-level talks with Pakistan to improve bilateral

relations, Indian External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral said

today.
</P>
<P>
He said that India was willing to talk with Pakistan on any

issue and that New Delhi had already taken several unilateral

steps to improve relations with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
India's offer to resume the talks, stalled since January 1994,

was first made last June by Prime Minister Deve Gowda in his

letter to the then Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
It was repeated when Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yakub

Khan came to India last month for a conference of foreign

ministers of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation

(SAARC).
</P>
<P>
However, Islamabad has so far made no response to India's

initiative, Gujral said.
</P>
<P>
"We stand by the letter if the present caretaker government or

the next government of Pakistan wants to start talks on any issue

for normalizing relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since their separation in 1947, India and Pakistan have gone to

war three times and both sides have claimed sovereignty over

Kashmir, which is the most thorny problem in their bilateral

relations.
</P>
<P>
Gujral stressed that India was committed to developing friendly

relationships with all neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Tung Urges Efforts to Boost HK Youth's Confidence in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive-Designate

Tung Chee-hwa today appealed for joint efforts to boost the

confidence of the youth in Hong Kong's returning to the

motherland, while encouraging the young generation to contribute

more to the territory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong United Youth

Association, Tung stressed that the youth stand as an important

force in Hong Kong society since they represent the direction Hong

Kong is heading for.
</P>
<P>
Some young people, however, are still worried about the

handover, Tung said, noting that the latest opinion poll showed

more than 80 percent of HK residents are confident about the

handover.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tung said, society, youth organizations and those

engaged in education in particular, and parents can do much to

help enhance the youth's confidence in future Hong Kong, their

sense of responsibility and belonging to the society and their

knowledge of the motherland and the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that his administration, which is to be formed

in days to come, will attach great importance to the youth and

create more opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts by all sides, the young generation will

undoubtedly gain much more confidence in the future and make

greater contribution to the society while getting a better

understanding of the excellent traditional Chinese values and

becoming proud of being Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Before the luncheon, Tung chatted with some 300 representatives

from about 20 local youth organizations on the youth policy to be

adopted by the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region

(HKSAR) government and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
It was the first face-to-face exchange between Tung and the

organizations since he was elected the first chief executive of

the HKSAR on December 11, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Focus on Development of Government-Subsidized Apartment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai municipal

government is to give apartment building and home renovation a

massive boost in a bid to improve residents' housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to assist real estate business people in the

supply of housing land, with reductions or exemptions from taxes.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to stimulate development of government subsidized

apartments and the improvement of living condition, said Wang

Wenzhong, director of the Municipal Apartment Development Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the next five years, Shanghai will

construct apartments with a total floor space of 50 million square

meters, at a cost of 150 billion yuan (18.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will launch reforms in the apartment distribution

system, with distribution on a welfare basis shifted to sales of

apartments.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will distribute government subsidized

apartments to low and medium income families, and sell apartments

to high income families.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of housing reforms, residents have changed

their attitude towards housing. Statistics show that among the

apartments sold in 1996 on the real estate market, about 54

percent were bought by individuals, up 20 percent over the

previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, prices of most of the apartments for sale are beyond

the financial capability of ordinary residents. About three

million square meters of such apartments are left unsold.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 13 million residents, with eight square meters of

living space for each person.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 each resident in Shanghai will have a living space of

ten square meters. The 3.6 million square meters of dilapidated

and shack-type houses will be renovated.

<P>
Lagos, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Four persons were killed and

eight others injured in a gas explosion in Warri, a major city in

Delta State, southern Nigeria, on Saturday, the Guardian

newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when cooking gas cylinders were being off

loaded from a lorry. As some of the cylinders were leaking, the gas

became tense in the air and people began to flee from the scence.
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver also started his car to escape, but immediately the

car was ignited. There was an explosion and fire soon engulfed the

off-loading lorry, an eye witness was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged woman and two of her children playing nearby were

killed in the explosion. The fourth victim is also a child.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, Syria Voice Concern Over Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Syrian leaders have

jointly expressed their concern about the situation in occupied

Palestine, Lebanon and Northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The concern was voiced at a meeting between Iran's First

Vice-President Hassan Habibi and his Syrian Counterpart

Abdul-Halim Khaddam on bilateral and regional issues here Sunday,

Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam was quoted as saying that as far as the views of the

two countries on regional issues were concerned, Iran and Syria

were even closer today than they had ever been.
</P>
<P>
He said "the peculiar behavior of the Zionist regime and its

plots and conspiracies in the Middle East warranted special

watchfulness by Muslim nations of the region."
</P>
<P>
But IRNA did not say if the two leaders discussed Syria's

stance toward Iran in a dispute with the United Arab Emirates over

three islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Syria has joined other Gulf countries in acknowledging UAE's

right to the sovereignty of Abu Mussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs

and urging Iran to end its "occupation" of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam arrived here Sunday

afternoon on a two-day official visit to Tehran amid a wave of

criticism by Iranian media for Damascus' stance towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian government has kept silent to avoid causing any

damages to the strategic relations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam has expressed pleasure at his visit to Tehran saying

that the Syrian officials had always benefited from meetings with

Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Start New Payment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is ready

to start a new electronic payment system this week to reduce paper

work for companies which want to transfer money across different

bank accounts, a local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system which is expected to start functioning on

Thursday, companies could simply submit a payment record on

diskette to the bank to draw money, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, recipients of payments have to keep several sets of

payment records and separate accounts when they have to transfer

money from different bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank officials said that the system will apply to

all local and foreign banks and it will help companies, for

example, to facilitate their salary, dividend, power or water

supply payments.
</P>
<P>
The system is the final step of the first phase of the central

bank's project to computerize the country's payment system, the

newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank introduced an electronic money transfer

network among banks and an electronic cheque-clearing system in

the country last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Phones Mubarak Amid Hopes of Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

this morning received a telephone call from U.S. President Bill

Clinton amid speculation that a Palestinian-Israeli deal on a

long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from Hebron might be

initialed today.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents reviewed intensive contacts Sunday in

an attempt to overcome obstacles hindering the deal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked Mubarak to pursue his efforts and contacts

with the Israelis and Palestinians to salvage and boost the

Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross Sunday night canceled his plan

to return home after spotting progress in a flurry of intense

peace talks Sunday involving the Palestinian Authority, Israel,

Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday night, Arafat phoned Mubarak for the third time

and briefed him on the developments of the Palestinian-Israeli

Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to salvage the negotiations, Jordan's King Hussein

flew to Israel to meet Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu after

talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza to find ways

to sidestep difficulties blocking the deal.
</P>
<P>
In a more upbeat tone, Israel Radio quoted reliable Israeli

Knesset sources as saying Sunday night that all differences on

Hebron have been settled with the agreement expected to be signed

at the Erez crossing today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that all the obstacles impeding a

Hebron pullback deal, including setting a timetable for the future

redeployment in the rest of the West Bank, have been removed.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the head of the Israeli negotiating

team and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat would sign the

agreement.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Syria Coordinate to Remove Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik

Hariri has said that he and Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi

will co-chair a meeting at the weekend to remove bilateral trade

obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be attended also by the two country's

government ministers, is aimed at paving the way for exporting of

Lebanese goods to Syria and through it to other Arab countries,

Hariri was quoted by today's local daily An-Nahar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Beirut from visit to Syria last night, the

Lebanese premier complained that his country does not export many

things to Syria, "but we import (from Syria) without organization

and this importation is sometimes harmful." He described this

phenomena as "not natural."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon suffered an estimated deficit of 167 million

U.S. dollars in its trade with Syria last year, a result of 236

million dollars of Syrian products arriving in Lebanon being

offset by only 69 million dollars of Lebanese goods entering Syria.
</P>
<P>
Three agreements involving customs, taxation and investments

were signed in the Syrian capital of Damascus Sunday, just before

the two sides ended a two-day meeting of the Lebanese-Syrian

coordination committee.
</P>
<P>
The customs agreement will lead to the establishment of

jointly-manned border posts to facilitate the transit of goods and

people, an official source here explained.
</P>
<P>
The other two accords involved a 29-point agreement on

preventing double taxation and an 11-point agreement comprising

guarantees and incentives for investment.
</P>
<P>
Three memorandums of understanding, respectively dealing with

water, commercial exchanges and transport, were also concluded

during the meeting, the same anonymous source added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri described possibility of an economic union between

Lebanon and Syria as "premature" because of their different

economic systems although the economies are complementary to each

other.
</P>
<P>
He announced that further meetings would take place over the

next two months to study agricultural, industrial and commercial

relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denies Reports to Buy French Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Deputy Prime

Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan ibn Abdul-Aziz has

denied reports that his planned visit to France would be

designed to make deals to purchase arms.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency today quoted the defense minister as saying

that his visit which is expected later this year would be aimed at

improving Saudi-French ties.
</P>
<P>
The minister declared last week that he had received the

French invitation to pay a visit to Paris.
</P>
<P>
Saudi press reports said Riyadh may work out a deal with

Paris to buy 250 French-made tanks during his trip.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest single arms buyers in the

world, with a defense budget of 13.2 billion U.S. dollars in

1995.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has seen heavy deliveries of major weapons

systems in 1996 ordered in the flush of the Gulf War victory,

according to Saudi industrial sources.
</P>
<P>
The same sources added that they are keen to acquire between

150 and 225 main battle tanks to add to its well stocked arsenal

of 315 General Dynamics main battle tanks--the Abrams MIA1.
</P>
<P>
The main contenders for the deal was reported to be the

French GIAT Industries' Leclerc main battle tank and the Vickers

Challenger II of Britain.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon, at the head a large

delegation of defense officials and businessmen, visited Saudi

Arabia last April for talks with Sultan ibn Abdul Aziz.

<HEADLINE> Hussein's Meeting with Arafat, Netanyahu Vital: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein's shuttle between

Gaza and Tel Aviv was "extremely vital" for the Israelis and

Palestinians to conclude a final agreement on Hebron, an Israeli

envoy said here today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Shimon Shamir said the king's

efforts came at the right time to achieve the progress in the

Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the Israeli withdrawal from

the West Bank town of Hebron, according to Jordan Radio.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's visit would also contribute to the improvement

of Jordanian-Israeli ties, which turned frosty after the Western

Wall Tunnel crisis last September, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis may finalize the Heron agreement

today after removing the main obstacles during Hussein's

mediation visit Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister

Binyamin Netanyahu will probably hold talks in 48 hours, Jordan

Radio quoted officials from both sides as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's effort came at the urging of U.S. special Middle

East coordinator Dennis Ross, who had planned to return to

Washington Sunday after a two-week mediation effort but

finally decided to stay to take part in the king's talks with

Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein returned here early this morning after

making intense efforts in Gaza and Tel Aviv to save an

Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Before returning home, the king said: "We are on the

verge of completion of a long road and as far as I am

concerned, I leave here confident everything will lead in the

right direction."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due to meet today

again to try and finalize an agreement on the Israeli army's

redeployment in Hebron, which may be initialed later today.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to finalize other three stages of further

redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, to be joined by U.S. representatives,

will meet at 10:00 a.m. local time (0800GMT) this morning in

Jerusalem, and are expected to be able to complete drafting the

long-awaited Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough followed a dramatic summit meeting late

Sunday night between Netanyahu and King Hussein in Tel Aviv

with the participation of Ross and Palestinian negotiator

Saeb Erekat, as well as Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak

Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession

that appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron

agreement during his meeting with Arafat earlier Sunday in the

Gaza Strip before he flew from Gaza to Tel Aviv for the

late night meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A senior PNA official said that Arafat agreed to Hussein's

proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage withdrawal

from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the key

sticking point in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Peace Talks Begin in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghan factions started a

meeting here today under the UN auspices to negotiate an immediate

ceasefire and formation of a technical working group.
</P>
<P>
According to UN sources, the talks would focus on ceasefire and

formation of a technical group to oversee the ceasefire, exchange

of prisoners, discussions on a broad-based interim government to

supervise elections, demilitarization of Kabul and the creation of

a neutral security force in the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources said the anti-Taliban Supreme Council for the

Defense of Afghanistan has nominated its three representatives

including Rasul Talib of Shiite Hezb-i-Wahdat, Mohammad Painda of

northern warlord Rashid Dostum's Junbish-i-Milli while Engineer

Ishaq has flown in on behalf of Commander Ahmad Shah Masood and

the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have also nominated their Ambassador to Pakistan

Masoon Afghani as well as Wakil Ahmad and Mullah Wahab to attend

the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at the UN office is being conducted by the UN

Secretary General's special envoy, Norbert Holl, who is expected

to announce the result of talks later today.
</P>
<P>
The talks scheduled in Ashkhabad were moved to Islamabad after

the Taliban's refusal to go to the central Asian republic of

Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
However, it is reported that the Taliban's insisted that the

talks should be preceded by exchange of prisoners while the

anti-Taliban factions have been demanding demilitarization of

Kabul as a pre-condition for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, taking capital of Kabul on September 27

last year, now hold two thirds of the war-torn Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Growth in Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas tourists

in China's Hubei Province reached 320,000 last year, up nearly 20

percent from the previous year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
During that time, 20 million domestic tourists also visited the

province, bringing in 2.8 billion yuan in profits, an increase of

more than 50 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dajiang, deputy director of the provincial tourism bureau,

says that Hubei is making greater effort at improving its tourism,

and hopes that the current tourism growth can continue.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken to improve tourism services. Ninety

travel agencies were shut down for illegal or irregular service in

1996. This year the province will make regular checks on travel

services and scenic spots, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The province's tourism sector now employs nearly 100,000

people, and by the end of the century, more than 90 percent of

Hubei's tour guides will have a college education or more, Liu

said, adding that more training will be provided for staff members.
</P>
<P>
Hubei spent more than 760 million yuan on tourism last year,

building new tourist attractions. More than 20 scenic spots were

added to Shennongjia, a place which is said to be the home of the

legendary "Big Foot", or wild man.

AMMAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan

returned here early this morning after making intense efforts

in Gaza and Tel Aviv to save an Israeli-Palestinian agreement

on Israel's military withdrawal from the West Bank town of

Hebron.

Hussein Sunday shuttled between Gaza and Tel Aviv for

<HEADLINE> Growing Number Of Medium-Sized And Small Cities In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of cities in China

has risen to 640, with 565 of them medium-sized or small ones,

according to the Minister of Construction Hou Jie.
</P>
<P>
Hou told Xinhua today that the country's urbanization is

characterized by the emergence of city clusters, a proliferation

of medium-sized and small cities, and growing urbanization in the

central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The country's urbanization strategy of "controlling the number

and scale of large and extra-large cities and to give greater room

to medium-sized and small cities as well as small rural towns," he

noted, has begun to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Vigorous local growth has caused the emergence of city clusters

nationwide. Most are concentrated in the Yangtze and Zhujiang

river delta areas, or the Liaoning Peninsula, and the

Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area.
</P>
<P>
Many other city clusters came into being because they are close

to key communications and border-trade cities.
</P>
<P>
Hou noted that rapid urbanization has also improved the uneven

distribution of cities in the eastern, central, and western parts

of the country to some degree. These three areas now account for

44, 37, and 19 percent, respectively, of the total number of

cities.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and

Ningxia, and Hubei, Qinghai, Shanxi, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi

provinces are seeing faster urbanization than the country as a

whole.
</P>
<P>
Hou said he expects the number of cities to reach 800 by the

turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> GCC Mediation in Members' Disputes Yields No Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The second special meeting

by a four-side Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ministerial

commission charged with resolving differences between Bahrain and

Qatar produced no positive results, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab

Emirates and Oman concluded their meeting in Saudi Arabian

capital of Riyadh Sunday, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the four-men committee, which was held

in Riyadh last Tuesday had discussed a problem-solving mechanism

plan regarding to the strained Bahrain-Qatar ties caused by

border disputes.
</P>
<P>
The commission discussed an Saudi-proposed plan to persuade

Manama and Doha to sign a memorandum stipulating a stoppage of

media campaigns, adoption of a dialog and a pledge to refrain from

hosting opponents, according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But evidences showed that the seven-point memorandum of

understanding was not reached after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The commission mentioned no word on the just-concluded meeting

nor on the schedule for the next one.
</P>
<P>
However, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al-Saud,

head of the committee, in earlier statements had described the

first meeting of the committee as a positive step towards ending

all border disputes among GCC member states as recommended by

GCC leaders during their summit in Doha last December.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in a border dispute over a

number of small bare Gulf islands which are controlled by Bahrain

since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's Cabinet Affairs and Information Minister Mohammad

Ibraihim al-Mutawae said in remarks published Sunday that "if

there is any signing on anything that achieves strong ties, then

Bahrain is willing."
</P>
<P>
The long-time border dispute between the two countries is

blocking an ambitious project to set up a Gulf gas pipeline

network that has been in the cards for several years.
</P>
<P>
The project to distribute natural gas from Qatar's mammoth

North Field was floated in the early 1990s but was held up by

financial problems and the conflict between the two neighbors

over the islands.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses Israeli Conditions for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister

Farez Boueiz has dismissed as "vague and unacceptable" Israel's

offer to withdraw from south Lebanon, but did not rule out

possibility to resume negotiations with Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Daily Star, the only English daily

in Beirut, Boueiz put up three conditions before Lebanon could

consider the resumption of peace talks with Israel, which broke

off last year.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in response to a statement made last week by

Israel's chief coordinator on Lebanon, Uri Lubrani, who said

Israel would be prepared to withdraw from Lebanon without a

peace treaty if it was guaranteed that guerrilla attacks on its

northern border could cease.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has already rejected two other proposals for

withdrawal presented by the Israeli rightwing Likud government

of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
These were the so-called "Lebanon first" proposal, and the

other which called for the deployment of joint

Egyptian-Jordanian and possibly Syrian troops to replace Israeli

forces.
</P>
<P>
In order to allay Lebanon's fears over these proposals,

Israel must explicitly say that "its withdrawal will be total,

and will be up to the internationally-recognized border and it

will not turn over the land to its proxy militia, the South

Lebanon Army led by Antoine Lahd," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He said all this means that Israel must declare that the

withdrawal will be done in a manner "that would allow the

regular forces of the Lebanese state to establish their

authorities on all Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
He added that there are no guarantees that Israel might not

decide to interpret a withdrawal as a redeployment and demand

"monitoring positions, joint patrols and reintegration of Lahd's

militia in the regular army of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said if Israel sincerely wants to leave Lebanon, it

should just implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 425,

which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south

Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He called the Israeli offer merely an attempt by Israel to

portray itself to the rest of the world as a peace-loving

nation.
</P>
<P>
Lubrani said last week that the Jewish state would pull its

forces out of Lebanon "if we are sure that the threat of

terrorism has been removed."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the army withdraws without guarantees, the

guerrillas will attack civilians in northern Israel and the

security zone will have to be reoccupied.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone in

1985 in a bid to protect the Jewish settlements in northern

Israel from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 180 Israeli soldiers have bee killed

and over 480 others wounded in clashes with guerrillas on the

last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Urges to Beef up Intelligence Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar

Hashemi Rafsanjani has called on his intelligence staff to step

up their work to safeguard the Islamic system as the United

States is increasing its hostility against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president issued the call Sunday in a meeting

with the staff of the information department of the Ministry of

Defense and Logistics, the English-language daily Tehran Times

reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was quoted as saying that "the nature and

sensitivity of the information forces' task is vital for

preserving Islamic values and the country's security."
</P>
<P>
He said that "sincerity, trust and faith of commanders and the

armed forces in the intelligence department are considered a

great asset."
</P>
<P>
"While world hegemonic powers intensify their hostile moves

against the Islamic Republic of Iran on a day to day, the duty

of the intelligence department personnel for preserving the

health and might of the armed forces will be effective," he

said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the information forces are charged with

protecting the great achievements made by the Iranian nation in

the sacred defense era. Thus, they should perform their task in

the best possible manner."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Rafsanjani's statement reflects

serious worries of the Iranian regime about the potential

military attack by the United States against some Iranian

targets on the pretext of sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said recently

that the situation in the Persian Gulf is rather "tense"

and "unsafe" due to foreign military presence, especially the

United States.
</P>
<P>
Velayati called the military presence of foreign powers

"unprecedented in the world" and "an obstacle to economic

development in this part of the world."
</P>
<P>
Some Western media reports said that Washington is working out

a special military program to strike 19 Iranian targets,

including some terrorist training camps and nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran has lost no chance to deny any involvement in

bombing the American military base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia last

June, which killed 19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iranian authorities are making preparation

for any kind of military attack. They have deployed ground

-to-ground missiles on the three Gulf islands under Iranian

control but also claimed by the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Silvery Needles In, Lingering Pain Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pascoal Amaro, an Angolan aged

46, has suffered for years from hemiplegia, excess sleep,

headache, dizziness and poor appetite, all sequelae of malignant

malaria. Each and every treatment he received ended in vain.
</P>
<P>
Now he was recovered perfectly within a month in the hands of

four Chinese doctors who used traditional Chinese methods to

treat him. They opened an acupuncture and moxibustion clinic in

central Luanda on May 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Chinese doctors to practise medicine

in the once war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, led by Lin Jianhua, an associate professor in

Chendu Chinese Medicine University, central China, have treated a

total of 2,426 people with an effective rate of over 95 percent

during the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
The cure rate surpassed 70 percent in the clinic called

Cacuchi-Chinese Medical Center in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Amaro, who can walk normally now, said the Chinese doctors

acupunctured his temples with electric stimulation and embedded

some specially-made needles in selected points inside his ears to

produce protracted effects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the doctors cupped him with a cup-shaped,

inside-heated, air-extracted cupping jar. Amaro was cupped

hundreds of times in one treatment and he had gone through

cupping therapy 16 times altogether.
</P>
<P>
In the view of Chinese traditional medicine, inside the human

body main and collateral channels form a network of passages,

through which vital energy circulates and along which the

acupuncture points are distributed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, connections exist between body surface and inside

organs, among the various organs and parts of the surface. This

explains why puncturing the body with needles at specific points

or cupping on outer skin can cure disease or relieve pain.
</P>
<P>
Such a theory first occurred in a book called "Nei Jing"

written in 200 BC in China and it has been developing for the

later thousands of years, according to one of the Chinese

doctors.
</P>
<P>
Besides malaria, arthritis, asthma and cerebral haemorrhage

are also common diseases in tropical Angola which is damp and wet

along the Atlantic Ocean and Chinese acupuncture, moxibustion and

massage have proved to be strongly effective for curing them.
</P>
<P>
In another case, 63-year-old Maria Estrela, was year in and

year out confined to bed due to paralyzation on the left part of

her body caused by cerebral haemorrhage. This is apoplexy,

because of which Estrela even couldn't wear clothes herself.
</P>
<P>
Estrela came to the Chinese clinic as her last hope, with no

confidence at all.
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, as Estrela put it, she could stand up by herself

once again merely after 13 acupuncture treatments and was fully

recovered within a month. Now she enjoys a normal life, like any

other healthy persons, Estrela boasted.
</P>
<P>
The intolerable pains caused by serious arthritis Nazare

Garcia and her sister Antonia had borne for years also

disappeared within eight days through acupuncture and cupping

therapy.
</P>
<P>
"Only Chinese doctors can be so brilliant exclamation" said

the sisters, who added they felt it's a heaven-sent fortune.
</P>
<P>
Patients of epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, insomnia,

dysmenorrhoea, stomach troubles and about 40 other kinds of

difficult and complicated cases of illness in Angola also find

relief in the Chinese clinic.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the patients who heap glowing words on the clinic

since they came out fully recovered, the fame of the Chinese

doctors are getting round fast. The small clinic is now teeming

with patients, sometimes with more than 40 a day, and besides

Angolans, more and more foreign diplomats and U.N. peacekeepers

in Angola are jamming into the clinic.
</P>
<P>
Small needles can cure severe diseases. This belief has been

naturally and rapidly rooted in the hearts of Angolans, local

observers say.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Output to Rise in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Cotton farmers in Zimbabwe are

expected to produce about 300,000 tons of seed cotton this year,

up from 250,000 tons in 1996, the First Merchant Bank said on

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale commercial farms will yield 80,000 tons of

this year's expected output, and the remainder will come from the

small and communal farmers, said the bank in its latest Economic

Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
The bank estimated that about 175,000 tons of cotton seed will

become available to oil processors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe expects to benefit from high cotton prices on the

international market, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic farmers are already benefiting from the

entry of other buyers in the cotton industry, with a range of

incentives currently offered to encourage cotton yield

increases.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urged to Have More Private Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has urged the

Philippine government to draw up more policy framework that would

enhance the private sector's participation in infrastructure

project development, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
To get substantial involvement of the private sector, the World

Bank said, a clear framework that sets out the regulatory setting

for investment as well as production is needed.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank noted that most Asian countries were yet to

install such a framework.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it has traditionally been heavily involved in

infrastructure finance, and is now increasingly working with

government and the private sector on the design of such a

framework.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the World Bank was working on an initiative

to reap the fruits of projects related to the water system,

transportation and other vital economic facilities.
</P>
<P>
Based on estimates, the demand for infrastructure in the region

will require as much as 1.5 trillion US dollars over the next

decade -- or an annual average of 150 billion dollars compared

with the 1992 spending of some 50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines alone, about 36 billion to 45 billion

dollars in investments are needed to finance infrastructure

development projects in the next 10 years.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A national financial conference

of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) attended by directors

of its provincial-level branches opened today in Beijing, where

they will sum up experiences of the past year and work out plans

for 1997.
</P>
<P>
ABC President Shi Jiliang spoke at the opening meeting, saying

that ABC played a big role in the agricultural sector's good

results last year, while China made great headway in rural banking

reforms and progress in commercializing and internationalizing its

banking.
</P>
<P>
Last year, ABC dropped connections with rural credit agencies,

and the Agricultural Development Bank of China, a new state policy

bank, also set up branches in 20 provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, by the end of 1996, the bank loaned 523.58

billion yuan to the rural sector, an increase of 111.79 billion

yuan over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Shi emphasized that his bank will continue to assist

agriculture this year, and that it will focus on improving the

quality of loans to lower risks.
</P>
<P>
The bank's 6,058 branches are now all connected to an

electronic clearing network.

LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Several Zambian lawmakers have

suggested the parliament to enact laws to regulate and monitor

the use of natural resources so as to protect the environment.

<P>
The lawmakers made the remarks when attending an environmental

education workshop at the weekend in Siavonga, southeast of

</P>
<P>
A related summary adopted at the workshop said that laws

should be introduced to provide a price tag on industries which

pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
Such laws and regulations should be enforced into effect

around the country and district councils should be encouraged to

analyze their environmental situation and provide a five-year

plan for improvement, they said.
</P>
<P>
It was also suggested that environmental education should be

introduced as a compulsory subject at all levels in schools, and

environmental education workshops be held for raising such

awareness among traditional healers and media personnel.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers urged that the media should be reformed to

become environmentally sensitive and environmental-protecting

programs using local languages should be encouraged on televisions

and radios.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Deal May be Initialed Today (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian

negotiators are due to meet today again to try and finalize an

agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron, which may

be initialed later today.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to finalize other three stages of further

redeployment in the West Bank, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, to be joined by U.S. representatives,

will meet at 10:00 a.m. local time (0800GMT) this morning in

Jerusalem, and are expected to be able to complete drafting the

long-awaited Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
The success of this morning's negotiations would probably lead

to a summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin

Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President

Yasser Arafat later in the day or this evening to announce the

agreement.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough followed a dramatic summit meeting late

Sunday night between Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan in Tel

Aviv, with the participation of U.S. special Middle East

coordinator Dennis Ross and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat,

as well as Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession

that appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron

agreement during his meeting with Arafat earlier Sunday in the

Gaza Strip before he flew from Gaza to Tel Aviv for the

late night meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A senior PNA official said that Arafat agreed to Hussein's

proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage withdrawal

from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the key

sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We can envision the end of the negotiations in sight,"

Netanyahu said after meeting with Hussein. "Because of the

important initiative His Majesty took, we have made considerable

progress."
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Sunday's controversy was the question of

whether the two sides could find common ground on the issue of

further Israeli army's pullbacks from the West Bank beyond a

Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to conclude by September 1997

as called for in the Oslo II accords, while Netanyahu's proposal

was for the final pullback by the end of the interim period,

ending in the spring of 1999, so it would overlap with the

deadline for resolving final status issues.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States put

forward a compromise proposal last week calling for the pullbacks

by some point in 1998, deliberately avoiding to give an exact

month, and the idea was rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hussein initiated a compromise proposal on a critical future

Israeli army pullback from the West Bank by the middle of 1998,

which would mark the midway point between Israeli and

Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal was worked out during seven hours of

talks in Gaza and came amid telephone conversations among

Netanyahu, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Ross, and

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Hussein arrived in Gaza Sunday afternoon to meet with Arafat,

in an effort to save the peace negotiations between the Israelis

and Palestinians, after Ross announced he was to leave the

region Sunday night without a Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Although it appears that the Hebron accord is to be finally

concluded, Netanyahu, Hussein, and Ross were upbeat but

noncommittal late Sunday night, saying some work remains to be

done.
</P>
<P>
"I leave here confident that everything will move in the

right direction, a fresh beginning to continue the work to

achieve the kind of peace and the kind of future we seek,"

Hussein told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We are closer than we were," said Ross, adding that he would

now remain in the region, despite earlier plans to return to

Washington.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that for Arafat, a Jordan-brokered

agreement would underline the commitment of Hussein to the

Israel-PLO Oslo accords, emphasizing that the Hebron agreement

was a multilateral affair rather than a bilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for Netanyahu, a Hussein-brokered agreement would

help restore his initial warm relations with the monarch,

which turned frosty after the Western Wall Tunnel crisis last

September.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Producing Large Granulated Urea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China has started to produce

large granulated urea which will remarkably improve the efficiency

of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The new urea, four times larger than traditional urea, is twice

as hard, more resistant to wetness, more enduring, and will

improve the efficiency of nitrogenous fertilizer by 12 percent,

agro-technicians said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from farmland, the urea, as large as a soybean, is

suitable for air sowing over forests and grasslands. China has

been importing such urea from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The urea is produced by Hainan Natural Gas Chemical Plant,

which has taken advantage of natural gas from South China Sea and

latest world-wide process installations.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Study Harmonizing Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The East African Cooperation

(EAC) will soon carry out a feasibility study on the introduction

of harmonized customs duties in a bid to speed up the flow of

trade among Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the East African reported

today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted EAC Secretary General Francis

Muthaura as saying in Arusha, northwest Tanzania, that the study

would make it possible for each country's revenue to be collected

at one point.
</P>
<P>
He told the paper last week that part of 1.9 million U.S.

Dollars provided by the German government will be used for a

study on how to compare the Gross Domestic Product of the three

east African countries.
</P>
<P>
The EAC chief executive noted that his secretariat has already

achieved considerable success in negotiating assistance with

other donors.
</P>
<P>
According to the EAC official, the British Overseas

Development Agency is going to finance a study on the

information management needs of the secretariat and the purchase

of the equipment recommended by the study.
</P>
<P>
The European Union Commission has also agreed to include the

EAC into the Regional Indicative Program, which is the second

financial protocol of Lome IV.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, he said, priority will be given to the

development of roads, food security and technical assistance in

the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has also promised to provide finance assistance

for a study on the establishment of a common external tariff for

the east African region.
</P>
<P>
Other donors to the Arusha-based organization are the European

Investment Bank and the East African Development Bank which are

going to finance the EAC Digital Transmission project.

<HEADLINE> PUK Satisfied With Peace Progress in North Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of

Kurdistan (PUK) is satisfied with the peace progress in northern

Iraq although an agreed ceasefire with rival Kurdistan Democratic

Party (KDP) is still not in place, a PUK senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted PUK Representative in

Ankara Mohammad Tofiq as saying that PUK leader Talabani would

meet KDP head Massoud Barzani if the latter came to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Talabani would come to Ankara, where the

continued peace talks between PUK and KDP would be held this week,

with attendance of U.S, Turkish and British officials.
</P>
<P>
Tofiq said that among the topics to be discussed would be

confidence-building measures, ceasefire monitoring groups as well

as clarifications of controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau has

invited Talabani, Barzani, Turkmen representatives to Ankara for a

continuation of the talks which started last year.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the PUK is ready to have a dialog with Baghdad, Tofiq

said that this would be possible only under the framework of the

U.N. Security Council 688.
</P>
<P>
Talabani himself will not be present at the upcoming talks,

but he is expected to meet separately with U.S. and Turkish

officials. However, Barzani has not confirmed if he would come to

Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Under a ceasefire signed on October 30 last year, the PUK and

KDP agreed to stop months of bloody strife in northern Iraq and

move towards an agreement for sharing power and border revenues.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and KDP were engaged in fierce battles in August of

last year. The Baghdad's support for the KDP led to the U.S. air

strike against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the PUK

and KDP began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Host Major Investment Conference in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will hold a major

investment conference in London in March to drum-up more British

support for job-creating investment, the Confederation of Zimbabwe

Industries (CZI) said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CZI President Jonee Blanchfield said that the conference would be

a follow-up to another successful meeting held on May 14, 1994, where

Zimbabwe received pledges of British investment then worth over 30

million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Blanchfield said in latest CZI industrial review that she hoped

the London conference would not only attract investment in the mining

sector as had happened at the last conference.
</P>
<P>
She said the CZI also planned to hold other investment conferences

during the year, consolidating on the success it had achieved in

1996, when two major foreign missions were organised in Germany and

Austria.
</P>
<P>
The German conference, held in the port city of Hamburg on

September 24, is estimated by the CZI to have attracted new

investment worth more than 50 million US Dollars in the

manufacturing, mining, horticultural and tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
The other conference held in Austria two days later is said to have

generated interest in the manufacturing sector, as well as pledges by

Austria's largest brewer to consider opening a plant in Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Knocked Out of Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Boris

Becker became the first victim of seeds when he was toppled in the

first rounder against Carlos Moya of Spain here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moya, who ranked 25th, beat the German world number six 5-7,

7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in three hours and 31 minutes to repeat

his victory over Becker in the Paris Open last October.
</P>
<P>
From a slow start, Becker won the first set 7-5 and lost the

tiebreaker in the second.
</P>
<P>
But the German seemed to control the game when he led 2-1

before Moya rallied to win the last two sets to overrun the

scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne was a place Becker found his both dignity and his

sorrow as he won the titles twice in 1991 and 1996, but lost his

third round in 1992 and suffered first round defeats in 1993 and

1995 in the year's first grand slam.
</P>
<P>
However, Becker, who has won six grand slam events, inked a

record as the only defending champion in the men's professional

tennis history to lose in the first round of a grand slam, tour

official said.
</P>
<P>
His defeat will serve as a blessing for American Michael Chang

whom the German beat in the final last year and would have met in

the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Speaker Calls For Early Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's National Assembly

Chairman Blagovest Sendov today urged the ruling Socialist Party

(SP) to agree to the opposition demand for an early general

election.
</P>
<P>
Sendov, who supports the Socialists in parliament, said on

national television that the SP-led Democratic Left coalition

should show wisdom and unconditionally open negotiations with the

opposition on an early election.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ruling party and the opposition to reach a

compromise and defuse the serious situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations should also ensure that a new government is

formed and that the opposition takes part in parliamentary

operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that without a functioning parliament, it will be

impossible to stablize the economy.
</P>
<P>
The ruling SP, which leads the coalition government, is only

half way through the four-year term.
</P>
<P>
But the resignation of Prime Minister Zhan Videnov in December

over the country's financial and economic crisis, triggered

protests by the opposition, who have blocked the Socialist Party's

plan to form a new government and demanded an early parliamentary

election.
</P>
<P>
Both the outgoing President Zheliu Zhelev and the newly-elected

President Petar Stoyanov support the demand for early elections.
</P>
<P>
Socialist leader Georgi Parvanov insisted, however, that the

most pressing issue is to form a strong Democratic Left government

as soon as possible so that the political situation can be

stablized.

WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Xue Ruihong won the

Schenk kept her lead in the World Cup speed skating standings.
</P>
<P>
Xue clocked 39.48 seconds at the distance on the National Ice

KAMPALA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A fairly strong earthquake

rocked Fort Portal Town, southwestern Uganda on Saturday, leaving

neither casualties nor serious damages, the local daily The New

Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tremor occurred at around 1:30 p.m. and lasted five

minutes, causing panic among residents in the town, located in

the earthquake-prone area in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fort Portal Town, about 380 kilometers west of the capital

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce New Oil Exploration Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- the Indian government is

expected to announce a new oil exploration policy soon in a bid to

increase oil production in the country, Petroleum Ministry sources

said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new exploration policy would put in place a set of

guidelines for investments in the hydrocarbon sector.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is expected to make the present policy more

attractive particularly in terms of granting licenses for

exploration to both private and public sector operators.
</P>
<P>
With dwindling domestic production of oil and a burgeoning oil

pool deficit and a mounting oil import bill, drastic changes are

needed in the hydrocarbon sector to augment production and raise

efficiency levels in enhancing yield of oil from existing fields,

the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already liberalized the hydrocarbon sector

offering medium-sized fields as also proven fields to the private

sector consortia to operate on a commercial basis. Two private

sector consortia of Reliance Industries and Vieocon group in

collaboration with the US-based Enron and Marubeni and Command

Petroleum of Australia have already got certain fields in the

country's western offshore and Krishna Godavari basin in the

southern offshore for exploration on a production sharing contract

with the Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC) where they will get

international rates for the crude produced.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of striking new oil and natural gas fields in

the near future in the country is bright, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Research of Single Event Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China is now leading the world in

the research of single event effects, according to a report from a

 space technology research institute in the northwest China

ancient city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite-used single event monitoring computers we

developed have proved to be advanced in the world as shown in

trial operation", the institute says.
</P>
<P>
Protons or energetic particles in the space can cause serious

trouble to computers on satellites. The penetration of protons and

energetic particles into computers, or single event effect, has

been a major issue of research for space scientists.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that internationally, as much as 39 percent of the

abnormal operation defaults of space flying machines were caused

by such effects.
</P>
<P>
China began research in the field nearly 20 years ago, with a

lot of valuable data having been accumulated.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Wants to Increase Flights to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- UK carrier British Airways

(BA) has planned to have a 40 percent increase in its flight

frequency to India by April 1998, British Airways sources said

here today.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate step that the airline will take in this

direction will be to raise its current frequency of 16

international flights per week to 18 flights with effect from

April 20, 1998," said Kevin Steele, BA general manager (South

Asia).
</P>
<P>
After the addition of these flights, the total frequency of

flights operated by BA to India will stand at 22, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
British Airways' officials are currently negotiating with the

Civil Aviation Ministry of India to obtain a licence for

increasing their services in India. The last round of talks

between the two parties took place three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
British Airways now commands a market share of 13 percent in

India.
</P>
<P>
The British airline also intends to create a much stronger

domestic market presence in India. BA recently concluded a

frequent-flyer program with the Naresh Goyal-owned jet airways,

which is the largest private airline operating in the Indian

domestic market.

BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Claus

</P>
<P>
He said that the 15-member EU has met difficulties caused by

the principle of consensus, hinting at Britain's non-cooperation

policy following the EU's global ban last March on the

exports of British beef products.

"If we have 20 or more member countries in the future, the EU

would not be able to function," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fragrant Paddy Price Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice mills, exporters and

government officials are concerned that the unusually high prices

of Thai paddy and rice could end up hurting the country's rice

exports.
</P>
<P>
Last week the price of fragrant rice paddy hit a record high of

6,500-6,700 baht (260-268 U.S. dollars) per ton during the harvest

period.
</P>
<P>
The high paddy prices have resulted from strong demand for

fragrant rice for delivery as many exporters are buying fragrant

rice in response to the government policy of raising the quality

of Thai rice exports to avoid competition from cheaper rice from

India and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Thai Rice Mills Association said the price of

fragrant rice paddy last Monday was set at 6,500 baht per ton, but

some mills offered a high of 7,300 baht (292 dollars) a ton. The

price of paddy used to produce 5 percent white rice was

5,150-5,200 baht (206-208 dollars) a ton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, last week the export f.o.b. price of Thai fragrant

rice was quoted at 640 and 625 dollars for 100 percent first and

second class respectively, 10 dollars each higher than the

previous week.
</P>
<P>
The price of Thai white rice is currently about 100 dollars a

ton higher than that being sold by its foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the rising Thai rice prices could make rice

importers in the world market turn to cheaper rice from Vietnam

and India.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand exported 5.25 million tons of rice, of

which 54 percent was of good grade, such as fragrant rice and 100

percent, 5 percent, 10 percent and 15 percent white rice.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Sector Playing Greater Role in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industries have

grown fast to pomote overall economic growth, as a result of

government encouragement over the past five years in south China's

Guangdong province's high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of the hi-tech sector has exceeded 50

percent.
</P>
<P>
The sector's high-tech products now account for nearly 10

percent of the total volume of industrial products in the

province, which has nearly 1,000 high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Of the first 76 key hi-tech enterprises listed by the State

Science and Technology Commission, 17 are in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of hi-tech products are competitive on the

international market, bringing Guangdong closer to the outside

world and helping to restructure its economy," says one local

economist.
</P>
<P>
The province's hi-tech sector has also helped to create better

conditions for big overseas companies. According to a provincial

government report, a third of the technologies being used by the

province's enterprises over the past few years came from aboard.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Give More Power to States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Planning Commission

in its approach paper for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998-2002)

proposes to give greater freedom to states in determining their

annual plan size and outlays, a government official said here

today.
</P>
<P>
"States would be free to decide their plan size taking into

account the Central assistance," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
To increase the states' revenue-raising ability, the commission

has suggested that the states be empowered to levy, collect and

retain taxes on the service sector. The base of sales tax should

be broadened by reducing the number of exemptions.
</P>
<P>
In line with the United Front government's promise to grant

greater autonomy to states, the Planning Commission has suggested

that detailed examination of the states' plans be done away with

and the review be limited to ensuring broad adherence to the

five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
The states would also be given the freedom to decide the annual

phasing of sectoral allocations, keeping in view the plan outlays,

national priorities and their needs.
</P>
<P>
The schemes sponsored by the central government should be

limited to those of inter-state ambit, pertaining to national

security, national priority or multi-state externally-funded

projects.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission's approach paper will be discussed by

the National Development Council on January 16.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Silvery Needles In, Lingering Pain Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Pascoal Amaro, an Angolan aged

46, has suffered for years from hemiplegia, excess sleep,

headache, dizziness and poor appetite, all sequelae of malignant

malaria. Each and every treatment he received ended in vain.
</P>
<P>
Now he was recovered perfectly within a month in the hands of

four Chinese doctors who used traditional Chinese methods to

treat him after opening an acupuncture and moxibustion clinic in

central Luanda on May 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Chinese doctors to practise medicine

in the once war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, led by Lin Jianhua, an associate professor in

Chendu Chinese Medicine University, central China, have treated a

total of 2,426 people with an effective rate of over 95 percent

during the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
The cure rate surpassed 70 percent in the clinic called

Cacuchi-Chinese Medical Center in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Amaro, who can walk normally now, said the Chinese doctors

acupunctured his temples with electric stimulation and embedded

some specially-made needles in selected points inside his ears to

produce protracted effects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the doctors cupped him with a cup-shaped,

inside-heated, air-extracted cupping jar. Amaro was cupped

hundreds of times in one treatment and he had gone through

cupping therapy 16 times altogether.
</P>
<P>
In the view of Chinese traditional medicine, inside the human

body main and collateral channels form a network of passages,

through which vital energy circulates and along which the

acupuncture points are distributed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, connections exist between body surface and inside

organs, among the various organs and parts of the surface. This

explains why puncturing the body with needles at specific points

or cupping on outer skin can cure disease or relieve pain.
</P>
<P>
Such a theory first occurred in a book called "Nei Jing"

written in 200 BC in China and it has been developing for the

later thousands of years, according to one of the Chinese

doctors.
</P>
<P>
Besides malaria, arthritis, asthma and cerebral haemorrhage

are also common diseases in tropical Angola which is damp and wet

along the Atlantic Ocean and Chinese acupuncture, moxibustion and

massage have proved to be strongly effective for curing them.
</P>
<P>
In another case, 63-year-old Maria Estrela, was year in and

year out confined to bed due to paralyzation on the left part of

her body caused by cerebral haemorrhage. This is apoplexy,

because of which Estrela even couldn't wear clothes herself.
</P>
<P>
Estrela came to the Chinese clinic as her last hope, with no

confidence at all.
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, as Estrela put it, she could stand up by herself

once again merely after 13 acupuncture treatments and was fully

recovered within a month. Now she enjoys a normal life, like any

other healthy persons, Estrela boasted.
</P>
<P>
The intolerable pains caused by serious arthritis Nazare

Garcia and her sister Antonia had borne for years also

disappeared within eight days through acupuncture and cupping

therapy.
</P>
<P>
"Only Chinese doctors can be so brilliant exclamation" said

the sisters, who added they felt it's a heaven-sent fortune.
</P>
<P>
Patients of epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, insomnia,

dysmenorrhoea, stomach troubles and about 40 other kinds of

difficult and complicated cases of illness in Angola also find

relief in the Chinese clinic.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the patients who heap glowing words on the clinic

since they came out fully recovered, the fame of the Chinese

doctors are getting round fast. The small clinic is now teeming

with patients, sometimes with more than 40 a day, and besides

Angolans, more and more foreign diplomats and U.N. peacekeepers

in Angola are jamming into the clinic.
</P>
<P>
Small needles can cure severe diseases. This belief has been

naturally and rapidly rooted in the hearts of Angolans, local

observers say.

<HEADLINE> Caring For Animals In Northeast China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- People in the Chinese coastal

city of Dalian, formerly known as Port Arthur, have long been

known for their love of animals, as can be seen now in three

places that keep animals: an amphibious reptile park at Tiger

Beach, a forest zoo at the Baiyunshan Scenic Spot, and a sea world

at Xinhai Bay that has Asia's longest walkway under the sea.
</P>
<P>
These projects were not just thrown together in haste, but were

the result of careful design and were built at considerable cost,

the forest zoo being a good example. The 10-sq.km. area was built

with American and Japanese designs at a cost of 180 million yuan

(about 21.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some people here claim that the local people provided their

best places for the animals.
</P>
<P>
He Ping, the manager of a local property company, discovered

two giant salamanders, an animal that is on the country's list of

protected species, at a local restaurant where he was

dining. Without a moment's hesitation, he forked over 5,000 yuan

to rescue the rare animals and sent them to the amphibious reptile

park.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai Zijia, the park's director, it has been given

amphibious reptiles worth tens of thousands of yuan by more than

30 local residents, including a 15-kilogram turtle that is 700 to

800 years old.
</P>
<P>
The people's love for animals has not come easily. A few years

ago when the country's first pigeon square was set up here, some

pigeons that took to strutting around the square ended up on some

residents' dining tables.
</P>
<P>
At that point the local press and people had a discussion and

ended up condemning the pigeon eaters. As a result, pigeons now

live in symbiotic harmony with people relaxing on the square.
</P>
<P>
To cultivate a love of animals in children, some schools have

set up indoor zoos, where school children can learn to feed such

animals as pigeons, monkeys, and hedgehogs.
</P>
<P>
Local people have even set up a memorial at the forest zoo to

honor dead animals, which bears the words: animals are human's

friends.
</P>
<P>
To repay the local citizen's love, more animals are becoming

available: It's now quite common for residents to see pigeons and

magpies on their balconies, something that is a bit rare in the

past.

DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Angered by the erosion of share

prices, agitated curb stock dealers went berserk and stoned the

Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) building Sunday, damaging some of its

windowpanes, according to stock sources.
</P>
<P>
Police used batons to disperse the curb traders and arrested 12

people on the spot.
</P>
<P>
These stock dealers later held a rally in front of the DSE

building, demanding stability in the capital market and release of

the arrested persons.
</P>
<P>
Share prices dipped to a new low on the day, pulling the

benchmark DSE All Share Price Index down to below the 2000-point

mark and 11 billion taka (about 275 million U.S. dollars) in

market capitalization evaporated in a single day's trading.
</P>
<P>
The index and market capitalization closed at 1900.63 points

</P>
<P>
The index, which crossed the 2000-point barrier on October 6

last year on an unprecedented bullish trend in the bourse, started

sliding in mid-November amid allegations of manipulation and

irregularities by both market operators and regulators.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the key index has been falling steadily from a

<HEADLINE> Meeting to Solve Hostage Crisis Called off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The planned meeting Sunday between

Peru's chief negotiator and guerrillas still holding 74 hostages

in Lima was called off after the government refused to consider

their proposal to free some 400 jailed members of the Tupac Amaru

Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
</P>
<P>
Education Minister and chief negotiator Domingo Palermo told a

news conference that he has sent another written proposal to

Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, head of the movement, to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
In the proposal, the government suggested establishing a

"guarantor commission" formed by representatives from the

government, the guerrillas, the Vatican and the International

Committee of the Red Cross, who would work jointly to solve the

26-day crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government was reported to have offered free passage for

the guerrilla unit out of the country if they surrender and local

media said Ecuador is a possible destination.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram will visit Peru on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, a group of MRTA guerrillas stormed a diplomatic

reception at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima and held

some 500 people as hostage.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that their comrades jailed in Peruvian prisons be

released, which has however been rejected repeatedly by Peruvian

President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have released most of the hostages but are still

holding 74 people.
</P>
<P>
President Fujimori has said he will not give in to "terrorist

blackmail" and urged the rebels to lay down their arms and release

all the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Efforts from other sides have also been made to solve the

embassy standoff while ensuring the hostages' security.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, several thousand Peruvians demonstrated behind the

security cordon around the residence in protest against the

hostage-taking and appealed to the guerrillas to free their

captives.

BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- German auto-maker Mercedes-Benz

is to merge with its parent Daimler-Benz AG, the country's biggest

industrial group, according to the latest edition of the news

magazine "Der Spiegel."
</P>
<P>
A report in the magazine said Daimler's Supervisory Board will

take a final decision to this effect on January 23.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be a further move by Daimler to streamline

its business structure after breaking up its electrical

engineering concern AEG Industrie and refusing to prop up its

troubled Dutch aircraft subsidiary Fokker N.V. last year.
</P>
<P>
Squeezed between a robust German mark and weak demand both at

home and abroad, the group lost a record 6 billion marks (4.17

billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, the highest since World War II.
</P>
<P>
Of its four major subsidiaries -- Mercedes-Benz, Daimler-Benz

Aerospace (DASA), AEG and the financial services and computer

supplier Interservice -- only auto maker Mercedes made a profit of

1.5 billion marks (1.04 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of

1995.

BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai textile exports in the

first nine months of 1996 posted 35.45 billion baht (about 1.4

billion US dollars), dipping down 0.8 percent in comparison with

the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Thai Commerce Ministry

available today, among the exports, shipments of fabrics of staple

fiber registered 13.75 billion baht (550 million dollars) during

the period, declining by 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the export value of woolen fabrics, which is not a

traditional export category of Thailand, performed well during the

period and soared by 40.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry analysts blamed the global market slump

for the decrease in the country's textile exports in the first

nine months last year.

They also predicted that Thailand's total earnings from its

textile exports during the whole year will not exceed the 50.23

billion baht (about 2 billion dollars) figure recorded in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Gap Falls in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus

fell 15.4 percent to 664.1 billion yen (5.7 billion U.S. dollars),

in November against a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said

today.
</P>
<P>
Higher imports of petrol-related products, a surge in spending

by Japanese traveling abroad and continued growth in the deficit

in services accounted for the fall, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus on the current account balance, which measures the

flow of goods and services, investment income and other monetary

transfers, has been falling on a year-on-year basis since

December 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the drop from 784.9 billion yen (6.76 billion dollars) in

November 1995 to 664.1 billion yen (5.7 billion dollars) in

November 1996, was the smallest rate of decline in eight months as

automobile and other exports rose amid the fall in the value of

the yen against the dollar. A weaker yen makes

dollar-deonominated Japanese exports more competitive on the

global market.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus in November fell 3.4 percent to 859.4

billion yen (7.41 billion dollars). Exports rose for the 16th

consecutive month, 11 percent to 3,856.9 billion yen (33.2

billion dollars), while imports rose for the 28th month in a row,

up 16 percent to 2,997.1 billion yen (25.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Imports of crude oil jumped 42.5 percent as prices increased,

and imports of oil-related products surged more than half in line

with the price hike.
</P>
<P>
The services deficit rose 26.7 percent from 440.1 billion yen

(3.79 billion dollars) to 557.4 billion yen (4.8 billion dollars),

the largest deficit for the month since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in tourism rose 5.3 percent from 278 billion yen

(2.4 billion dollars) to 292.7 billion yen (2.52 billion

dollars).

DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh

Nationalist Party (BNP) and the ruling Awami (people's) League

have moved close to ending the impasse in parliament after

opposition leaders on Sunday night met the speaker at the latter's

residence.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was held in a free and cordial atmosphere and I

don't see much difficulty in sorting out the unresolved issues,"

Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury was quoted by informed sources.

The BNP has been abstaining from attending the parliament

session since November 10 last year, following a row over a

meeting "encouraging", but he refrained from speculating whether

or not it might lead to an end of the BNP's abstention from the

proceedings of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the opposition had been assured to

be given equal opportunity on television and radio in respect of

the coverage of proceedings of the parliament. Steps were also

underway to open a second channel of Bangladeshi television for

the purpose.
</P>
<P>
A formal meeting between the ruling party and the opposition is

expected to be hold before the beginning of the next session of

parliament on January 15, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Plans More Cut in Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank is

looking at the possibility of further trimming down banks' reserve

requirement by another two percentage points after the first half

of this year.
</P>
<P>
This would bring the reserve requirement to only 11 percent

from the 13 percent after another one percentage point reduction

scheduled in July, according to today's Manila Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The reserve requirement was lowered by one percentage point to

14 percent from 15 percent early this month.
</P>
<P>
But a high-ranking official of the central bank said that this

new round of reduction would largely depend on the sustained

decline in inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is cautious in slashing down the reserve

requirement since, based on current deposit levels, each

percentage point of reduction frees around 6.5 billion pesos (248

million U.S. dollars) in funds that contribute new liquidity in

the financial system.
</P>
<P>
An unnecessary expansion in liquidity, in turn, could exert

more inflationary pressures. The reserve requirement is thus a

tool used by the central bank in controlling the amount of money

supply in the system.

BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab

Chaiyasarn today began a three-day official visit to Laos in a bid

to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying him are Commerce Minister Narongchai Akraseni and

Transport Minister Suwat Liptapallop.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are expected to hold talks with their

Laotian counterparts later today on bilateral issues, such as

border demarcation, repatriation of Hmong hilltribe people living

in Thailand, tourism, trade, tariff reductions on Thai goods

entering Laos and transport and communications issues.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Prachuab and Suwat will preside over the formal

handover of renovation work financed by the Thai government at the

Luang Prabang airport. Luang Prabang is a former capital of Laos

and is now a major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
For the project, the Thai government provided a grant aid of

about 2 million US dollars for the construction of a passenger

terminal and air traffic control tower, the renovation of runways

and aircraft parking areas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has also agreed in principle to provide another 8

million dollars for a second phase development, which will include

the extension of existing runways and upgrading of the electricity

and communication systems so that the airport can serve big

aircraft, such as Boeing 737-400 jets.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand's Budget Bureau approves the funding, the project

would be completed in two years' time.

<HEADLINE> Snow, Avalanches Strand Thousands of Skiers in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of skiers and
snowboarders were stranded over the weekend after more than 60 cm
of fresh snow and avalanches blocked a canyon highway about 15
kilometers east of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
The highway to the Snowbird and Alta ski resorts in the Wasatch
Mountains began to be blocked Saturday afternoon and by late
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people snowbound at Snowbird crammed halls,
restaurants and conference rooms to sleep Saturday night. Another
2,000 people were stuck at Alta, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the unusual crowds, Snowbird's restaurants ran out
of food for supper Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Many of the snowbound skiers, who came by bus, waited for the
highway to open Sunday for bus, but they had to head back to the
slopes, where Snowbird had all but two of its lifts running.
</P>
<P>
Piling snow led to avalanches in the mountains. One avalanche
buried 45 cars in a parking lot at Snowbird on Saturday. Another
snowslide at Alta swamped a sheriff deputy's truck and some
pedestrians Saturday night, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Salt Lake County crews worked to clear snow from the highway
and eliminate avalanche dangers by deliberating triggering slides
with explosives. But wind up to 70 kph, combined with the heavy
overnight snow, increases the danger of avalanche in opening
roads, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In North Dakota, a storm piled snow in drifts up to two meters
high, blocking some main highways. Nearly 900 kilometers of
Interstates 94 and 29 had been closed in North Dakota, Minnesota
and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton today declared North Dakota a major
disaster area, making the entire state eligible for federal
funding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, up to two meters of snow piled up Sunday on an
isolated area of northern New York state, and as much as one meter
snow fell into the southern Rockies of New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Haier's Sales Volume Exceed 6 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The sales volume of the Haier
Group, a major refrigerator producer in China, made a leap forward
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the sales volume of the Qingdao-based group exceeded
six billion yuan (about 723 million US dollars), 1.7 billion more
than the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The group's sales volume topped all five major groups in the
coastal city of Qingdao, in east China's Shandong Province,
statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the company has developed rapidly by
efficiently operating capital, expanding its production scale, and
implementing an export-oriented strategy.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the company floated stock in Shanghai. From this it
raised more than 700 million yuan, which has laid a solid
foundation for later development.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the group merged six freezer, air
conditioner, and electrical appliance companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the group seized opportunity to invest in the Haier
Industrial Park. By the first half of 1996, the industrial park
had been completed and yielded high economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The group's air conditioners, automatic washing machines,
immersion heaters, and microwave ovens are popular among
customers. Its products have been exported to Europe, America and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
At a trade fair last Autumn, overseas business people showed
interest in Haier's range of products. The groups concluded deals
worth 115 million US dollars with overseas businesses, topping all
electrical exporting companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the group developed 18 new sales agencies around the
world. Boasting 5,700 sales centers worldwide, the group's
influence is growing increasingly in the international market.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei Province
will spend 3.14 billion yuan on anti-flood facilities in its Haihe
River valley, according to its deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest amount spent on harnessing the river
since the 1980s, the deputy governor, Chen Liyou, notes. This
includes consolidating a dozen large reservoirs in the Taihang and
Yanshan mountains, improving dykes along the major water courses,
where flooding occurs, and removing silt from a number of major
tributaries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local areas are being urged to draw up anti-flood
plans and to improve water and soil conservation in mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ADB to Give Philippines Higher Annual Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will give the Philippines an annual loan of 550 million US dollars
during the next three years, the Manila-based Business World
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Werner Schelzig, manager of ADB's programs department for the
East, said in an interview with the business daily that the amount
was agreed upon by the Philippine government and the ADB in their
latest programming session.
</P>
<P>
The amount is higher than the 400 million US dollars the
government secured for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The increase in development loans came despite warnings that
assistance to developing countries is expected to shrink in the
next few years due to "aid fatigue" experienced by the bank's
members.
</P>
<P>
Schelzig said the loans will finance a mix of infrastructure
and social services projects.
</P>
<P>
However, in the coming years, the ADB will be concentrating on
human development and environmental projects with special interest
in Mindanao region.

Another traffic policeman was seriously wounded in the pre-dawn
incident, the paper said. The two policemen and their colleagues
tried to stop a Honda car which beat a red light, but were met
with a volley of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Ebdane also directed his field commanders to intensify the
campaign against loose fire arms, which includes random checks of
nightspots and body search of civilians.
</P>
<P>
To allay fears among the people that the checkpoints could lead
to abuses by policemen, Ebdane said the checkpoints would be
manned by uniformed personnel led by a police officer.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of checkpoints was necessary to restrain
the movements of criminal elements especially at nighttime, and
regulate the carrying of firearms by civilians.
</P>
<P>
But the paper said the move could draw fire from militant and
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
The public had strongly distrusted police checkpoints because
of extortion and illegal detention during the martial law era
under late former president Ferdinand Marcos.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Farmers Reward Scientists For Economic Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Some farmers in Wuxian City in
east China's Jiangsu Province have provided 100,000 yuan (12,000
U.S. dollars) as a bonus to some scientists who helped them
improve their harvest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city also held a news conference recently for six farmers
who provided a 23,000 yuan bonus for a dozen scientists and
agro-technicians who had a contract to help them increase their
grain output. All the city's farmers increased their income last
fall and decided to take some of their money to award scientists
and agro-technicians, in addition to sharing earned interest with
science and technology stations.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists working at the city and town level here get about
700 yuan monthly from agro-science and technology stations. The
six farmers also sent a silk-banner to the city's agro-science
station praising scientists and technicians for their achievements
in increasing grain output with science and new technology.
</P>
<P>
To improve grain or vegetable production on 1,000 hectares of
land, 162 scientists and technicians have signed contracts with
farmers stipulating that the scientists and farmers will share
benefits and risks equally, and the contract system has encouraged
the use of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Xing Changquan, a farmer in Jiaozhi County, says that rice
output on his land covered by contracts increased 750 kg per
hectare last year by applying new methods of sowing and spreading
fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Grotto In Yellow River Reservoir Area to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists will
relocate an ancient buddhist grotto from an area that will be
inundated by a new reservoir on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The cave, which dates back 1,300 years, and its 288 buddhist
statues will be moved to a site 40 kilometers from the Xiaolangdi
reservoir, a key state project on the middle reaches of China's
second longest river.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir will be able to hold 12.6 billion cubic meters of
water and will be completed by the year 2001. A total of 18
counties and cities will be affected by its water.
</P>
<P>
China successfully relocated an ancient palace along the Yellow
River 40 years ago, but has never dealt with relocating a cave on
a rocky hillside.
</P>
<P>
The cave is 10 meters above the Yellow River, and is the only
grotto along the middle reaches of the river. Archeologists say
that it is significant for the study of the Northern Wei period, a
chaotic period in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Work involved will be difficult, they point out, because the
cave will have to be cut into sections and shipped to the new
site, where experts can assemble them in the original form.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Election
Commission (Comelec) warned Sunday prospective candidates in the
1998 elections against premature campaigning and engaging in
"partisan political activity," a leading Philippine newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, Manila Bulletin, said the warning followed
mounting public complaints that although the 1998 election is
still one year and four months away, prospective presidential
candidates are making pronouncements as if they are already on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
The complainants said that the intense political rivalries
among the presidential aspirants often divert the attention of
government officials from delivering urgent public services.
</P>
<P>
These activities, the Comelec said, are punishable under the
country's election laws.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec officials assured the people that they will
prosecute candidates campaigning prematurely "whoever they are."
</P>
<P>
"We will not hesitate to apply the law against those who may be
found guilty of premature partisan political activity, whoever
they are," Comelec officials was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said any person found guilty of an election
offense shall be punished with an imprisonment of one year to six
years without probation.

<HEADLINE> New Measures in Shanghai for Biological Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai is to take measures to speed up development of a
modern biological and pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
It will see scientists earning big bonuses and dividends by
becoming shareholders.
</P>
<P>
According to a municipal government official, the city is to
establish the Shanghai High and New Technology Industry
Development Fund with the help of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and technicians could become shareholders of a
biological and pharmaceutical venture, with their research
achievements or patented technology receiving a large bonus, or
receiving high dividends.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures are to be taken to attract more scientists
and technicians to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, Mayor of the city said that Shanghai will focus its
high and new technology development in the coming years on a
modern biological and pharmaceutical industry and an information
industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has so far established some high-tech oriented
biological and pharmaceutical ventures, and seven state-level
pilot bases and major laboratories which have attracted 18,000
scientists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
Construction of six state-level research engineering centers
and a laboratory are already underway in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years the output value of Shanghai's modern
biological and pharmaceutical industry has risen by 38 percent each
year, double that for the rest of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The city will realize 30 billion yuan (3.75 billion
U.S. dollars) of annual output value from a modern biological and
pharmaceutical industry by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The six pillar industries in Shanghai are automobiles, iron and
steel, communications equipment, power station installations, refined
chemicals and domestic electrical appliances.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Urged to Stop Excessive Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals across the country
have been asked to adjust their charges for technical services and
restrict the use of excessive medicines and expensive medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Health is trying to isolate
business accounting from technical treatments and the sale of
medicine in hospitals, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also trying to prohibit income from the sale of
medicine as ending up as personal bonus, said Cai Renhua, a
department director in charge of policy research with the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in some hospitals often overprescribe medicine and
frequently conduct expensive physical examinations with new
high-tech equipment on patients in order to generate more revenue
for the hospital, claims a report from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
This practice has caused a rapid increase in medical expenses
and resulted in the waste of valuable health material and
medication, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes that through pilot projects, the country can
find a solution that encourage doctors to prescribe medicines in
accord with the patient's illnesses and stop the practice of
over-prescribing medicine, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
The policy will also encourage medical workers to improve
professional standards and treat patients with greater respect, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai medical community is one of the first to carry out
such reforms.
</P>
<P>
In line with a municipal regulation, hospitals are allowed to
increase charges for some technical and consultancy treatments,
but they also have to reduce the cost of physical examinations
performed with elaborate medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also put a limitation on the
increase of earnings from medicines and asked hospitals to take
out a sum, equivalent to ten percent of the total income from
technical treatments, to fund medical research.
</P>
<P>
The reform has curbed the rapid increase of medical
expenditures. More than three billion yuan (361 million US
dollars) was saved since the reform was put into practice in July,
1994, said Zuo Huanchen, vice-mayor of Shanghai.

<P>
Guinea recorded a 2-0 victory at Burkina Faso thanks to first
half goals by Souleymane Oulare and Momoh Wendel Soumah, opening
up a clear lead atop the standings.
</P>
<P>
And Nigeria has a tough road towards the World Cup finals as
only one team advances from each four-member group.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's action included five more African zone games wherein
Ghana scored twice in the last six minutes for a 2-2 tie with
Morocco in African Group Five.
</P>

stuck on one point after Saturday's 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe romped to a 3-0 victory over the weakest team in Group
Four, Togo.

Congo went ahead in the fifth minute through Chris Bongo but
the Zairians equalized in the 10th minute through captain Luende
Bolangala.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Improve Quality of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to improve the
quality of medical products this year by streamlining its
pharmaceutical industry, stepping up reform of medical
distribution, and standardizing the medicine market, a senior
medical official said.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of medical products has a great bearing on the
health of the Chinese nation," said Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the
State Pharmaceutical Administration, stressing the importance of
intensifying a sense of quality and tightening control of
pharmaceutical production.
</P>
<P>
It is the sacred duty of medical workers to ensure that people
use medicine in a safe, effective and convenient way, and to
safeguard the rights and interests of consumers, Zheng said in a
report delivered to a national working conference of
pharmaceutical directors.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Zheng urged all medical workers to redouble
their efforts to provide society with the best products and a
first-class service.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the total output value of China's pharmaceutical
industry reached 120 billion yuan, with the sales of medical
products hitting 88 billion yuan, and pre-tax profits rising up
to 12 billion yuan, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made in the reform of marketing
and distribution of medical products in the past year, he said,
adding that illegal manipulations of trading of medical products
have been curbed, and the order of medicine production and
marketing improved.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the supply and management of medicine in
China's rural areas have gradually been enhanced, and a new
wholesale and nationwide retail system of medical products has
improved.

<HEADLINE> Lott: New Congress to Handle Campaign Reform Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republican
leader Trent Lott said today the Senate would consider the issue
of campaign finance reform early and deal with it quickly in the
new Congress.
</P>
<P>
In CBS's "Face the Nation" program, Lott said the first bill
before the Senate would be a constitutional amendment to balance
the budget.
</P>
<P>
A similar measure failed in both the House and the Senate in
the last Congress. The Clinton administration hoped to work
together with the Republican-led Congress in the new term to pass
a budget aiming to be balanced by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Lott also said Republicans would have an education initiative.
"Republicans are putting education high on our list," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the campaign financing, Lott said Republicans would renew
attempts to reform campaign financing laws, expecting that it
would be something "we'll work on early and quickly."
</P>
<P>
He said that he had selected a panel of Republicans to decide
"what it is Republicans can agree on for better campaigns in the
future."
</P>
<P>
Crime and drug problems would be among other priorities in the
new Congress, according to Lott.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Meets Bosnian Ministerial Council Co-Chairmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Envoy for the
former Yugoslavia John Kornblum met in Sarajevo today with
co-chairmen of the Bosnian Council of Ministers Boro Bosic and
Haris Silajdzic over the latest developments in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency reported from Sarajevo that the closed-door
talk had related to the implementation of the Dayton accord,
specifically the economic reconstruction of the war-ravaged
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers, or the Bosnian joint government, was
formed last month with ministers from both the Serb Republic and
the Muslim-Croat Federation. The two chairmen, a Serb and a
Muslim, act as prime ministers and chair the cabinet in rotation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Silajdzic of the Muslim-Croat federation
said there was a high degree of agreement that the Dayton accord
be respected in full, as it was a guarantee of peace.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the arbitration of the disputed town of Brcko
had not been discussed at the meeting. Brcko is a strategic town
in northeastern Bosnia and its status will be decided by
international arbitration next month.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Bosnia, Kornblum, who is
concurrently the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe,
also met with Premier of the Muslim-Croat Federation Edhem
Bicakcic and President of Bosnia's three-men Presidency, Alija
Izetbegovic. The two sides had discussed ways and means of
consolidating the federation and forming a joint federal police
force, Tanjug said.

<HEADLINE> UK's Small Firms Confident of Bumper Profits in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized firms in
Britain are confident of a bumper year in terms of growth and
profitability, according to a latest European business survey.
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual European Business Survey, published last week
by Grant Thornton International, the accountant, and Business
Strategies, the business consultancy, showed that Britain's small
and medium-sized firms are expecting strong growth in all areas of
spending, trading and investment.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the survey reflected a marked rise over the past
five years and highlighted improved confidence in the sector.
</P>
<P>
About 29 percent of small business owners expect to hire more
staff this year, compared with 1 percent five years ago. The
percentage expecting to buy new equipment has risen from 2 percent
to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
This confidence is also seen in the areas of training,
advertising and profitability. Only in exports has there been a
drop from 32 percent in 1992 to 22 percent this year in the number
expecting growth.
</P>
<P>
The survey, in which 5,000 small and medium-sized companies in
Britain took part, also suggested that small firms in Britain are
more optimistic in most sectors than the European average.
</P>
<P>
A net balance of 56 percent of those polled expect to see sales
rise this year, compared with the European average of 37 percent.
Twenty-nine percent of British firms expect an increase in
employment this year, compared with the European average of 8
percent.

<HEADLINE> UK Fashion Wins Record 3 Billion Pounds Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British fashion brands such as
Mulberry, Aquascutum and Gossard helped the country's clothing
industry rack up record 3 billion pounds (about 5 billion U.S.
dollars) exports in 1995, the Sunday Times newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Helped by the fact the "British look," particular in menswear,
is the height of fashion in many foreign countries, Britain's
clothing industry is establishing itself as one of the country's
fastest-growing export-earners, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the report said, the value of British
clothing exported has more than doubled from 1.4 billion pounds
(about 2.2 billion dollars) to 2.95 billion pounds (about 4.7
billion dollars), climbing from the 30th in the world rankings of
top exports sectors to the 20th.
</P>
<P>
Paul Alger, project executive for the British Knitwear and
Clothing Export Council, said that much of the boom was being
driven by a resurgence in British designer labels, such as Frank
Usher and Jaeger.
</P>
<P>
British cocktail, eveningwear and bridal-wear are doing
particularly well while St Michael, the Marks &AMP; Spencer brand, is
the most popular label, he said, adding that "the middle-to-better
brands are seeing much of the demand."
</P>
<P>
The greatest demand for British clothing comes from Japan,
which in 1995 imported 1.26 billion pounds (about 2 billion
dollars) of British clothes, an increase of 25 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Alger noted that the weakened pound during 1995 was also one
reason why the year was particularly strong in clothing exports.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Report on Serbian Elections Should Be Applied: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos said here today that the report on recent
municipal elections in Serbia drawn up by OSCE Envoy Felipe
Gonzalez should be applied in full, including where it relates to
the Belgrade city council.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after holding meetings with both government
officials and opposition leaders in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said the application of the Gonzalez report should be freely
accepted by all political factors in Serbia within the country's
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez headed an OSCE (Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe) delegation to Belgrade in late November to
find out truth about the election disputes between the Serbian
government and the opposition coalition Zajedno. The Gonzalez
report confirmed that the opposition won local elections in 14 out
of 18 largest cities in Serbia in the November 17 elections for
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that once this had happened, he felt sure the
government and the opposition would be ready to open dialogue on a
procedure that would guarantee a free and true expression of the
political will of the Serbian people in the future.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue should be open to the public with the help of all
technical facilities of the mass media, so that the people should
know the possible positions of the political powers in the
country, the Greek minister explained.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos arrived here earlier in the day for a one-day visit to
Yugoslavia at the invitation of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry. He
had held talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic and opposition leaders in an
effort to help end the political crisis in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian opposition coalition has been staging protest
demonstrations in Belgrade over the past eight weeks over the
annulment of the local election results and asked the government
to recognize their victory in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also said that his country was very much interested in
stability, democratization and economic progress in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Serbia were linked by strong ties which were more
than just historic, cultural and religious, he added.
