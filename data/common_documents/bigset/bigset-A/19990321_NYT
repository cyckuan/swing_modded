HARRINGTON'S RED SOX PRIORITIES DUBIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Suddenly, John Harrington has an image
problem. For a quarter-century, he was Mr. Squeaky Clean _ a
humble, friendly, and charming accountant who went to daily Mass
and was trusted by all.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as he has become more withdrawn and more
powerful, Harrington's motives as CEO of the Red Sox have come
under question. And Saturday he released an in-house memo (to be
sent to Sox partners and employees) aimed at convincing folks that
he's not just another Kevin Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald is the state representative (D-Mission Hill) who
befriended a bag lady who turned out to be a wealthy bag lady. When
Mary Guzelian died, Fitzgerald and a top aide inherited her
$400,000. The will was later invalidated and Fitzgerald and his
aide were ordered to return the money to Guzelian's 76-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have Harrington, the keeper of the Yawkey Trust, getting
to play with the big league owners even though he doesn't have big
league money. Harrington worked for, and befriended, Thomas and
Jean Yawkey back in the early 1970s and has been the man in charge
of the Yawkey Trust (trustee of the majority general partner of the
ball club) since Jean Yawkey died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sox are owned by the Ozlike Corporation, a
faceless file cabinet filled with stock certificates and the Yawkey
wills. Harrington has been left in charge of how the money is
spent. Prospective buyers are rebuffed. Harrington gets to play
owner, and a Herald report last week charged that he ``has
personally reaped millions of dollars from Jean Yawkey's estate and
the charitable foundations of her and her husband Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   The in-house memo _ only slightly shorter than ``Tuesdays With
Morrie'' (six pages, single spaced) _ goes to great lengths to
refute many of the charges in the Herald report. On Page 4 of the
memo, Harrington states, ``At no time have I committed to a
specific schedule to sell the Yawkey interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The polygraph would explode if Harrington uttered that whopper.
On May 20, 1992, Harrington told the Globe's Will McDonough,
``These are the facts. The team will be sold in the next two to
five years.'' In 1993, Harrington and former Sox partner Haywood
Sullivan told the Globe's Curtis Wilkie that Yawkey's will decreed
that the team be sold as quickly as was practical.
</P>
<P>
   It has now been seven years since Jean Yawkey died, and
Harrington shows no signs of putting the club up for sale.
Harrington believes the club will be worth more once a new park is
built, and that he can better serve the Yawkey Trust if he waits
until Fenway Park is replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's in-house memo concludes with, ``I take my fiduciary
responsibility as trustee very seriously and have always acted in
what I believe are the best interests of the Yawkey Trust and
Foundations and the wishes of the Yawkeys. These foundations have
helped thousands of people throughout Massachusetts and the U.S.
and are the legacy of Tom and Jean Yawkey that the trustees always
hold in trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's closing remark might make his employees and
partners feel better, but it's not likely to soothe the restless
natives who follow the Red Sox. Boston baseball fans would rather
have an owner who puts winning championships ahead of his fiduciary
responsibility to a trust.
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans want to know why the club wouldn't pay the going rate
to keep Mo Vaughn. They want to know why Dan Duquette has been
anointed GM-for-Life. They want to know why the club keeps raising
ticket prices while falling farther behind the Yankees. And they
don't get these answers from a CEO who is beholden to a trust.
</P>
<P>
   There's no accountability in the owner's box on Yawkey Way.
Harrington had no comment after the settlement of a nasty lawsuit
involving former employee Thomas Sneed _ litigation that had
threatened to uncover some nasty in-house allegations. Before the
release of Saturday's memo (no doubt a counterstrike to keep
Harrington in good graces with the politicos he'll need to get a
new ballpark), the last time Harrington made a public statement was
when he stood on the Fenway sidewalk on Christmas Eve and
complained about ``50 or 60 years of unfair criticism'' directed at
the Red Sox. He made that remark in the wake of public outcry after
the Sox had bounced peanut and hot dog vendors from the streets
around Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's new profile is that of a paranoid, indecisive
accountant who charmed his way into enormous power and now is
unwilling to yield the throne. He should sell the team, or get some
investors and buy it. Fans simply don't trust the trust.

LITTLE REASON FOR HUSKIES TO HOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They've done nothing to impress and just enough to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   They were blessed with a bracket of yapping canines _ Texas-San
Antonio, New Mexico, Iowa and Gonzaga _ and barely got the monkey
off the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut prevailed on Saturday, slipping by a No. 10 seed,
liberating their coach from an invisible noose, taking an important
step in the evolution of their program.
</P>
<P>
   But they have proven nothing, other than put a pop-gun to four
teams that would make up a wonderful Alaskan Invitational. &UR; And
while the fog of failure has been lifted, they'll arrive in St.
Petersburg, Fla., with the same nagging question:
</P>
<P>
   Can they beat a great team when it matters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd probably have to go through purgatory to get to
heaven,'' Huskies Coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice, of course, that Calhoun's career will no longer be
defined by previous roadblocks. No man of his status should have to
explain how he can win more than 300 games at a faceless oasis, a
rural school somewhere between Boston and New York, and go 0-3 in
regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to go to the Hall of Fame the right way,'' guard
Khalid El-Amin said. ``Not as the best coach never to reach the
Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and it's touching that El-Amin heard the buzzer, jumped
over the scorer's table and ran 15 rows into the stands to hug
members of his family. Impressive that Richard Hamilton was able to
keep his team in the game during the first half by scoring over a
gimmick defense spearheaded by a 5-foot-8 point guard.
</P>
<P>
   But if Connecticut thinks the battle for respect is over, well,
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the game until the last seconds,'' Gonzaga guard
Matt Santangelo said. ``It's not like we lost the game by 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. And this just in: The combined seeding of UConn's
conquests is 40. Not exactly a riveting run to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, we haven't played our `A' game yet,'' Huskies guard
Ricky Moore said. ``But when we get everyone playing their special
game on the same night, we're unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a week to practice,'' El-Amin said. ``We can tune up
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, after shaking off Iowa in the closing
minutes, the Huskies were bursting with confidence. Later that
night, El-Amin scoffed about the perception of playing in a 63-team
field with one pre-ordained champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's hyping up Duke as much as possible, and they
haven't even played us yet,'' El-Amin said. ``I'll leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Duke is beatable?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the UConn message had softened considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we send to ourselves is we're happy to go to
Florida,'' Calhoun said. ``If anyone's talking, I guarantee Duke
isn't listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Gonzaga wasn't too impressed. Had a lid not formed on
the basket, had they not lost their edge on the boards, had
Santangelo not lost his game, had either one of two Gonzaga players
recognized an open teammate outside the three-point arc in the
closing seconds . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, we had an opportunity to win down the stretch,''
Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't tee it up like we did in the last couple of
games,'' center Jeremy Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sorry all you Gonzag-nuts. Your team deserves mad praise
for supplying some entertainment value to a staggering tournament.
For openly disdaining all the gleeful cliches and glass slippers.
For proving they belong. But for the competitive balance of the
Final Four, it's best that UConn advances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be nice to see one of the few anointed
heavyweights play up to their marquee value. Nice to know that if
UConn can survive Ohio State, a team that lost to Illinois two
weeks ago, the Huskies can make a championship game worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they cut down the nets and soaked in the victory,
but the swagger was missing. And when asked about the Blue Devils,
the cockiness was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we come to that bridge, we'll cross it,'' El-Amin said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is really all the Huskies accomplished on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can they handle the other side? &QL;

GARCIAPARRA SEEKS SECOND OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GARCIAPARRA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ There can no longer be any hiding behind
half-answers, shrugged shoulders, or, as was the case Saturday when
Nomar Garciaparra left camp with no comment, silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortstop is sufficiently concerned about the
condition of his right arm _ more specifically, his right elbow _
that he plans to fly Sunday to Los Angeles for a magnetic resonance
imaging and a consultation with Dr. Tony Daly, who was medical
director for the 1984 Olympics and is the team doctor for the NBA's
LA Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who has not played shortstop since March 11 _ a
span of nine games, including Saturday's 2-1 win over the
Pittsburgh Pirates _ met Saturday afternoon with team doctor Arthur
Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, who had left camp more than a week ago and had not seen
Garciaparra since the injury, said the shortstop had
``sensitivity'' in his right biceps, but stated for the first time
that the primary area of concern was a strained flexor muscle,
located on the inside of the elbow. The MRI, Pappas said, will
determine whether there is any ligament damage. Saturday, Pappas
said Garciaparra had a ``mild'' strained ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ligament, we have to see what's going on,'' he said.
``I think he's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, asked if he thought Garciaparra would be playing again
at the end of the week, said, ``Probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra took some ground balls at shortstop Saturday
morning, lobbing them back into the home plate area or flipping
them to second without making any throws to first. He also hit in
the batting tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling better each day,'' Pappas said. ``He's doing his
ground balls, hitting and fielding OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, despite denials, apparently had decided to seek a
second opinion even before meeting with Pappas. Normally, Pappas
said, the Red Sox would have sent the player to the UMass Medical
Center in Worcester for the MRI, but with Garciaparra's plans to
see Daly, it was decided that it was best for the exam to take
place in LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have recommended an (MRI) at this point,'' said
Pappas, adding that he was in full agreement with Garciaparra's
desire to seek a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas has asked Garciaparra to also see noted orthopedist Dr.
Lewis Yocum, one of the foremost elbow specialists in baseball.
Yocum is team doctor for the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an excellent idea,'' Pappas said of Garciaparra's
wish for a second opinion. ``First of all, it's (his) right.
Secondly, it's important for me to have information from people
with knowledge of baseball biomechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said he believes Garciaparra has some history with Daly
but didn't know the circumstances under which Garciaparra may have
seen Daly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, club officials, including manager Jimy Williams,
described Garciaparra's condition as biceps tendinitis, a muscle
problem that in the case of infielders usually requires only two or
three days of treatment. Pappas said Saturday that diagnosis did
not come from him. Garciaparra was given anti-inflammatory
medication, and Pappas said Saturday he was responding well to the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Garciaparra told reporters he had felt a ``sharp
pain'' in his arm, though he didn't mention that his elbow was
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra watched Saturday's exhibition from the bench,
dressed quickly and left. When reporters sought to speak with him
in the waiting area reserved for family and friends, Garciaparra
told club publicist Kevin Shea repeatedly he did not wish to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that it was suggested to him that Garciaparra
injured his arm while making a relay throw March 11 in an
exhibition against Toronto. It was in Toronto in June 1997 that Tim
Naehring sustained a career-ending elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said there is no correlation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's didn't show improvement,'' Pappas said. ``Nomar has
shown improvement.''

FINAL FOUR EMOTIONAL TRIP FOR CALHOUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After Kevin Freeman heaved the ball nearly to the
rafters and Ricky Moore got off one last celebratory shot, after
the mobbing and the hugging and the net-cutting, Connecticut's
players gave their coach, Jim Calhoun, an ice water shower right
there at midcourt at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the frustrations were washed away, the smoldering
embers of past NCAA Tournament failures doused. UConn and Calhoun
are going to the Final Four. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited Huskies beat spirited Gonzaga, 67-62, advancing to
St. Petersburg, Fla., next week and ascending to Calhoun's view of
``heaven'' for the first time in school history. UConn will play
South Region champion Ohio State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a soaked Calhoun again downplayed the significance
for himself and spoke of the program he has built over the past 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared that people would put so much undue pressure om Jim
Calhoun going to the Final Four,'' he said. ``I'm tagging along as
the coach. Connecticut's going to the Final Four. I didn't want
that pressure put on the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to do everything humanly possible, including
yelling an awful lot, about just (focusing on) basketball. That's
all we talked about today. Another road game to earn a trip to
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, another road game that moved Calhoun to the brink of
tears, that moved his wife, Pat, past that point when he summoned
her from the stands for a warm embrace. Another road game that
prompted his son, Jim Jr., to also choke up and whisper, ``I'm
proud of you, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another road game that has an entire state figuring out how
to hitch itself to a trailer and head down Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, top-seeded in the West and the strong favorite, had
to literally snatch the game from the 10th-seeded Bulldogs and the
non-UConn portion of the 18,053 fans who embraced the underdog Zags
and tried to scream them into a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   It almost worked, but the Huskies are tougher than that. They
hit the backboards with a ferocity that produced 21 offensive
rebounds and 10 points off second and third chances in the last 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Forced into a zone because of their inability to deal one-on-one
with All-America forward Richard Hamilton, the Bulldogs paid the
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just piranhas on the boards,'' Gonzaga Coach Dan
Monson said of the Huskies after Freeman, a junior forward, had 15
rebounds, 10 off the offensive glass. Both were career highs.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said, ``It was a matter of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of down-and-dirty work was needed to offset an
0-for-12 shooting performance by sophomore point guard Khalid
El-Amin. El-Amin also got into early foul trouble, and UConn never
got into an offensive flow, shooting 36.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But El-Amin predicted Friday that defense would determine the
outcome, and he was right. The Huskies locked on Gonzaga's
three-point shooters, who had riddled Minnesota, Stanford and
Florida to advance farther in the tournament than most presumed
possible.
</P>
<P>
   After making 32 of 63 three-pointers in their three West Region
victories, the Bulldogs were 5 for 21 against the Huskies. Richie
Frahm, who made five three-pointers in Thursday's win over Florida,
was 1 for 7. Matt Santangelo, the team's No. 2 scorer behind Frahm,
was 0 for 4 from long range and 1 for 9 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who was named the regional's outstanding player, had
the primary defensive duty on Frahm. But he couldn't explain what
he did, except to say, ``I wasn't worried about scoring baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   He did anyway, ending up with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a senior guard whom Calhoun labels the best defender he
has coached, was chiefly responsible for Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as good as it gets,'' Monson said of Moore's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get up into him when he caught the ball on
the perimeter because I knew he was a terrific shooter,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their failures from three-point range, the Zags did
enough from other parts of the court to lead by one at halftime and
by four with 16:28 to go before a 14-4 run gave UConn a 51-45 lead
with 8:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (32-2) wouldn't trail again. But Gonzaga (28-7)
repeatedly stayed within a breath, the last time with 36.6 seconds
left when Quentin Hall launched a three-pointer from his shoulder
to cut the UConn lead to 63-62.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin came back with a pair of free throws to put the Huskies
up by three, and Santangelo opted for a two-point attempt on the
next possession. But his runner in the lane was altered by UConn
center Jake Voskuhl. Freeman hit a pair of free throws and then
stole the inbound pass, heaving it into the air as time was
expiring. Moore grabbed it, shot and missed, but the celebration
already had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga huddled up and walked off, heads held high. After that,
Santangelo talked of friendship and love of each other and of
competition. He said the most important thing he wanted to get
across was ``people to understand that we deserve to be here.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - After it was over, Khalid El-Amin had plenty to smile
about.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he spent all but four minutes of the first half
on the bench in foul trouble. Or missed all 12 field-goal attempts.
Or committed what could have been a costly turnover when he took
his eye off a teammate's pass with less than two minutes left. Or
was outplayed by Gonzaga's 5-foot-8 Quentin Hall.
</P>
<P>
   UConn won, 67-62, in Saturday's West Region final at America
West Arena, so everything was fine in El-Amin's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few good looks, and I missed,'' he said, shrugging off
his performance. ``I decided I was going to try and do a few more
little things. I had a couple assists and also a couple of big
rebounds. We got the `W,' and that's what I was very pleased
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have easily turned disastrous for El-Amin. With
Connecticut clinging to a two-point lead, he let a pass slip
through his hands out of bounds, giving Gonzaga the ball with 1:47
left. Fourteen seconds later, Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo was at
the free-throw line for a one-and-one that could have tied the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo missed the first shot, and the Huskies held off the
Bulldogs the rest of the way, thanks in part to two key free throws
by El-Amin that gave UConn a three-point lead with 34.4 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-10 and 203 pounds, the only sharp edges to El-Amin are
in his game. His tough mentality is his biggest asset. Yet
Saturday, it was his mental mistakes that did him in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first couple of possessions, I wasn't paying attention
to detail very well,'' he said. ``I was running at him (Hall), he
went around me, and I bumped him twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun considered bringing El-Amin back in the first half, but
the Bulldogs never threatened to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we stayed within three or four points, I felt we
could roll the dice,'' Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin struggled when he returned, missing all 10 of his
second-half shots. And his turnover late in the game would have
been costly had Gonzaga converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so many thoughts going through my mind at one time, I
just forgot about catching the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, meanwhile, caused the Huskies problems all afternoon. He
finished with 18 points and was the best point guard on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out with every intention of outplaying him (El-Amin),
but I do that every game, no matter who I play against,'' Hall
said. ``I tell you what, if I had a choice, I'd take his game and
take the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall and El-Amin held an animated conversation in the final
minute, but after the game neither wanted to go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some friendly greetings-type things,'' is how El-Amin
described the conversation. ``He was trying to get into our heads.
We won the game, so that's my talking.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hall was confident, he didn't expect El-Amin to play as
poorly as he did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him on TV,'' Hall said. ``I know he's got more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of UConn's biggest strengths is its depth. When El-Amin
went out, senior Ricky Moore took over at the point and finished
with 12 points, three assists and one turnover. He also was
suffocating defensively, limiting Santangelo to 1-of-9 shooting
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was the Huskies starting point guard until El-Amin
arrived, so he felt comfortable in the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew somebody had to step up because Khalid was out,'' Moore
said. ``We were not making the shots in the first half, and I knew
someone had to do it. I thought this could be my last game, and
that kind of scared me.''

YOU CAN'T BRAND HIM A SOFTIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ How do you describe the play of Duke
sophomore power forward Elton Brand? You know that space on the
front and sides of the basket, the area folks call the paint? That
belongs to him. It's his. Others in college basketball play well in
the area. Some would lead you to believe they control the paint,
that they own it. They don't. Elton Brand does.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound widebody owns it because if a loose
ball lands in that area and he is among five players who go after
it, he is the one who comes up with it. Attack him with a shot and
watch him swat it out of the paint. He's territorial.
</P>
<P>
   Double- or triple-team him in the area while trying to score,
and watch him score. Whack him in the process and watch him step to
the line to complete the 3-point play. He's strong, tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   Leave a driving lane along the baseline that only an underweight
gnat could get through, and he'll find a way through. He's agile,
nimble. Try to beat him to the baseline and you'll settle for
second. He's quick, fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The national player of the year candidate is the primary reason
top-ranked, top-seeded Duke (35-1) is one of the most dominant
teams in recent college basketball history, why it enters Sunday's
East Regional final against sixth-seeded Temple (game time is 2:40
p.m.) the odds-on favorite to capture its third national
championship this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how big he is, but man he plays basketball as
well as I've ever seen a strong forward,'' said Temple coach John
Chaney. ``Watch him play with those long arms, and to watch him
play like a pro at this level is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand leads the team in scoring (17.7 ppg) and rebounds (9.6
rpg) and is coming off a most impressive showing in Duke's 78-61
victory over 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State in the regional
semifinal. He finished with 14 points, 8 rebounds (including 5
offensive), 5 blocks, and 4 steals. Battling 6-11 center Danny
Moore and being double-teamed throughout, Brand controlled the
paint as if, well, as if he owned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can muscle you. He can bounce off people,'' said Chaney.
``He can throw his body into you and make you play to the basket.
I've neer seen a player his size play that well underneath. I
remember Larry Johnson, from Las Vegas, but he's even better than
that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   And he does it with an intense demeanor that spreads to his
teammates. ``He brings a lot, from his personality to his
expressions on the court,'' said Duke guard William Avery. ``When
he scores and shakes his head at a guy, like he's saying, `It's no
way you can guard me,' we really feed off of that. We get energy
and we just play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that a player could be this dominant in
college basketball. But someone from Peekskill, N.Y., a small,
bucolic town more than 30 minutes north of New York City?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember taking a bus trip upstate to play an AAU game,''
said Brand, ``and the guys on my team were looking at different
media guides. They said, `Throw out a school. Where would you like
to go?' And I said, `Duke, Georgetown, North Carolina.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a freshman at the time, and they were like, `Be
realistic.' They thought I should have gone to a place like the
University of Buffalo. That was where they were looking at. I had
big dreams, and they kept saying, `Be realistic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a few growth spurts following his freshman year in
high school. Brand grew to 6-4, 200 pounds as a 13-year-old. And,
when he realized kids his age were too small to contend with him,
he took his game to outdoor courts, to play against men two or
three years out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   They were multi-talented players who didn't make it to college
but still were living out their basketball fantasies. He was
someone trying to make his unfold. ``They were signed-up hackers,''
said Brand. ``That's all they did. They would just hack you and
wouldn't let you call the foul, so I was used to being physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Peekskill High School coach Lou Panzanaro gave Brand's
dream a major push in 10th grade, working with him on low-post
moves, jump hooks, drop steps and his work ethic so much that it
almost backfired when Brand contemplated quitting basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say things like, `All right, we're not leaving until
Elton makes 20 jump hooks,' '' said Brand,in a tone that reveals
he's still a little bothered by his coach's approach. ``It was
extra pressure on me, but he wanted me to improve and I give him a
lot of credit for my success and work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   By his junior season, the kid from Peekskill had begun excelling
at AAU tournaments against some of the nation's stars and became
one of the most sought-after players before choosing Duke over
Kentucky, Villanova, and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival at Duke, Brand has been one of the most
dominant players in college basketball. Last season he was named an
honorable mention All-American, averaging 13.4 points and 7.4
rebounds. ``Being able to play against some of the top players like
Antawn Jamison and Robert Traylor last year,'' he said, ``that's
what gave me the confidence (to think) I can play at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he suffered a broken left foot in practice last season that
forced him to miss 15 games. Brand returned to help guide Duke to
last year's NCAA South Regional final, but the Blue Devils lost to
eventual champion Kentucky after leading by as many as 18 points in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up a lot, and I remember saying with 12 minutes to go
that we were on our way to the Final Four,'' said Brand. ``And then
the buzzer sounded and we were down by 2. That was somewhat of a
daze.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand scored just 4 points in that game. He wasn't as dominant a
player as before the injury and said he sought to prove the setback
had left no lasting effects. Many said he began doing that when he
led the US squad to a gold medal in last summer's Goodwill Games,
where he averaged 17 points, 7.6 boards, and shot 65 percent from
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a New York summer league matchup against New York
resident Anthony Mason, now with the NBA Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to make it more of a matchup and all the fans
there were trying to make him go at me,'' said Brand. ``He pretty
much went at me. But I held my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his prowess this season, Brand was benched for Duke's
games against Michigan (Dec. 12) and North Carolina A&AMP;T (Dec. 20).
The remainder of the season, he was arguably the most dominant
player in college ball, posting double figures in 13 of Duke's
remaining 24 games. That included a 16-point, 12-board, 7-block
effort vs. St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just not playing hard enough,'' Brand said, ``and I
think the coach wanted to send a message to the team that nothing's
given, especially on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the NCAA Tournament, Brand has fielded questions
regarding his future. He denied reports that he will definitely
turn pro, going so far as to say that he is leaning toward
returning to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can let down the temptation (of going to the
NBA) is knowing it will be there and enjoying yourself right now,''
said Brand. ``I think I'm leaning more towards staying because I
love school and this is all I know. I don't know how to be rich,
how to have money yet.''

SHY ON FANCY BUT IT COUNTS  
 FOR UCONN'S HAM ILTON, REGION TITLE STILL A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It wasn't the prettiest of victories, but All-America
forward Richard Hamilton said the videotape of Connecticut's 67-62
win over Gonzaga on Saturday goes right to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Shots weren't falling. The Huskies made just 36.9 percent of
them. Point guard Khalid El-Amin was 0 for 12 and was reduced to
being a spectator for most of the first half because of two fouls.
</P>
<P>
   But the statistic the Huskies can cherish all the way to St.
Petersburg, Fla. _ site of the Final Four _ is the rebounds,
particularly on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   UConn had 47 boards. Twenty-one were on the offensive end, 13 in
the second half. Gonzaga, which had three fewer rebounds in the
first half, when it led by a point, finished with 33 boards, 13 on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not be on your `A' game, but to still will yourself to win,
shows how much heart we had today,'' said center Jake Voskuhl, who
had nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga used a 1-2-2 zone for much of the second half. Its game
plan was to turn the quicker Huskies into jump shooters. Given
UConn's shooting struggles, including 0 for 9 from three-point
range, it seemed a sound strategy. But when the shots were clanking
off the rim, Kevin Freeman was usually there. So was Voskuhl. So
was reserve forward Edmund Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with trying to get them to shoot outside, when
you're in a zone, they're piranhas on the boards,'' Bulldogs Coach
Dan Monson said. ``We paid the price. Twenty-one offensive
rebounds. We cut that in half and we're probably second at this
podium'' _ referring to the post-game news conference in which the
losing team meets the media first.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman rated his offensive performance a one (he made 4 of 14
shots), but the way he hit the offensive boards, especially in the
second half, received ovations from his coach and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He had 10 of his 15 rebounds on the offensive end, including a
tip off his own miss with 7:42 to play to give the Huskies a 53-47
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin has had more artistic games,'' Coach Jim Calhoun said.
``But coming down the stretch, he had that look you occasionally
see with him that he will not be denied. I think, down the stretch,
his rebounding was one of the most phenomenal things I've seen a
guy do.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he noticed how Gonzaga beat Florida on a late tip
in Thursday's semifinals. He said there was no way the Huskies were
going to let this game get away by being soft on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gonzaga) got after it early, and it kind of told us, `Hey, we
have to make this lane ours and keep them out,' '' Freeman said.
``We had to fight for every score. It was a tough situation. But
this team isn't going to quit after the shot goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun also liked his team's defensive effort. Hamilton limited
Richie Frahm, Gonzaga's leading scorer, to seven points on 2-of-11
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here is the first time I had respect for my defense,''
Hamilton said. ``I told everybody, but nobody wanted to listen. I'm
trying to be a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton did his part on offense, too. With El-Amin on the
bench, Hamilton put the Huskies on his back and scored 11 of his 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look up in the dictionary for NBA player and you've got
Hamilton,'' Monson said. ``He does everything you want from a
player.'' &QL;

SANTANGELO TAKES LOSS PERSONALLY  
 GONZAGA GUARD BLAMES OWN PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo has endured a more
miserable game, he can't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 2-for-12 shooting performance against Idaho. But
that came in a 39-point non-conference victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 1-for-9 effort couldn't have come at a worse time _
the biggest game in school history and a chance for the Bulldogs to
continue their fairy-tale season.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo blamed himself for Gonzaga's 67-62 loss to
Connecticut in the NCAA West Regional final at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I let down my teammates with my performance,''
said Santangelo, Gonzaga's floor leader and its first honorable
mention All-American since John Stockton in 1984. ``It's a real
personal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Santangelo's dismal shooting, the Bulldogs still
had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Quentin Hall's off-balance three-pointer with 36
seconds left pulled Gonzaga to within one point. Then, after
Connecticut's Khalid El-Amin hit two free throws with 34 seconds
remaining, Santangelo had another chance to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   He drove through the lane with eight seconds left and could have
dished the ball to either wing for a game-tying three pointer.
Instead, he shot and missed, and the Bulldogs were forced to foul
with 6.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have kicked it out,'' Santangelo said.
``Then again, we could have gotten a quick score (two-pointer), and
there still would have been plenty of time left. We could have
fouled and then had another possession. I may have made a bad
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until Saturday, Santangelo had made many good decisions in
orchestrating Gonzaga's marvelous ride through the NCAA Tournament
from the No. 10 seed to the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I don't feel I did the things I did all year,'' said
Santangelo, who finished with a season-low two points. ``I fought
through it. But I still feel real disappointed in myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win a game like this, you have to have all the
strengths going at once. The (shooting) guards never held up their
end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo and Richie Frahm combined to shoot 3 of 20 from the
field, 1 of 11 from three-point range. As a team, the Bulldogs were
5 of 21 beyond the arc. In their first three tournament games, the
Bulldogs made 32 of 63 three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo's teammates were quick to come to his defense. Hall,
who kept the Bulldogs in the game with a team-high 18 points and
eight rebounds, said he thought Santangelo was being too hard on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Casey Calvary concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's got so much on his shoulders,'' Calvary said. ``The
other team focuses on him so much, and he does so many other
things, bringing the ball up, rebounding, defense. He still had a
good game, even if the shots weren't falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Frahm's shots weren't falling, either. He was 2 of 11 from the
field, 1 of 7 from three-point range while being guarded by
Connecticut All-America forward Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the life of a shooter,'' Frahm said. ``You live and die
with the shot. I just couldn't hit the open shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Monson said the offensive difficulties were somewhat
understandable, given the magnitude of the game and the caliber of
the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team isn't just a three-point-shooting freak show,''
Monson said. ``We've had games where the shots didn't go in. It
didn't surprise me we were struggling offensively. This was a game
to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall was up to the task. He completely outplayed El-Amin,
holding him without a field goal on 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was indescribable,'' Santangelo said of Hall. ``He did
everything he needed to do for us to win. I feel sorry we didn't
give him any help.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the loss, the 10th-seeded Bulldogs know they put
Gonzaga's program on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to understand we belonged and we deserved to be
here,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Said center Jeremy Eaton, ``This was not the way we wanted it to
end, but in a couple of days, we will realize where we were. We
were among the top eight teams in college basketball.''

WEBB VAULTS TO THE FRONT  
 BUT LEADER RESPECTS FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Perhaps it is too early to hand Karrie Webb a check
for $127,500, the lion's share of the purse for the Standard
Register PING.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lorie Kane is a fine player who is only 2 strokes
back entering today's final round at Moon Valley Country Club. And
former Arizona State University star Wendy Ward and Scottsdale's
Tina Barrett also are in shouting distance, 4 off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Albers has an outside chance, too. She is 5 strokes back
after posting the best score of Saturday's wind-blown third round,
a 6-under 66.
</P>
<P>
   Although Webb is 48 under through her last 11 rounds, the
Australian knows better than to get ahead of herself.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it's her tournament to win or lose, Webb said, ``No,
there's a lot of good players in this field, and I have a lot of
respect for the girls that are up there on the leader board. I
could still shoot 2 or 3 under and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way the cool and confident Webb is striking her driver,
launching her irons and holing putts, she looks unsinkable. In the
19 rounds she has played this season, she has been under par in 15.
Only twice has she been over par, and those were just barely, a 73
and a 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play the same sort of golf I have been and see what
happens,'' said Webb, who already has two victories in 1999,
including a record-setting 26-under effort in the recent Australian
Ladies Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A 2-shot lead) can be turned around in one hole, and this
course can reach up and grab you.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Webb has her game on cruise control. Her latest
effort included four birdies and a bogey as her 69 got her to 11
under.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were pretty tough out there,'' noted Webb, who
entered the day 1 shot behind second-round leader Tracy Hanson, who
felt the wrath of the wind on her way to a devastating 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a little windy, and the course is drying up,''
Hanson said. ``The new greens (Nos. 14, 15 and 18) are like bricks.
(The wind) affected club selection, especially the last few holes,
because it was crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson actually lost the lead on the first hole, where she
bogeyed and Webb birdied. From that point on, everyone was in
pursuit of Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karrie drove it fabulous,'' said Kane, who was in the same
threesome. ``My consistency comes from driving the ball, and I let
the wind move me around out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kane still managed to hang on with a birdie on the final
hole that got her to 71 and 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said she's just glad ``we've got one more round of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest, I wasn't trying to chase Karrie, just stay as
close as possible,'' said the Canadian, who has yet to win on the
LPGA in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Kane knows what she is up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a golf swing, a game and an attitude like
Karrie, you're going to win,'' Kane said. ``She really sets the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who carded a 68, and Barrett, who shot 70, have both won
before. Of the two, Ward has perhaps the best vibes, having
finished in third place here as an amateur in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said she does not feel intimidated while chasing the
hottest player in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karrie and I have played a lot of golf together,'' said Ward,
who at one point had it to 8 under through her first eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, I (was paired in the final round of the Standard
Register PING) with the best two golfers in the world at that time,
Beth (Daniel) and Laura (Davies), and came close to catching
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Albers, who made seven birdies and a bogey to get to 6 under,
will have to go at least that low again _ and hope Webb has a
hiccup or two.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it's probably long-shot city, as three other
pre-tournament favorites _ Davies (72), Annika Sorenstam (71) and
Helen Alfredsson (74) _ are all 7 strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's biggest fear, if there is such a thing, might be that the
forecast calls for stiffer breezes today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what the weather will do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane hopes the wind blows and blows and blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on an island,'' said Kane, who hails from Prince
Edward Island. ``I'll be happy if it does.'' &QL;

HOLES IN ONE JUST PAR FOR THE LPGA COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Annika Sorenstam was steamed. Standing outside the
scorer's tent, she shook her head. Downcast, arms crossed, she
muttered to herself and her caddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ``Annika'','' I wanted to say, and it was all I could do
to keep from grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her
violently, ``you got a HOLE IN ONE!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish-born golfer aced the par 3 second hole Saturday at
Moon Valley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Her 8-iron shot traveled 140 yards. Dropping out of the bright
blue sky, the little white ball landed softly on the green,
bounced, rolled about 15 feet and disappeared like a bunny rabbit
down a hole. Startled witnesses erupted in wild cheers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the miracle, Sorenstam requested a few moments
alone while she composed herself. Sorenstam, who shot 71, couldn't
shake her disappointment after bogeying the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   And the hole in one?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good shot,'' Sorenstam said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good''?
</P>
<P>
   Perfect, if you asked me.
</P>
<P>
   But what do I know?
</P>
<P>
   Like most human beings, I've never made a hole in one, and I've
been trying since before Annika was born.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam's muted reaction to a feat that duffers dream of
experiencing just once before going to that big par 3 course in the
clouds is typical of professional shotmakers. To them a hole in one
isn't such a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis Stacy hasn't made a hole in one during the LPGA Standard
Register PING tournament, but she has bagged her share. How many,
Hollis?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about eight,'' she said casually.
</P>
<P>
   ``About'' eight?
</P>
<P>
   ``In competition, only three or four.'' Hollis said, smiling.
``I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   How does one not remember something as remarkable as a hole in
one? To me, it's like asking a mother how many times she has given
birth, and she says `Oh, three, maybe four. . .'' The exact number
had slipped her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy said she got her first hole in one when she was 12 or 13.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to strangle her.
</P>
<P>
   Groucho Marx once was asked what he thought was the toughest
shot in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it,'' Marx replied, his eyebrows doing pushups, ``to be
the hole in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the degree of difficulty is overrated. Jackie
Gallagher-Smith knocked the ball into the 15th hole on Friday, 172
yards, using a five iron. LPGA players have recorded five holes in
one in eight tournaments this year.
</P>
<P>
   These women totaled 25 aces in tournament competition last year,
and a record 29 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Whitworth, an LPGA pioneer, had 11 during her career. Jan
Stephenson has more aces (8) than ex-husbands. Tracy Kerdyk had
three holes in one in one ``year''.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Ward, the former ASU All-American, scored her first ace in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still three behind my mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I hate them. Both of them.
</P>
<P>
   If life were fair, each person who played golf would be allotted
one hole in one.
</P>
<P>
   But life isn't fair, as evidenced by a Texas man who claims he
has recorded more than 40. Mancil Davis reportedly once sliced his
tee shot into a pine tree. The ball ricocheted toward the green,
bounced off a sprinkler head and hopped into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable is the frequency of holes in one scored on
the LPGA Tour. TV announcer Ben Wright once actually said that
women golfers were handicapped because they ``have boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this anatomical ``disadvantage,'' women keep knocking
the ball into the hole with one swing. &QL;

BARKLEY, ROCKETS KNOCK OFF SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Charles Barkley was embarrassed the last time the
Houston Rockets lost a game. It was in Phoenix, where Barkley says
the Suns have a team that won't even reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Barkley made amends against his old ballclub,
scoring a season-high 35 points, including the first six on three
unanswered baskets in overtime, and grabbed 18 rebounds as the
Rockets beat the Suns, 103-93, at the Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and the Rockets sent the Suns home with their third loss
on a four-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Suns Coach Danny Ainge, after wearing Barkley down with Joe
Kleine defending him in Phoenix, tried the same ploy in the
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked for them once, so they tried it again,'' Barkley
said. ``Only this time we weren't playing the second game
back-to-back.''
</P>
<P>
   And he made Kleine a profit. The Suns' reserve center had said,
after limiting Barkley to two fourth-quarter baskets in Phoenix,
that if Barkley is hitting his mid-range jump shots, ``you're at
his mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   They were, and he was merciless, scoring inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's one of the top 50 players of all time,''
Kleine said.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge agreed. ``It's pick your poisin in the overtime,'' he
said. ``Do we play him man-to-man and hope he can't post us up, or
do we double-team and let them shoot threes?'' he said. ``It's a
helpless feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took all Barkley had to keep the Suns from stealing
another from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had an opportunity to win in regulation, but Scottie
Pippen forced Phoenix guard Rex Chapman into a turnover with 5.1
seconds remaining, ma king up for his own turnover with 14 seconds
to go that opened the door for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a miscommunication,'' Chapman said. ``I take
responsibility because I'm a guard out on the court. I don't think
everybody knew what we were doing. We were trying to get me a shot
off a screen, and the play broke do wn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard, but there's no excuse for the mental
breakdowns. You can live with the physical mistakes, but we lost
this game because of mental mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns had played with the same exuberance they had in
Houston in their fourth game in five nights on the road earlier in
the trip, they would have gotten out of Charlotte or Atlanta with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   They hit the boards, scrambled for loose balls. Luc Longley even
drove past Hakeem Olajuwon for a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was that guy?'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge asked.
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Gugliotta pouring in 12 of his team-high 22 points in
the first quarter, the Suns mounted a 27-22 lead. Still, they had
to weather an 18-0 second-quarter Houston run to stay in the game.
And the Rockets mounted it with center Hakeem Olajuwon and Pippen
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It started after Danny Manning's 17-foot shot put the Suns up
29-22 less than a minute into the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley's postup move in the lane started it with 10:50
to go in the second and Barkley's fade-away jumper, then a power
move in the paint capped it with 6:04 to go in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Manning finally ended it with a driving layup, and that started
a surprising 11-1 Phoenix counterpunch that trimmed a 40-29 deficit
to two points.
</P>
<P>
   And the Suns actually regained the lead briefly when Gugliotta
pushed the ball up the floor, kicked it to Kidd, who fed Robinson's
for the finish and a 46-45 lead. But Pippen hit his first shot of
the half, a three-pointer, with 19.9 seconds to go and Othella
Harrington's free throw with less than a second remaining sent the
Rockets to the locker room with a 49-46 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Suns responded, this time with one of their best
third-quarter performances of the season. The third quarter is
often their Achilles heel. It was 24 hours earlier in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting five rallied to a 60-60 tie, then the reserves
came in and kept it going. Rex Chapman's three-point shot with half
a second to go in the quarter gave the Suns their biggest lead of
the game to that point, 77-68.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets rallied behind Barkley. He scored their first five
points in a 10-0 Houston run to start the final period. His
offensive rebound and putback basket with 6:16 to play started
another spurt, this one 8-2 that gave the Rockets an 86-84 lead
with 4:03 to go in the game. And Barkley's fastbreak lay up with
1:31 to go gave Houston a three-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the Suns last-gasp effort. &QL;

COYOTES TRADE FOR ISLANDERS' LEADING SCORER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - General Manager Bobby Smith fired the 100 mph slap
shot everyone has been waiting for. And he scored Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the woeful New York Islanders decided to continue
gutting their team, Smith swooped in and plucked away their leading
scorer, 27-year-old center Robert Reichel, in exchange for young
winger Brad Isbister, 21, who is on the injured list with a pulled
groin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Coyotes swapped third-round picks in the
upcoming June NHL entry draft _ potentially moving up 18 spots that
round by virtue of the Isles' disastrous season _ and also acquired
a fourth-round pick from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased we were able to make this trade,'' Smith
said, shortly before the deal became official early Saturday night.
``Obviously, there's an age difference and a salary difference, but
you can tell by the compensatory picks involved that we value our
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been extremely impressed with Brad Isbister. He's
a terrific young player and a terrific young man, who's going to
have a great career. I did not want to trade him, but to get a
player as accomplished as Robert Reichel, who's so talented and so
good on the power play . . . (Jeremy) Roenick's the only guy we've
got who's scored more points than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Listed at 5-foot-10 and 186 pounds, Reichel, a two-time 40-goal
scorer from the Czech Republic, will center the Coyotes' No. 2 line
between veterans Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet. The eight-year pro,
who helped the Czechs win the gold medal last year at the Nagano
Olympics, should be in the Phoenix lineup tonight at 6 when the
Coyotes meet the Los Angeles Kings at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   After 70 games, he was leading the Islanders in goals (19),
assists (37) and points (56) _ eight fewer than Roenick. A
fifth-round find by Calgary in 1989, Reichel, who scored the
Czech's lone goal in their semifinal Olympic win over Canada, hit
the 40-goal mark with the Flames in 1992-93 and 1993-94. That last
season, when he added 53 assists for 93 points, was his NHL best.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel earns $1.7 million, $500,000 of which reportedly is paid
by the Flames following his trade to New York two years ago. He
will become a restricted free agent this summer and had threatened
to return to the Czech Republic for good if the Islanders didn't
extend his contract this season. Reportedly, he wants a multiyear
deal worth $3 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, isn't worried about losing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to have him here for several years and we'll deal
with that after the season,'' Smith said. ``I'm optimistic he's
going to like Phoenix, like our team and that's he's going to be
able to come to agreement with us on a new deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Isbister, who expects to play within a week to 10 days, said he
was shocked to learn he was going to the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard rumors I was going to Montreal for (Vincent)
Damphousse, so yeah, I was kind of caught off guard,'' Isbister
said. ``When Bobby called me, I thought that's what he was going to
say. But this is a good opportunity for me, too. I should get the
chance to play a lot and show them what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-round pick in '95, Isbister had four goals and four
assists for the Coyotes during an up-and-down, injury-riddled
season. He has missed 29 of the team's past 33 games because of the
nagging groin injury, which weeks ago developed into a hernia,
requiring surgery. He recently returned from that injury only to be
sidelined again after three games on the active list. &QL;

BOXING STENCH GROWS FROM GARBAGE INSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News item: Muhammad Ali knocks out Sonny Liston on May 25, 1965,
at Lewiston, Maine, with a phantom punch. It wasn't seen at
ringside, and it has never been detected in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Boxing is condemned.
</P>
<P>
   News item: Mike Tyson bites Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28,
1997, at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Loud condemnations.
</P>
<P>
   News item: Lennox Lewis scores heavily and repeatedly against
Holyfield, yet the judges declare a draw on March 13, 1999, at New
York's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: The chorus continues.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Will it ever end?
</P>
<P>
   The controversial beat of a sport, contentious by definition,
has been going on since the day somebody discovered that fists are
pretty handy as weapons. There's no dispute about the world's
oldest profession. Nonetheless, boxing runs a very close second,
both in time and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing always has resisted regulation. Defiance is admired
inside of the ropes and practiced outside of them. The public
complains. Yet it always seems to return. Many of 1.4 million
pay-per-view television customers for Tyson's dinner date with
Holyfield's ears screamed that they would never watch the sport
again. But, nearly two years later, there were about 1.2 million
customers for Lewis-Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like a great fight,'' said Don Harris, a
longtime boxing judge and the Maricopa County Attorney in 1976. ``A
great fight is like a work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   But the old art form is beginning to look like graffiti. It
still has its moments. Oscar De La Hoya's stirring decision over
Ike Quartey on Feb. 13 has been debated and reviewed as though it
were a masterpiece worth another look. But Lewis-Holyfield has
taken on a powerful stench. It's been called garbage by fans,
media, politicians and seemingly everybody but promoter Don King,
who is better at selling controversy than any tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis-Holyfield has begun to attract attention that not even
King can deflect, or perhaps elude. Above all, there's the
government, which has begun to look at the bout as though it were a
problem for waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three investigations. Two have been launched
by the state of New York. A third has been ongoing. The federal
district of Manhattan has had a grand jury looking into boxing's
business practices for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Arizona Senator John McCain, who has authored the
framework for some federal legislation and is pushing for more.
McCain was at ringside for Lewis-Holyfield. He said he a got phone
call last week from Muhammad Ali's wife, Lonnie, who relayed her
husband's disgust at the result. In a letter Wednesday to New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, McCain wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The best outcome of the Holyfield-Lewis bout would be a
complete overhaul of boxing industry abuses in America. . . . An
inquiry into the Holyfield-Lewis controversy presents an
opportunity to reform this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There are allegations that Holyfield-Lewis is the tip of a
titanic iceberg full of kickbacks to promoters, bribes for world
ratings and manipulation of judges. The ruling bodies _ World
Boxing Council, World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation _ take percentages of purses as sanctioning fees for
titles that are designed to give televised bouts some credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing always has been run by questionable, unethical practices.
In the late 1940s and 1950s, there was a U.S. Senate hearing on
involvement by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were better off when the mob ran it,'' said Steve Eisner, a
longtime Valley promoter who has managed fighters since the 1950s.
``At least then, you knew who and what you were dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the three organizations each want 2.5 to 5 percent of the
purses for sanctioning fees. The federal grand jury reportedly is
asking questions about whether those same organizations rig the
ratings. Can a top-10 ranking be bought?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called outstretched palms in T-room meetings, the T
standing for Treasury bills,'' said Eisner, who said in the 1940s
and '50s there was only one body _ the mob _ to pay, unlike today's
many-sided collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate task is to root out the influence that ruling
bodies and promoters have over the selection of judges, according
to Harris, McCain and Eisner. At Lewis-Holyfield, each of the
heavyweight titles _ WBA, IBF and WBC _ was represented by a judge
selected by the respective organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to change,'' said John Montano, executive director of
the Arizona State Boxing Commission and vice president of the
national Association of Commissions, which was created by McCain's
legislation. ``We need to create a pool of recognized, reputable
judges. Then, the national association would make assignments for
the big title fights. As states, we have to exercise more control
over who judges and referees.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, there are too many conflicts of
interest. For instance, the IBF judge is less likely to score
against that organization's champ. Example: Jean Williams was the
IBF judge at Lewis-Holyfield. Holyfield holds the IBF title.
Williams scored the fight for Holyfield. If there's a rematch,
there's another sanctioning fee for the IBF, which figures to look
kindly on Williams when it assigns judges for another major bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is now, if the judge doesn't see it the way the
organizations or the promoter sees it, that judge might not get
another assignment,'' Montano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, of course, wants to lose power they've had for a long
time. In trying to take away that power from the ruling bodies,
we'll undoubtedly have a huge fight on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as it doesn't end in a draw.

   HOUSTON _ Halfway through the NBA season, the Suns find
themselves sitting in eighth place in the Western Conference. And
if the playoffs began today, they'd just barely keep alive their
streak of playoff appearances, now at 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this tough. The Suns lost  &UR; Antonio
 &UR; McDyess to free agency, but the acquisition of  &UR; Tom Gugliotta
figured to fill that void. But the Suns lack the depth they've had
in recent seasons, and they hit the halfway mark a game below the
.500 mark (12-13) after a 103-93 overtime loss to the Rockets on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd have more wins at this point,'' said Suns Coach
 &UR; Danny Ainge. ``I didn't know the West was going to be as tough as
it is, and everybody in the West has stayed fairly healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't get any easier. Their April schedule is
murderous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that before the season, and I did not like what I
saw,'' Ainge said. ``No sense killing myself over that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have struggled in large part because they lack the
inside game most expected them to have with the addition of
Gugliotta and center  &UR; Luc Longley, and they've had spotty shooting
from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not expect that,'' Ainge said. ``I didn't think we would
have so much trouble scoring in the low post, or having such a
difficult time defending in the low post. That's like the blocking
and tackling of basketball _ scoring inside, rebounding and
defending inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think in the second half of the season, we'll get better
at all of those things, and we'll get better as a team.'' &QL; 
It's an outrage &QL; 
 &UR; Charles Barkley of the Rockets was in a more jovial mood Saturday
night than he had been in Phoenix, when the Suns beat the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Suns reserve center  &UR; Joe Kleine defended Barkley down the
stretch in that game, and Barkley made only two of eight shots in
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Joe (Friday) night _ in the middle of the night,''
Barkley said, gleefully. ``And I called him again this morning. I
told him it's been embarrassing to be walking around knowing he
actually stopped me in a game.'' &QL; 
Show me the money &QL; 
Barkley also took a playful swipe at teammate  &UR; Scottie Pippen, who
complained after that loss in Phoenix that he wasn't an integral
enough part of the Houston offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in Scottie,'' Barkley said, raising his voice
so it carried throughout the locker room. ``He's bitching about
shots. He wants all the money AND all the shots. I'll take a switch
on that. He can have all the shots if I can have HALF his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is playing this season for $1 million. Pippen is getting
about $9 million in the first year of a seven-year contract. &QL;

NFL: INTO 21ST CENTURY AT 55 MPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's viewed as a ``Good Old Boys'' club, a bunch of
rich curmudgeons who aren't crazy about change.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, change the NFL did during the spring meetings at the
Arizona Biltmore last week _ even if some of the team owners had to
be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   They took steps to catch up with high technology, foremost being
their approval of the return of instant replay on a one-year trial.
</P>
<P>
   There were other issues discussed that could impact the league
significantly, but the manner with which the owners dealt with
those indicates that they're still generally driving 55 mph in a 75
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to several high-profile officiating snafus, an instant
replay video has become as hot an item as a Lauryn Hill video, and
even the geriatric crowd in the owners' room seemed to appreciate
that.
</P>
<P>
   Three systems, shown to teams at the scouting combine in
February, are under consideration to become the means by which
instant replay will be administered during its trial run. All are
quick and sharp to view, addressing the biggest concern among many
replay opponents: pace of the game. The strongest sentiment seemed
to be for a hand-held digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   When the coach wants to make a replay challenge, he will beep
the referee, much like a restaurant pages patrons who have waited
an hour and 45 minutes for a table, or like the employee in the
third hour of a lunch break who is being sought frantically by the
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I like the old bean bag that you tossed out
there,'' said Mike Holmgren, new coach of the Seattle Seahawks.
``But it ``is'' the high-tech age. It might be kind of fun to zap
these guys once in a while, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also lead to the hiring of a computer-geek assistant
coach to monitor network television feeds of games to determine
whether a challenge is likely to be won, according to Tony Dungy,
coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Coaches don't want to waste a
timeout on a lost challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're all going to have to take a look at
now,'' Dungy said. ``It's possible that we'll have to have a replay
coach who would have the same access to the TV feed as the replay
assistant working with the officiating crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stately Wellington Mara, the owner of the New York Giants
who epitomizes the league's old guard, changed his vote this time,
after voting against replay nine straight times. ``Duke,'' as he is
known, is approaching his 83rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are new stunts they are going to try, and new
equipment,'' Mara said. ``They have all this new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is a by-committee version of instant replay, with
narrow parameters governing what can be challenged. Supporters
conceded they just wanted to get it on the books while the issue is
hot, try out the new technology, and hope that it works so well
that it will be expanded and extended when the owners re-evaluate
it next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't get it passed this time,'' Holmgren said, ``we
never would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay will give officials the ability to reverse many
of the obviously blown calls. But not all of them. The one that
most sticks in the craw of Cardinals fans was the obvious pass
interference against Rob Moore by Kevin Smith of the Dallas Cowboys
on the final play at Sun Devil Stadium in November. Had it been
called, the Cardinals would have had one play from the 1-yard line
to score, tie the game, and force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been no effect on that play with this system,
it's not viewable,'' said Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin. Pass
interference is not covered in the trial replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never included judgment calls,'' said Holmgren,
co-chairman of the league's competition committee. ``What we'd like
to do is develop consistency in the way officials call pass
interference. That is a tough call, but you can't have judgment
part of instant replay.''
</P>
<P>
   On some matters, the owners ought to make faster judgment calls
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While the owners are enjoying unprecedented wealth in their
revenue sharing plan thanks to huge television rights and expansion
fees, they could rake in even more. The nation's second-largest
television market, Los Angeles, has been allowed to remain out of
the league for four seasons. That's more than enough time to have
put together an ownership group and arrange for construction of a
stadium, or significant modifications of an existing facility such
as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The owners awarded a 32nd team to Los Angeles, conditionally.
The two competing groups have six months to come up with stadium
and financial plans suitable to the owners, or they'll pull the
plug on LA and award the expansion franchise to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When _ if _ the NFL returns to LA, Al Davis wants to be
compensated for it. He doesn't necessarily want to move his Raiders
back down the coast from Oakland, where he's hoping the city lives
up to promises it made when he returned in 1995. He just wants to
be paid for the ``Los Angeles opportunity'' he believes he owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stop them from anything,'' Davis said. ``I
just want to uphold the rights for the territory I have.''
</P>
<P>
   If the league doesn't settle with Davis it could be looking at
legal action that might further delay the return of the game to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The owners were more moved by noise of a different sort, piped
in artificial noise, acknowledging that technology has gone too far
when canned music and cheers drown out civil conversations on the
sideline. The Cardinals were among those that complained about it
during their second-round playoff game against the Vikings at the
Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The owners approved a rule that limits the number of speakers on
the field to four. They must be placed between the 20-yard-line and
the goal line, and they may not face toward the bench or the
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of the Milsteins, Edward and Howard, and
their business partner, Daniel Snyder. They are trying to buy the
Washington Redskins for a whopping $800 million, or about 150
percent of the expansion fee charged to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In classic NFL style, the owners tabled for 60 days action on
approval of the purchase of the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed what the owners want is to keep the team in the
hands of John Kent Cooke, son of Jack Kent Cooke, another longtime
old-school NFL crony who died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There also is some concern that the Milsteins would prove to be
flamboyant rogue owners, in the style of Davis or Jerry Jones of
the Cowboys. The old boys don't want their territory shaken up any
more.
</P>
<P>
   While the bow tie was smart in its time, maybe a kick in the
pants is what some of them need.

MVP RACE IS WIDE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The season's halfway point has arrived, so it's time for the
lockout-abbreviated, 25-game midseason awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes please: &QL; 
Most Valuable Player &QL; 
With  &UR; Michael Jordan out of the league, this is suddenly a race.
And there's no clear-cut favorite.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns could just win some games, point guard  &UR; Jason Kidd
might be a runaway choice for this right now. He has five
triple-doubles and has come within one rebound of three others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on your definition of Most Valuable Player,'' Suns
Coach
 &UR; Danny Ainge said. ``I know there's no player in the league more
valuable to his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the Suns are foundering. Still, Kidd will get some
votes if he continues on his current pace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers is leading the league
in scoring and has blossomed since moving from the point to
shooting guard. His team also might not be good enough to get him
the award.
</P>
<P>
   And Iverson is getting some heat for missing a practice without
being excused, the latest in a series of transgressions that has
marred his young career. Unless the 76ers come on stronger, it will
cost Iverson enough votes to exclude him from winning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Karl Malone of the Jazz will get a lot of votes if Utah
finishes with the best record, although he's not playing at quite
the same high level he did two years ago when he upset Jordan for
the award.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's  &UR; Alonzo Mourning figures to carry a lot of votes in the
East, and they're deserved. His club has the second-best record
right now, and he has been a force.
</P>
<P>
   But the midseason winner here is Lakers center  &UR; Shaquille
O'Neal, who is second in scoring (27.0 points a game), first in
field goal percentage (.575) and fourth in rebounding (11.2). He's
the league's most dominant player, and although his team has
underachieved, O'Neal has been the one constant in a tumultuous
year. His coach was fired, the club made a major trade and  &UR; Dennis
Rodman has been at the same time a godsend and disruption. It's a
reluctant vote, but it goes to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year &QL; 
It's a two-man race _ Miami's  &UR; Pat Riley in the Eastern Conference
and &UR; Jerry Sloan of Utah in the Western Conference. Riley has done a
fabulous job keeping a team that has been damaged by injuries to
two starters,  &UR; Voshon Leonard and  &UR; Jamal Mashburn, on track to
finish with the best record in the East.
</P>
<P>
   But our vote goes to Sloan, who never has gotten enough credit
for Utah's consistent success. Make no mistake, he'd much rather
win the Larry O'Brien Trophy that goes to the league's champion. He
might get both this year. &QL; 
Rookie of the Year &QL; 
Part of the problem with this lockout-shortened season is that many
of the voters for these awards won't even get to see all the
players under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly troublesome in voting for rookies. Boston's
 &UR; Paul
 &UR; Pierce has a checklist of teams he plans to embarrass for not
drafting him, and he's doing a pretty good job of it. He's
averaging 16.1 points a game, shooting 42.5 percent from
three-point range and is among the league's leaders in steals.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's  &UR; Vince Carter has evoked comparisons with  &UR; Dominique
Wilkins for his ``human highlight'' aerial maneuvers and leads all
rookies with 16.6 points a game average.
</P>
<P>
   But the best rookie we've seen, in person at least, is
Sacramento's
 &UR; Jason Williams, dubbed ``White Chocolate'' by his teammates. Sure,
Williams plays out of control at times, but he's fearless and a
blast to watch. And how many players can that be said about this
season? Plus, he has had an impact. Pierce and Carter may have
improved their clubs, but Williams has lifted his. &QL; 
Defensive Player of the Year &QL; 
Phoenix forward  &UR; Clifford Robinson should get consideration for
this award. He has guarded somebody at every position this season.
In fact, when someone suggested to Ainge that maybe he should let
Robinson do it all in one game just for kicks, Ainge said he
already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that's happened,'' he said. ``He guards a three,
four and five (small forward, power forward and center) in every
game. He's guarded (point guard)  &UR; Gary Payton. And we switch on
twos and threes (shooting guards and small forwards) defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he may not have them as a primary assignment, but he's
guarded them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson will be a long shot, though, because he doesn't have
big shot blocking or steal statistics. The likely winner is
Mourning, who is the interior anchor of the league's best defensive
team.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning gets the vote by a narrow margin. &QL; 
Sixth Man Award &QL; 
But we haven't forgotten Robinson. He has been the league's best
reserve, and based on the criteria, he qualifies despite moving
into the starting lineup. The award only requires that a player
come off the bench in the majority of his games. Robinson may not
be eligible when the season ends, but he has more bench games than
starts at the midpoint. Robinson won the award in 1991, and if
Ainge moves him back to the bench, he'll probably win it again _ if
the Suns make the playoffs. &QL; 
Most Improved Player &QL; 
This award typically goes to a player who hasn't necessarily
improved but has taken advantage of more playing time. This year,
the two leading candidates in our opinion don't fit that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's  &UR; Joe Smith was considered such a bust that the
former overall No. 1 draft pick could only get a one-year, $1.75
million salary cap exception as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been terrific for the Timberwolves. Question is, did
Smith improve or did his situation just get better? He's surrounded
by better players than he had been in either Golden State, where he
started his career only three years ago, or Philadelphia, which
didn't re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender, believe it or not, is Iverson. He was
already an explosive player, but since moving off the ball, he has
taken his game up a notch. He leads the league in scoring with an
average of 29.2 points a game and is third in steals.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing he hasn't improved is his practice attendance
habits.
</P>
<P>
   So this ballot goes to Smith. &QL; 
All-NBA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, Phoenix, point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, Philadelphia, shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, LA Lakers, center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kevin Garnett, Minnesota, small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, Utah, power forward. &QL;

FLYERS SEARCH FOR ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The winless streak has reached 12 games and counting for the
Philadelphia Flyers. It has swollen to 0-8-4 entering their big
showdown today against the Detroit Red Wings and because of it, the
Flyers have fallen all the way to the No. 6 spot in the Eastern
Conference where, egads, they'd have to open the playoffs on the
road at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening to Philly isn't shocking,'' Hurricanes Coach
 &UR; Paul
 &UR; Maurice said. ``It's all part of the tightrope that teams are
walking in the Eastern Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have already plunged to their demise. Or have they?
Carolina General Manager  &UR; Jim Rutherford isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they're going to win a game here pretty soon and
then rattle off seven to 10 in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers hope that's true. But even if they don't, Coach
 &UR; Roger
 &UR; Nielson's job is safe, according to General Manager  &UR; Bobby Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no thought to replacing Roger,'' Clarke said.
``We're not going to do that. A couple of months ago, this team was
25-1 under him and people were talking about him as Coach of the
Year. So now he's going to get fired?''
</P>
<P>
   Something's got to happen, though. But please, not a last-minute
flurry of trades. Clarke's made enough moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have a good club,'' captain  &UR; Eric Lindros said.
``It's just that the people in the dressing room aren't doing the
job on the ice . . . I don't know why it's this way. We're
snake-bitten at times. The snowball keeps getting larger. We've
gotta hope for some warm weather around here to melt it down.'' &QL; 
JR wants to stay &QL; 
Responding to an ESPN report that he won't be back in a Coyotes'
uniform after this season,  &UR; Jeremy &UR; Roenick said he doesn't want to
go anywhere and he wants his fans to know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real ticked when I heard the rumor. I'm very
disappointed,'' he said. ``I'm extremely happy to be playing in
Phoenix. I love the team I play for. I love the organization. And I
really enjoy playing for the fans in Phoenix. I'm thoroughly happy
in the position I'm in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the house I've always wanted (in Paradise Valley). My
family's happy and secure there. And I've just made a couple of
purchases in the Arizona area, which should prove to everybody that
I want to stick around here for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that. The rumor was based more on the assumption
that the Coyotes may try to further trim their payroll this summer
and that Roenick, who has two years remaining on a contract that
pays him an average of $4 million a season, could be the biggest
cost-cutting casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if that's the case, that's the owner's decision, the
owner's and management's decision,'' Roenick said. ``If they want
to move me somewhere else because of my salary, that's their right.
But my points are up there with the same guys making the same
amount of money that I make. It's not that I'm not worthy of where
I am, financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Note to Owner  &UR; Richard Burke and GM  &UR; Bobby Smith: You might be
able to afford more by dealing away Roenick and his salary, but you
can't afford trading your most popular player. Not now, anyway. &QL; 
Weight problem &QL; 
A big reason why the Edmonton Oilers have fallen in the tank lately
is because their best player, center  &UR; Doug Weight, has been
swimming around with the Tidy Bowl Man. He's flushed his game down
the toilet since returning from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He has just three goals in 30 games, partly, he said, because
he's been worrying too much about the knee since he's returned to
the lineup. General Manager  &UR; Glen Sather has reminded him to forget
it and move on _ now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I have to play better, you're damn right I do,'' Weight
said. ``If that's what Glen's saying, that's what I say, too. This
is the worst year of my career and now I've got to try and salvage
and play as hard as I can. I've been hurt, sure, but we're losing
and playing like crap. This sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but I still wouldn't want to meet the Oilers in
the first round of the playoffs. Assuming they get there, of
course. &QL; 
Murphy's law
</P>
<P>
   Veteran forward  &UR; Joe Murphy of the San Jose Sharks created quite
a stir the other day while discussing the free-agent pool available
this summer. In doing so, he ragged on fellow veteran  &UR; Mark Recchi,
whom many claim will be the prized catch among the unrestricted
players on July 1 if he doesn't re-sign with the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put my game up against his game any time, any situation,
any day,'' Murphy told the ``San Jose Mercury News.'' ``Everybody
back East where the so-called Hot Stove hockey experts are, are
sleeping by the time our games start. By the time they get the
score, it's second-day news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Recchi this, Mark Rechi that. Everybody's chirping that,
and I'm tired of hearing it. He's definitely got better (career)
numbers than I do, but that goes back to him playing with ( &UR; Mario)
 &UR; Lemieux and Eric Lindros and now he's playing with Lindros
again.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Murphy has 16 goals and 16 assists in 62 games.
Recchi has 14 goals and 35 assists in 65 games. &QL; 
They said it
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's  &UR; Jan Vopat, who has been battling a mysterious skin
irritation that has been covering his lower legs for the past
several days, on returning to the Predators' lineup after missing
four games: ``I'll be wearing new underwear, new shin pads, and
I'll put Vaseline on before I put the uniform on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa goalie  &UR; Ron Tugnutt, reminded that former teammate,  &UR; Guy
Hebert of the Mighty Ducks, said he once looked like an accountant,
not a professional hockey player: ``I was looking back at the team
picture of that first year (in 1993) and it seems to me Guy has
some hair since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Coach  &UR; Bob Hartley on Detroit  &UR; Kirk Maltby's four-game
suspension for a slash last Sunday that broke  &UR; Valeri
 &UR; Kamensky's forearm, sidelining him for the season: ``He ain't going
to get eight to 12 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's  &UR; Alexandre Daigle, who was Philadelphia's union
representative after the Flyers picked his name out of a hat
because no one wanted the job: ``I think my name was the only name
in the hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly-acquired Coyotes forward  &UR; Brian Noonan, who has played for
former NHL Coach  &UR; Mike Keenan in four different cities, asked if he
thinks Keenan will resurface as an NHL coach again: ``Oh, I'm sure
someone will give him another chance. He deserves it. He's a
winner. I hope he gets another job. It means I might have another
place to play if I need one.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ Final Four?
</P>
<P>
   Final Four!
</P>
<P>
   So it finally came to pass for the University of Connecticut
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of what ifs, might have beens and if onlys at
places ranging from Miami to Oakland, from the Meadowlands to
Greensboro, the Huskies boldy will go where no men's basketball
team in school history had gone before: to the NCAA Final Four next
Saturday night in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   All of that became official at America West Arena Saturday as
the Huskies dug deep into their souls as they fought off surge
after surge from a gritty Gonzaga team, pulling out a 67-62 victory
in the NCAA West Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if we worked any harder for a victory,'' said
Huskies coach Jim Calhoun, who now can shed the unwanted tag of
being The Best Coach Never to Reach The Final Four. ``In the last
10 years, we have had teams that have made runs (to the Final
Four). I love them all. This is for them as much as it is for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the top-seeded Huskies, who carry a 32-2 record
into their Final Four semifinal, earned this victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, which came into the tournament as the 10th seed in the
West and quickly took on the Cinderella role capturing the hearts
of fans from salmon fishermen in Seattle to barbers in Scituate,
gave the Huskies all they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That it wasn't enough came down to basically one or two plays in
the final seconds of a 40-minute game that had all the intensity
and tension that a regional championship brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at the 30-second point when it (the game) changed,''
said Gonzaga forward Casey Calvary, whose last-second tip-in shot
against Florida gave the Bulldogs their first spot in a a Regional
final. ``I really felt confident until the six-second point. That
was the first time I felt we were going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And until that point, no one at UConn, which came into the game
as a double-digit favorite, could predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Calhoun, who had agonzied through Regional final
losses to Duke in the Meadowlands, UCLA in Oakland, and North
Carolina in Greensboro, knew that anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
   It was that way through a first half in which Gonzaga had a
32-31 lead. It was that way through the tense final minutes as the
Huskies tried desperately to open a lead.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen until the final seconds because Gonzaga didn't
allow it to.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:28 remaining, the Huskies looked as if they finally might
open a gap when Ricky Moore completed a 3-point play to give them a
51-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in a heartbeat, Gonzaga's 5-foot-8-inch senior guard Quentin
Hall wiped that out with a 20-foot 3-point shot and a drive and a
foul shot, which tied it at 53 with 6:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies realized they were in a last-possession type of
game. With 1:02 left, center Jake Voskuhl took a feed from Richard
Hamilton (21 points, Regional MVP) and put in a basket to give
UConn a 63-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun thought the trend was finally going his way. It was, but
not before a final few seconds of agony and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Again it was Hall, who with the shot clock running down threw up
an offbalance prayer from 20 feet above the key with 36.6 seconds
left to make it 63-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that kid threw in the three, I said to myself, `Oh, no,'
'' said Calhoun, no doubt flashing back to Duke's Christian
Laettner's shot that cost UConn a Final Four slot in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Gonzaga's strategy was clear. Foul quickly,
hope UConn missed from the foul line and come up with a buzzer
beater.
</P>
<P>
   After the timeout, the Huskies inbounded the ball to guard
Khalid El-Amin, who was having a horrible offensive day (0 for 12
from the field).
</P>
<P>
   But El-Amin, who may be UConn's toughest clutch player, made
both foul shots. Now the situation was desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga's Matt Santangelo, the self-proclaimed leader of the
team, made one last attempt to get the Bulldogs back within one
possession, but his shot was short. When the Huskies grabbed the
ball, were fouled, and made the two foul shots, Gonzaga's 28-7
dream season was over.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked off, Kevin Freeman tossed the ball
high in the air, Calhoun, crouching on the sidelines, slowly stood
up, received a bear hug from longtime assistant and former player
Dave Leito, and looked at the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, someone asked him about his quest and how tough it
had been and what it would be like if UConn finally did reach the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do make it, I think I can skip Purgatory,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after being drenched by his team in a football-like
water cooler dousing, Calhoun looked up with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is Purgatory,'' he said, looking around America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first stop on his way to UConn's first Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a victory, Calhoun was being tested.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting are the Buckeyes and Jim O'Brien, a former Big East
competitor but also a close enough friend that the men exchanged
good luck greetings before this weekend's games.
</P>
<P>
   That Calhoun had an 18-game winning streak when O'Brien was at
BC and an overall record of 20-3 against him doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in St. Petersburg, it will be another test of faith
against another story that is even more feel-good than Calhoun's.

FROM DREAD TO RESIGNATION  
 PLAYERS REACT DIFFERENTLY TO TRADE DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   D-Day falls in 48 hours. The NHL is bracing itself. Especially
the players. Some are handling it better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me about the trading deadline, please,'' begged one
Coyotes player the other day. ``I'm nervous enough as it is. I
think I'm going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a deep breath and try to relax. It's not that bad. Trades
happen. They're part of the business. Every professional athlete
has to live with it, whether they like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, so is having to go to the dentist for root canal
surgery,'' our same Coyotes player said, still quivering in his
skates. ``I don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but just so the rest of you know: The league's moratorium on
wheeling and dealing will officially end at 1 p.m. Tuesday, Phoenix
time. The Coyotes? They finished shopping two days early, acquiring
on Saturday the second-line center they long have been searching
for by picking up Robert Reichel, the New York Islanders' leading
scorer, in exchange for Brad Isbister and a swap of some draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a lot of calls lately, but after getting this deal
done, I'd say it's pretty unlikely we'll do anything else between
now and Tuesday,'' Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in his first season on the job, Smith said he had
been so busy chatting with other general managers in the days
leading up to the trading deadline that he had become hoarse _ so
hoarse he couldn't physically inform defenseman Dave Manson he had
just been traded to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was the most active of any Deadline Day in NHL
history. Go ahead, guess. How many trades do you think general
managers pulled off a year ago on the final day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say eight,'' Montreal Canadiens center Trent McCleary
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Try 19. A record 38 players changed teams due to those
last-minute moves, which tied the most deals on Deadline Day ever.
Four years ago, the NHL also watched 19 trades go down. That
season, it involved 32 players.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of telling how many trades will be made Tuesday.
Because some of the major stars who were rumored to be heading
elsewhere already have been shipped to different teams _ Toronto
sent Felix Potvin to the Islanders, Vancouver shipped Pavel Bure to
Florida, Calgary moved Theo Fleury to Colorado, and Montreal dealt
Mark Recchi to Philadelphia _ some think the numbers will be low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be wrong, but I just don't think there's going to be a
flurry of activity this year,'' said Jim Devellano, a senior vice
president of the Detroit Red Wings. ``A lot of the big moves have
already happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Another huge one took place Saturday, when Edmonton made an
eight-player deal with Chicago that included the Oilers' Boris
Mironov and the Blackhawks' Chad Kilger. Then the Oilers got
Islanders goalie Tommy Salo for Mats Lindgren.
</P>
<P>
   Mironov, whose name had circulated in rumors for weeks, was
fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's coming,'' he said last week. ``There's no way not
to hear the rumors or read about them in the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone, of course. Brad Bombardir of the Islanders, who
was speculated to be part of the Mironov trade just a few days ago,
was keeping his eyes and ears open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think about it for sure,'' he said. ``Any player who
doesn't this time of year is nuts. But thinking and worrying are
two different things. I'm thinking but not worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, 85 players had been involved in trades
this season. A handful of players, such as Roman Vopat, Harry York,
Eric LaCroix and rookie Mike Maneluk, have actually been traded at
least twice.
</P>
<P>
   The deals picked up steam as March arrived with eight separate
deals in the first 15 days of the month. But more certainly await.
Maybe even more than the 19 that went down last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who will host the Los Angeles Kings at 6 p.m.
today, had been eyeing a handful of experienced centers to play
between wingers Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet. They included Vincent
Damphousse of Montreal, Adam Oates of Washington and both Trevor
Linden and Bryan Smolinki of the Islanders, but they lucked out
while New York was gutting itself Saturday and plucked the Isles'
next-best player behind Ziggy Palffy _ the 27-year-old Reichel.
</P>
<P>
   Who's next? There's no way to be sure, of course. Anything can
and usually does happen on D-Day. Ask Detroit tough guy Joey Kocur,
who's been traded a few times on the last day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always worried, absolutely,'' he said. ``You not only
trade teams, you trade lives. Everything you've created here in
Detroit or wherever you're from is gone. Chances are, you'll never
be back. You gotta buy a new house in the next city. You gotta sell
this one. All your acquaintances, friends and connections are all
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Smith, would like to see the deadline pushed up,
perhaps moved to February, to create a more level playing field.
The general feeling around the league is that the high-priced stars
usually only go to the high-priced teams. Clubs out of the playoff
race are picked over like a leftover turkey. Those teams and
``bubble teams'' like them would have an extra month to get back
into the race if they were allowed to add players and/or protect
more of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the deadline moved up a month,'' Edmonton General
Manager Glen Sather said. ``As it is, teams with money just rent
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Relax. The end is almost in sight. Just another 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 24th, let's have a party so we can put all the rumors
behind us,'' quipped Islanders Coach Bill Stewart. ``But it's a
fact of life, a big day for everyone.'' &QL;

CRASHES TAKE JOY FROM RECORD RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mat Mladin was happy. And mad.
</P>
<P>
   Happy because of a successful bid to capture the pole position
on Saturday in the American Motorcyclist Association Cruise America
Arizona Superbike Challenge at Phoenix International Raceway, where
Mladin uncorked a blistering record qualifying lap of 90.609 mph
over the 11-turn, 1.51-mile road course.
</P>
<P>
   But also mad, because of three vicious crashes that forced three
injured riders to be airlifted to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical
Center for treatment of various injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the injuries appeared life threatening, the
constant summoning of helicopters turned PIR into what seemed like
a gruesome scene from an episode of ``MASH.''
</P>
<P>
   Awful, just awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``(PIR) is a nice little Mickey Mouse track,'' Mladin said. ``I
don't have anything against it. It's just that there's some areas
that aren't too safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple those concerns with a weather pattern that produced
unseasonably warm temperatures nearing 90 degrees, and riders were
hit with a double dose of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track was hot and slippery,'' said Ducati's Ben Bostrom,
who will start third on today's grid behind Suzuki's Mladin and
Ducati's Anthony Gobert.
</P>
<P>
   Ty David Piz (250 Grand Prix) and Takahito Mori (Formula Xtreme)
both were airlifted after crashing into an unprotected concrete
wall. Piz suffered a closed head injury and a possible fractured
right arm, and Mori also had a head injury and suffered abrasions
on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Both were listed in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Lopez crashed while leading the 25-lap Formula Xtreme
race, and although one eyewitness said it appeared as if the rider
hit a wall near Turn 5, another onlooker said Lopez struck the
pavement before barrel-rolling to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Lopez still needed to be transported via helicopter
with a head injury and a fractured left finger.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the 25-lap 750 SuperSport race concluded three laps early
following a spectacular crash involving rider Joseph Castillo of
Mesa. Although Castillo appeared to escape injury after crashing
into the hay bales near Turn 11, a fire erupted and it took course
workers several minutes to extinguish the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Canadian superbike champion Michael Taylor also had
to be airlifted following a horrific crash into the wall in Turn
11, which is Turn 4 on the 1-mile oval. Taylor, who was injured
during Formula Xtreme practice, suffered a concussion, a fractured
pelvis and a fractured right thumb. He underwent surgery Saturday
and remains in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is awful,'' superbike rider Jamie Hacking said.
``There are red flags every five minutes. It's really dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a grip on these dangerous tracks and we
need to eliminate some of them or they're going to eliminate us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMA spokesman Bill Nordquist said the problem will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Track Review Advisory Committee and I'm sure at the
next meeting this will be discussed,'' Nordquist said. ``I heard
people saying that in 10 years of covering this series, they've
never seen a day like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mladin hopes they never sees another one. &QL;

WARD'S HUBBY WILL PAY FOR MISSING 68 
</HEADLINE>
 GLF-LPGA-PING-WARD  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Half of the dream weekend went awry, but former
Arizona State star Wendy Ward did her part to keep the second half
alive Saturday at the Standard Register PING at Moon Valley Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day at 3 under, Ward was determined to take the
smooth 4-under 68 she shot to move within 4 strokes of leader
Karrie Webb even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, she wanted to punish her husband of five-plus
months, Nate Hair, for abandoning her during Saturday's round.
</P>
<P>
   Hair, a native of Spokane, Wash., was at America West Arena on a
kitchen pass, watching hometown Gonzaga's Cinderella story go up in
smoke against Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at the UConn-Iowa game Thursday night and about
halfway through it he looked at me and said, ``Well, is there
possibly any chance I could be excused on Saturday?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance and he could go.
But I kinda wanted to make him pay for it by going a couple of
shots lower today. But I own him now. It's probably good for a
couple of laundries, and I'll make sure I have a lot when I come
home from Sacramento in two weeks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, of course, is best known here for leading Arizona State to
three consecutive women's NCAA golf titles from 1993-95 and for
capping her senior season in 1995 by playing the final round with
final-day leaders Beth Daniel and Laura Davies en route to a
third-place finish in the Standard Register PING.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, she has been remembered for missing the cut in
the first three tournaments she played this season, before
surviving last week at Tucson and finishing in a tie for 39th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a full month off after the JCPenney Classic (in early
December) and I really needed it,'' said Ward, who has won once in
each of her last two seasons on the tour. ``I had a fun, exciting
year last year with a lot of events going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my best year financially ($342,495), the most traveling
I have ever done and I got married in September and bought a house.
It really was a full year and I needed the break, but it got me off
to a slow start. I also wasn't feeling well in January and I think
that slowed me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly was healthy enough Saturday, at one point going to
8 under during a six-birdie, two-bogey outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the second week of a four-week stretch for me _ that's
long for me _ but I'm excited to go out there because I'm hitting
the ball well. It was a little hard at the beginning of the year. I
was humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't shot a round under par until Tucson last week. It
wasn't that I was uncomfortable shooting under par, I just wasn't
doing it. I wasn't birdieing anything. Every day this week I've
been capable of shooting 64 or 65, but I haven't gotten any putts
to drop. It's a matter of getting a few breaks around the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is one thing she has never worried about at Moon Valley.
She backed up her third-place finish as an amateur with a Top 15
finish here last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it always hasn't been that way. When she joined the tour in
1996,
especially coming off her 1995 performance here, she was viewed as
yet another incoming ``wunderkind.'' Instead, she has paid some
dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't pressure, but I wasn't ready to jump in and be
No 1 at this level,'' she said. ``It usually doesn't happen that
way. The Karrie Webbs and Se Ri Paks _ it doesn't seem they're few
and far between, but they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back on my career at each level, it has taken me a
couple years to feel comfortable. It was that way from high school
to college and college to here. It's OK. Some of us pay their dues
a little longer than others. Even Karrie played the European tour,
so she paid her dues, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She also believes she's a better player now than the kid who
finished third here as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much better,'' Ward said. ``I was very tough mentally that
year, but my overall game has really improved. It's why I'm
excited. I'm hitting my drives 10 yards farther. When I played with
Laura in 1995, I was keeping up with her 3 irons with my driver.
Now I can probably keep up with her 2 irons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can perform somewhat mediocre in college and still play
strong; shoot 71 or 72 and win a tournament. There's so much less
room for error out here. It's a matter of consistency and feeding
off lower scores.'' &QL;

LPGA PONDERS OPTIONS FOR 2000 TOURNEY SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Three golf courses are under consideration to host
next year's Standard Register PING, including one site that
temporarily could unite the LPGA and PGA tours.
</P>
<P>
   The TPC of Scottsdale, the venue for the Phoenix Open, is one of
those possibilities to pick up the void when the LPGA is
temporarily displaced from Moon Valley Country Club to accommodate
major reconstruction of the course's greens.
</P>
<P>
   The other layouts that Standard Register board of governors are
considering are Phoenix Country Club, probably the front-runner at
this point, and the Karsten Course at Arizona State, which is named
after Karsten Solheim, the founder of PING.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Grove, director of golf at the TPC of Scottsdale, said:
``We've had some contact about the possibility (of moving the
tournament to the TPC).''
</P>
<P>
   But the contact has not come from the LPGA Tour, said its new
commissioner, Ty Votaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not be adverse to the idea,'' Votaw said. ``It's good
to have choices, whether it's two or three or whatever many. It
helps your decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Stu Smith, chief executive officer of the Samaritan Foundation,
said it will take about three to four weeks to decide which course
gets the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reach a decision by May 1 or earlier,'' Smith
said. ``We currently are pursuing discussions with at least three
locations, and we expect the possibility of two more as backups.
One thing I'd like to emphasize is that we are not bartering one
course against the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that three criteria are being weighed to determine
the right fit:
</P>
<P>
   The temporary venue must be of championship quality and
attractive to the pros. The LPGA will be solicited for input to
determine the course's worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the course must not be in an extreme north,
south, east or west corner of the Valley. An accessible path to the
tournament must already be in place.
</P>
<P>
   The financial ramifications must continue to benefit the
Samaritan Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raise between $350,000 and $800,000 a year for cancer care
through the Samaritan Hospitals,'' Smith noted. ``We have to be
very cautious about jeopardizing our bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Country Club, the TPC of Scottsdale and Karsten all have
pluses and minuses, although the tournament committee favors the
tradition of PCC, which once hosted the Phoenix Open before it
moved to the TPC in 1987. The big hang-up with PCC, however, is
that not all of its members are willing to give up the course, even
though such influential members as Bob Goldwater, ``the Father of
the Phoenix Open,'' have given such a move their blessing. PCC also
has a small driving range and lacks parking facilities, although
several are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The TPC might be a bit of a reach because of lost revenue
considerations to the PGA Tour, and the possibility that a
comparison would be made between men's and women's golf if the
crowds were significantly less than what the Phoenix Open draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing about 180 to 190 rounds a day this week, and
that's at $172 a player,'' said Grove, meaning the TPC would have
to give up or be compensated for $200,000 to $250,000 in lost green
fees should the LPGA and PGA tours work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The big plus for the TPC, however, is that no other candidate
has the facilities or the championship quality that the TPC boasts.
Several of the LPGA players have said they endorse the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting to see how we'd do at the TPC,'' said
Cindy Flom (formerly Rarick). ``Obviously, the atmosphere (at Moon
Valley) is great, but it would be nice to have more people. I'm
rooting for the TPC.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karsten Course, however, has the Solheim family name on it
already, a link that can't be overlooked considering the financial
commitment to the tournament from PING. Most of Karsten's
facilities also would work, as would the accessibility. The
negative is that the course is not of the same championship caliber
as the two alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   John Solheim, president of PING, said his family's preference is
the Karsten Course, ``although there is a lot of history at
Phoenix, and both Phoenix and the TPC are great courses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the family tie to Karsten is already there, plus it offers
accessibility, plenty of parking and a central location,'' Solheim
added. ``And I think it would be really nice to have it there
because the Lady Sun Devils have been national champs so many
times, and a lot of those (former ASU players) are now out here on
the tour.'' &QL;

ALBERS FASHIONS COMEBACK WITH BIRDIES ON ALL PAR 5S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN AND TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   PHOENIX - If Australian &UR; Karrie Webb had not distanced herself 2
strokes ahead of second-place &UR; Lorie Kane going into today's final
round of the Standard Register PING, &UR; Kristi Albers would have been
the talk of Saturday's third round.
</P>
<P>
   Albers, a 13-year LPGA Tour veteran from El Paso via the
University of New Mexico, started the day at par and finished it 6
under. She had seven birdies and a bogey en route to the day's best
round of 66. She started the day so far back of the leaders that
she teed off with the morning's fourth group, moved into fifth
place by herself and is 5 shots behind Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the par 5s really well, and I made some putts,''
Albers said. ``The last two days I got myself into trouble. I was
in trouble only once today, and I got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to going lights out was the fact that she birdied all
four of the par 5s during the round, staggering only when she
missed a five-foot par putt on the par-3 second hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit good drives on all the par 5s and was able to reach them
in 2,'' she said. ``You can make some putts on these greens.
Obviously, the scores are lower. The wind was tough on a few holes
_ Numbers 15 and 16 were right into the wind. I used two clubs more
on Number 18 than I did Friday.'' &QL; 
Forget the ace &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Annika Sorenstam, the two-time player of the year who is coming
back from a one-month layoff, was upset following her 71.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a career-first hole in one at the second hole, where
she holed out an 8-iron from 140 yards, did little to soothe
Sorenstam's mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a little time, will you,'' said Sorenstam's husband,
 &UR; David
 &UR; Esch, who was consoling his wife after she bogeyed the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Swede had it to 5 under after the hole in one, but
immediately bogeyed the third hole. She got back to 5 under twice
on the back side before closing out with the bogey that came via a
greenside bunker.
</P>
<P>
   After Sorenstam recovered from the disappointment, she did have
a comment on the ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really psyched after I made it,'' she said, her mood not
reflecting her statement. &QL; 
No saving grace &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grace Park, the super sophomore at Arizona State, is 1 over
after three rounds. But her 72 on Saturday left her in anything but
a good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't putt,'' Park said, shaking her head in disgust. ``I
missed (birdie putts) of four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10
feet . . . and I'm not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably had 15 (birdie putts), and I made one. That's
terrible, because I'm hitting it so good (off the tee).''
</P>
<P>
   Park always has been plagued by her putting, but she had putted
well since going cross-handed last fall under the tutelage of her
instructor, Kierland's &UR; Mike LaBauve. The key to her U.S. Amateur
victory last year, has always been her incredible length.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hit three drives in a row _ at Nos. 6, 7 and 8 _ that were
all over 300 yards,'' LaBauve reported. ``The putting will come
back around, because Grace is a great player.'' &QL; 
For once, `Hi, Dad!' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tired of one athlete after another turning to the television
cameras to say, ``Hi, Mom!''? What about Dad? He's always been the
forgotten party until &UR; Lorie Kane came along. Kane is 2 shots behind
leader Webb and will be grouped with her today as she tries for her
first LPGA victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited to be in the final group,'' said Kane, from
Canada's Prince Edward Island. ``And with the satellite we bought
my dad for Christmas, he'll be able to watch me. It's fun. And
because we're on regular television, the people at home will get an
opportunity to see me. That keeps you sharp, and I'm looking
forward to it.'' &QL;

JOHNSON COULDN'T ESCAPE LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the very end,  &UR; Tim Johnson was not about to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to get rid of me, they are going to have to fire
me,'' Johnson told a visitor in his office days before he was fired
by Toronto General Manager  &UR; Gord Ash last week.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of scrutiny, the Blue Jays could have no more
and did, indeed, fire Johnson, who guided Toronto to a surprising
88 victories in his only season as a major league manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the chaos surrounding Johnson's lies about being a
Vietnam veteran and having turned down a basketball scholarship to
UCLA proved too much of a distraction for the club to move forward,
the Blue Jays front office believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was clear is that he needed some rest,'' said assistant
GM
 &UR; Dave Stewart, who stayed with Johnson until 2 a.m. the night he was
fired. ``I don't think the Tim Johnson we saw this spring was ever
the real Tim Johnson. There was too much going on. He could never
get a break from the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose brother  &UR; Sandy Johnson is the Diamondbacks
assistant general manager, was basically buried under an avalanche
of ill will and cheap shots from most every direction. Former Blue
Jays players such as  &UR; Ed Sprague wouldn't let the situation die.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most every question asked of anyone in the
organization, either from a reporter or an opposing player, had a
mention of Johnson's lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the cards we had before us, the best thing was to fold
up the hand and try again,'' Toronto catcher  &UR; Darrin Fletcher said.
``I was willing to give him a second chance, but with all that
stuff hanging over his head, would he have survived the scrutiny
the first time we lost two in a row? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson joins  &UR; Phil Cavaretta as the only managers ever
fired during spring training. Cavaretta was fired on March 29,
1954, after his Chicago Cubs had a 5-15 spring record and he
indicated to the club's owner that it would probably be a very long
season on Chicago's north side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an issue that preoccupied our time, all this was
wearing on Tim and affecting his style of leadership,'' said Ash,
who hired
 &UR; Jim Fregosi to replace Johnson. ``We wanted a fresh guy; I don't
think we made a mistake. Now our mandate has changed. We needed
someone with experience.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Which pitcher has appeared in more games than anyone else during
the 1990s? &QL; 
Carrasco update &QL; 
Right-handed reliever  &UR; Hector Carrasco, who came within days of
being on the Diamondbacks opening day roster last season, could be
in serious medical danger.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco, who was thought of as Arizona's first closer during
spring training, lost circulation in his right (pitching) arm last
week after a Minnesota Twins spring training game and was taken via
helicopter from Fort Myers, Fla., to a Tampa hospital for extensive
testing after his right arm became numb.
</P>
<P>
   Blood thinning medication managed to subside blood clots found
in his armpit and elbow and an emergency surgery was halted before
it began. However, Carrasco's condition remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' said Carrasco, who may be forced to miss the
entire season. ``The doctors (in Fort Myers) didn't know what was
wrong and I had to see another doctor. This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors discovered a 40 percent narrowing of the arteries in
Carrasco's right shoulder. Twins general manager  &UR; Terry Ryan, who
acquired Carrasco from waivers after the Diamondbacks released him
last spring, was beside himself over the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the prime of his career and was throwing the ball
well,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to enjoy being in this organization.'' &QL; 
Brown out &QL; 
If this event doesn't cement the Dodgers' leaving Vero Beach,
nothing will. While taking a shower at the club's complex in
Florida last weekend, star pitcher  &UR; Kevin Brown was scalded after a
teammate flushed a nearby toilet, causing the water in the shower
to jump in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who recently signed baseball's richest contract ever at
$105 million, became so livid that he grabbed a baseball bat and
smashed the culprit _ the toilet, not the unknown player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's better to get that out,'' Dodgers Manager
 &UR; Davey
 &UR; Johnson said. ``No one was hurt by it. You can repair a toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown did suffer a bruised head after he shoved the door to the
toilet and it rebounded hard right back into his face. &QL; 
Drumming up support &QL; 
The Minnesota Twins drew 7,744 paying customers for their
Grapefruit League game against the Yankees last Wednesday. The
Twins had five smaller crowds and four others within 300 of that
figure in the Metrodome last season.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at least the Twins know their clientele.
Minnesota announced its promotional schedule for the season and
there were some eye-catchers on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins will start out with Kids Opening Day on April 11, when
children will be allowed to take over ballpark duties. The game on
June 5 between the Twins and Houston will feature fishing rods to
the first 5,000 fans under the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's on to Independence Day, when fans will be
allowed to bring their dogs to the Metrodome for the Twins-Tigers
game. The July 24 game will feature the Twins and Seattle wearing
futuristic uniforms for Turn Ahead the Clock Night. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Ridiculed as he may be at times, Cleveland left-handed reliever
 &UR; Paul &UR; Assenmacher holds the distinction with 589 games pitched
during this decade. Next on the list is teammate  &UR; Mike Jackson, who
has worked in 572 games in the 1990s. Assenmacher has 829 career
big-league appearances, 19th on the all-time list. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; There once was another rookie who took the majors by
 &UR; storm: For the sake of baseball (and the Cubs), let's hope  &UR; Kerry
Wood is not the next  &UR; Mark Fidrych, whose career flamed out because
of shoulder problems shortly after he became the rage of baseball
during his rookie season in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Appeasing the right guy: They say it had nothing to do with  &UR; Mo
Vaughn, but the Anaheim Angels decided last week to move in the
fences in center and left-center field by nine feet this season.
Just by coincidence, that's where most of Vaughn's home runs tend
to leave the yard.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Bill Singer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Messing with the wrong dude: Cleveland pitcher  &UR; Bartolo
 &UR; Colon declined a generous four-year offer worth $9 million from the
Indians. GM  &UR; John Hart, who had to be disturbed by the move, turned
around and renewed the young All-Star's contract for just $21,000
above the major league minimum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That's nice, but why not pay them their due: San Diego
ownership recently picked up the 2000 option seasons for GM  &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Towers and Manager  &UR; Bruce Bochy, two high-quality individuals who
remain embarrassingly close to the bottom of their respective pay
scales. &QL; EXTRA BASES &QL; Florida starter  &UR; Alex
 &UR; Fernandez, who will certainly be the subject of trade talks later
this season if he proves he is healthy, designated Atlanta,
Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Texas and the Cubs as
the only clubs he could be traded to this season. Fernandez has a
limited no-trade clause that allows him to pick where he could go.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his negotiations during the winter, Kansas City
closer  &UR; Jeff Montgomery managed to add a clause in his contract
that calls for his base salary to jump from $2.5 million to $4
million if he is traded.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first day pitcher  &UR; Orel Hershiser can entertain
offers from other clubs. Hershiser is in Cleveland's camp with a
chance to leave for any club that offers a major league job to his
liking. He also has an option to remain with the Indians. Clubs
that probably are interested include the Phillies, Tigers, Devil
Rays, Cubs, Red Sox and Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Before they decided to rename a stretch of a Manhattan highway
after  &UR; Joe DiMaggio, a New York state assemblyman actually wanted
to rename Yankee Stadium after DiMaggio. If they didn't do it for
 &UR; Babe Ruth,  &UR; Lou Gehrig or  &UR; Mickey Mantle, they rightfully couldn't
do it for DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles sent 15 players to its minor league camp for
reassignment. Among the players sent were  &UR; Pete Rose Jr. and  &UR; Gavin
 &UR; Osteen, the son of former Dodger pitcher  &UR; Claude Osteen.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals, who are forced into being creative
because of limited revenue, recently had a 37-year-old Canadian
softball pitcher in camp.  &UR; Mike Piechnik apparently throws a nasty
slider and screwball. There was one problem, though, he balks every
time he pitches. &QL; THE RUMOR MILL &QL; With
 &UR; Carlos Baerga booted out of St. Louis' camp for being overweight
and slowing, talks of the Cardinals looking to Milwaukee for second
baseman  &UR; Fernando Vina may start to heat up once again. The two
discussed a trade involving Vina during the winter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after fleecing the Dodgers in a trade,
Cincinnati might be willing to consider a trade for left-handed
pitcher  &UR; Dennys Reyes. The Yankees and Tampa Bay have inquired
about the  &UR; Fernando Valenzuela look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Philadelphia first baseman  &UR; Rico Brogna and
Phillies management will not be able to make their relationship
work, at least not in the long run. Brogna was looking for a
long-term contract. The Phillies, who have first baseman  &UR; Pat
Burrell on the way, are not inclined to make that kind of offer.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado reliever  &UR; Curtis Leskanic seems to be the leading
candidate to become the closer for the Rockies.  &UR; Jerry Dipoto, last
season's closer, has a 7.20 ERA while Leskanic did not allow a run
in his first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Basically run out of town in San Francisco and Anaheim for his
``laissez-faire'' attitude,  &UR; William VanLandingham is emerging as a
serious candidate to make Milwaukee's starting rotation. In his
first three spring outings, he allowed one run on three hits and
one walk. &QL; Includes information from other media sources. Pedro

<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Here's the usual Jim O'Brien Final Four modus
operandi: arrive at the site, hang out in his room, go to as few
meetings as possible, attend no official social functions, spend no
time schmoozing in the hotel lobby, and get out of town as soon as
possible. There usually aren't six people who will even recall he's
been there.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   This time Obie's presence will be noted by several hundred media
members, the entire state of Ohio, and millions of American sports
fans. He will be seen at major press conferences and he will be
seen on the bench, guiding his Ohio State Buckeyes against
Connecticut in a Final Four semifinal affair next Saturday. That's
because those same Buckeyes led wire to harrowing wire, defeating
St. John's, 77-74, to win the South Regional championship before
24,248 fans at Thompson-Boling Arena Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Up by 13 (61-48) with 9:05 left, up by 9 (73-64) with 2:47
remaining and up by 6 (75-69) with 44.4 seconds to go, Ohio State
needed a missed free throw by St. John's Chudney Gray, one made
foul shot by tourney Most Outstanding Player Scoonie Penn, and a
welcome turnover by St. John's point guard Erick Barkley to secure
the school's first visit to the Final Four since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Brien, who left Boston College with a bowling ball-knot in
his stomach less than two years ago, this represents an almost
incomprehensible vindication of his coaching expertise and personal
integrity. For this Ohio State team was 8-22 (1-15) in the Big Ten
a year ago. This Ohio State team suffered through a 17-game losing
streak. And now this Ohio State team is marching off to the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just really hard to put into words the feeling shared by
all of us right now because it's hard to imagine that we've put
ourselves in this position,'' said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State was in complete control for 38 or so minutes, seizing
early leads of 9-2 _ this on a 4-point play by the irrepressible
Penn _ and 19-11. And just when Mike Jarvis's Red Storm seemed to
be straightened out in the late stages of the first half, Ohio
State's mercurial slasher supreme Michael Redd (20 points) stepped
a bit out of character by nailing three 3-pointers over a Red Storm
zone in the final 2:12 of the half, the last of which, with 2.8
seconds left, sent Ohio State into the locker room holding a 41-33
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expected superb play of Penn and Redd (``If
they're not the best backcourt in the country, they're one of
them,'' said O'Brien), who combined for 42 points, 13 assists, and
14 rebounds, Ohio State also got big lifts from forward Jason
Singleton (13 points), and, most of all, from ``work in progress''
6-foot-11-inch junior center Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   This was, frankly, the best game of his Buckeye career. The big
guy blocked seven shots, altered several others and even
contributed 12 points in only his fourth double-figure game of the
year. ``He was the difference,'' said Jarvis. ``He set the tone of
the game from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fast-paced game, so well-played and hard-fought it was
that rare '99 contest even a neutral observer could love. Cast in
the catch-up role, such St. John's players as Lavor Postell (a
career-high 24 points) and Barkley (13 points, 7 assists) proved to
be resilient. The Johnnies never once hung their heads, no matter
how many Redd and Penn daggers were thrust into their mid-section.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just refused to go away nicely,'' observed O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnnies got back into it by forcing turnovers and making
some tough shots. With Ohio State up, 75-73 (12.2 left), Gray
missed one foul shot and made one. So did Penn. Down by 2, and with
Penn on him, Barkley lost his dribble, the ball rolling to Redd,
who likewise made one of two shots to put the game away with 0.7
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Was Barkley fouled by Penn? ``If I had a hand on him,'' said
Penn, ``it wasn't enough to make him lose the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter now. ``The game's over,'' confirmed Jarvis.
``They deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And who, except for a few sadly ill-informed people at The
Heights, doesn't know that Jim O'Brien certainly deserved to win?

UCONN TITLE HOPES BLOWN AWAY

   CINCINNATI _ The University of Connecticut women's basketball
team, which six days ago dodged a bullet by beating Xavier to get
into the Sweet 16, couldn't do it Saturday. The top-seeded Huskies
(29-5) were upended by fourth seed Iowa State, 64-58, in a Mideast
Regional semifinal. It is the first time in seven trips to a
regional semifinal that UConn has lost the game, and it was the
lowest amount of points the Huskies scored all season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Iowa State (25-7) advanced to the Elite
Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a tremendous disappointment whenever the season
ends,'' said UConn coach Geno Auriemma, whose team has made 11
trips to the NCAA Tournament and had been to the Final Four four
times. ``You feel like you've been kicked in the gut, it really
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Tamika Williams, who had scored the winning points last
Sunday against Xavier, scored 12 of her team-high 14 points in the
first half. A group of about 100 fans from her hometown of nearby
Dayton in the crowd of 5,772 at the University of Cincinnati's
Shoemaker Center was rooting loudly for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some no-shows for UConn, mainly Svetlana
Abrosimova and Shea Ralph, who contributed 9 and 5 points,
respectively. Ralph shot 0 for 9 from behind the 3-point line,
while Abrosimova was 1 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had wide-open shots,'' said a red-eyed Ralph after the
game. ``I don't know what to tell you, but we just didn't hit
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite was true for the Cyclones, who were cold from
behind the arc at the beginning of the second half, when they went
0 for 9, but hit the shots when they mattered, including five in a
row with just over five minutes to go in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to that point we weren't shooting our best, but coach just
keeps telling us to keep shooting, and luckily towards the end of
the game they were starting to fall,'' said junior guard Stacy
Frese, who scored a game-high 16 points, 14 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't probably aesthetically the kind of game that people
want to see, but we had to give up some open shots and luckily they
weren't making a lot of them,'' said Iowa State coach Bill
Fennelly. ``I thought we handled their pressure as much as we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State held UConn to 29.9 percent shooting from the field,
its lowest of the season. The Huskies' previous low was in their
loss to Boston College in January, when they shot 38.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State led by as many as 6 in the first half, 18-12, but saw
the lead slip away on a layup and a 3-point play by Williams, and a
field goal by freshman Swin Cash. The Cyclones came back, however,
fueled by a 3-pointer by freshman Tracy Gahan, and got within 2.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out in the half, sophomore guard Erica Haugen
fired a court-length pass that was tipped by teammate Megan Taylor,
and then the junior forward grabbed it and took it in for a layup
just before the buzzer to tie the game at 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the kids all the time that you've got to play till the
buzzer goes off, and that was a great example,'' Fennelly said.
``In a game like that, 28-28 sounds a heck of a lot better than
28-26.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn went on a 7-0 run five minutes into the second half.
Fennelly admitted he was squirming, as three of his players had
four fouls each. But the Huskies created their own trouble, as they
went four possessions in a row without scoring. Suddenly, Iowa
State was beating the Huskies at their own game, pressuring them
and making their defense collapse.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn ahead, 50-44, the Cyclones' fireworks truly began.
Junior Monica Huelman made a 3-pointer from the left side of the
key, and her teammates made four more in a row to give Iowa State a
59-55 lead. A 3-pointer by Marci Glenney was the Huskies' final
basket. Iowa State added three more free throws to finish the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor scored 13 points for the Cyclones, while Angie Welle
added 10.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State had just two winning seasons in the 18 years before
Fennelly came to the program five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot to prove to everyone else,'' said Gahan. ``I
think our whole team and our coaching staff were the only ones who
believed in us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's upset, there are a lot of believers.

RODMAN EXPECTED TO RETURN SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Wherever Dennis Rodman was, whatever he did and
why he did it, the only thing certain now is he's back, and the
Lakers have never needed him more.
</P>
<P>
   Well, strike the ``certain'' part _ this is Rodman, after all _
but he was certainly (begin ital)expected(end ital) to arrive here
in time for the Lakers' 12:30 p.m. EST game against the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric and troubled rebounding specialist was due to
arrive after 1 a.m. EST, having missed two earlier flights out of
Los Angeles. Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed Saturday evening
that the team expected Rodman's arrival and planned to have him in
uniform today.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman skipped the past four games to attend to unspecified
``personal business,'' which apparently included at least one trip
to Las Vegas. His public relations firm has denied rumors that he
also spent time in Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodman worked out his problems at the blackjack table, the
Lakers were going 1-3 on their toughest road trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, coach Kurt Rambis said Rodman would be put
back to work immediately, whenever he eventually arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shows up, I'll give him a pat on the back and send him
in,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were 7-6 before Rodman started playing for them, then
went 9-0 with him in uniform. But they have struggled mightily of
late, having lost Rodman at the same time they traded away Eddie
Jones _ their other best defender _ for Glen Rice, leaving them
weak defensively. They've given up 100 points in each of the past
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: The Magic is celebrating its 10th anniversary this
season, honoring alumni as they pass through the city. But the top
player in franchise history wants no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal would rather just pound a dozen dunks, crush
the Magic by 20 points and move on with his life. No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal left the city he called ``a dried-up little pond'' nearly
three years ago, but the locals will never let the Lakers star
forget his past. Especially the part where he dumped them for $121
million and a career in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the O-rena crowd booed and heckled his every move,
and the public-address system skewered him with songs _ ``Lies,
Lies, Lies,'' ``You're so Vain,'' ``Superman's Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, ironically, the team wants to honor O'Neal. The Magic
has presented 10-year anniversary plaques to former players Dennis
Scott and Bison Dele, and there's one with O'Neal's name on it, but
the team isn't sure what to do with it, fearful of crowd reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Shaq to settle the quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give me anything,'' he said. ``I play for the Lakers
now. (Playing for the Magic) is just a memory to me. They can keep
their awards, I don't care. I don't wanna be honored. Don't honor
me. It's all in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And he insists the game has no special significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just gonna be another game. No matter what happens, I
built that arena. That's why they call it the O-apostrophe-arena,''
O-apostrophe-Neal said. ``No matter what happens the rest of my
career, ever, I built that arena, I built that city.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers know their leader is in for a rough day at the
office, and Rick Fox said he understands the fans' reaction to
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting in a relationship with a girl,'' Fox said.
``If it's a good one, it's unbelievable for a short period of time.
But all of a sudden, if you pick up and you leave, they go crazy.
They get vindictive and psycho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando is the girlfriend you can't leave, you shouldn't have
left. They're definitely the spurned lover, because they did
whatever they could to keep him. It's like, `I love you, don't
leave me.'''

BC CAPTURES HOCKEY EAST CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston College completed a joyous run to the Hockey
East championship Saturday &UR;  &LR; night before a roaring 14,278 in the
FleetCenter as Blake Bellefeuille of Framingham completed a magical
two-night performance with a dramatic overtime goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bellefeuille's winner 6 minutes 58 seconds into the extra period
lifted the Eagles (25-11-4) to a dramatic 5-4 victory over the
University of New Hampshire (29-6-3). BC now has a head of steam
heading into next weekend's NCAA regionals in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were able to win the title largely because goaltender
Scott Clemmensen (20 saves) played to the form he showed a year ago
when he was tremendous during the stretch run of the Eagles' NCAA
championship loss against Michigan on this same ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles saw a 4-1 first-period lead dissipate as the Wildcats
responded to the challenge. UNH created a 4-4 tie when unheralded
Johnny Rogers swept in front of Clemmensen and tucked it between
his pads 15:18 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal bore a certain resemblance to the Wolverines'
title-clinching goal against BC last year. The puck wound up on the
stick of freshman defenseman Brooks Orpik on the left boards after
a scramble. Orpik sent Bellefeuille in, and Bellefeuille's shot
beat goaltender Ty Conklin. ``There was a turnover on the side
boards,'' said Bellefeuille, ``and I picked it up and just started
to bring it to the net. I tried to fire it as quickly as I could,
and catch him off guard. Luckily, I caught the far corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was a bitter setback for the Wildcats, whose history
in playoff hockey isn't something to write home about. They've been
in the playoffs 34 times and have just one victory in the ECAC
tournament 20 years ago at Boston Garden. They were 0-1 in ECAC
Division 2, 1-3 in the ECAC. UNH is now 0-10 in Hockey East and 0-8
entering the NCAAs next weekend, where it undoubtedly will draw a
first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who were picked No. 1 in the preseason but stumbled
a few times en route to Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, threatened to turn the
game into a rout. Farkas, who has been a major force in the stretch
run, broke in on the left wing to lift the Eagles to a 1-0 lead
just 2:22 into the game. After defenseman Jayme Filipowicz drew a
high-sticking penalty 7:47 into the period, the Eagles built a 2-0
lead when Farkas scored from the slot after defenseman Bobby Allen
started it in motion and Bellefeuille tipped it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bellefeuille fielded a pass from Bobby Allen on the left
wing and rifled it in at 14:25 of the period. BC 3, UNH 0. The
Wildcats finally broke through when Jason Krog, a finalist for the
Hobey Baker Award as college hockey's best player, took a picture
feed from Steve O'Brien and put it past Clemmensen at 15:56 of the
period. The Eagles answered when Kevin Caulfield put in a rebound
of a shot by Tony Hutchins to go ahead 4-1 at the 17:33 mark.
</P>
<P>
   While it looked like the rout was on, things actually were just
getting interesting. David Busch scored 3:53 into the second
period, and just 10 seconds later Jason Shipulski tucked the puck
between Clemmensen's pads to make it BC 4, UNH 3. The two goals
within a 10-second span were the fastest in tournament history.
Maine had scored two within 12 seconds in 1990 against
UMass-Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen then went to work, making two big saves on Mike Souza
bids. It remained 4-3 until Rogers swept out in front after a pass
out from Corey-Joe Ficek and tied it. ``We were dead for a while,''
said Bellefeuille. ``The coach (Jerry York) and the captain
(Brendan Buckley) got us back. They got us back into it in the
third period and it carried over into overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt for a while,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile.
``We'll get over it. We'll find out tomorrow who we're going to
play next weekend.''

SAMARANCH AWAITING SENATE`S INVITATION 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Will International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch testify at the Senate Commerce
Committee's hearings next month? Perhaps _ if he is invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always very pleased to go to the United States, no?''
Samaranch said. ``But I have received no letter. If I received the
official invitation, I will think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, Samaranch was more startled than anyone
else by the 86-2 vote of confidence from his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected eight or 10 or 12, even 15 members against me,''
said Samaranch, who appointed four-fifths of the Lords. ``I was
very surprised that there are only two votes against me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Samaranch vowing to stay on until his term ends in 2001,
the succession derby has been put on hold. As of now, the top
candidates are considered to be vice presidents Richard Pound of
Canada and Pal Schmitt of Hungary, and board members Jacques Rogge
of Belgium and Thomas Bach of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The purge of the Lords may not be done yet. The cases against
Kim Un Yong of South Korea and Phil Coles of Australia are still
open, and if the IOC's executive board gets the evidence it needs,
they could be expelled at the next full meeting in Seoul in June.
Coles may be done in by his ex-wife, who has confirmed that she has
a $6,000 necklace that the Athens bidders gave her husband. If the
IOC gets proof that Kim knew the Salt Lake bidders subsidized his
son's telecommunications job in Utah, he could be gone, too. That
expulsion would be delicate, though _ Kim lives in Seoul . . . The
IOC won't pursue allegations by former Salt Lake bid chief Tom
Welch that US member Anita DeFrantz was aware of improper payoffs.
DeFrantz, who is an SLOC board member, insists she knew nothing and
the inquiry board believes her. ``I consider these allegations
scandalous and am seeking counsel,'' she said . . . The IOC is in
no rush to fill the spots opened by the 10 members who resigned or
were expelled. ``We'll probably want to see how we'll restructure
ourselves before we start appointing members under the old
system,'' said Pound . . . Why were only 88 and not 90 members
voting when the IOC reached the end of the expulsion list last
week? ``We have some elderly members who get fatigued,'' said Pound
. . . The IOC says it is not necessary for its new selection group
to visit the six European bid cities before choosing the two
finalists for the 2006 Winter Games in June. ``Remember, until 1986
nobody visited cities,'' says DeFrantz. ``We have done it this way
before and it worked well.'' . . . Atlanta had its live bulldog,
Salt Lake had its bathroom fixtures. What was Sydney's most
imaginative gift to a Lord of the Rings? Shipping seven zoo-bred
horses to Mongolia for IOC member Shagdargav Magvan for a mere
$150,000 . . . Top priority for new Salt Lake Chief organizer Mitt
Romney is getting a computer hardware provider ASAP to work with
SEMA, the European system integrator he is stuck with courtesy of
the IOC. After Atlanta's IBM nightmare, Romney wants no
cybercrashes in 2002.

   They may be broke and scrambling for ice time, but the Russians
still could win nine of the 12 medals at this week's World Figure
Skating Championships in Helsinki. Besides sweeping the men's
event, which no country has managed since 1956 (the US), the
Russians could grab two medals in each of the other three. What's
left? A gold for Michelle Kwan in the women's event, a silver for
the Chinese (yes, the Chinese) in pairs, and a silver for the
French in dance. Unless Michael Weiss can crack the men's troika of
Alexei Yagudin, Evgeny Plushenko, and Alexei Urmanov, the Americans
will win only one medal. That hasn't happened in a non-Olympic year
since they were blanked in 1993. What the Yanks are more worried
about is that their inexperienced squad implodes and loses spots
for next year . . . Think home cooking doesn't mean much in Nordic
skiing? The Austrians, who hadn't won a world cross-country medal
in 66 years, grabbed four at the recent world championships in
Ramsau, winning the men's by a ski tip ahead of the heavily favored
Norwegians, who had their worst overall showing (``only'' five
medals) this decade. Top individuals were Finland's Mika Myllylae,
who won three races and was runner-up in the fourth, and Italy's
Stefania Belmondo, who won two golds and a silver. The Norwegians
won both individual Nordic combined events, with the Finns taking
the team title, and the Germans swept the jumps. Nothing, as usual,
for the Americans. Best cross-country showing was 25th by Justin
Wadsworth in the 50K; no women cracked the top 30 . . . Ticklish
protocol issue for the Sydney organizers with their Opening
Ceremonies. The Olympic rule is that the head of state is supposed
to declare the Games open. But is that Queen Elizabeth of England,
who heads the British Commonwealth, or the Australian prime
minister? The Aussie cabinet says it is the prime minister; the
British Parliament says it is the queen. The Australian public will
have its say in November, when it votes either to keep the queen or
create a president.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What will the Sydney organizers do for cash if disillusioned
sponsors pull out because of the IOC scandal? One-armed bandits.
The Aussies are considering having slot machines installed in
clubs, with the organizing committee getting a piece of the take.
It's OK with the IOC, which considers slots a form of lottery . . .
New president of the Massachusetts Sports Partnership is Soosie
Lazenby, a former executive at Adidas and International Management
Group. She succeeds Bob Colarossi, who departed last year to become
president of USA Gymnastics . . . Significant boost for the US
baseball team, which will have access to any pro not on a 40-man
major league roster for both this summer's Olympic qualifier and
next year's Games. That means minor leaguers probably will replace
most of the collegians. And it is almost certain that they'll be
swinging wood at Olympus. After the pingfest in Atlanta (110 homers
in 28 games) aluminum bats have been scrapped . . . Long Beach,
Montreal, and Barcelona are the candidates to host the 2003 World
Aquatics Championships . . . Symbolic breakthrough for US
badminton: The men's doubles team of Mark Manha and Howard Bach has
cracked the world top 20. That has not happened since the sport was
added to the Olympics in 1992 . . . Yes, the torch for Sydney's
relay was meant to resemble a boomerang. It will be made out of
stainless steel and aluminum, and will weigh more than 2 pounds.
But unlike a boomerang, it won't return to the previous runner.

BRUINS SURVIVE SHARK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the beginning, it looked like it was going to be so,
so easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was so, so difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins did their best to give the game to the San Jose
Sharks
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the FleetCenter. The Sharks said, ``No, that's OK,
let's split it.''
</P>
<P>
   So each team walked away with a point in a 2-2 tie. Had the
contest lasted longer than 65 minutes, Boston, still sitting in
eighth place in the Eastern Conference, would have been sunk. The
Sharks dominated the overtime, though the shots were only 3-1 San
Jose, and Bruins coach Pat Burns looked as if he was going to have
a coronary behind the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst I've seen my team play in an overtime since I
remember, since I've been coaching, I think,'' said Burns. ``In 10
years now, I've never seen a team play in overtime like that. We
were very, very fortunate to get a point. And probably not
deserving of a point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks were swarming all over the Bruins in the extra
period, but it was the Bruins doing the dominating in the first
period, when they jumped out to a 2-0 lead. It should have been,
could have been more, as Boston hit five posts.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first, Steve Heinze tallied his 17th goal of
the year. Heinze took a pass from Jason Allison and tried to beat
goalie Steve Shields with a forehander at the right post. His shot
clanged off but came right back to him and Heinze switched to his
backhand, jamming it in for the 1-0 lead at 10:28.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than five minutes remaining in the first,
Heinze nearly scored again, his shot from the left circle rattling
off the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made it a two-goal lead on the power play at 17:36.
Allison dished a pass to the point for Ray Bourque. Bourque fired a
shot that deflected past Shields for his eighth goal. The Bruins
outshot the Sharks, 15-5, in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we wanted the headlines,'' said Burns. ``It was so easy
to go the way we were going. We followed the game plan, I told
them, `Put speed on them, put speed on the outside, get the puck in
behind them, cycle the puck, roll, try to get in the front of the
net, and we're going to get some goals.' We did that. In the second
period, we decided to cheat a little bit here and cheat a little
bit there, and the next thing you know, the puck is in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second, the Bruins let the Sharks back into the game,
allowing both San Jose goals, including one with 17.7 seconds
remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing Boston could do about the goal that made it
2-1 at 10:36. Right wing Joe Murphy, who is best known for recently
saying he's as good as Mark Recchi, threw the puck at the net from
the left side. It caromed off the right skate of Kyle McLaren and
past Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   If they couldn't prevent the first, the Bruins most definitely
could have stopped the second. The Sharks gained tremendous
momentum from their first tally and put the heat on Boston. The
Sharks pinned the Bruins in their end and center Marco Sturm skated
the puck from behind the net to the right circle, evading Darren
Van Impe. With Dafoe on his way down in front, Sturm fired a
forehander that went between Dafoe's legs at 19:42 to pull the
Sharks even at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period and overtime, the teams were even in shots
with eight, but the Sharks outplayed Boston. In the third, Dafoe
made two brilliant stops _ on Sturm from the slot with 5:20
remaining and on Mike Ricci from the right circle with 5:08 left.
Ricci reacted by putting both hands on his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   In the extra period, it was all San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a big team, they're a strong team, they're an
experienced team,'' said Burns. ``They hit you all night long. We
were fortunate to pick up a point, it's a very important point, and
I'm happy to get the point.''

   BOSTON _ They were taken first and second in the 1997 draft, the

apparently play in the same National Hockey League, Thornton might
as well play on Jupiter and Marleau on Mars for all the contact

   It's only natural. Thornton was the top choice, Marleau just
behind, and Marleau checks the summaries to see how Thornton, also
19, is faring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a respect for each other and we want each
other to do well,'' said Marleau, ``but there's also a friendly
competition between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Marleau took the honors last season with 13 goals and 32 points,
while Thornton struggled. As the hockey gods would have it, each
had a chance to be the hero Saturday in the Bruins' 2-2
squander-a-thon against the travel-weary Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   It's very hard, said San Jose coach Darryl Sutter, ``to play a
night game at home and then travel cross-country for an afternoon
game. We were on a body clock that said 10:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that in the first period, San Jose goalie Steve
Shields ``was hearing `Jingle Bells' behind me'' with five Bruins
shots striking posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult morning,'' said Shields, his body
clock a few hours behind Causeway Street time.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second period it was Boston that donned its Santa
Claus suit, giving away two soft goals. By the third period and the
overtime, however, the Bruins might as well have been clanging
their Salvation Army bells as they were in need of help. And there
was Marleau sent in clean from the left circle on a two-on-one in
the first minute of overtime on Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Marleau now had a chance to do what Thornton, his friendly rival
and teammate on the Canada's world junior championship team two
years ago, couldn't do earlier, what the top choices in the draft
are expected to do _ put the puck in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like Dafoe was going down when I was going in, but
then he stood up,'' said Marleau of the goal-that-wasn't. ``And he
just got a piece of my shot with his (right) shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have loved to have seen Patrick score then, because
there's always that thing with Marleau and Thornton every time they
play each other,'' Sutter said. ``Everybody wants to talk about it,
and it would have been great to see him score in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   So neither Marleau nor Thornton could claim the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were on the ice against each other at all,''
said Marleau, ``but I still had my eye on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter and Mars may pass close by each other in another six
months. In the meantime, reports from the distant planets say
Thornton has 11 goals and 21 assists, while Marleau has 19 goals
and 19 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be checking up on Joe,'' said Marleau. But from afar.

ON ROAD TO NOWHERE, CELTICS ARE LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you are a Celtics fan, the best news for you is
this: You have options. You want to know why your team has lost
seven of its last eight games. You want to know why the young men
in green seem to have a fear of leaving the 617/508/781/978 area
codes, since they have lost eight straight away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the losses?
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you are a Celtics player or coach, the worst news for
you is this: You have options. You want to know why you lost to the
Knicks Saturday at Madison Square Garden, 96-78. You want to know
why the game was over at the end of three quarters, when the New
Yorkers led, 80-60. You want to know how you can shoot 54 percent
in the first half _ an exceptional percentage _ and still trail by
10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the losses?
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Most people would start with the Knicks' bench. The last time
these teams met, on Feb. 26, the Celtics won by 14. ``They kicked
our butts royally the last time we played,'' said Knicks center
Patrick Ewing. ``We came out and gave it back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell was in Boston Feb. 26, but he didn't play. He
came off the bench Saturday and had 21 points in his first 17
minutes. He finished with 27 in 31 minutes. Once, he came down
court and made a pull-up 3-pointer. Another time, he drove the lane
and dunked on 6-foot-10-inch center Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he's rounding into form,'' Celtics coach Rick
Pitino said of the 6-5 guard. ``He's a very unstoppable weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that stopped Sprewell last season was the NBA
office, which determined he was trying to use his hands as weapons,
weapons that would wrap themselves around the neck of his former
coach, P.J. Carlesimo. But when Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said,
``I thought (Sprewell's) aggression was good,'' everyone knew he
was talking about his work against Celtic guards, not league
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to remember that you have options. So know that
Sprewell is not the only reason the Celtics lost. You could also
point to the 15 rebounds by Marcus Camby, who also came off the
bench. Camby and Sprewell had nine offensive rebounds between them;
the Celtics totaled 10. But that wasn't the sole factor, either.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched the first 17 minutes probably couldn't have
guessed that the Celtics would be reduced to Garbage Time fodder in
the final quarter. That's because they led, 30-25, after the first
quarter and were tied with the Knicks, 41-all, with just over five
minutes remaining in the first half. Ron Mercer (19 points) looked
as if he were on his way to a 60-point night, shooting and scoring
with ease over Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we didn't guard at all in the first six or eight
minutes,'' Van Gundy explained.
</P>
<P>
   As Van Gundy was lamenting that, Pitino was turning to players
on the bench and saying, ``Now that's good basketball.'' He was
talking about the passing of Mercer, Kenny Anderson, and Antoine
Walker. Later the coach would say, ``I thought we really had fun
passing the basketball. But then we reverted back to, `I may be
hot, so let me take my man (one-on-one).' ''
</P>
<P>
   So the passing stopped. The scoring did, too. In the last 5:04
of the second quarter, the Celtics were outscored, 14-4. And a tie
game had become a 10-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could keep telling you the same old thing after these
games,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have fallen apart on the road before. They have had
low-scoring quarters before, similar to the 15-point effort they
had in the third. But they have rarely had four starters sit on the
bench for the entire fourth quarter. Pitino said he did that
because his team has a game Sunday against the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino revisited a familiar topic after the game. He said the
Celtics will make the playoffs next season. He said that will
happen even if the Celtics have to get older. He said he will
observe his players and see who has character; who handles being
down by 15 points well, and who handles an eight-game road-losing
streak well.
</P>
<P>
   If he and his team decide to look at Saturday's game again, they
will have a lot to discuss.

KINGS' RANSOM WASTED 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Kings needed power-play help _ who doesn't? _ and
so last July, only 24 hours into the open free agency period, they
showered Steve Duchesne with a three-year deal worth $11.75
million.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, not even nine months later, Duchesne was placed
on waivers. Now there's real bang for your buck.
</P>
<P>
   It's lucky these businesses are monopolies, folks, because if
pro teams had to operate under standard free-market conditions _
basics such as supply and demand, finding the best deal on paper
clips, and the most dreaded thought of all, competition _ some of
them wouldn't be around long enough to hear the anthem on opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   Not that LA is alone in the big, bad world of hoodwinkdom.
Hardly. What were the Blackhawks thinking when they pounded the
table to the tune of $18 million for Doug Gilmour? Answer: They had
to come up with someone after losing out on Brett Hull. Gilmour
hasn't been the total bust Duchesne has been in LA, but he has
skated in the same cloud of futility.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision in LA shows that Kings general manager Dave
Taylor feels more stable in his position than his counterpart in
Chicago, Bob Murray, did. Placing Gilmour on waivers would be
tantamount to Murray writing his own resignation letter. Taylor
won't be asked to leave, at least not yet, because the Kings still
have a slight chance of landing a postseason berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are bad, but they're not Blackhawk bad.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who has been GM for only two years of the Blackhawks'
38-year rebuilding program, will see his team miss the postseason
for a second consecutive time _ something that hasn't happened in
Chicago since the late 1950s. If he sticks around, he can go for
the hat trick next season.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL trade deadline is only some 48 hours away _ Tuesday, 3
p.m. _ and, contrary to prevailing opinion, from here it doesn't
appear that a flood of big deals will rush through the league. Big
deals call for big names, and all the game's big names now make big
bucks, too. Those big names who actually are earning their money,
such as Curtis Joseph in Toronto, aren't going to be dangled in the
next day or two. The bigger action could come in late June, around
the amateur draft and just prior to free agency kicking in July 1.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings could have dealt Duchesne, even while absorbing
some of the financial pain, they obviously would have done that.
The Blackhawks will have to do the same if they want to unload
Gilmour. Ditto for the Lightning with Stephane Richer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be moves made in the next couple of days, such as the
Chicago-Edmonton seven-man swap, maybe even one or two that will
lift an eyebrow (like Trevor Linden to Ottawa or back to the
Canucks), but nothing that will capture the imagination. The Kings
had that dream machine going last July, and look where it took
them. Buying out Duchesne's deal, which now appears inevitable,
would cost them approximately $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Flyers need (beyond a life raft, a Red Cross kit,
and archery lessons for Roger Neilson) is help at the point on the
power play. That, in part, is why rumors have had them acquiring
ex-Bruin Stephane Quintal from the Habs _ although Montreal's
Vladimir Malakhov has more of a slap shot than the ``Q'' . . .
Prior to sending Mark Recchi to the Flyers for Danius Zubrus, the
Habs tried to pry prospect Simon Gagne and a first-rounder out of
Philly. Flyer GM Bob Clarke wouldn't bite. A small center (6 feet,
165 pounds), Gagne was the Flyers' first pick last June and has
been lighting up the Quebec League this season . . . After
recording the fourth-best save percentage (.920) in the league last
season, Capitals netminder Olaf Kolzig has dipped into the
.890somethings, the numeric wasteland for No. 1 goalies. Wouldn't
it be ironic if, like ex-Capitals goalie Jim Carey, he went from
boom to bust in one season? . . . The Oilers, still reeling in net
from Joseph's walkaway over the summer, picked up the Islanders'
Tommy Salo Saturday. He's not CuJo, but he's a better bet than Bob
Essensa or Steve Passmore. Oiler boss Glen Sather on his club's
lackluster play of late: ``This is a big problem _ not a tweaking
problem.'' Sather gave up forward Mats Lindgren in the Salo swap,
after the Islanders reportedly were holding out for Ryan Smyth (now
recovering from a badly fractured jaw) . . . He was rendered a
spare part earlier this season, but Derek Plante dropped even
further from the picture in Buffalo when the Sabres picked up Stu
Barnes from Pittsburgh. He'll be elsewhere by midweek, perhaps for
as little as a third-round pick . . . Will he stay or will he go?
According to ``Hockey Night in Canada'' commentator John Davidson,
Chicago blue liner Chris Chelios recently informed management that
he would agree to be traded, but only to one of three teams. The
Blackhawks promptly denied it. Ditto for Chelios . . . Within hours
after opening up the doors to his new bar, Shayne 27, in downtown
Montreal, Canadiens winger Shayne Corson awoke to printed rumors
that he'll be dealt at the trade deadline _ perhaps to San Jose.
``It's been like this most of my career,'' Corson told the Montreal
Gazette. ``Teams know the kind of player I am, that I come to play
every night, and that's what you look for when you want someone to
help you make the playoffs.'' And if he has to bid adieu, what
happens to the bar? Corson: ``I have good people who can run the
place.'' . . . Different sports, different countries, different
times, but anyone else out there see the similarities between Joe
DiMaggio and Jean Beliveau in the dignity, style, and class
departments? . . . Ken Hitchcock, runner-up to Pat Burns as coach
of the year last season, has virtually eliminated practices for his
Dallas Stars the rest of the season. The Stars will have a brief
morning skate on game days _ if they practice at all _ and will
work in liberal offdays here for the last month of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone believed otherwise, but the new deal Adam Graves
signed with the Rangers last week gives an idea how lofty the
bidding will be for unrestricted free agents this summer. Graves,
who will turn 31 next month (and therefore would have been
unrestricted come July 1), will collect a minimum $12 million over
three years. The Blueshirts can pick up another year at the back
end for $3.5 million. Still unresolved: a new pact for
free-agent-to-be Brian Leetch. He turned 31 earlier this month and
figures to bank upwards of $30 million on a four-year pact . . .
The Rangers have gone 6-3-2 without Wayne Gretzky in their lineup.
The Great One has had a cortisone shot to soothe the pain in his
neck (herniated disk). He got word Tuesday that he can start back
skating _ on his own, without contact _ and could be back in action
next weekend . . . Seconds into his first shift with the Penguins,
ex-Sabre Matthew Barnaby goaded the Flyers' Roman Vopat into a
roughing penalty. No big deal, but the Penguins went on to a
relatively easy 4-0 victory and Barnaby was sporting that smug ``go
ahead, punch me'' look most every shift . . . Word around Tampa Bay
is that the Bolts could push ex-Bruin Bill Ranford to the minors
before the season ends. There's virtually no chance of his being
grabbed in the expansion draft, raising the likelihood that he'll
be bought out over the summer . . . Last weekend, the Red Wings
surprisingly went with Norm Maracle over Chris Osgood in
back-to-back starts in net. It could be one of two things: Scotty
Bowman, master of the mind game, is playing his cerebral shuffle;
or Maracle is getting showcased for a possible trade. The Wings
would like to get some blue line help for the playoffs, fueling
rumors much of the second half that they've had an eye on the
Rangers' Ulf Samuelsson . . . Anaheim superstar Teemu Selanne, upon
seeing his 17-game point streak come to an end when a power-play
goal was rubbed off the board because of yet another controversial
player-in-the-crease call: ``This is ruining hockey. I feel shame
for hockey.'' . . . As expected, former Pittsburgh superstar Mario
Lemieux submitted his reorganization plan to purchase the Penguins
out of bankruptcy Thursday. A second group, headed by trucking
magnate Harvey Gainey, is expected to submit a similar plan early
this week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the red-hot Coyotes? They've dropped like a rock in the
second half, so much so that speculation ran hot last weekend that
head coach Jim Schoenfeld could be headed to the unemployment line.
ESPN's Al Morganti reported Tuesday night that Jeremy Roenick will
not be back with the Coyotes next season. GM Bobby Smith played
down the Schoenfeld rumors. Following a 1-0 victory over Anaheim,
Schoenfeld bolted the building without talking to the media. Too
late in the season to make such a drastic coaching change? Bruins
fans know better. Fred Creighton had his '79-80 Bruins (with rookie
Ray Bourque in the lineup) flying high when Harry Sinden canned him
with 14 games to go. The Bruins went 7-6-1 under Sinden, finished
with 105 points, and made it into the second round of the playoffs,
where they were dumped by the Islanders (first of four straight Cup
runs for New York) . . . A Kirk Maltby slash left Valeri Kamensky
with a broken arm, likely ending the Russian striker's season _ and
perhaps his stay in Denver. Kamensky, an unrestricted free agent
this summer, wants to return to the Avalanche, but it's doubtful
they'll pay him the $2 million or more per year he'll command.
He'll be 33 when this season ends and won't have a lot of clubs
chasing him. Maltby was suspended four games for delivering the
hack . . . Ex-Canucks coach Mike Keenan incensed Vancouver
management with recent remarks on Canadian TV, including his
suggestion that his old pal, Mark Messier, wouldn't be with the
club through the end of his contract. GM Brian Burke sent
videotapes of Keenan's remarks to lawyers to consider whether
Keenan broke his contract's confidentiality clause. He still has
about $1 million coming from the Canucks, including $800,000 for
next season. Burke: ``I think it's really lame that he would drag
Mark Messier into this. He should be worried about finding another
job and not about the Vancouver Canucks.'' . . . Sinden will be
honored, along with the '98 US Olympic women's hockey team, with
the Lester Patrick Award (for outstanding contributions to hockey
in the US) at a noon luncheon March 30 at the Fairmont Copley
Plaza. Tickets are $125 each. For information, call 617-624-1923.

DECISION DUE SOON ON DUCHESNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Steve Duchesne's status remained unresolved
Saturday, with no conclusion to his saga likely until Tuesday's NHL
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the Kings either will buy Duchesne out of his
contract, trade him, send him to the minors or keep him on the
team. The Kings waived Duchesne on Wednesday and he cleared waivers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out Duchesne's contract would be costly. Last summer, the
Kings signed him as a free agent to a three-year contract worth
$3.75 million a year. There also is a fourth year on the contract,
at Duchesne's option, for $3.75 million. Under terms of the NHL's
collective bargaining agreement, the Kings would have to pay
two-thirds of the remaining $11.25 million on the contract, or $7.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings were to trade Duchesne, they would probably have to
pay a large portion of Duchesne's remaining salary to get another
team to take him. If the Kings were to buy out Duchesne, he could
turn around and sign a new contract as a free agent with another
NHL team. He would have to sign by noon Tuesday, however, to be
eligible to compete in this year's Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, Florida, Detroit and Carolina are some of the
teams that might be interested in adding Duchesne for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne was a healthy scratch for the fifth straight game when
the Kings played host to Florida on Saturday night but was
scheduled to travel with the team for tonight's game in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumor: A Kings spokesman denied a rumor that the team was
considering trading defenseman Doug Bodger and winger Russ
Courtnall to the Detroit Red Wings for 22-year-old Mathieu
Dandenault, a speedy defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro nominated: Center Ray Ferraro is the Kings' nominee for
the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which is awarded annually to
the player who best exemplifies the qualities of ``perseverance,
sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro overcame knee problems this year to have a solid season
in 1998-98.
</P>
<P>
   Previous Kings who have won the Masterton Trophy are Butch
Goring (1977-78), Bob Bourne (1987-88) and Dave Taylor (1990-91).
</P>
<P>
   Rare goal: Kings defenseman Mattias Norstrom scored his second
goal of the season during the Kings' four-goal first-period
outburst Saturday. Norstrom matched a career high set with the New
York Rangers in 1995-96, and after he scored, the Panthers replaced
starting goalie Kirk McLean with Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good that I can contribute once in awhile
offensively,'' said Norstrom, a consistent defensive contributor.
``It hasn't happened often.''

NASH WAKES UP, HELPS MaVERICKS TOP KINGS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Steve Nash played more like Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent played more like Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   And, most important, the Sacramento Kings played exactly like
the NBA's worst defense.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, those three elements led to an easy 104-90 Mavericks'
victory before 16,161 last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little disheartened after some close losses, but
this was just what the doctor ordered,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson
said. ``If we would've shot like that all season, we'd have five
more wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who ended a three-game losing streak and improved
to 9-17, got 22 points and five 3-pointers from Nash, 22 points and
11 rebounds from Trent. The Mavericks made a season-high nine
3-pointers and topped 100 points for the first time in 10 games,
and only the fourth time this season. The porous Kings, 0-2 in
Dallas, surrendered 100 points for the eighth time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could beat this team,'' Mavericks center Shawn
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   After a pregame pep talk from injured teammate Cedric Ceballos,
Nash melted Kings rookie Jason Williams with his hot hand. With a
shoot-first mentality for the first time this season, Nash made
7-of-16 shots, but more important, held Williams to six points on
3-of-11 shooting, including 0-6 from beyond the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out like it was all or nothing,'' said Nash. ``I was
going to take the open shots and not worry about it. I'm too good
of a shooter to keep in this slump. Ced just told me to stop
thinking and worrying and be more aggressive. After the first
quarter he wanted a 15 percent finder's fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent, despite fighting a stomach virus, dominated the Kings for
the second time. He had 29 points and 16 rebounds in a February
victory, and last night became an effective passer after a pregame
film session in which he and Nelson watched Barkley operate in the
low post.
</P>
<P>
   The result was Trent patiently backing down his defender into
the lane before either shooting, or if double-teamed, sending a
one-handed bounce pass to an open shooter on the perimeter. He
finished with four assists and was a main reason for Nash's
career-high 3-pointers and another four by Hubert Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've done before, but tonight it worked better
than ever,'' said Trent. ``It's a way to really control the
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Michael Finley missed six of his first seven shots,
the Mavericks had their best offensive half of the season, building
a 56-47 halftime lead. Dallas shot 45 percent, hit six 3-pointers,
made 14-of-16 free throws and outrebounded the Kings, 27-16.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was equally inept at both ends, going 5:30 without a
basket as the Mavericks built a 33-20 lead. Despite Chris Webber
picking up three fouls in a 30-second span and Williams being on
the bench after being badly outplayed by Nash, the Kings pulled
within 41-38 on back-to-back 3-pointers by Vernon Maxwell.
Inexplicably, however, Tariq Abdul-Wahad left Davis wide open on
the perimeter for three 3-pointers that rebuilt Dallas' lead.

   BOSTON _ It's getting harder and harder to decide which Los
Angeles team is more newsworthy these days. The Clippers keep
losing and their coach rips them. The Lakers lose Dennis Rodman and
a couple of games and once again are a bull's-eye for inquiring
minds.
</P>
<P>
   So, Rick Fox, what's the story?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a soap opera act all year,'' the ex-Celtic and
current Laker says. ``There's no reason to believe it's over. It's
a continuing saga.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is. No sooner did it appear that the Lakers had all
their ducks in order than Rodman up and left. Jerry West would like
him to stay away, but it's not his call. Jerry Buss created this
and it's his baby. Now the Lakers have come East, and they started
the trip inauspicously with losses Thursday in Cleveland and Friday
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has taken some heat for speaking out about the team's
deficiencies (maturity, lack of leadership). He was perceived as
being holier than thou, uppity, presumptuous, you name it. He feels
otherwise and clearly the darts haven't muzzled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things needed to be said,'' he said. ``If you think it's
fine, that it's good, you're just lying to yourself. Ever since
I've moved beyond the first phase of my career, I just don't have
time to play the b.s. game. It's not what everyone wants to hear. I
can live with myself. At least when I say something, people know
it's not b.s. They should respect you for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any leaders stepping forward, he said, ``We're
getting closer to having a form of leadership and moving beyond the
`what's in it for me?' You can have all the talent in the world and
not go anywhere. We think (talent) is going to carry us.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``There's a power struggle getting everyone on
board. But if we're not all on the same page, we're not going
anywhere. We don't have as many guys who have personal agendas. But
is that enough? I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fox thinks the Lakers will hit some bumps in the next couple of
weeks. He noted that with the acquisition of Glen Rice and the
losses of Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, the team is still in
flux, and this pseudo-season already is half-over. But he thinks
this year is better than last year, when he talked early and often
about the Lakers' woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew last year it was going to fall apart after one month,''
he said. ``That made me mad because I knew we were going to fall. I
think we were headed down that same path this year. It hasn't
settled yet. There are still a lot of distractions. A lot of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   He's watching the unfolding egodrama. Shaquille O'Neal is
scoring but is still an indifferent rebounder and doesn't seem
remotely interested in playing defense. He's also playing hurt _
the abdominal thing is bothering him _ and you have to wonder
whether reporting out of shape had anything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant is playing terrific basketball. Rice? Who knows?
There's only one ball, but a lot of other stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching this mix. Any one of these guys would be the guy
on another team,'' said Fox. ``You have egos. If it doesn't play
out to a smooth transition in a couple weeks, I'm sure I'll be
talking to you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Laker (non-Rodman) stuff: Sunday marks Shaq's second visit
back to Orlando and the fans in Hooterville are sure to give him a
typical reception. We asked Penny Hardaway recently about his
relationship with his former teammate and why it wasn't closer. ``I
think it was just two different guys,'' Hardaway said. ``I wanted
to be close to him, but, at the time, he didn't want to be close to
me.'' Hardaway said, however, that his arrival in Orlando also
stole some of Shaq's thunder and the Big Guy wasn't happy about it.
``What happened was, where the rubber meets the road, I came in and
basically stole his shots,'' said Hardaway. ``Not trying to, but
just (by) playing. Some guys can't handle that. I think he's a
really good guy. But you have people around that push the wrong
buttons, that tell him, `He's in your spot, he's taking too many
shots.' I think that's what happened with him because he has all
kinds of guys around him. I only told the truth, but the truth
hurts. I would love to have had a great relationship with him and
would still like to have a relationship with him now. I'd love to
sit down with him and say, `Hey, whatever happened in the past,
happened. Let's move on. At least we can be friends.' I don't want
to hate him.'' Hardaway said his relationship with Shaq has ``even
trickled over to Kobe.'' He said it started when Bryant was talking
trash a couple years back at Magic Johnson's game. ``He tried to go
at me, every time,'' Hardaway said. ``It's fine to be competitive,
but to start talking trash to a veteran guy, that's the worst thing
you can do. So that's what Kobe's into now, and he's sending
messages back, by people that I know, talking about how he's going
to kill me and all that type of stuff. And I'm like, I can remember
this guy when he was (in high school) in Philadelphia and he asked
me if he should come out or not. Now, he's all of a sudden talking
trash.'' Gee, think we could arrange for an Orlando-LA final? . . .
Attention Karl Malone: The next time you play the Clippers, you
might stride over to their bench, put your arm around trainer Ray
Melchiorre, and say, ``Sorry for all the trouble you've been
through.'' Melchiorre had to have neck surgery last season after
taking a spill caused by a Malone dive into the Clippers bench. It
wasn't the Mailman's fault, and Melchiorre doesn't even think
Malone knows about it.

   Milwaukee's George Karl said he would have agitated for Paul
Pierce had he been running the Bucks' draft last June. As it was,
he was, as they say, between jobs. ``I worked with Paul a couple
summers ago,'' said Karl, ``and even though he was out of shape, I
could tell what great basketball instincts he had. He has that feel
for the game. If I had been here, I would have had a high desire to
draft him. When you're a bad team, you gotta have players. What
position they play has never been that important to me.'' . . .
Speaking of Karl, he had been warned by the league to stop ripping
Sonics president Wally Walker, which is why he was so heavily fined
($25,000). Still, isn't trashing your ex-boss an unalienable right?
What happens when the next book comes out and Player A or Coach A
tears into his old organization? Sounds to me like David Stern
could find a better use for his billy club . . . Billy Curley
didn't stay unemployed for long. He was told by the Timberwolves
that they would bring him back if New Jersey waived him. The Nets
did their part and Curley was back playing for the wounded Wolves
as they made their third trip to the Pacific in the last two weeks.
They'll be in here next Wednesday, but they'll be hurting. Both
Anthony Peeler and Malik Sealy, their top two shooting guards, are
hurt and may miss the game. The Wolves also sent Chris Carr to New
Jersey in the Stephon Marbury trade, but were hoping to be able to
save him and package him to Vancouver for Sam Mack. Instead, Carr
had to go to Jersey to balance out the salaries and Mack ended up
in Houston. The Wolves are still fuming over David Falk's
machinations in getting Marbury out of town. (In case you missed
it, Marbury waited less than a week before calling some former
teammates and expressing regret about the whole thing.) Kevin
McHale wanted to call Falk's bluff, believing that Marbury would
not go to any of the three teams that have big cap room: the
Clippers, Raptors, and Bulls. Why not Chicago? Can you see Marbury
playing for a college coach in a triple-post offense? But Minnesota
owner Glen Taylor wanted to be certain he'd get something for
Marbury, and he signs the checks . . . NBA Operations Czar Rod
Thorn has advised the referees to do what they can to keep games
moving. So far, Thorn said, games are three minutes longer this
year than last, but that's mainly because of additional mandatory
timeouts in the second and fourth quarters. ``We're just urging the
refs to keep the games moving,'' Thorn said. ``Get people out of
the huddle, get players to the line, that sort of thing.'' Thorn
also said he's getting some satisfaction out of seeing the scores
come up. ``It was a pleasant surprise,'' he said. Added Celtics
coach Rick Pitino, ``In the last week, I've noticed that it's
starting to get better. The play is getting much better. The
assists are going up. The shot selection is getting better. Just in
the last week. Prior to that, it was difficult. I think you'll see
it continue to get better, and come the playoffs, you'll have teams
playing their best basketball and be fresh physically, unlike prior
years.''

   The Clippers and Lorenzen Wright talked about doing an extension
prior to the deadline, which would have been a first for that team.
As you may know, the Clipper way is to lose their assets. How close
were they to getting it done? ``Well, I wasn't on the cusp of
history,'' said Wright's agent, Robert Fayne. ``There was a
difference, a significant difference, in value.'' He said the
Clippers were nothing if not consistent, and how they deal with
Wright, he feels, will send a message to the other players; the
Clippers have a slew of free agents, of which Wright is the most
valuable. ``You don't let a guy leave without making a very strong
effort to keep him,'' said Fayne. ``They made an effort. But not a
very strong one.'' Wright, Vin Baker, Joe Smith, and Erick Dampier
will be among the top frontcourt free agents this summer, but money
is tight all around and the opportunities are not all that great
(see Marbury, above). Asked about staying put, Wright said, ``If it
can turn around, I wouldn't mind being here to help. But if the
team is not ready to turn around, I don't want to stick around and
be in the same predicament. I want to win more than anything. We
haven't done too much of that.'' Wright is the top remaining pick
from the Class of '96 (No. 7 overall) who has not signed an
extension . . . The Spurs' turnaround can be traced directly to a
schedule that seems to have been designed by John Thompson. From
March 1 to April 4, the Spurs play 19 times and only five games are
against clubs with winning records. And of the five teams with
winning records, a couple of them, Phoenix and Seattle, are
struggling . . . So, Don Nelson, how is Dirk Nowitzki coming along?
``He's just not ready yet,'' Nellie said of his No. 1 pick, coveted
by Pitino. ``He's just not NBA-ready. We have to be patient with
him. But I like everything he does, his attitude and work ethic are
terrific.'' How about his shooting? ``I didn't think he'd struggle
this much with his shooting,'' Nellie said. ``I thought he'd be
able to shoot regardless. It's just going to take a while. He's not
used to the physicalness and the pace.''

LA IS FAMILIAR BATTLEGROUND FOR DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ While the National Football League continues to search
for some way to put an expansion team in Los Angeles, Al Davis is
plotting how to get paid if it succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has long contended that he still holds the territorial
rights to that market despite having left it to return to Oakland
in 1995, and he is ready to file suit against the league in
California state court to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has always been an iconoclast, so when he voted against
the granting of the league's 32d franchise to Los Angeles last
week, it came as no surprise. Neither, frankly, does his belief
that in the end he and his ``Raidahs'' will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the future of the Raiders is gonna be great,'' said
Davis. ``Where we'll play, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Davis's contention that the city of Oakland has not lived
up to an agreement that guaranteed all the suites and club seats
would be sold at the refurbished Oakland Coliseum. Although he
concedes that such a condition is not in the contract he signed
with the city, Davis contends that, for once, the media is his
ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the representation made to the Raiders and the
community,'' Davis said during his annual State of the Al address
on the final day of the NFL owners meetings. ``That was a lie. It
was a fraudulent inducement (to leave LA).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have that in writing. Not in a contract but in their press
releases and in other places. They've admitted it. I was satisfied
I had a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland city officials deny making such a guarantee, and the
Raiders have seldom sold out on the strength of their product.
Since returning to the site of their greatest glory, they have yet
to have a winning season or reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of on-field success and in-the-stands support has cost
the Raiders in revenue and consequently hindered their ability to
pursue free agents, the same problem Patriots owner Bob Kraft says
drove him to seek a lucrative stadium deal in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe that Davis, a man once viewed as the
Darth Vader of pro football, was hornswoggled by Oakland
politicians or bamboozled by press releases, but time _ and surely
a court somewhere _ will tell about that. Until then, football's
most interesting owner will continue to pursue both the Oakland and
Los Angeles markets in search of what seems to be the most relevant
thing to NFL success today _ skyrocketing stadium income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability is really what we're looking for,'' said Davis, who
once ran the winningest and most stable franchise in football. ``I
have optimism we'll come out all right. I don't worry about
problems. Problems are normal. But I'm in the later years of my
life and I want to get this resolved so we can get this team back
where it belongs. I don't want to stop the league from doing
anything. I just want to preserve the rights I have.''
</P>
<P>
   What Davis seeks is a payment known as ``territorial
enhancement,'' something NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is on
record supporting. The idea is that if an existing team moves into
a more lucrative market and enhances its value, it pays a fee that
is divided among the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   This has been done in the past, such as when the Rams moved to
St. Louis and into one of the best stadium deals in history. It
happened when the Browns left Cleveland for Baltimore, and it is
something Kraft may face if he ever gets his stadium in Hartford
because New York Giants owner Wellington Mara believes the Patriots
are targeting Connecticut's Gold Coast for corporate sponsors,
territory the Giants now have a monopoly on.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, is seeking a unique double dip, claiming he
should be paid if he allows someone to move into ``his'' territory
in LA while also seeking a ``disenhancement'' payment for moving to
Oakland, a less lucrative market that he believes has reduced the
value of the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the law of the land,'' Davis contended.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to argue that in 1995 he had a chance to build a new
stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif., but allegedly was
undercut by the league's threat that the new venue would not
receive a Super Bowl that local politicians felt was necessary to
back the deal unless a second team were allowed to move in.
</P>
<P>
   The league denies Davis's accusations, but Davis insisted, ``We
finally acquiesced but asked for a three-year delay so we could get
started. They said no. At every avenue, the league put onerous
terms on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when discussion of LA's bid for an expansion team began
last week, Davis asked at a closed-door session whether the league
planned to put a second team in the new stadium it will help
finance. No one answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only team that's played at the (Los Angeles)
Coliseum for 17 years,'' Davis said of the aging stadium one LA
group wants to refurbish. ``LA has very carefully played to the
court system. They've been pretty cunning. I don't want to stop
them from doing anything. I just want the Raiders to be paid for
the Los Angeles opportunity (Davis would be giving up) and the
disenhancement in Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Davis is right (and he usually is in these matters once
the NFL's spinmeisters end up on a witness stand), why, when he
will soon be 70, does he continue to fight the league he's been a
part of for nearly 30 years? There are many reasons, some personal
and some professional, but in the end it all comes back to football
and what Al Davis has always been about _ finding a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the worst quartile of the teams and the
top quartile in the NFL is between $30 million-$50 million in
revenue,'' Davis said. ``In some cases, it's $50 million in income.
I don't care how bright you are, you can't compete against that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, it's about the money, as always. Davis no more
wants to return to LA than he wanted to leave in the first place.
What he wants is a place where he can win again. And that means a
place with a fat stadium deal and big stadium revenue. That place
could be Omaha and Davis would take the Raiders there if it led him
back to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has lived a gypsy life _ I don't mean to imply the
gypsy life isn't great, by the way _ for 20 years,'' Davis said.
``My preference is for Oakland to live up to its commitments and
for my team to be where it can function best.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, that's been in the courtroom, not on the field.
If that proves true one more time, just maybe Al Davis will finally
get his silver and black back on the attack on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After winning the coaches' golf tournament Monday, Oakland's Jon
Gruden lifted his putter over his head and joked, ``And with this
victory the Raiders secured the rights to Los Angeles.'' . . .
Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who is cochairman of the
Expansion Committee, speculated that there may be more than the
present two groups seeking to buy the provisional LA franchise
after the stadium issue is resolved. ``I'd personally be surprised
if other people don't surface,'' Richardson said. One possible
suitor who could challenge the New Coliseum Partners group and the
one headed by Hollywood mogul Michael Eisner is Eisner's old boss,
the Disney Co. . . . George Seifert, the 59-year-old new coach of
the Panthers, called the NFC West ``the geriatric's division,'' a
reference to 62-year-old Dick Vermeil (St. Louis), 59-year-old Mike
Ditka (New Orleans), and 55-year-old Dan Reeves (Atlanta). Two of
the four have survived heart surgery and three have already retired
once. Only 43-year-old 49ers coach Steve Mariucci fits the present
youth movement, but he laughed at Seifert's position, saying,
``They've all been to the Super Bowl, too.'' He, of course, has not
. . . Seifert will use multimillion-dollar disappointment Sean
Gilbert as a traditional defensive tackle in 4-3 fronts, and even
when he's over a tackle in the 3-4 he will not be an outside pass
rusher. Gilbert has proven less than adept at rushing from the
outside . . . Reeves issued a cautionary draft note that both the
Patriots and Dolphins can appreciate. ``You've got to be careful
taking a wide receiver on the first round,'' Reeves said when asked
if he would consider one after releasing troubled Tony Martin. ``It
seems more and more you can get better players at that position
later in the draft.'' New England continues to hope former No. 1
pick Terry Glenn will return to his form of three years ago when he
was a rookie sensation with 90 catches. He has been plagued by
injuries, and the same applies in Miami, where Jimmy Johnson took
Yatil Green No. 1 two years ago and has yet to see him play a down
because of severe knee injuries. ``The doctors say he'll be ready
to go, but for two years in a row I counted on Yatil and bypassed
other receivers,'' Johnson said. ``I'll not take that approach this
year. My approach is not to pencil Yatil in as a starter.'' . . . A
year ago, Johnson strongly endorsed the Patriots as the favorite to
win the division. Not so this year. ``They've had a pretty good
run,'' said Johnson, ``and when you've had that success and go
through a bunch of injuries like they had, you're not quite the
elite team you were anymore. Sometimes you're not going to have
that same drive.'' Johnson still believes the AFC East is the most
competitive division in football. ``Most anybody in football who's
objective and looks at the AFC East will think it's the strongest
division in football,'' Johnson said. ``We have some of the premier
people in the league on the field and on the sidelines.'' A year
ago, Patriots coach Pete Carroll was lamenting the difficulty his
team faced because of the high expectations thrust upon it. When
told he has no such problem this year, Carroll said, ``It would be
better if they were still there. I don't think it's a reflection on
us. It's the emergence of the other clubs, like the Jets, that got
a whole lot better. Our expectations stay the same. The
expectations of the media may have changed.'' Apparently so have
the expectations of his AFC East rivals, because everyone picked
the Jets as the leaders in the clubhouse . . . The consensus in New
England may be that Glenn remains the key to their offense, but
Johnson disagrees. ``That would be putting more on Terry Glenn than
he deserves,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of players influence the
Patriots along with Terry Glenn. But Drew Bledsoe is the key guy.''
. . . Colts coach Jim Mora was irate last winter when Ryan Leaf did
not show for a scheduled meeting at the scouting combine in
Indianapolis and never called to say why. Leaf later said he had a
physical scheduled at the same time. Considering the problems with
immaturity Leaf struggled with all last season in San Diego, Mora
now says his choice of Peyton Manning was right all along. ``I got
blasted by (agent Leigh) Steinberg and Leaf for saying I was upset,
but it was a copout what he said for an excuse,'' Mora said. ``He
was right across the hall. All he had to say was, `I can't make
it.' Peyton came in with his notepad and pencil asking us questions
like who we had on the offensive line and who was going to protect
him. We evaluated Leaf as close as Peyton and we didn't get strong
vibes he'd be the way he was. It surprised me he self-destructed,
but I crossed myself many times last season. But he's still a
talent. If he matures he'll be a good player. But that's a big
question.'' It's a question Steinberg insists is being addressed.
``He's wholly cognizant of what went wrong, and it won't happen
again,'' Steinberg said. ``He got a real education on the demands
on an NFL quarterback and the need to be cordial and cooperative in
all situations. I think he'll do better and better.'' He couldn't
do worse, that's for sure . . . Word is the Eagles are fascinated
by Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb and may pass on Heisman
Trophy winner Ricky Williams to take McNabb with the draft's second
pick. If they do, Williams would likely slide further because
Cincinnati is likely to take Oregon quarterback Akili Smith with
the third selection if he isn't already gone.

CORRUPTION IS DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Eugenia Williams very probably didn't take a penny to
conclude that Evander Holyfield defeated Lennox Lewis last weekend
even though she did file for bankruptcy protection six weeks ago.
She quite simply may have known the sad story of a referee named
Octavio Meyran.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, 1990, Meyran was the third man in the ring in Tokyo
when Buster Douglas knocked Mike Tyson cold, winning the undisputed
heavyweight title despite being a 42-1 underdog. Only hours after
that upset, promoter Don King tried to steal the fight for Tyson
with the assistance of boxing's three crime families _ the World
Boxing Council, World Boxing Association, and International Boxing
Federation _ but King had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   King claimed Douglas had actually been knocked out earlier but
was saved by Meyran's ``slow count.'' He protested loudly and WBC
president Jose Sulaiman, who had named Meyran the referee, promised
this injustice would be rectified. Problem was, Meyran didn't go
along with the fiction.
</P>
<P>
   An honorable man in a den of snakes, Meyran loudly proclaimed
his innocence to a half-dozen American journalists who had traveled
to Tokyo expecting to get off work in time to get sushi before bed
and ended up filing for overtime and not eating until breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Meyran explained over and over during the long hours immediately
after the fight how he had picked up the count from the timekeeper
and that Douglas had arisen at the count of nine, clear-eyed and
ready to fight. Douglas had stared right at Meyran, listening to
the only thing that matters in a boxing ring _ the referee's count.
</P>
<P>
   Not once did Meyran waver, as British judge Larry O'Connell did
this past week after he returned to London amid a sea of
controversy and lamely declared that he now thought his decision to
call the Lewis-Holyfield fight a draw was in error. Meyran refused
to play that kind of game, and because of it, Sulaiman was forced
to back off, especially when tape of that fight backed Meyran's
count.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Meyran worked one more title fight that year, a World Boxing
Organization flyweight bout in Acapulco on Nov. 3, 1990. There were
1,243 world title fights from then through 1997, the last year full
records are available. Octavio Meyran did not referee a single one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 200 world title fights last year. He isn't
known to have worked one of those, either. He was not hit by a bus
or run over by a freight train. Octavio Meyran, a good referee in
an often bad sport, simply disappeared from the boxing scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a well-used world referee,'' said Mills Lane, one of
boxing's most respected figures. ``He refused to back down, and I
never heard of him doing another major fight. You can't tell me
people don't know those things are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's done in boxing today. That's how the three
monogrammed crime families and the promoters they support so often
seem to get what they want, even when all evidence might argue for
another result. They don't pay anybody off because they don't have
to. They just make sure the phone doesn't ring again at Octavio
Meyran's house.
</P>
<P>
   To have so much power concentrated in so few slimy hands is
corrupting, but boxing has done it that way for a long time, and it
has created a system ripe for manipulation and chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   As Lane explained, ``If you're at the mercy of the sanctioning
bodies for work and you like to travel but you live in Switzerland
and don't get to travel much and you're in San Antonio because the
WBC sent you there to do Julio Cesar Chavez against Pernell
Whitaker and you know Sulaiman is close to Chavez and the promoter
(King) is paying your expenses and he's close to Chavez, when the
round is close who do you go to?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the subtle pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arizona Sen. John McCain wrote in a letter to New York State
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer four days after Lewis-Holyfield:
``Professional boxing's problem with controversial fight results is
not that experienced and objective judges sometimes reach
surprising or unpopular decisions. The very nature of the boxing
industry gives rise to conflicts of interest and fraudulent
practices in the arranging and conduct of boxing events. This is a
point I hope federal and state officials across the US will reflect
upon in the wake of this controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, Lewis won the unification fight with Holyfield
and deserves to hold all three belts, but he won them by a slight
margin not a wide one, even though the opportunity to do the latter
was there had he chosen to press his advantage. He did not,
however, and so a fight that was 6-1 after seven rounds suddenly
became close on the scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   Had anyone but King been promoting the fight, there probably
would have been far less controversy. Williams would have been
dismissed as incompetent, which she was on that night at least, and
most everyone would have moved on. But the systemic problems in
boxing lead to the kind of suspicions that have swirled around the
Holyfield-Lewis outcome and spawned four investigations in New York
that will most likely conclude that Williams didn't know what she
was looking at.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone thinks they're going to find bribery trails they can
forget it; the system makes out-and-out bribes unnecessary.
Williams earns about $30,000 as a municipal accounting clerk in
Atlantic City. Six weeks ago, she filed for bankruptcy protection,
owing nearly three times as much as she earns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in recent years the IBF has assigned her to judge bouts in a
half-dozen countries, including two trips to South Africa, as well
as the United States, at the expense of promoters like King. That's
because in boxing, the judges' fees and expenses are not paid by
the organizations that appoint them but by the fight's promoter,
which is like Bob Kraft paying the officials when the Patriots play
in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   It is an absurd system on the face of it let alone behind the
scenes, where promoters have been seen with a table full of judges
at a fancy restaurant in the nights before a fight.
</P>
<P>
   What other sport would not think twice about having a promoter
pay the judges of his matches? What other sport would let anyone
off the street walk into a gym and call himself a trainer? What
other sport would have no understandable way to rank its
participants and no way to prevent the obvious manipulation of
those ratings?
</P>
<P>
   What other sport has anything like boxing's alphabetized crime
families deciding on the officials in the biggest events? And what
would you expect but trouble from a system in which being in the
good graces of one of the organizations is the only way to get
assigned as a judge or referee in a big fight?
</P>
<P>
   When somone in power, such as the guy who appointed Williams and
later defended her, IBF president Bob Lee, says, ``I looked at it
as no harm, no foul,'' it makes you wonder even further.
</P>
<P>
   The point is: Don't bother looking for bribery and influence
peddling at ringside. That is not necessary. A judge like Williams
doesn't have to be told how expendable she is; all she has to know
is what can happen to an honest guy like Meyran.
</P>
<P>
   We have ratings that everyone in the sport knows are so corrupt
and absurd they defy any form of logical analysis. King is not
alone at this, only the best at it.
</P>
<P>
   It does little good to condemn any one person or organization in
boxing. The big question is, how can this system be reformed?
</P>
<P>
   Good first steps would be to change the way officials are chosen
and paid. Give the responsibility to the state or country in which
the fight is being held. If there are not enough competent
officials in a particular state, or if neutral judges are called
for, have an international pool of judges and referees ready and
willing to be rotated to eliminate any hint of favoritism
regardless of which organization is sanctioning the show.
</P>
<P>
   Would this clean up the red light district of sports? Not by a
long shot, but it's a start. And that's what boxing needs right now
_ a new start. Before it finishes itself off.
</P>
<P>

   The fistic marriage of IBF welterweight champion Felix Trinidad
and WBC titleholder Oscar De La Hoya continues in May when they
will appear on back-to-back HBO shows. De La Hoya will defend his
title against Oba Carr May 22 at the new Mandalay Bay Casino in Las
Vegas. A week later, Trinidad will defend his title against No. 1
challenger Vincent Pettway at Roberto Clemente Stadium in his
native San Juan. Negotiations are ongoing for a De La Hoya-Trinidad
unification match this fall, and the potential deal was helped
considerably by the pay-per-view success of Holyfield-Lewis.
Promoter Bob Arum and HBO executives closely watched how
Lewis-Holyfield sold, believing the closer it got to 1 million buys
the more likely it was that De La Hoya-Trinidad could be made. No
one believes a non-heavyweight fight can exceed Lewis-Holyfield, so
it effectively became the ceiling for De La Hoya-Trinidad's sales
potential. Holyfield-Lewis did 1.2 million buys . . . Hot
heavyweight contender Michael Grant gets another test June 19 at
Madison Square Garden when he takes on strapping Lou Savarese.
Andrew Golota may be a co-feature but only if his manager, Lou
Duva, agrees to a more formidable opponent than he has yet
mentioned. Originally, HBO hoped to match Grant with Shannon
Briggs, but Briggs's management turned down a $750,000 purse while
Savarese asked for the Grant fight . . . Vinny Pazienza returns to
the ring wars April 9 at Foxwoods vs. Joseph Kiwanuka. Pazienza
(44-7) continues to search for a title shot in the super
middleweight division. Kiwanuka is 26-3-2 with 19 KOs and is coming
off a win over Glen Johnson last August . . . Hartford heavyweight
Lawrence Clay-Bey plans to get back into the ring in June after a
bone graft to fix a broken finger . . . Hall of Fame middleweight
champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler will attend the International
Boxing Hall of Fame ceremonies June 10-13 in Canastota, N.Y. For
information on the event, call 315-697-7095 . . . Don't be
surprised to see Ike Quartey abandon the welterweight division soon
and move up to challenge young super welterweight champion Fernando
Vargas if he can't get back into the De La Hoya rematch mix . . .
James Toney recently returned to the ring in Phoenix with a win. He
had not fought since June 14, 1997.

BAFFERT TURNS TO `TIMBER' 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Kentucky Derby picture has changed dramatically,
starting last Saturday when winter book favorite Exploit ran second
in the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita, his first defeat. On
Wednesday, it was announced that Exploit had chipped his left front
knee and would be retired.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber caught Exploit, who was 3-5, inside the 16th-pole
in the San Felipe and drew away. The next thing anyone knew,
Exploit, who is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of Silver
Charm, was off to the breeding shed. The loss was a blow to trainer
Bob Baffert, but he also trains Prime Timber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had surgery performed to remove the chip, but we
decided the horse was worth too much as a stallion prospect,'' said
Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   The injury will be allowed to heal naturally and a decision on
where to stand the son of Storm Cat will be made later.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit was favored at 6-1 after the first round of advance
betting sponsored by Churchill Downs. He went up to 14-1 as the
second round closed last Sunday, following his defeat. As is the
case with advance wagers, all bets on Exploit were lost because he
will not start.
</P>
<P>
   So Prime Timber, a son of Sultry Song, picks up the fallen flag
for Team Baffert. Owned by Aaron and Marie Jones, Prime Timber has
won three of five starts and been second in the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty comfortable race,'' said David Flores, who
rode Prime Timber in the San Felipe. ``I was patient until the last
turn, then I asked him to pick it up a little bit, and it took a
while for him to do it. But once he changed leads, he really took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Prime Timber is the Santa Anita Derby April 3.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another top Baffert 3-year-old, General Challenge, also tasted
his first defeat last weekend, finishing fifth in the Louisiana
Derby at Fair Grounds. General Challenge, who was off at 4-5, had
an excuse as he lunged at the break and trailed the field early. He
made a big run into contention at the top of the stretch but tired
badly. The race was won by 22-1 shot Kimberlite Pipe, with Answer
Lively, last year's 2-year-old champion, second. ``When you get
left like that in a race like this, it leaves a lot to do,'' said
Gary Stevens, who rode General Challenge. ``He just got tired. He
needs some experience.'' . . . Meanwhile, Baffert's fine 3-year-old
fillies just kept rolling along. Silverbulletday ran her record to
9-8-0-0 with a tally over a sloppy track in the Fair Grounds Oaks
Saturday, while Excellent Meeting took the Santa Anita Oaks Sunday
and now stands at 10-6-3-1. Silverbulletday, the 2-year-old filly
champion of 1998, won by 3 lengths under Stevens at 3-10. ``She
wasn't really relishing the off track, but she got the job done,''
said Stevens. ``I just wanted to keep her out of trouble and give
her a chance to win.'' Excellent Meeting prevailed by a neck over
Tout Charmant, another Baffert charge. Ridden by Kent Desormeaux,
Excellent Meeting was off at 1-10 and created a minus show pool of
nearly $120,000. She took the lead down the backstretch and lasted
at the wire. ``I put her in the position I put her in because she
was much the best, and she got her picture taken,'' said
Desormeaux. So far, Baffert has insisted his top fillies will race
in the Kentucky Oaks, but either one would be competitive in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is still a long way to go, but there is a chance that
Plainridge Racecourse will be an attractive little track. The
future home of harness racing in Massachusetts (live racing begins
April 19) is small, with a capacity of 2,800 and 1,680 seats, but
the decor in the five rooms will be modeled after the Mohegan Sun
casino, which is very nicely appointed. The racing surface will be
patterned after Rosecroft Raceway in Maryland, considered one of
the best in the business. At 83 feet, the track will be wide enough
to start nine horses across. The turns will have a high bank,
allowing a slingshot move into the stretch by closers. There will
be neither a tote board nor lights in the infield. Management
readily admits those items were omitted to save money, but it also
could be aesthetically pleasing, as the only thing in an infield
that faces a tree-lined backstretch will be a 2 1/2-acre manmade
lake. Plainridge officials have no interest in racing at night and
figure the bettors now watch the odds on TV screens, anyway. The
third room on the second floor could hold more than 450 slot
machines. If slots come to Bay State tracks, the only problem
Plainridge would have is that its 1,000 parking spaces wouldn't be
enough . . . The 2000 Breeders' Cup will not be held at Santa Anita
as expected. Frank Stronach recently purchased the Arcadia, Calif.,
track, and he announced that the facility will be undergoing
renovations at Breeders' Cup time next year. Churchill Downs, which
hosted last year, is eager to step in again, and is the most likely
site. This year's Breeders' Cup will be at Gulfstream Park Nov. 6,
and Belmont Park is considered the front-runner for 2001 . . . Real
Quiet, last year's Kentucky Derby winner and 3-year-old champion
colt, will race next in the $750,000 Oaklawn Handicap April 3.
Trained by Baffert, Real Quiet was second in the New Orleans
Handicap March 14, his 1999 debut . . . Puerto Madero, who will be
held out of the Dubai Breeders' Cup after suffering a filling in
his ankle while finishing fifth in the Santa Anita Handicap March
6, will be pointed for the California Handicap at Hollywood May 29.

BRASWELL A CANDIDATE AT WASHINGTON STATE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge head men's basketball coach Bobby Braswell
confirmed Saturday he is a candidate for the head job at Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell met with Washington State athletic director Rick
Dickson on Thursday about the opening created when Kevin Eastman
resigned on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, definitely,'' Braswell responded when asked if he was a
candidate. ``I'm listening. I was contacted by (Dickson) . . .
that's all I can really say.''
</P>
<P>
   Braswell just finished his third season at CSUN and led the
Matadors to a 17-12 record. It was the first winning record
produced by the Matadors under Braswell, who is 43-43 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell came to CSUN, his alma mater, in 1996. He was
previously an assistant at Oregon and Long Beach State and head
coach at Cleveland High in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell was named as a candidate for the job Friday by the
Spokane Spokesman-Review, along with Oregon assistant Don Newman,
Kentucky assistant George Felton and Utah assistant Donny Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a former head coach at Arizona State, appears to be the
front-runner, but Braswell and Daniels are both attractive
candidates. Daniels has been at Utah for nine years and is the
Utes' lead recruiter.

BALLESTEROS, PALMER NEVER STOP TRYING 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ They could have been shots from another era _
Arnold Palmer putting his classic charge into a 35-foot putt for
birdie, Seve Ballesteros magically lifting a bunker shot from an
awkward downhill lie to within 2 feet of the pin _ but
unfortunately there is no pause button in life. Not even for golf
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were merely footnotes to rounds put together by a
couple of proud gentlemen Friday morning in the Bay Hill
Invitational. It was cut day and, not surprisingly, both Palmer
(78-74) and Ballesteros (76-76) were on the wrong side of it. They
were joined in their threesome by Robert Friend, who finished 57th
on the money list last year but is perhaps better known for being
the son of former major league relief ace Bob Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Friend shot 73-71 to make it into weekend play. Palmer returned
to his office above the Bay Hill pro shop, from where he runs this
event, not to mention a golf empire. Ballesteros, meanwhile, left
quietly, headed toward the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Ballesteros will be inducted Monday in festivities at the World
Golf Village in St. Augustine, Fla. The Hall of Fame has opened its
doors to Ballesteros not for what he now does, which is struggle
mightily with this game; it has welcomed him because of what he
once did, which was play the game with a brilliant passion and
dashing skill that few could match. He was Houdini with a golf
club, whether his ball came to rest among trees, in a deep-faced
pot bunker, or in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But with his 42d birthday a few weeks away, Ballesteros's only
magic act has been making his game disappear. Despite the snickers
of many, the three-time British Open champ and two-time Masters
winner is determined to rediscover it.
</P>
<P>
   For three days leading up to Bay Hill, Ballesteros virtually
lived on the practice range. In his quest to recapture the faded
skills, the proud Spaniard has turned to Butch Harmon and even the
zany Mac O'Grady. Now it is Robert Baker's turn. The hot name in
coaching circles is best known as Ernie Els's instructor but it was
at Seve's side that Baker spent several days this past week.
</P>
<P>
   It made for quite a spectacle. There was Baker, and his top
assistant holding a video camera; Greg Kraft and Tom Pernice Jr.,
also Baker guys, offered their suggestions; Vijay Singh took time
out from his 2,500 buckets of balls to contribute his thoughts. And
all the while Ballesteros listened and hit, stopped to study his
swing, then hit and hit and hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Lord never gives good golfers everything,'' said Lee
Trevino, who was 130 miles away, playing in the Legends of Golf.
``He never gave (Jack) Nicklaus a wedge. He never gave me long
irons. He just doesn't give you everything. He always keeps
something from you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept nothing from Seve. Seve was pretty well-rounded when
it came to playing golf. Gave him a terrific temper, though. He
gave him killer instinct, but too much killer instinct, because
when Seve didn't win, he didn't know how to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't accept it easily, which is why he has plans to
play in next week's TPC. Perhaps he is looking for something that
is gone forever, but even if that is true, he once had something
that few have ever possessed. He deserves respect, not ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, Palmer, who was asked if this would mark his last time
playing in his own tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given it any thought,'' he said. ``Should I?''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer flashed a sly grin as he said this, but the reporter
didn't have to answer because a large crowd did the honors by
swarming to him, six and seven people deep.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Palmer, Michael Jordan, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
and singer Amy Grant. The question: Who were those people playing
with Pat Rooney in the Tuesday pro-am at Bay Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Only kidding, of course. Even though he is the CEO of Cooper
Tires, which presented this PGA Tour stop, there is little doubt
that only his closest friends knew Rooney was even in the group.
One could argue, too, that Palmer, Ridge, and Grant, despite their
celebrity stature, were invisible, too. That is how much star power
Jordan has.
</P>
<P>
   Though his appearance had been publicized for only a few days,
thousands turned out to watch the basketball player-turned-golf
nut, and tournament officials and volunteers were pressed into
serious work manning the ropes and keeping people back. All this
for a pro-am. Heck, there were barely a couple of dozen people
following the Tiger Woods group earlier that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Makes you wonder about the possible dynamics if Jordan pays a
visit to the Ryder Cup matches in September at The Country Club.
Several sources said they had heard that Jordan will indeed take in
the event, not surprising given the fact that he went all the way
to Spain for two hours of one day's matches in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, crowd control for a Jordan appearance at the Ryder
Cup is less of a factor since tickets can't be purchased at the
gate as they were Tuesday at Bay Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And celebrities are nothing new to the Ryder Cup, which has been
elevated recently to must-attend status. Don't be surprised if
Prince Andrew (who has played The Country Club) pays a visit in
September, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson leaned against a car in the Bay Hill parking lot,
signed autographs for two fans, then was left alone in his
thoughts. They couldn't have been pleasant. The soon-to-be
50-year-old Watson had shot a second-round 77, on top of an opening
80 that left him dead last in the field of 112. Incredibly, he had
gone 8-9 on the 543-yard, par-5 sixth, a dogleg left around water
that the field had roughed up to a 4.884 average, fourth easiest.
In a twist of irony, Watson was paired with John Daly last year
when Daly hit drive after drive into that pond before settling for
an 18. Watson is off to a rough start in 1999, having broken 70
just twice in 13 rounds, and since his victory at the Colonial
MasterCard last May, he has struggled. He will be in Augusta in
three weeks, trying to stop a slide of five straight missed cuts in
majors . . . Heartache at Bay Hill's 18th, Parts I and II: Stuart
Appleby was 1 over, figuring he needed a par to make the cut. He
hit his approach into rocks bordering a large pond and was forced
to take an unplayable. Thinking he needed to hole his chip, he was
too strong, and when he missed the 6-foot comebacker, he had made a
double to finish 3 over. Minutes later, Mark Calcavecchia, also 1
over, bounced his approach off the rocks into the water. He, too,
made a double and finished at 147. Later, they learned that the cut
was 2-over 146 . . . The march to Augusta is on, and for many Bay
Hill _ not Doral _ is the new springboard. Virtually every big name
was in this week's field, save for David Duval, Nick Price, Greg
Norman, Steve Elkington, and Jesper Parnevik. Duval prefers to play
no more than three weeks in a row, which means next week's TPC,
followed by BellSouth, then the Masters. The defending champion at
BellSouth, Woods, will not be in this year's field but before you
fire off your criticism, understand that he announced this a year
ago. His reason is acceptable: The BellSouth was moved to the week
before the Masters and Woods, like many others, prefers not to play
leading up to a major . . . The fields for the next four weeks (the
MCI Classic follows the Masters) should be superb, but look for the
Greater Greensboro Classic and the Houston Open to take big hits .
. . Mark O'Meara and Woods will be in Europe for a tournament
opposite Houston . . . O'Meara was asked about his passion for
skiing and said he was not fearful of an injury as much as he was
bothered by people telling him he shouldn't ski. On a recent
vacation, O'Meara skied with Phil Mickelson, who had shattered his
leg in a mishap on the slopes a few years ago. ``Phil is an
aggressive individual,'' said O'Meara. ``I mean, he skis like he
hits his flop shots off a tight lie, so he kind of lives on the
edge.'' . . . Pat Bradley, the pride of Westford, Mass., was named
captain of the US Solheim Cup team that will defend its title in
2000. Bradley played on three Solheim Cup teams.

   BOSTON _ Bobby Rahal has parked it. Two-time defending champion
Alex Zanardi has bolted to Formula One. And Roger Penske's
sputtering outfit has been pared to a one-car operation. Those are
some of the significant changes the CART FedEx Championship series
will face when the 20-race series kicks off its 1999 season with
Sunday's Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami at the 1.5-mile
Homestead-Metro Dade Motorsports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   While Rahal's retirement and Zanardi's defection have depleted
the series, Michael Andretti, a two-time champion at Miami, Jimmy
Vasser, Paul Tracy, and Al Unser Jr. will return as its marquee
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Team Kool Green driver Dario Franchitti, a 25-year-old from
Scotland, is widely regarded as the man to beat. Franchitti
finished third in the series last year, recording five poles and
his first three career victories, at Road America, Vancouver, and
Houston. He will be challenged by at least eight others for the PPG
Cup, which for the last three seasons has been the exclusive
property of the Target/Chip Ganassi Racing outfit.

   ``One thing I learned last year is that you have to be
consistent over the course of the season,'' Franchitti said. ``It's
a balancing act between being aggressive and using your head. I'm
just happy to be considered a championship possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, who won the series championship in 1996, will attempt to
deliver Target/Ganassi its fourth consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's built-in pressure just to perform at the highest level
that you can, to keep your team and your sponsors happy, and to
keep your job,'' said Vasser, who will be paired with rookie Juan
Pablo Montoya after losing Zanardi as a teammate. ``So there's not
really any more pressure because there is a fourth championship
possible for our team. I think we may have a shot at it, but it's
just going to take a little while for the whole scenario to
unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years, Rahal will no longer be behind the wheel. He
retired as driver last November, his seat to be filled by Max
Papis, and will head into the season as a full-time owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to feel quite yet,'' said the
three-time CART champion. ``I've been looking at it like it's still
my car, but Max is driving. At spring training, it felt a little
weird not wearing a driver's suit. And people kept telling me I was
out of uniform. Obviously, it's a strange sight seeing a different
helmet in the Miller Lite car. But I'm prepared for this change.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes include Team Penske's decision to scale back to a
one-car operation. With Brazilian teammate Andre Ribeiro no longer
in the picture, Unser Jr. will be the focus of Team Penske's
resources and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a one-car effort will be good for us,'' said Penske,
whose drivers last year struggled to compete while ironing out the
wrinkles of the new Mercedes power plant. ``It gives us a chance to
refocus our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very desperate,'' said Unser. ``We're needing a win very
bad. For Roger, for Marlboro, for everybody. The crew guys haven't
won in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser Jr., who has not visited Victory Lane since September
1995, finished 11th in last year's PPG Cup standings with 72
points; Ribeiro was 22d with a mere 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'm like in heaven,'' said Unser. ``All of Penske's
organization is geared to make Al Jr. go fast and win races. I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another change is Andretti's decision to switch to
Firestone tires, ending a long association with Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been great to be associated with Goodyear over the
years,'' said Andretti, who will attempt to become a three-peat
winner in Miami. ``They helped me become the winningest active
driver in CART (with 37 victories), and for that I will always be
thankful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodyear is a first-class organization, but, as a team, we
have a responsibility to our sponsors and we feel that Firestone
will help us meet those expectations.''
</P>

   Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, already the winner of four
consecutive Southern 500s, will attempt to add to his glittering
record at Darlington Raceway when he starts Sunday's TranSouth 400
from the pole position, which he earned with a fast lap of 173.167
miles per hour during Busch Pole qualifications Friday at the
1.366-mile oval. Dale Jarrett hurt his chances to tie David
Pearson's record of three consecutive victories in the Darlington
spring race when he qualified a disappointing 21st. Johnny Benson
won the outside pole in his Ford Taurus with a surprising lap of
172.541 m.p.h. . . . Bobby Labonte, who is 32 points behind Winston
Cup leader Mike Skinner, was dealt a huge setback Friday when he
broke his right shoulder in a crash as he practiced for the Diamond
Hill 200 Busch Grand National Series event at Darlington . . .
Skinner caught a huge break last Wednesday when his Busch Grand
National team won its appeal to have his victory and points
reinstated from the Yellow Freight 300 March 13 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. NASCAR officials had disallowed the win when inspectors
found illegal cylinder heads on Skinner's Chevrolet. An independent
appeals commission did, however, levy a $19,000 fine, the largest
in NASCAR Busch Series history . . . After failing to get their car
into the Daytona 500, Mike Herbert, 43, of Winchester and his
partner, Dewey Parsons of Medfield, will make another go of it on
the Winston Cup circuit next week. The owners of Norwood-based
Panther Brewing Co., maker of Three Stooges Beer, will sponsor a
car in the CBS-televised Primestar 500 at Texas Motor Speedway.
Driver Ken Bouchard will carry the Three Stooges Beer logo on the
No. 84 Chevrolet Monte Carlo fielded by Petty Huggins Motorsports.
``For the product we're trying to market, it's the best bang for
your buck,'' said Herbert . . . In honor of Sunday night's Oscars,
here are our nominations for the top three racing movies, followed
by three we wish were never made. Checkered Flag: 1. ``LeMans.''
Steve McQueen would've made Dale Earnhardt wet his pants. 2.
``Winning.'' Paul Newman as the quintessential Indy 500 winner. 3
``Heart Like a Wheel.'' Bonnie Bedelia in the inspirational
true-life story of top fuel drag racer Shirley Muldowney. Wipeouts:
1. ``Stroker Ace.'' Burt Reynolds does NASCAR no favors in this
celluloid canine. 2. ``Days of Thunder.'' Ditto for Tom Cruise. 3.
``Six Pack.'' Kenny Rogers stars as a down-on-his-luck driver who
employs a brood of runaways as his pit crew.

BURN BLANKS REVAMPED WIZARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On a night when the opponent had the big-name players
with the skills to take the spotlight, two of the Dallas Burn's
stars stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Wizards boasted a revitalized squad that
included the likes of holdover Yugoslavian star Preki, U.S.
national team defender Alexi Lalas and goalkeeper Tony Meola, who
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   But Burn forwards Jason Kreis and Mickey Trotman instead
thrilled Burn fans with an impressive season-opening debut. Kreis
notched a hat trick and an assist and Trotman added a goal and an
assist to lead the Burn to a 4-0 victory last night at the Cotton
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I was fortunate,'' said Kreis, who has
eight goals and three assists all-time against Kansas City. ``A lot
of those shots were easier to make than they were to miss. I was
certainly happy with it, but it wasn't something I expected and it
won't be something that I'll expect every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the game, the Burn faithful _ the 17,112 fans, the
largest home crowd since 1996 _ might expect to see some compelling
soccer this season, if Dallas can stay healthy. Despite some
expected first-game slip-ups and several starters out with
injuries, the Burn played a controlled, pressing game that resulted
in a franchise-record four second-half goals.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Kansas City was without Meola. Rookie goalie Cesar
Delgado, who was signed in January as a discovery player, took the
net and showed his inexperience. But Dallas' goals still
demonstrated offensive hustle.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman scored the Burn's first goal in the 53rd minute, as he
and Kreis maneuvered through three Wizards players. Off a touch
from Kreis, Trotman fended off defender Sean Bowers before firing
the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Trotman headed a ball to Kreis, who one-timed
a low shot past Delgado for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas effectively shut down Kansas City's offense for most of
the second half, holding the Wizards to only two shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Preki got the most action through his array of creative passes.
But during a bizarre moment in the second half, a seemingly
intoxicated fan ran on to the field and up to Preki near midfield,
throwing confetti at him and widely waving his arms. Players from
both teams surrounded the fan before security guards escorted him
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Burn players provided the excitement. Kreis
notched an 80th-minute unassisted goal after a slip-up by Delgado.
On his final goal four minutes later, Kreis slipped the ball
through Delgado's legs after a brilliant crossover assist through
two Wizards defenders from Oscar Pareja.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no clue what to expect coming into the season,'' Burn
coach Dave Dir said. ``But we know it's just one game. It was a
great crowd, and to get them out and show them what we can do was
the most important thing. I don't want to get too excited with one
game.''

RANGERS WORRIED ABOUT WETTELAND'S HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers' concern about closer John
Wetteland's health reached such gloomy depths yesterday that
manager Johnny Oates canceled the right-hander's workouts until
Wednesday and discussed an alternative for Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, whose progress this spring suffered since a Feb. 22
ankle injury, has incurred further misfortune by experiencing
muscle spasms in his lower back. The All-Star closer will continue
his rehabilitation and be evaluated tomorrow by Dr. John Conway and
again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Oates told Wetteland yesterday morning that he was holding him
out of action until midweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not go onto the field today,'' Oates said after the
Rangers' 5-4 victory against the Cincinnati Reds at Charlotte
County Stadium. ``John is not feeling that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' original plan called for Wetteland to pitch either
yesterday or during today's game against the Reds in Sarasota, Fla.
The spasms prevented that, and it remains unclear whether this
latest affliction stems from his injured right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I've got, I've got,'' Wetteland said. ``All you can
do is go on and move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland questioned whether he could recapture the form of a
dominant closer by Opening Day after getting hit hard in his
one-inning appearance Thursday against the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who admits experiencing pain in the ankle, cannot
spot his fastball with consistency. The injury prevents him from
driving his body toward the plate during his delivery from the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Wetteland surrendered 12 runs (11 earned) on 12 hits
_ which included two home runs _ during his two previous one-inning
appearances. Furthermore, the hard-throwing right-hander failed to
record a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get him where he can push off that ankle,'' Oates
said. ``How? I don't know right now. When? I don't know that right
now, either.''
</P>
<P>
   That forces Oates to consider an alternative to Wetteland should
a save opportunity present itself Opening Day against the Detroit
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be a pessimist,'' Oates said. ``I don't want
to be overly optimistic. I'd like to be a realist. We're going to
have to face reality. Is he getting better?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would enter the season with a closer-by-committee
likely composed of right-handers Tim Crabtree and Danny Patterson
and left-hander Eric Gunderson should Wetteland be unavailable,
Oates said. The manager would attempt to orchestrate as many
favorable situational matchups for those three relievers to
preserve late-inning leads.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, Patterson and Gunderson have combined to convert only
eight of 33 save opportunities during their careers. Wetteland has
converted 253 of 300 opportunities during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have that one go-to guy at the end,'' Oates said.
``If one of those guys emerges \Ras the closer\S, then fine.''

HEALTHY WOHLERS CRUCIAL FOR BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves are hopeful Mark Wohlers can be their closer
on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news for a team that has taken one hit after
another since arriving at their plush Disney World complex. Their
optimism could also be interpreted as a sign of desperation setting
in on baseball's ``Team of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves looked like a powerhouse coming into camp with the
off-season additions of right fielder Brian Jordan and second
baseman Brett Boone. Then came the news that first baseman Andres
Galarraga will miss the entire season with a tumor in his lower
back and closer Kerry Ligtenberg is doubtful because of a bad
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the best team in the National League looks vulnerable,
although general manager John Schuerholz believes the Braves will
survive with Ryan Klesko moving to first base and Otis Nixon taking
over in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a club record for offense last year,'' Schuerholz said.
``We won't have the big guy in the middle now, pounding 500-foot
home runs. But we will still be a very effective offensive team. In
fact, we'll have more speed and offense spread more evenly
throughout the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   That's more spin than reality, but the Braves still have two
terrific prospects in first baseman Randall Simon and outfielder
George Lombard. One or both could be promoted during the season if
the Braves' offense has trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg rescued the Braves' bullpen last year when Wohlers
first got hurt, then lost all idea of where he was throwing the
ball. Now the Braves are insisting Wohlers is close to reclaiming
his old ability and returning to the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' options without Wohlers or Ligtenberg would be go
with John Rocker or make a trade for Minnesota's Rick Aguilera or
Kansas City's Jeff Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' strength remains starting pitching. But they had
just 24 complete games last season as opposed to 62 save
opportunities. Denny Neagle, since traded, had five of those
complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Spotlight on Dean Palmer
Palmer and Tigers are good matches in several ways
</P>
<P>
   There are some good matchups for Dean Palmer as a member of the
Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably:
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Tigers infield coach Perry Hill: Palmer did his best
defensive work with the Rangers when Hill was the infield coach.
Hill has developed a reputation for being one of the best defensive
minds in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's helped me tremendously,'' Palmer said. ``As far as
working, he's one of the hardest working coaches in the game. We've
been doing a lot of work on throwing mechanics and a lot of drills
with feet work.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Tiger Stadium: The old ballpark, in its final year,
is a great place for power hitters. Over the past three years,
there have been 27 percent more home runs hit at Tiger Stadium than
the average ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Palmer hit the second-longest home run in the majors
with a 475-foot shot at Tiger Stadium off pitcher David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and a long-term contract: Palmer has been in the majors
since midway through the 1991 season, but signed his first
long-term deal in the off-season. The Tigers gave him a five-year,
$36 million contract, and Palmer also got a no-trade clause for the
first three years.
\Nsubheds:Baker gets reprieve
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker is one of the most
respected men in the game, except by his own boss. Insiders say
Giants general manager Brian Sabean was just itching for the chance
to replace Baker with his buddy, Jim Fregosi.
</P>
<P>
   Baker never gave him that chance, winning a division title in
1997 and tying for the wild card last year. Now Fregosi has stepped
down as Sabean's special assistant to take over the Toronto Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is irreplaceable,'' Sabean said last week. ``It's a tough
loss. Jim and I are very close. He brought a lot to the table. He
has one of the best baseball minds I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's status is still tenuous.
\Nsubheds:Schilling wavers
</P>
<P>
   Phillies ace Curt Schilling is starting to believe his team
won't be that bad. But it still doesn't mean he wants to hang
around through a rebuilding program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since camp opened, we've played well, and that adds a lot to
the enjoyment of showing up and doing your job,'' Schilling said.
``We are going to have a good club if we stay healthy and things
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   But as far as rescinding his willingness to be traded, Schilling
said, ``Don't ... don't go there. It's been fun. We've got a good
mix of guys, and I think when we leave here, there will be 25 guys
on the roster who belong in the big leagues. That was not the case
in the last couple years. This is the best team I've been on here
since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not saying much. Schilling will be with the Cleveland
Indians by August.
\Nsubheds:Angels watch
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Chuck Finley is coming around slowly after being
bothered by shoulder and neck stiffness. The Angels aren't sure if
he'll be ready to start against the Rangers in the first week of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn also is having troubles adjusting to Arizona spring
training after years in Florida. Vaughn said he was having trouble
seeing at the Angels complex in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to put a dome over this place,'' said Vaughn, whose
average has been under .200 for most of the spring. ``I'm not
picking up the ball real well. I figured if I concentrate here,
once I get in major-league ballparks \Rthe ball\S will be as a big
as a pumpkin.''
\Nsubheds:Short hops
</P>
<P>
   One concern about the absence of manager Joe Torre is the
Yankees don't have anyone who can stand up to owner George
Steinbrenner. Torre served as a buffer to the volatile
Steinbrenner, and other club officials are worried what might
happen while he's out.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants appear to be leaning toward Marvin Bernard as their
centerfielder and are willing to move Stan Javier.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers love rookie outfielder Gabe Kapler, who hit
.322 with 28 homers and 146 in Double A last year. He could push
aside Brian Hunter, a great defensive outfielder with a lousy
on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas has changed his mind. He said the majority of his
playing time will be at DH. The White Sox have been impressed with
Paul Konerko this spring, and he should be their everyday first
baseman.

SPORTS WORLD SHOULD HEED MOTHERS' HONESTY POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long ago, in what seems like another lifetime, I was abducted
into the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   That's no lie. Can I manage the Toronto Blue Jays?
</P>
<P>
   Have I ever told you about the time we were ambushed on a trail
about six clicks south of Khe Sanh, or the time we chased Charlie
out of a village near Soc Trang?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't, because it never happened. But I can tell you a true
story about Christmas Day in 1971 when I got to see the Bob Hope
Christmas Show in Long Binh.
</P>
<P>
   I don't do war stories. And Tim Johnson shouldn't have, either.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a lying society, an age when convenient
prevarications are seen as more important than prevailing truths.
Ministers lie. Ex-football greats lie. The president of the United
States lies.
</P>
<P>
   Integrity has become a decidedly relative term. A lying man
simply needs a successful lawyer. A fibbing athlete simply needs a
weasel of an agent.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know Tim Johnson. If he is half the man that his
brother, Sandy, the Rangers' former personnel chief, is, then Tim
Johnson must be quite a man.
</P>
<P>
   But he violated a cardinal rule among those in charge of modern
sports: If you're in charge, don't let the public or your players
catch you lying. The public will never quite trust you again; the
players will use it, when needed, to brand you as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a liar and a back stabber,'' Pittsburgh third baseman Ed
Sprague said of his former manager, Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a struggling has-been who hasn't batted better
than .228 in the past two seasons might be looking for somebody
else to blame. The public took it as an appropriate condemnation of
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note, too, that Johnson apparently did not
regularly regale the Blue Jays with tall tales about Vietnam
firefights waged by the amber glow of burning villages. No, he told
pitcher Pat Hentgen, who had his worst season in the major leagues
last season.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson tried to skip the slumping Hentgen in the rotation
and insert Roger Clemens in a key series in Boston, Hentgen
bristled. It prompted a clash between Johnson and pitching coach
Mel Queen. Once that rift was firmly a matter of public record,
Hentgen simply pulled back and let Johnson's original lie run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was fired Wednesday. Toronto general manager Gord Ash
blamed the fact that Johnson's Vietnam fib wouldn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Ash is right. People love to chant ``liar, liar, pants on fire''
at the playground big shot. If he's an Oval Office big shot, all
the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get him fired,'' Queen told the Toronto Sun last
week. ``If he wants to see who got him fired, he should look in the
mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has to look in that mirror every day. From what I've
read, he already feels the pain of that.
</P>
<P>
   But in sports today, he made an easy target. Stretch the truth,
and you'll be branded faster than you can say Barry Switzer. A
coach or manager _ or a high-profile owner from Arkansas _ who gets
caught misstating the truth sets a dangerous precedent. A lying
coach or owner invites teamwide distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Modern players, in that regard, are no better than teen-agers,
returning home with a dent in the family car. How they respond
often depends on the integrity of the people they will be giving
their explanation to.
</P>
<P>
   By his Vietnam lie, Johnson's ability to run the Blue Jays was
compromised, probably permanently. The only policy is to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell you war stories about that, but I don't have any.
As a Vietnam veteran, I'm not as much offended by Tim Johnson's
masquerade as I am saddened by it.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty, as our mothers told us, is the best policy. Whether
you're running a country or a baseball team, the risks are not
worth the rationalizations.
</P>
<P>
   People still expect the truth, even in a fantasy business like
sports.

   PASADENA _ In his luxury suite at the Rose Bowl, Major League
Soccer commissioner Doug Logan must have felt good about his
Saturday-morning meeting with midfield holdout Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meeting that convinced the three-time MLS All-Star to
end his holdout _ at least for now _ so that Cienfuegos could make
an appearance during the Galaxy's 2-1 shootout victory over
Colorado in the season opener for both teams Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Welton, Daniel Hernandez and Clint Mathis scored in the shootout
to give L.A. the victory while David Vaudreuil notched the lone
Rapids shootout goal.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, who sat near the end of the bench in the first half,
did more for his bargaining power by not playing than when he
actually entered in the 53rd minute to loud cheers from the measly
crowd of 17,343.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``Cienfuegos'' were heard throughout the opening half,
certainly loud enough for Logan to notice while the two sides argue
over his financial worth to the league.
</P>
<P>
   The midfield general came in and helped strengthen the so-so
performances of youngsters Daniel Hernandez and Joey Franchino, but
it wasn't enough to salvage a victory in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With Cienfuegos itching to get in along the sideline, midfielder
Clint Mathis, expected to share a bulk of the midfield
responsibilities with Cienfuegos this season, needed only minutes
to display his one-legged something of a hop-dance goal celebration
in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Welton weaved his way through Colorado's central defense,
attempting a shot that bounced to the left of the Rapids goal off
defender David Vaudreuil's leg toward Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, unmarked on the right side, settled the ball from the
air with his chest, then one-touched a strike to the left corner to
give L.A. a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids answered in the 34th minute, getting a goal from
midfielder Ross Paule.
</P>
<P>
   Joey DiGiamarino sent a looping cross in the Galaxy box for
Jorge Dely Valdes, who was watched closely by Greg Vanney. Valdes
and Vanney lunged, but the ball appeared to sail off Vanney's head
toward Paule.
</P>
<P>
   Paule picked it out of the air, hammering home a 20-yard shot to
the left-corner past Galaxy keeper Kevin Hartman to notch the
score.

BRUTON SMITH GETS HIS KICKS FROM NASCAR WHEELS AND BIG-BUSINESS
DEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Town and Country Ford is so huge. There are
dozens of spotless, shiny new cars on the cavernous showroom floor.
Outside, there are vehicles almost as far as the eye can see.
Everywhere, young men wearing the salesman's uniform of
short-sleeve shirt and tie earnestly buzz around.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a large-volume car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been No. 1 in the nation, where we have outsold every
Ford dealership,'' Bruton Smith says. ``I think we kind of did it
to show we could.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Bruton Smith does business, whether it's building
Texas Motor Speedway, the host to the Busch Grand National
Coca-Cola 300 and the Winston Cup Primestar 500 next weekend, or
spending $215 million to purchase Las Vegas Motor Speedway, or
running his 109 _ and counting _ car dealerships, or any of his
50-plus companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's the challenge, the competition, the desire to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love business,'' he said. ``I enjoy what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith makes money like the rest of us make a mess _
effortlessly, regularly.
</P>
<P>
   He says he isn't sure how much he's worth, but does admit to
owning 70 percent of Speedway Motorsports, Inc., which he says is
valued at $1.6 billion, and a tad less than 60 percent of Sonic
Automotive, the auto dealership conglomerate worth more than $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that Smith really does know his net worth to the
penny _ give or take any pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to believe his IQ must be in the genius level,
because he never forgets anything,'' said Eddie Gossage, who runs
Texas Motor Speedway for Smith. ``He always does what he says he's
going to do. If I need a phone number, I don't look it up, I ask
him. He memorizes everything. He never has a schedule, but he can
tell you where he has to be on the 13th of next month.''
</P>
<P>
   So why not proudly state his value? Simply because it's not that
important. Making money is not Smith's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   You become the No. 1 Ford dealership in the nation just to say
you did it. You become a major player in the fastest-growing sport
in the country because you enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun,'' Smith said. ``I think we all need to have
fun in what we do. It doesn't make any difference what it is. We
all, hopefully, eat three meals a day and sleep in a bed. As long
as you're having fun, you can do a better job at whatever you do.''
\Nsubheds:The good life Smith knows how to have what most of us
consider fun. On a bright, sunny day in North Carolina, he tools
around Charlotte in a bright red Dodge Viper. He flies out on
weekends to go watch stock-car races.
</P>
<P>
   But fun also is turning Charlotte Motor Speedway into the first
racetrack with condos and luxury suites, being the first person to
take a motorsports company public and put it on the New York Stock
Exchange, building a 151,000-seat facility in an unproven market in
Fort Worth, building an opulent, private club on the premises,
purchasing a track in Las Vegas, and buying automobile dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hobby is business,'' Gossage said. ``He is the kind of
person it takes to make things happen. There's a perception about
him that he won't take `no' for an answer, and that's true. That's
a tremendous quality, because without people like him nothing would
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has the vision and the gumption. He also has a cadre of
loyal employees who will do anything he asks. Gossage is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes across to some people as distant, or short,'' Gossage
said. ``But the truth is he only has a small group of friends
around him, and if you're not one of his friends he's
uncomfortable. His friends are the people that run his
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage was afraid he might no longer be with Smith after the
problems at TMS the past two years. The Winston Cup drivers didn't
like the track configuration, water seeped up through the track
surface, and Gossage's once cute ``Shut Up and Race'' T-shirts
became a public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy thing to have done would have been to fire me and
blame me,'' Gossage said. ``I'm the guy out front. Instead, he kept
encouraging me along. I knew he took it personally, but he didn't
talk about how he felt. He talked about how I felt, and offered me
tremendous encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith never considered firing Gossage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing, yeah,'' he said. ``But I'm a strong
believer that two wrongs do not make a right. Gee whiz, I've made
mistakes, and I'll make more. If I got clobbered every time I made
a mistake, I'd never amount to much.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of loyalty extends to his sport, even though he
doesn't always agree with the direction of that sport.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wants a second Winston Cup date at TMS and LVMS. That puts
him at odds with NASCAR president Bill France. In addition to being
the leader of the organization that makes the schedule, France is
chairman of the board of International Speedway Corp., which also
is in the business of building and acquiring tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with France's loyalty to older, smaller,
traditional tracks with two races _ such as Darlington, S.C.,
Rockingham, N.C., Martinsville, Va., and Richmond, Va. _ and it
makes dates tough to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think frustration is correct,'' Smith said. ``When you see
the success of Texas, no speedway to my knowledge, from the
opening, has ever had the success that speedway's had. Didn't that
speedway earn its right? The market is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Smith disagrees with France on the issue of dates, he
said tales of a rivalry between the two racetrack titans are
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media likes to play on that,'' he said. ``I've
tried repeatedly to stop it, unsuccessfully. Bill has tried to
help, maybe not as aggressively as he could have, but we've tried
to put that out. Bill knows that he has my commitment of helping
him build NASCAR. As NASCAR grows, that positively affects me. The
better I can make it, the better it is for Speedway Motorsports.''
\Nsubheds:Thinking ahead Smith points to the agreement between SMI
and ISC to join forces to seek a national TV deal for NASCAR races
as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He also has advocated splitting the Winston Cup circuit into two
leagues, but France opposes it, so Smith isn't pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. France and I have discussed it,'' Smith said. ``If it's
done, it's a NASCAR thing to do. It's not going to be easy. There
will be some opposition from drivers, some from fans. But it's
something that could take us to another level. We could have a race
at 1 o'clock Eastern and another race that starts 3 1/2 hours later
on the West Coast. It certainly would afford our sport more dates,
and we would create tremendous growth. I think that someday it will
be done, but it will only be done when NASCAR is ready to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Smith continues to look for other
opportunities, other ways to have fun. In February, he sold the
naming rights to Charlotte Motor Speedway to Lowe's Home
Improvement Warehouse. He said a similar deal might be coming to
TMS, but not any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to buy automobile dealerships. He's about to launch
an Internet auction company called SoldUSA.com.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Smith is a sharp businessman. But through it
all, he keeps a twinkle in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith is having fun, just like he did as a boy growing up
on a farm in Oakboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't know that he's on the Forbes list,'' Gossage
said. ``Wednesday before our first race here, we were busy and
didn't take time to go eat lunch. We were hungry, and so my
secretary fixed peanut butter sandwiches. I had to go answer the
phone, and when I came back I took a bite of my peanut butter
sandwich and it crunched. He looked at me with a grin on his face.
I opened my sandwich up, and he had put potato chips on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `that's how I ate them as a kid. Try it, you'll love
it.' I thought, if people could only see this big-shot millionaire
eating peanut-butter-and-potato-chip sandwiches. But he's a
peanut-butter-and-potato-chip kind of a guy. He really is.''

 MIDDLEBURY CLAIMS 5TH STRAIGHT TITLE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Vt. _ They proceeded in single file, arms rigidly
upraised, fingers pointed stiffly skyward, like a surrendering
army. But this was a gesture of conquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlebury College hockey players were merely celebrating _
and signifying _ the latest achievement in their metronome of
success. With a 5-0 throttling of Wisconsin-Superior
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, they claimed their fifth consecutive NCAA Division
3 championship, padding a record of domination unrivaled at any
level of college hockey.
</P>
<P>
   So their impromptu victory parade featured a high five on each
hand, a symbol for their ecstatic fans on both sides of Kreitzberg
Arena, who stood in salute for the last three minutes of the game
and serenaded the Panthers for a half-hour afterward. Yes, there
was mutual adulation, but this revelry was probably the most
poignant of the bunch, because it was the most unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   That's why coach Bill Beaney stood off to one side in the
immediate aftermath, joining a circle of embrace with his four
seniors _ cocaptains Nickolai Bobrov and Ross Sealfon, plus Jeff
Anastasio and Brady Priest, who represent the second straight
graduating class that has gone 4 for 4 in national finals.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the team indulged in a pig pile of delirium,
Beaney and the seniors bowed their heads, and he quietly told them,
``Thank you for the strength of your conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a conviction that not even the coach had at the start of
the season, after he lost the six-player core that had been the
foundation of this dynasty, and looked at the flock of youth in its
place. His forecast for another NCAA plaque: ``I didn't expect it
of them,'' said Beaney, ``and they knew I didn't expect it of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   How did they know that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I told them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobrov and his fellow elders also had a message for the
peach-fuzz brigade: ``Why can't we be the class that keeps it going
instead of the one that ends it?''
</P>
<P>
   With that resolve, the Panthers endured what Bobrov called ``a
roller coaster of a season,'' struggling to a 2-2 start, then
finishing with an 8-0-1 flourish yet still barely squeezing into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an emergence that was as spectacular as it was
surprising, capped by Middlebury's utter domination of the Final
Four, starting with a 9-3 whipping of Rochester Institute of
Technology and climaxing with Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's rout of the
Yellowjackets, which wound up as a 12-save shutout for Jon Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Bobrov had a storybook farewell by scoring twice and assisting
twice as Middlebury built a 4-0 lead in the first 22:55. Junior
defenseman Ben Barnett triggered the first three goals with
blue-line lasers, scoring two and assisting on one.
</P>
<P>
   When Barnett's afterthought of a blue-line blast during a line
change found the far corner of the Wisconsin-Superior net at 1:05
of the second period, he figured this was going to be Middlebury's
night. ``When the puck starts bouncing your way,'' he said, ``you
know things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   So well that this was the first final during the joyride in
which Middlebury (21-5-1) prevailed by more than a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this was a dream finish, Bobrov said, ``When no one
believes in you except 20 guys amd thousands of others don't think
you can do it and you make it happen, I can't describe the
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaney tried. ``In a lot of ways, it is (the most special),'' he
said. ``The first one is always the biggest surprise, but in all
honesty, this one was more so because we'd lost so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   What about yet another encore? Athletic director Russ Reilly
believes Beaney's greatest coaching challenge will be in how he
handles the next Panther team that doesn't win it all. And still,
Beaney keeps him waiting.
</P>
<P>
   A new millennium approaches, and the dynasty is not done. ``Like
the sap that runs from the trees,'' said Beaney, ``anything is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He never bothered to explain that bit of Green Mountain wisdom.
But he did give a preview of his welcoming speech to the 1999-2000
Panthers: ``I'm gonna tell them they don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already proven to be a lousy prophet. Hey, nobody's
perfect. Though Middlebury comes close.

TECH COACH MUM ON PREFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore might have the top-seeded team
in the women's basketball West Regional finals, but he wasn't about
to say which team he wanted to face following the Lady Techsters'
73-52 victory over Louisiana State at the Sports Arena on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always a tricky question. I would like to play the
worst team, no matter who that is,'' Barmore said, declining to say
whether he preferred UCLA or Colorado State. ``Regardless of who we
play, it will be difficult. Colorado State has a large fan
following and UCLA will be playing at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez sprains ankle: UCLA point guard Erica Gomez sprained her
ankle in the opening minutes against Colorado State and did not
return to the game. Gomez went into the locker room and returned to
the bench with a pair of crutches, and her availability Monday, if
the Bruins defeated Colorado State, was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   With Gomez out, point guard duties fell to former Crescenta
Valley High guard Michelle Greco.
</P>
<P>
   Instant offense: The most impressive early performance was
turned in by Louisiana Tech guard Betty Lennox, who scored 19
points in 18 minutes off the bench against Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   She scored seven straight points in a one-minute, 14-second span
in the first half that turned a 15-10 LSU lead into a 17-15
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she came in and hurt us a lot,'' LSU guard Marie
Ferdinand said. ``We didn't expect her to shoot the way she did. We
had the game under control until she came in.''
</P>
<P>
   No bragging rights: Although they beat the big in-state school,
Louisiana Tech wasn't exactly cherishing its victory over LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to go all the way,'' Lennox said. ``It didn't
really matter that we played them. It didn't make the game any
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency lettering job: LSU forward Detrina White was wearing
the wrong jersey number (35 instead of 23) after the Lady Tigers
manager forgot to pack her jersey to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So LSU improvised, taking White's new jersey to a lettering shop
across from their downtown hotel. Her name was spelled correctly,
but barely resembled the other players' jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament sightings: It almost looked like a current and
ex-coaches convention inside the Sports Arena. USC coach Chris
Gobrecht and her predecessor, Fred Williams, were in attendance.
Williams is an assistant with the WNBA's Utah Starzz. Also on hand
was Alemany High coach Melissa Hearlihy, who had former Indians
center Carly Funicello playing for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Since USC is hosting the regional, former All-Americans Lisa
Leslie and Tina Thompson were given courtside seats for the
contests.

KINGS HOLD ON 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ So many times this season, the Kings have
fallen behind early, then spent the remainder of the night
frantically attempting to battle back.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, they altered their modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 7 minutes, 17 seconds in the first period, the
Kings fired four goals past two Florida Panthers goalies. Then they
simply held on for 40 minutes, trying not to let a crucial victory
slip away.
</P>
<P>
   They survived in the end to win 4-3 before a Forum crowd of
14,551. It was the Kings' fourth win in their last five games, as
they concluded a season-long seven game home stand with a 4-3
record.
</P>
<P>
   The home stand wasn't easy, but if the Kings are going to squeak
into the playoffs, the hard part comes now. Thirteen games remain,
nine on the road, beginning this evening in Phoenix against the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory left the Kings (27-37-5) three points behind
Calgary and Edmonton, which are tied for the eighth and final
playoff berth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (25-26-17) has problems of its own. The Panthers, who
were without star right wing Pavel Bure (knee injury), are four
points out of an Eastern Conference playoff berth with 14 games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings appeared headed for a blowout after their
4-0 first period, the hero of the opening 20 minutes was goalie
Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety seconds into the game, Fiset sprawled to rob Radek Dvorak
on a breakaway. Two minutes later, with the Kings on a power play,
Fiset stopped another breakaway, this one by Bill Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fiset's effort, the Kings might have found themselves in
an early 2-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Donald Audette scored off a Luc Robitaille rebound
on a power play at 6:04, the Kings had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Audette's shot was the Kings' second of the game; on their
fourth shot, on another power play at 8:11, they took a 2-0 lead on
a blast from the right point by Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, with Blake screening goalie Kirk McLean,
Mattias Norstrom scored his second goal of the season, on the
Kings' sixth shot of the game. It was the last shot faced by
McLean, who was replaced by Sean Burke. Less than three minutes
after Burke entered the game, Russ Courtnall scored on a
shorthanded breakaway, increasing the lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the Panthers fought back in the second period, cutting their
deficit in half and outshooting the Kings, 15-3. Their first goal
was scored by Viktor Kozlov on a power play at 8:12. Less than one
minute later, on an outnumbered rush, rookie Mark Parrish scored
his 18th goal this season, off a Lindsay pass, to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that would be the end of the Panthers' rally.
Through much of the third period, the Kings played solid
defensively and limited Florida's scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the closing minutes, Doug Bodger and Blake received
penalties, providing Florida with a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It took Florida little time to capitalize, Ray Whitney scoring
from point-blank range to draw Florida within a goal.
</P>
<P>
   After Whitney's goal, the Panthers still had 1:51 left on a
Blake penalty to try to tie the score, and though they applied
plenty of pressure they were unable to get the puck past Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minute, the Panthers pulled Burke for an extra
skater, but the Kings kept Florida out of their zone, and were not
threatened.

FOREIGN INTRIGUE: MAVERICKS ROOKIE NOWITZKI ADJUSTS TO AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
WITH SIDEBARS 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a good thing Dirk Nowitzki has broad shoulders,
considering that he carries with him the future of basketball in
his native Germany, the future of the long-downtrodden Mavericks
and, right this minute, an acute craving for a TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too homesick,'' Nowitzki said of adjusting to life
away from Germany. ``But I miss most of all Mom's kitchen. She
cooks everything. My cooking, it doesn't taste pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   How together were you at the age of 20? Now imagine yourself 7
feet tall. Now imagine yourself leaving the comfort of your home,
your friends and your family to live 3,000 miles away. Now imagine
that you've done all this while saddled with the expectation that
you are destined to be an all-star, a Great White Hope, a messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki is the latest experiment in the growing trend of pro
teams in North America going international. The Mavericks' Nowitzki
and Chris Anstey (Australia), two first-round draft picks, are from
overseas. The Stars have used eight of 15 draft picks the past two
years on foreign players. The Rangers have 75 players in their
minor-league system from Latin America, including their No. 1
prospect, center fielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks general manager Don Nelson doesn't dismiss the
difficulty foreign players have in adjusting to life in the United
States. That doesn't stop him, however, from gambling on their
talent. He said the learning curve for a player like Nowitzki is
longer than for U.S. players but that that's no reason to not take
a chance on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 4 billion people in the world,'' Nelson said. ``It's
a little silly, maybe even a little arrogant, to think that the
only good basketball players are within some tiny radius of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nowitzki to succeed, however, Nelson knows he needs to make
the transition to American life off the court, as well as on, where
he has struggled to keep up physically with the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy America,'' Nowitzki said. ``But I don't think when I'm
old I'll be here. And when the season ends, I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how he's making the adjustment, put yourself
in Nowitzki's size-15 shoes. Slip into 48 hours of being Dirk.
Starting now:
Tuesday evening The Suns-Mavericks game should have been over by
now. But moisture on the Reunion Arena floor causes a delay of more
than an hour. Nowitzki's body clock is confused, believing it's
time to do postgame interviews, then time to eat a snack, then time
to be in bed before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' Nowitzki said after the loss in which he plays only
10 minutes, ``I was still up at midnight. Shopping. I had no food
in my household.'' So, he made a midnight run to Albertson's.
``Weird. Nobody else in the whole place.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV dinner scarfed, Nowitzki went to bed, first with music,
then with a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to everything,'' he said. ``I like Lauryn Hill. Rap,
soul, black music. When I was young I liked AC/DC. In Germany we
have something called `technogroove.' I like it.''
Wednesday morning Nowitzki is up at 9 a.m. and feeling sheepish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually get up earlier than this,'' he said, almost
apologetically. ``But it's OK, because my apartment is so close to
\Rthe team's practice facility.\S''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the arrangement is cozy. Mavericks teammates Hubert
Davis, Anstey and Steve Nash live in the same complex. Logically,
Anstey _ a 7-foot-tall second-year pro who shares Nowitzki's
passion and skill for tennis _ has become a close friend. Nash,
meanwhile, is a baby sitter of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve helps me so much,'' Nowitzki said.
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to write checks,'' Nowitzki said. ``I'd never
done anything like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson of the living
arrangements: ``It was sort of a coincidence. But Steve helps take
care of that homesickness thing. It's kind of preventative
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast, Nowitzki has Frosted Flakes. A steady diet of TV
dinners and Frosted Flakes? One can't help but suggest that
Nowitzki will someday need some sort of medicine, preventative or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki arrives at the practice facility at 10 a.m. driving a
rental car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big long car, so I like it,'' he said. ``I just decided
to rent it for three months. Maybe next year I'll buy one. When I
was little I always liked Mercedes-Benz, but it's not important
now.'' Besides, he added, ``I'm hardly ever driving. Apartment,
Reunion, practice, and to the airport. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   At practice, Nowitzki gets schooled by veteran A.C. Green.
Nowitzki is three inches taller and forever wider than ``Gramps,''
but the vet knows tricks. Green's side runs a series of
pick-and-rolls, forcing Nowitzki's side to adjust and switch men.
In one sequence, Nowitzki finds himself guarding the 6-9 Green,
then bullish forward Gary Trent, then Davis, a guard.
</P>
<P>
   Green _ who implores his unit with screams of ``Fourth quarter,
who wants it?'' _ leads his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Green assaults Nowitzki with good old-fashioned American trash
talk. Nowitzki grins. The kid may have the easiest smile in the
NBA, except sometimes one gets the impression he guffaws at the
joke although he doesn't get the punchline.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just that trash talk is absolutely not my style, so I
laugh,'' Nowitzki said. ``I don't know who needs it. I'm a shy
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To end practice, most of the Mavericks disband from the
scrimmage to work individually on free throws. But Nowitzki, Anstey
and fellow young big man Samaki Walker are summoned to one end of
the gym, where they work one-on-one on their inside games.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nowitzki and the Mavericks embark on the tiresome
part of their work day. First comes a practice-ending session with
coaches. Then comes an NBA security meeting. Then come visits with
the media. Then comes a mandatory weight-lifting session.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the 20-20 rule,'' Nowitzki said. ``If you
don't play 20 minutes \Rin the previous night's game\S, you've got
to ride the \Rexercise\S bike for 20 minutes. Fun.''
Wednesday evening Time for another $30 visit to the grocery in
preparation for tomorrow's visit from Nowitzki's father and in
satisfaction of two more dietary cravings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love sweets,'' Nowitzki said. ``And I drink lots of Sprite.
Lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki also stops by Target to purchase sheets and pillows for
the new bed he bought for the visit from his father, Joerg.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., the bed is set up, the sweets are gone and it's time
for a rare look at the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Americanized in that I don't watch any TV, really,''
said Nowitzki, who is watching the National Invitation Tournament
on ESPN with Nash as his visitor. ``I watch some basketball games
on TV, but nothing like soap operas or anything. In Germany, we get
CNN. And there's a superchannel that shows Jay Leno and Seinfeld
and The Cosby Show, all translated. But it's not my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki is asleep by 10:30, anticipating a home game tomorrow
night against the tough Orlando Magic, dreaming of performing well
in front of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw my first game in Seattle because it was broadcast on
German TV,'' Nowitzki said. ``But this will be the first time he's
seen me in person in America. And it will be his first time in the
States. Both of us are excited.''
Thursday morning Nowitzki is happy to clear up misconceptions about
his hometown of Wurzburg, misportrayed by the Fort Worth-Dallas
media as a sleepy little backwater village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is small by American standards, I think, but quite large by
German standards,'' he said. ``Very cultural. It was completely
bombed in the Second War. But it's been rebuilt. A cultural center.
A castle. Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Nowitzki's day would normally follow a typical NBA
player's game-day pattern, except for the fact that his father and
the boyfriend of Dirk's sister will soon arrive at Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to talk to my girlfriend back home every day,'' Nowitzki
said, speaking softly as he mentions Sybille Gerer, 20. ``I do miss
her. She's been here twice, and wants to come back again soon. But
she doesn't like the States too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nowitzki, Gerer is a basketball standout. She plays forward
on a club team in Germany. But Nowitzki said they almost never talk
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Gerer lived here, he would go out more. More
restrictive, however, is his age. While his father is visiting,
he'll try to get out to a Dallas steakhouse. But that's as
adventurous as his nightlife gets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried going out a bit, but every time I go to the bar,
they want to see my passport,'' said Nowitzki, adding that he
half-expected the occasional barkeep to not bother carding a 7-foot
man. ``In Germany, 18 is the age you can drive. And 16 is the age
you can drink a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything especially American Nowitzki is looking forward to as
part of his 21st birthday June 19?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to drink here,'' he said. ``But to be honest, I
don't like your beer. Ugh. It's like lemonade.''
Thursday afternoon Joerg Nowitzki and his daughter's boyfriend
arrive. After Dirk picks them up, Joerg expresses disappointment at
his first glimpse of the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't it be hot?'' he said, smiling. ``It's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk drops his guests off at the apartment, arranges for them to
take a cab to Reunion and bids them goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 p.m., it's time for the short drive that precedes a
seven-hour night at Reunion Arena that, for him, will produce only
a few minutes of on-court time.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:20 p.m., Nowitzki makes his first appearance with 5:55 left
in the second quarter, the ninth man in Dallas' rotation. He scores
a basket on his first shot and commits a foul on each of the next
two possessions. But at least he contributes something (seven
points and two rebounds) in what will be a 93-76 upset victory
against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Near halftime, Joerg Nowitzki is interviewed on the Mavs' TV
broadcast. ``Hello, Dallas Mavericks!'' Joerg said into the
microphone. ``I love you!''
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, and a 48-hour peek into his life, Nowitzki has
time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about the pressure of being a German, or about
my role in the future,'' he said in a festive post-game locker
room. ``No, not at all. I'm just 20. I'm struggling the last two or
three weeks. Riding the bench. I must just worry about my game.
That's enough for me right now.''

FOREIGN INTRIGUE: MAVERICKS ROOKIE NOWITZKI ADJUSTS TO AMERICA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a good thing Dirk Nowitzki has broad shoulders,
considering that he carries with him the future of basketball in
his native Germany, the future of the long-downtrodden Mavericks
and, right this minute, an acute craving for a TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too homesick,'' Nowitzki said of adjusting to life
away from Germany. ``But I miss most of all Mom's kitchen. She
cooks everything. My cooking, it doesn't taste pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   How together were you at the age of 20? Now imagine yourself 7
feet tall. Now imagine yourself leaving the comfort of your home,
your friends and your family to live 3,000 miles away. Now imagine
that you've done all this while saddled with the expectation that
you are destined to be an all-star, a Great White Hope, a messiah.
</P>

JOHNSON VOICES CONCERN OVER HUNDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he is
contemplating opening the season with three catchers because time
is running out for injured Todd Hundley to prove he could handle
the everyday rigors of catching.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that Hundley, bothered by a sore right elbow,
could begin the season on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be something we have to deal with,'' Johnson said
before the Dodgers and Baltimore Orioles played Saturday. ``We're
kind of running out of time. It's probably doubtful that Hundley
will show me enough between now and opening day that I can go with
two catchers, and I don't want to get caught short.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley can't catch, 24-year-old rookie Angel Pena could be
the Dodgers' opening-day catcher. Paul LoDuca is the favored
backup, but Johnson brought four catchers to play against the
Orioles _ Pena, LoDuca, Rick Wilkins and Tim Laker _ to maximize
his evaluation time on each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't voiced it, but it's an issue,'' Johnson said. ``I've
been thinking about it for 10 days. When Hundley had the setback,
(carrying three catchers) immediately jumped through my mind. It
may not be a distinct possibility. It may be a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley won't catch before Tuesday's day off, which
will leave less than two weeks before the April 5 opener against
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hundley, I want to be able to find out what he can do and
can't do,'' Johnson said. ``Can he play four or five days a week or
can he play two days a week?''
</P>
<P>
   Until this time, the Dodgers have maintained Hundley would be
ready for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hasn't caught a game during the spring training. He's
been the designated hitter twice but not since March 10. He injured
his right elbow the day before that when he hit left-handed for
more than 30 minutes in an extended batting cage session. According
to team doctors, that caused inflammation in his right elbow,
though doctors say it's unrelated to the reconstructive surgery he
had on the same elbow Sept. 26, 1997, as a member of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley played in 53 games for the Mets last season but caught
just twice. He spent most of his time in an ill-faded left-field
experiment. He was acquired in a trade with minor-league pitcher
Arnold Gooch for Charles Johnson and Roger Cedeno on December 1,
1998, in a move that will help define general manager Kevin
Malone's tenure with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and Malone both said they wouldn't have traded for
Hundley if Pena wasn't in the organization and ready to play at the
major-league level. Pena is supposed to start the season with
Triple-A Albuquerque, but Hundley's availability could change that.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought he had a chance to start the season
with the Dodgers, Pena said: ``For some reason, yes, I feel like I
do. The pitchers say they like me, and that's the best thing they
can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's played in two Grapefruit League games and has one hit
in eight at-bats. He's being counted on to handle a veteran
pitching staff expected to be one of the best in baseball. The
switch-hitting Hundley also is expected to be the much-needed
left-handed bat in a lineup dominated by right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley also brings power. His 41 homers with the Mets in 1996
is a major-league record for catchers. He followed that by hitting
.273 with 30 homers and 86 RBI in 132 games before elbow problems
ended in 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the guys we have backing up are capable,'' said
Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort, speaking particularly about their
defense. ``LoDuca's good back there, Pena's good back there.
Wilkins is an experienced guy who's been around for a while and
Laker is another guy who's been around for a long while.''

JOHNSON VOICES CONCERN OVER HUNDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he is
contemplating opening the season with three catchers because time
is running out for injured Todd Hundley to prove he could handle
the everyday rigors of catching.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that Hundley, bothered by a sore right elbow,
could begin the season on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be something we have to deal with,'' Johnson said
before the Dodgers and Baltimore Orioles played Saturday. ``We're
kind of running out of time. It's probably doubtful that Hundley
will show me enough between now and opening day that I can go with
two catchers, and I don't want to get caught short.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hundley can't catch, 24-year-old rookie Angel Pena could be
the Dodgers' opening-day catcher. Paul LoDuca is the favored
backup, but Johnson brought four catchers to play against the
Orioles _ Pena, LoDuca, Rick Wilkins and Tim Laker _ to maximize
his evaluation time on each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't voiced it, but it's an issue,'' Johnson said. ``I've
been thinking about it for 10 days. When Hundley had the setback,
(carrying three catchers) immediately jumped through my mind. It
may not be a distinct possibility. It may be a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Hundley won't catch before Tuesday's day off, which
will leave less than two weeks before the April 5 opener against
the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hundley, I want to be able to find out what he can do and
can't do,'' Johnson said. ``Can he play four or five days a week or
can he play two days a week?''
</P>
<P>
   Until this time, the Dodgers have maintained Hundley would be
ready for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hasn't caught a game during the spring training. He's
been the designated hitter twice but not since March 10. He injured
his right elbow the day before that when he hit left-handed for
more than 30 minutes in an extended batting cage session. According
to team doctors, that caused inflammation in his right elbow,
though doctors say it's unrelated to the reconstructive surgery he
had on the same elbow Sept. 26, 1997, as a member of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley played in 53 games for the Mets last season but caught
just twice. He spent most of his time in an ill-faded left-field
experiment. He was acquired in a trade with minor-league pitcher
Arnold Gooch for Charles Johnson and Roger Cedeno on December 1,
1998, in a move that will help define general manager Kevin
Malone's tenure with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and Malone both said they wouldn't have traded for
Hundley if Pena wasn't in the organization and ready to play at the
major-league level. Pena is supposed to start the season with
Triple-A Albuquerque, but Hundley's availability could change that.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought he had a chance to start the season
with the Dodgers, Pena said: ``For some reason, yes, I feel like I
do. The pitchers say they like me, and that's the best thing they
can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's played in two Grapefruit League games and has one hit
in eight at-bats. He's being counted on to handle a veteran
pitching staff expected to be one of the best in baseball. The
switch-hitting Hundley also is expected to be the much-needed
left-handed bat in a lineup dominated by right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley also brings power. His 41 homers with the Mets in 1996
is a major-league record for catchers. He followed that by hitting
.273 with 30 homers and 86 RBI in 132 games before elbow problems
ended in 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the guys we have backing up are capable,'' said
Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort, speaking particularly about their
defense. ``LoDuca's good back there, Pena's good back there.
Wilkins is an experienced guy who's been around for a while and
Laker is another guy who's been around for a long while.''

KINGS HOLD ON 4-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ So many times this season, the Kings have fallen
behind early and spent the rest of the night vainly attempting to
battle back.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, they altered their modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 7 minutes, 17 seconds in the first period, the
Kings fired four goals past two Florida Panthers goalies. Then they
simply held on for the final two periods, coming close to allowing
a crucial victory to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   They survived in the end to win 4-3 before a Forum crowd of
14,551 attending the conclusion of a season-long seven game home
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped playing the way we were supposed to be playing,
getting the puck deep (in the opposing zone),'' coach Larry
Robinson said. ``All of a sudden, we get a 4-0 lead and guys are
trying to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Donald Audette, who scored the Kings' first goal: ``We
kind of got satisfied with the lead. When you do that, you go out
without the same desire, and that can cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-3 home stand wasn't easy, but if the Kings are going to
squeak into the playoffs, the hard part comes now. Thirteen games
remain, nine on the road, beginning this evening in Phoenix against
the Coyotes. Saturday's victory left the Kings (27-37-5) three
points behind Calgary and Edmonton, which share the final playoff
berth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (25-26-17) has problems of its own. The Panthers, who
were without star right wing Pavel Bure (knee injury), are four
points out of an Eastern Conference playoff berth with 14 games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings appeared headed for a blowout after their
4-0 first period, the hero of the opening 20 minutes was goalie
Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety seconds into the game, Fiset sprawled to rob Radek Dvorak
on a breakaway. Two minutes later, with the Kings on a power play,
Fiset stopped another breakaway, this one by Bill Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fiset's effort, the Kings might have found themselves in
an early 2-0 hole. Fiset is expected to be the backup to Jamie
Storr tonight in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fiset) doesn't come up big for us early,'' defenseman Doug
Bodger said, ``it's a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Audette scored off a Luc Robitaille rebound on a
power play at 6:04, the Kings had a 1-0 lead; two minutes later,
Rob Blake scored on another power play, his 10th goal this season
and his sixth in the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   It took just two more minutes, with Blake screening goalie Kirk
McLean, for Mattias Norstrom to score his second goal of the
season. And less than three minutes after that _ with Sean Burke
now in the Panthers' goal _ Russ Courtnall scored shorthanded for a
4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Panthers fought back in the second period, cutting their
deficit in half and outshooting the Kings 15-3. Their first goal
was scored by Viktor Kozlov on a power play at 8:12. Less than a
minute later, on an outnumbered rush, rookie Mark Parrish scored
his 18th of the season off a Lindsay pass to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with less than four minutes left in the game and two Kings
in the penalty box, Ray Whitney drew the Panthers within one. The
Kings survived another 1:51 shorthanded to win for the fourth time
in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is over, fine, shut it off,'' said a relieved
Robinson. ``What it is, it's a win.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Kings will take them any way they can get
them.

GALAXY WINS IN SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- In his luxury suite at the Rose Bowl, Major League
Soccer commissioner Doug Logan must have felt good about his
Saturday morning meeting with midfield holdout Mauricio Cienfuegos
-- a meeting that convinced the three-time MLS all-star to end his
holdout -- at least for now -- so that Cienfuegos could make an
appearance during Saturday's 2-1 shootout victory over Colorado in
the season opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, who sat near the end of the bench in the first half,
did more for his bargaining power by not playing than when he
actually entered in the 53rd minute to loud cheers from the measly
crowd of 17,343.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ``Cienfuegos were heard throughout the opening half --
certainly loud enough for Logan to notice while the two sides argue
over his financial worth to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues over specific worth are issues left to the negotiating
process,'' said Logan, avoiding direct questions about Cienfuegos'
worth to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can come up with a solution that lengthens his
career here and his value to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The midfield general came in and helped strengthen the so-so
performances of youngsters Daniel Hernandez and Joey Franchino, but
it wasn't enough to salvage a victory in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Given the long days coach Octavio Zambrano has spent dealing
with Cienfuegos' uncertainty and trying to prepare his team, a
positive result, even if its worth only a point in the standings,
was something to feel good about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first game and it's good to get a win,'' he said.
``Sometimes you have to take what you get. Certainly we were close
enough and did most of the work to get the win but it didn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was our first match with Mauricio and we felt the loss
of him for a while, but he will get back in the swing of things and
so will this team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cienfuegos itching to get in along the sideline, midfielder
Clint Mathis, expected to share a bulk of the midfield
responsibilities with Cienfuegos this season, needed only minutes
to display his one-legged something of a hop-dance goal celebration
in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Welton wieved his way through Colorado's central defense,
attempting a shot that riocheted to the left of the Rapids goal off
defender David Vaudreuil's leg toward Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, unmarked on the right side, settled the ball from the
air with his chest, then one-touched a strike to the left corner to
give L.A. a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids answered in the 34th minute, getting a sweet goal
from midfielder Ross Paule to tie the match.
</P>
<P>
   In the shootout, Daniel Hernandez, Welton and Mathis each scored
goals to give L.A. a 3-1 edge. David Vaudreuil scored for the
Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who spent the off-season auditioning for the U.S.
National team, showed the flashes of creativeness that Zambrano has
been talking about all preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old roamed behind strikers Cobi Jones and Welton,
picking his spots to get good looks at the goal and it paid off
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to get out here and see the chemistry for the
first time with our guys,'' Mathis said. ``I thought at times we
played real well and had opportunites, but then again we had mental
lapses that come with the beginning of a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis was pleased to share his midfield duties with Cienfuegos
in the second half. And Cienfuegos will certainly help with the
development of Franchino and Hernandez, who are expected to be
regular starters in their second full-seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, right when he came in he got the crowd into it,''
Mathis said of Cienfuegos. ``He's just such a phenominal player and
we all feed off him when he's in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootout victory wasn't what the Galaxy had in mind, but
with a long season ahead, Mathis wasn't ready to lower his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not three-points, but it's a win and that's more
important than anything else, he said. ``Sure it would have been
nice to win in regulation but getting a `W' is the most important
thing.''

NO DECISION ON DUCHESNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Steve Duchesne's status remained unresolved
Saturday, with no conclusion to his saga likely until Tuesday's NHL
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the Kings either will buy Duchesne out of his
contract, trade him, send him to the minors or keep him on the
team. The Kings waived Duchesne on Wednesday and he cleared waivers
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out Duchesne's contract would be costly. Last summer,
they signed him as a free agent to a three-year contract worth
$3.75 million a year. There also is a fourth year on the contract,
at Duchesne's option, for $3.75 million. Under terms of the NHL's
collective-bargaining agreement, the Kings would have to pay
two-thirds of the remaining $11.25 million on the contract, or $7.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Duchesne's agent, Pat Brisson, Duchesne would have
to agree to a buyout for the Kings to buy him out during the
season. After the season, teams can buy out players without their
assent. Brisson did not say whether Duchesne would agree to be
bought out during the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings were to trade Duchesne, they undoubtedly would have
to pay a large portion of Duchesne's remaining salary to get
another team to take him. If the Kings were to buy out Duchesne, he
could turn around and sign a new contract with another NHL team. He
would have to sign by noon Tuesday, however, to be eligible to
compete in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Detroit and Carolina are some of the teams that might
be interested in adding him for the playoffs, either in a trade in
which the Kings picked up a substantial amount of salary, or if the
Kings were to buy him out.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia reportedly had been intrigued in Duchesne, an
ex-Flyer. But when asked if he'd be interested, Flyers general
manager Bob Clarke told the Delaware County Daily Times: ``Not
particularly. He's on waivers for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne was a healthy scratch for the fifth straight game when
the Kings played Florida on Saturday night but was scheduled to
travel with the team for tonight's game in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: A Kings spokesman denied a rumor that the team was
considering trading defenseman Doug Bodger and winger Russ
Courtnall to the Detroit Red Wings for 22-year-old Mathieu
Dandenault, a speedy defenseman.... The Kings assigned forward
Nathan LaFayette to the Long Beach Ice Dogs and activated forward
Steve McKenna, who has missed most of the season with an abdominal
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro cross-checked: The 4-3 victory over Florida ended with
the Panthers' Scott Mellanby cross-checking Kings center Ray
Ferraro in the mouth. Mellanby received a match penalty from
referee Denis LaRue and could face a suspension from the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't get suspended, it's a (bleeping) joke,'' an
angry Ferraro said before storming off.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Ferraro, was named the Kings' nominee for
the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which is awarded annually to
the player who best exemplifies ``perseverance, sportsmanship and
dedication to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous Kings who have won the Masterton Trophy are Butch
Goring (1977-78), Bob Bourne (1987-88) and Dave Taylor (1990-91). &QL;

UCLA REACHES FINAL EIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They lost their point guard, but not their cool.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded UCLA lost Erica Gomez to a sprained ankle 35
seconds into the game but stuck to its game plan of getting the
ball into the post. It also got some timely outside shooting in the
second half and and made enough free throws down the stretch to
secure a 77-68 victory Saturday night over second-seeded Colorado
State in an NCAA West Regional semifinal before a crowd of 4,583 at
the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (26-7) advance to the regional final Monday night at
9 p.m. against top-seeded Louisiana Tech, with a berth in the Final
Four on the line. Colorado State, which got 24 points from Kate
Cronin and 21 points from All-American Becky Hammon, finished 33-3.
</P>
<P>
   No UCLA team has ever reached this level in the NCAA Tournament.
The 1978 team won the AIAW national title.
</P>
<P>
   Just 35 seconds into the game, Gomez stumbled in the back court
and sprained her right ankle. She pounded the floor and pulled her
jersey over her face before being carried off the court. Gomez did
not return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   She said from the trainers' room that Roxanne Manning had
stepped on her.
</P>
<P>
   She later returned to the bench with her foot wrapped in a towel
and her eyes red.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins continued on anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of our team,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said.
``When Gomez went down, they showed character. They had a lot of
confidence and they took it to them. It was a total team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to go down low and use the height advantage with
6-foot-4 Janae Hubbard and 6-3 Maylana Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was virtually unstoppable, scoring 21 points, including
12 in the first half. Martin finished with 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our size was too much for (them),'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Melanie Pearson found the zone for the
Bruins. She scored 15 of her 17 points in the second half,
including all nine in a 9-0 run that put the Bruins ahead 52-42
with 9 minutes, 42 seconds to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   LaCresha Flannigan also chipped in with 14 of her 16 in the
second half, including eight by free throw and five by free throw
in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Greco replaced Gomez at the point and played all 40
minutes, scoring eight points _ including the team's only field
goal in the last six minutes _ and getting two assists.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the free-throw shooting. Colorado State battled
back to within one point, 67-66, with 2:12 left. UCLA made 9 of 14
free throws in the final two minutes to stay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA dominated the inside game in the first half. Hubbard, who
at 6-4 is taller than the entire Colorado State team, scored 12
points.
</P>
<P>
   The other post players, Maylana Martin and 6-4 Carly Funicello,
scored four points apiece, but Martin seemed content to stay at the
top of the key and throw the ball into Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   The teams began the game shooting from outside _ and missing.
Colorado State, which relies on its 3-point shooting, stuck to its
game plan, not attempting anything from inside the 3-point line for
the first 6:45. In that span, the Rams scored once, by Jacque
Johnson with 13:52 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, UCLA wasn't shooting much better, having scored
just six points.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State also had troubles dribbling the ball, being
called for traveling eight times in the first half and 10 for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   After Flannigan hit an outside jumper to give the Bruins a 10-3
lead, Colorado State scored 12 of the game's next 16 points to take
a 15-12 lead. In that span, five people scored points.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA closed the half with a 10-4 run and take a 26-25 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams finished the first half shooting 27.6 percent, compared
to 35.1 percent for the Bruins.

GOMEZ TO HAVE X-RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA point guard Erica Gomez will undergo X-rays
this morning on her right ankle to determine if she can play in
Monday's women's basketball West Regional final against Louisiana
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez injured her ankle early in the first half of the Bruins'
77-68 victory over Colorado State on Saturday night at the Sports
Arena, when she stepped on the foot of Colorado State's Roxanne
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was unsure after the game if she could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hanging in there. We'll see what happens,'' Gomez said.
``It's throbbing a little bit. It's a little bit swollen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was forced to wear an ankle boot and walk on crutches
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Without Gomez, UCLA relied on former Crescenta Valley star
Michelle Greco at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I feel) terrible,'' Gomez said. ``It's hard to sit there and
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed signal: A UCLA fan hung this sign inside the Sports Arena:
``I'm here because the men's team stinks. Fire Steve Lavin!''
</P>
<P>
   No preference: Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore might have the
top-seeded team in the West Regional, but he wasn't about to say
which team he wanted to face following the Lady Techsters' 73-52
victory over Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always a tricky question. I would like to play the
worst team, no matter who that is,'' Barmore said, declining to say
whether he preferred UCLA or Colorado State. ``Regardless of who we
play, it will be difficult. Colorado State has a large fan
following and UCLA will be playing at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant offense: The most impressive early performance was
turned in by Louisiana Tech guard Betty Lennox, who 19 points in 18
minutes off the bench against LSU.
</P>
<P>
   She scored seven straight points in a one-minute, 14-second span
in the first half that turned a 15-10 LSU lead into a 17-15
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she came in and hurt us a lot,'' LSU guard Marie
Ferdinand said. ``We didn't expect her to shoot the way she did. We
had the game under control until she came in.''
</P>
<P>
   No bragging rights: Although they beat the big in-state school,
Louisiana Tech wasn't exactly cherishing its victory over LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to go all the way,'' Lennox said. ``It didn't
really matter that we played them. It didn't make the game any
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency lettering job: LSU forward Detrina White was wearing
the wrong jersey number (35 instead of 23) after the Lady Tigers
manager forgot to pack her jersey to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So LSU improvised, taking White's new jersey to a lettering shop
across from their downtown hotel. Her name was spelled correctly,
but barely resembled the other players' jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament sightings: It almost looked like a current and
ex-coaches convention inside the Sports Arena. USC coach Chris
Gobrecht and her predecessor, Fred Williams, were in attendance.
Williams is an assistant with the WNBA's Utah Starzz. Also on hand
was Alemany coach Melissa Hearlihy, who had former Indians center
Carly Funicello playing for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Since USC is hosting the regional, former All-Americans Lisa
Leslie and Tina Thompson were given courtside seats for the
contests.

 &HT;    BOTH WINGS OF GOP TAKING SOFTER LINE ON ABORTION
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opposition to abortion appears to be fading as a
political litmus test for candidates at all levels of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
is drawing both criticism and support with his kinder, gentler
rhetoric that counsels patience on outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the rhetoric is kinder and gentler still among those charged
with recruiting GOP candidates for the crucial 2000 congressional
races. In fact, the chief House recruiter, Rep. Tom Davis of
Virginia, says he rarely broaches the subject with prospective
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't discuss it all,'' Davis said at a breakfast with
political reporters last week. ``If it comes up, it's only in the
context of where your district is and how you are going to handle
the issue. I don't have a litmus test on that issue for the party,
and I don't think it's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Never in the two decades since the Ronald Reagan-led Republican
Party first made a constitutional ban on abortions a part of its
party platform has the GOP seemed so tolerant of those who disagree
that ``the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life
which cannot be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The party is ``hungry for victory,'' explained Frank Luntz, the
Republican pollster behind the ``Contract With America'' that led
to the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the hunger has produced unusual political theater as
some of the staunchest foes of abortion rally around Bush to
protect him from attacks by other abortion opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, the
main supporters of the GOP's anti-abortion platform plank, said
recently on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that he ``totally'' agrees
with Bush's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well take the incremental approach,'' Robertson
said, at least until Supreme Court has changed enough to overturn
Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   And late last week, the National Right to Life Committee urging
anti-abortion candidates and their supporters to refrain from
criticizing Bush. ``Governor Bush has a pro-life record and has
taken a pro-life position,'' said the group's executive director,
David N. O'Steen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he opposes abortions except in cases involving
rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother. He also has
said that Roe v. Wade will not be overturned ``until our hearts are
changed'' and that, until then, ``we should focus on ways to reduce
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he has stated that the Republican Party should
``maintain its pro-life tenor,'' he has deliberately avoided
endorsing the anti-abortion language of the 1996 GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
   That has left him open to attacks from Gary Bauer, Dan Quayle,
Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes, all of whom are starting to raise
questions about Bush's commitment to ending abortion as a way of
slowing the Texas governor's juggernaut to the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is human life, and when Republicans begin to play
games with it, we send a signal that we are not a serious governing
party,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Rev. Jerry Falwell said on CNN last week that the
Republican Party would be a ``losing minority'' if it abandoned its
anti-abortion principles.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, though, conservative author David Horowitz
predicted the GOP would remain ``a minority party for a
generation'' if it keeps its ``pro-life'' platform intact.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for Republican candidates is that their party's
nominating process is often dominated by anti-abortion activists.
Candidates must walk a tightrope, taking a stand firm enough to win
the nomination, but not so rigid as to alienate the more centrist
voters in general elections.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Davis suggested that the party's platform is not important in
his job of recruiting the kind of candidates who can help keep
Republicans a majority in the House after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the party platforms are traditionally big
winners or losers,'' he said. ``I think the presidential candidates
set the tone, not the party platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to abortion ``is not a litmus test to join the
Republican Party,'' he added, ``and even if it's in the platform,
we have a wide variety of views.''
</P>
<P>
   In recruiting candidates for the party, ``you have to cut the
cloth to fit the coat,'' he added. And in American politics today,
``where the rubber is meeting the road is in the suburbs,'' where
libertarianism sentiments often run strong, the Republican Party's
anti-abortion stand is not always popular, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said the GOP's moderation on
abortion is ``nothing more than a campaign strategy'' and that the
party's ultimate goal is still ultimately to outlaw abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman vowed that her organization, the nation's largest
abortion-rights advocacy group, would work to expose the ``great
pretenders'' in the Republican Party.

   HAITI-FUTURE _ PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ With American taxpayers
more than $2 billion in the hole when it comes to Haiti, a growing
number of Congressmen are increasingly concerned about the
effectiveness of U.S. aid to the h00emisphere's poorest country.
But as Haiti faces its worst political crisis since a U.S.-led
force restored the democratic process there in 1994, what could
make aid more effective? Many Haiti watchers argue aid should be
more focused on rural areas, noting that only 7 percent of U.S. aid
now goes to rural areas, home to two-thirds of Haiti's population.
Still others argue that all aid should be cut off except emergency
food aid. Bottom line: Whatever the solution, U.S. policy toward
Haiti cannot continue as it now stands. (Emling, Cox News Service)

But she's not like American girls. Born with no arms, and born in
Haiti -- the hemisphere's poorest country -- Maderges was abandoned
by her parents0 when s he was three months old. But, fortunately,
she was deposited at the front door of the privately funded St.
Vincent's School for Handicapped Children, the only place in this
Caribbean country that takes care of children with disabilities. At
the school, a dilapidated building that looks more like an old
motel, she has learned to accept the challenges of her disability
by using her feet -- to eat, to write and to dress. Developing.

   SALESMAN-WITHOUT-WARES (Undated) _ Willy Loman is the world's
most famous failed salesman, but what did he sell? During the
50-year existence of ``Death of a Salesman,'' Arthur Miller's words
have entranced audiences with Willy's inflated dreams for his sons,
his affair and his suicide: all the while refusing to disclose what
Willy lugged in his valises. Willy's real wares may appear to be
inconsequential because what he sold was himself, and ultimately,
there was no demand for his product. By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   DIVERSITY-POETS (Undated) _ The Academy of American Poets, a
65-year-old organization that is at the symbolic heart of the
American poetry establishment, is making what it calls significant
changes in its structure in response to criticism that it is an
elitist group, dominated by white male poets. By Dinitia Smith.
</P>
<P>
   FREDY-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The subtitle of ``Fredy Neptune: A
Novel in Verse'' suggests that this suspiciously hyper-picaresque
ricochet through the hells of our century is a novel disguised as a
poem. In fact, it is a poem disguised as a novel disguised as a
poem, as written by Les Murray. Reviewed by Richard Eder.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-THEATER-REVIEW (New Haven) _ ``Working'' is a musical
about people who are never in musicals. The hard hats, cleaning
women, parking lot attendants and bricklayers portrayed in this
sweet-tempered revue are propelled from the chorus line of life
into unlikely leading roles. All get the chance in this show to
exercise their inalienable American right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of a boffo production number. Reviewed by Peter Marks.

   RAVEL-OPERA-REVIEW (New York) _ Ravel at home was small,
fastidious, and obsessively elegant in dress. Ravel also collected
figurines and porcelain ranging, his friends said, from the
discreet to the ``quite bad.'' ``L'Heure Espagnole'' and ``L'Enfant

   BORDERLESS-BOOK-BUYING (Undated) _ Computer users in the
expanding world of electronic commerce in literature can ignore
global borders with ease. When a book published in London is
purchased from a computer attached to a desk in New York is the
sale taking place in England or the United States? What takes
precedence in defining international publisher's rights: cyberspace
or actual geography? The answers are still evolving. By Doreen
Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE-FOR-GIRLS (San Francisco) _ It is hard to be small and
unknown, particularly in the CD-ROM games market. Purple Moon,
which sought and failed to make a viable business out of computer
games for girls _ games that unlike current top-sellers in the
category, were not about eyeshadow selection or nail polish tricks
_ faced an unforgiving battle for shelf space with Mattel, which
claimed six of the top 10 girls' titles last year. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   GATES-BOOK-CHAMELEON (Washington) _ Which is the real Bill
Gates? Is it the author who insists, in his new book, ``Business
(at) the Speed of Thought,'' that all inter-office communications
should flow ``over e-mail so workers can act on news with
reflex-like speed''? Or is it the witness who testified in the
government's antitrust case against his company that he could not
remember dozens of e-mail messages he wrote or received over the
last several years? By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   OUTRAGEOUS-CABLE-TV (Undated) _ The rambunctious next generation
of cable television shows owes a debt to two phenomena of recent
cable seasons: the rude and crude Comedy Central animated series
``South Park'' and the apparently bottomless popularity of
professional wrestling. Programmers are seeking to up the ante in
terms of, in their own words, the ``edginess'' and
``outrageousness'' of their new programming. By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN (Undated) _ This has been the decade in which
software moved, big time, into the industrial designer's world. In
corporate offices across the country, engineers have been booting
up programs that let them tinker, in three dimensions, with every
permutation and combination of a product's design. It was just a
matter of time before engineers would aim their computers at
designing and refining the assembly lines on which those products
are made. And apparently, that time has come. By Claudia H.

   MONICA-BOOK-MEDIA (Manchester, England) _ Although Monica
Lewinsky's tour of Britain has her publishers rubbing their hands
in glee, her American publishers, St. Martin's Press, do not have
as much cause for elation. After a huge initial burst of sales,
``Monica's Story'' has slipped to No. 3 from No. 1 on the New York
Times best-seller list, behind books by George Stephanopoulos and

`FREDY NEPTUNE:' POETIC LICENSE WITH A CALAMITOUS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Freddie Boettcher, an Australian farm boy of German descent,
runs off to sea before World War I. In Constantinople he contracts
leprosy; the disease is arrested, but it leaves him unable to feel
pain or any other physical sensation in most of his body.
</P>
<P>
   This physical blankness plus enormous strength attend a wildly
extravagant career. He is impressed into the German Navy, serves at
a British cavalry station in the Middle East (he meets Lawrence of
Arabia and judges him a popinjay), works as a rough laborer back in
Australia and as a circus strongman (where he gets the name Fredy
Neptune), and goes on a weird gangster mission to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He rides the Depression rails, becomes a Hollywood extra
(Marlene Dietrich brings him lunch and recites Rilke), serves on a
German zeppelin, beats up brownshirts in Bavaria, is strafed by
Japanese planes in World War II and scouts with Australian
commandos in New Guinea. Finally, he settles back home with his
patiently resourceful wife, two grown children and a mentally
impaired German boy he had rescued years before from a Nazi
sterilization squad.
</P>
<P>
   All this (I've been chokingly succinct) makes ``Fredy Neptune''
sound like an antipodean Tintin. Yet the subtitle suggests that
this suspiciously hyper-picaresque ricochet through the hells of
our century is a novel disguised as a poem. In fact, it is a poem
disguised as a novel disguised as a poem.
</P>
<P>
   Les Murray, neither cartoonist nor novelist, is Australia's most
distinguished poet. At the heart of ``Fredy Neptune,'' a heart that
only quite reveals itself toward the last of its 10,000 blank-verse
lines, is a notion so audacious and unnerving as to belong to
poetry's flash of transforming revelation, not fiction's tidal
sea-changes.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the revelation is the meaning of Fredy's physical
numbness. We know it has a metaphorical purpose from the beginning.
Soon we realize that his role is to be a witness to the terrible
events of history.
</P>
<P>
   No detached witness, Fredy launches himself at every outrage as
well as he can, which is not very well. He is a Superman who can't
fly, a Paul Bunyan attended by the tiniest of blue calflets.
Numbness is his only strength, the very condition of sentience.
When the body can't feel, the mind is free to feel everything;
there is no pain to trip the circuit breakers of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fredy'' is only 255 pages, yet so much is packed in each line
(a page would be a chapter of a regular novel) that it seems of
epic length. That is far for the numbness metaphor to extend.
Metaphors are leaps; in an instant they carry us past 30 minutes of
explanation. In ``Fredy'' we may find ourselves trudging with the
metaphor on our back, until the end, when it launches into full
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the adventures varies. The first 80 pages ring an
entrancing set of changes from the very first line (``That was
sausage day/on our farm outside Dungog') to Fredy's return to
Australia after the German Navy, a Berlin hospital and a flight
with a British airman on what turns out to be a quail shoot against
trapped Turks, one that Fredy forcibly terminates.
</P>
<P>
   His struggles to support a family in Depression-wracked
Australia are well told, if less exciting. His adventures in the
United States, on the other hand, are both excessively fantastical
and inert. The intensity of the verse form magnifies the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray's way with language and imagery is thrilling when
it has action and character to sustain. He has given his
protagonist a biting plebeian voice, a vernacular that soars. Here
is Fredy describing an attack by spidery World War I planes in
Palestine:
</P>
<P>
   Three came straining over
</P>
<P>
   from down south, rocking, hanging their pony-trap wheels.
</P>
<P>
   In front of those north hills they stopped and braced above
ground
</P>
<P>
   on their guns' fumy penciling.
</P>
<P>
   A woman is asked how she is managing old age:
</P>
<P>
   Ar, just. I sleep in little squares
</P>
<P>
   like pissy milk chocolate. Once, I'd snore off the whole black
block.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of his estranged body, insensible to pleasure (his
sexual partners have to tell him when he's ready and when he's
finished) and pain. To avoid suspicion, he learns to ``curse when
burnt, hunch when you see it's cold'' and ``remember to get
tired.'' He avoids sleeping in total darkness ``because of the
way/my body, it would fade, and leave me just a self in mid-dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The real meaning of Fredy's condition lights up at the end,
igniting circuits laid earlier. We realize what the physical
deadness signifies: not only defense but atonement for the world's
evil. His leprosy struck him in Constantinople when Turks doused a
group of Armenian women with kerosene and set them alight, ``dark
wicks to great orange flames/whopping and shrieking.'
</P>
<P>
   Its numbness lifts, finally, only after the final horror: the
mushroom clouds over Japan, whose lethal whiteness Fredy prefigures
in his own long white-out. Despairing, he asks how to pray. The
answers are shocking: ``Forgive the Aborigines,'' a voice tells
him. Then, ``Forgive the Jews.'' Then, ``Forgive women.'' (``Those
burning?'' he asks. ``All women,'' the voice replies.)

   It is brilliant, it is awful. Wrong-headed? Suddenly Murray
shatters a deadly contemporary cycle of evil and apology _
Holocaust, apartheid, slavery, Guatemalan genocide and, if you
insist, Monica. There is something freezingly inert about apology:
a way of getting off cheap, of clothing evil with virtue and, even,
a new aggression against the victims. (Why does the proposed Berlin
Holocaust monument arouse such agonized dispute?)
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the Jews, the Aborigines, the Guatemalans? Why? ``For
being on our conscience.'' Yes, it is wrong-headed, even literally:
it stands reason on its head. Murray blasphemes, but then poets do
have the license. Virtuous answers doze off; a poet can provide
dreadful questions to jolt them awake. Literature is an ax wielded
against the frozen sea within us, Kafka wrote. Murray's ax is
barbarous but something has just cracked inside me.

`WORKING': THE WORKING STIFF'S ANGST FROM MASON TO WAITRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (Eds: Production notes at end.) 
(DW) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ ``Working'' is a musical about people who are
never in musicals. The hard hats, cleaning women, parking lot
attendants and bricklayers portrayed in this sweet-tempered revue
are propelled from the chorus line of life into unlikely leading
roles. The trucker on a long haul, the operator on a short break,
the waitress on a circuit of the dining room: all get the chance in
this show to exercise their inalienable American right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of a boffo production number.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unashamed celebration of the common man, as wholesome as
a Labor Day picnic. Based on Studs Terkel's identically titled
book, a compilation of verbatim interviews with dozens of workers
about their daily toils, this 1978 musical attempts nothing fancier
than to spread the message through song that virtually everyone
takes pride on the job and, by golly, deserves a little respect for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Is this premise enough for an evening's entertainment? Well . .
. let's just say . . . um . . . almost. ``Working,'' with an
appealingly eclectic folk-rock score by, among others, James
Taylor, Stephen Schwartz, Mary Rodgers, Craig Carnelia and Micki
Grant, was nevertheless a bust in its original incarnation on
Broadway two decades ago; the overblown and overlong production
tried much too hard to jazz up what should have been a gentler
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at last, in a revival at the Long Wharf Theater here,
``Working'' is getting the loving, small-scale handling it was
always meant to receive. This new version, streamlined by its
adapters, Schwartz and Nina Faso, to 90 minutes, was first produced
movingly at the Signature Theater in Arlington, Va., last season.
It's an unpretentious re-imagining that in its most satisfying
moments digs out the poignant internal struggles in the bedrock
American lives it seeks to glorify.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ashley, who directed, and Dawn DiPasquale, credited
with the ``musical staging,'' which presumably means the minimal
choreography, do extremely well by their Broadway-caliber cast;
Pamela Isaacs (``The Life'') and Emily Skinner (``Side Show'') are
among the members of the talented ensemble that also includes John
Herrera, Alix Korey, Matthew Saldivar, Gavin DeGraw, Ann Harada,
Ken Prymus and Rex Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something of a knee-jerk impulse to
sentimentality in much of the material they perform, a tendency to
pablum, that dims the power of ``Working.'' It's not exactly
agitprop, but the show at times displays its biases so baldly it
comes across as a rather corny commercial for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers can be quite affecting; Taylor's elegiac
``Millwork,'' for instance, set in a luggage factory and sung with
a smoldering sense of loss by the excellent Ms. Skinner, is a
masterly precis on a kind of suffering that OSHA's regulations
cannot quash. As Ms. Isaacs and other cast members work a
plastic-molding machine, realistically rendered by the set designer
Neil Patel, Ms. Skinner tells her story of the snuffing out of a
spirit on the assembly line _ ``Millwork, it ain't nothin' but an
awful boring job'' _ and that does, truly, sound like America
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Many other times, however, ``Working'' settles for the
uncomfortably facile. When a homemaker sings of her loneliness
(``Just a Housewife''), when a stoneworker declares his joy in the
durability of a wall (``The Mason''), when a migrant worker dreams
of a better life (``Un Mejor Dia Vendra''), the audience knows from
the first syllables where the number is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show's creators updated some of the vignettes _
corporate raiding and word processing, for example, were not yet
popular pursuits when the musical was first put to paper _ many of
the numbers still sound slightly antique, as if they should be
background music on television's ``That 70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet overlooking some unremovable stains, a good time can be had
at ``Working'' savoring the better numbers and the cast's expertise
at selling them. (Ms. Korey and DeGraw, for example, have sharp
turns as, respectively, a teacher from a less tolerant era and a
package delivery man with an eye for sunbathing addressees.) As in
any workplace, you have to be willing to compromise.

CRITICIZED AS ELITIST, POETS' ORGANIZATION REVAMPS ITS STRUCTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Academy of American Poets, a 65-year-old
organization that is at the symbolic heart of the American poetry
establishment, is making what it calls significant changes in its
structure in response to criticism that it is an elitist group,
dominated by white male poets.
</P>
<P>
   Ten new poets have been elected to augment the academy's
nine-member board of chancellors, which oversees the awarding of
the $100,000 Tanning Prize, one of the nation's biggest literary
awards, and also has a symbolic importance with a membership that
includes many of America's best known poets. Among those elected
are three African-Americans, Yusef Komunyakaa, Lucille Clifton and
Jay Wright. ( Wright declined to serve, saying he wanted to devote
his time to his work.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Clifton, four women have been elected: Louise
Glueck, Heather McHugh, Adrienne Rich and Rosanna Warren. Also
elected were three white men: Charles Wright, Robert Creeley and
Michael Palmer. Several of the new members are known for their
experimentalism.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Jonathan Galassi, the president of the academy's
board of directors, its governing body, said, ``The difference is
now it's all over the map.'' Referring to the board of chancellors,
he said: ``There are different age groups. The board is more
representative of the many things going on in poetry today.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year two prominent poets, Maxine Kumin and Carolyn Kizer,
brought longstanding criticism of the academy to the fore when they
resigned from the board of chancellors to protest the absence of
blacks and women. The German writer Fred Viebahn, who is married to
Rita Dove, a black poet and former Poet Laureate of the United
States, criticized the academy in International Quarterly for what
he called ``unapologetic racial `purity' and gross gender
imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellors and the board of directors met in January to
discuss ways of revamping the organization, said Bill Wadsworth,
the executive director. Questionnaires were sent out to 500 poets
and arts administrators, asking for suggestions. The directors
voted on the new chancellors early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Galassi said that broadening the organization's board of
directors was ``our next project.'' While there are 10 women on the
28-member board, there is only one black, Jamaica Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   Galassi said in a written statement: ``All of us involved in the
academy, directors, chancellors and staff, soon came to recognize
that the controversy in which the organization was embroiled
represented an opportunity to evaluate from the ground up how it
could best carry out its mission to support and promote the work of
American poets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chancellors will join John Ashbery, Jorie Graham, John
Hollander, Richard Howard, Donald Justice, J.D. McClatchy, W.S.
Merwin, Mark Strand and David Wagoner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to overseeing the Tanning Prize, the board of
chancellors also gives out the academy's prestigious $20,000
fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the chancellors choose their fellow board members, but
the new members were elected on March 10 by the board of directors.
In the future the board of chancellors will continue to elect its
own members, Galassi said, but with more restrictive term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Until now chancellors have been allowed to serve for two 12-year
terms. Their terms will now be limited to six years, but they will
eligible for re-election after they have been off the board for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the board of chancellors from becoming static, the
academy has also set up a rotation system, Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year three chancellors whose terms are up will rotate off
the board and be replaced by three new poets.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year three longtime chancellors, Wagoner,
Hollander and Ashbery, will retire from the board.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a change in the way the Tanning Prize is
awarded. In the past the chancellors have been criticized for
giving the prize mainly to white male poets, including one of their
own members, Merwin, in 1994, and Anthony Hecht, a chancellor
emeritus, in 1997. Ms. Rich received the prize in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Galassi said the chancellors would be ineligible to receive any
academy prize during their tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellors also are being asked to take a more active role
in the organization. Until now they have not met regularly. In the
future they will be asked to meet annually.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, based in New York, was founded in 1934. In addition
to awarding prizes it sponsors readings and panels, the ``On-Line
Poetry Classroom'' and other educational programs and the Poetry
Book Club. It also coordinates National Poetry Month, which is in
April.

THE NEW REPUBLIC LOOKS TO A REDESIGN TO STAY AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When does an 85-year-old need a face lift?
</P>
<P>
   When it is The New Republic, a weekly opinion magazine facing
stagnant circulation, flat advertising revenue, an editorial
merry-go-round, a scandal or two in the ranks of its reporters and
the smorgasbord of opinion that the major newsweekly magazines and
television news programs serve to their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal opinion magazine, which is owned by Martin Peretz,
has not been redesigned for so long that no one there can remember
the last time anyone changed anything, except maybe the masthead.
</P>
<P>
   It was founded in 1914 by Herbert Croly, a politically active
author, when the notion of a weekly magazine offering opinion was
still new. The New Republic's mission, Croly wrote at the time, was
to ``throw a few firecrackers under the skirts of the old women on
the bench and in other high places.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days everyone seems to be throwing firecrackers, said
Charles Lane, the magazine's editor since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion market is flooded,'' Lane said. ``It's not just a
couple of magazines anymore. It's the Internet, it's everybody on
television, and it's that newspapers that used to eschew
point-of-view writing but now incorporate it more and more into
what is ostensibly news coverage. So the competition is that much
more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The bandages come off in the issue dated April 12, courtesy of
Roger Black, the designer who has jazzed up magazines from Foreign
Affairs and Reader's Digest to Harper's Bazaar and Premiere. The
approximately 100,000 New Republic readers, accustomed to
arid-as-tundra pages dense with three-column type leavened only
sporadically by a line drawing, will now get a magazine with
internal color, bold graphics, photographs, more illustrations and
bigger type.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the redesign, Lane said, was to stimulate
newsstand sales and differentiate The New Republic from the
ever-growing stable of weekly opinion magazines, a group that
includes The Nation, The National Review and The Weekly Standard,
as well as smaller fish like National Journal, once a journal of
research that now offers opinion to 7,000 Washington readers. There
are, too, online magazines like Slate and Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Will Lippincott, The New Republic's publisher, predicted that
the new design would bolster advertising revenue, ad pages and
circulation, which have all been flat for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fresh and frisky,'' Lippincott added. ``The
goal is to get us in front of advertisers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The frisky redesign, however, will also burnish the image of a
magazine that has had plenty of turbulence recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a period of editorial instability, and that certainly
registered,'' Peretz said, referring to his search for an editor
after he dismissed Michael Kelly, who went to National Journal in
1996. ``It was very problematic for our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Peretz said the magazine, which is now losing close to $500,000
a year, was briefly in the black in the early 1990s. ``But it was
the kind of in-the-black that, if I had taken the staff out to a
spaghetti dinner, we would have been in the red again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic's masthead was in flux from 1989 to 1996 as it
lost editors in rapid sequence, due in part to Peretz's
often-mercurial administrative style as editor in chief: first
Michael Kinsley, then Hendrik Hertzberg, Andrew Sullivan and Kelly.
The magazine then underwent a period of almost a year when it was
steered by a troika of acting editors. Lane, eventually named to
the top spot, had been a senior editor at the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The political atmosphere has also presented some problems for
the magazine. Peretz's decades-long friendship with Vice President
Al Gore has led some in Washington circles to question his
objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Peretz and Kelly clashed over coverage of President Clinton and
Gore; when Kelly was dismissed, Peretz called him ``an obsessive
right-winger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a disastrous mistake hiring him,'' Peretz said then.
</P>
<P>
   But he defends his objectivity, pointing to a recent editorial
touting the virtues of Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator,
as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's search for a fresh identity was also stalled last
year when an associate editor, Stephen Glass, admitted to having
fabricated part or all of 24 articles. And The New Republic has
retained three public relations firms in the last year, finally
settling on Rubenstein Associates.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine hopes its redesign will keep it above the waves
churned up by other political outlets now drawing attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even the country's oldest weekly magazine, The Nation, has
spiffed itself up recently and now puts together ocean cruises for
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   And while The New Republic is not sponsoring voyages around the
Caribbean, it is offering the chance to win a trip to Washington.
The winner of a new-subscriber sweepstakes will attend a New
Republic editorial meeting and be given two seats at a White House
Correspondents Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, editor and publisher of the conservative Weekly
Standard, which is owned by News Corp., said that all political
opinion magazines must always struggle to answer a central
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, The New Republic had a clear question,'' Kristol
said. ``They were the anticommunist liberals. Under Mike Kelly,
they were going to be liberals who weren't compromised by Bill
Clinton. The Nation, for example, is always addressing the question
of how to revitalize progressive politics. I am not sure now what
question it is The New Republic is grappling with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that the magazine had always been concerned with
liberalism and its discontents. ``What does liberalism mean in the
21st century?'' he said. ``We answer it a lot of different ways,
but that is what we are obsessed with. We answer it prescriptively
and descriptively, through attitude and point of view, and through
definitions of what liberalism isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weekly Standard is a pamphlet. The New Republic is a set
of arguments, ideas and questions. It is not something you read to
reconfirm what you thought before you opened it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley, now the editor of Slate, the online magazine published
by Microsoft Corp., said he had no comment on The New Republic now
on the newsstands, but that he was looking forward to the new
design and the sweepstakes: ``If you win the contest, can you write
an editorial about Al Gore?'' he asked. ``I guess I'll have to
enter it.''

   ``It's just the interest,'' Ms. Calderbank said, straining to
find Ms. Lewinsky, the biggest celebrity to appear in Manchester
for some time, who was deep in the bowels of the County Bookshop.
``I saw one of the interviews,'' she said. ``I don't remember which
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Having metamorphosed from a voiceless cipher in the eye of a
Washington storm into an international figure on a whistle-stop
book-selling tour of Britain, Ms. Lewinsky last week drew gawkers
and book buyers wherever she went. Traveling with her own entourage
_ driver, bodyguard, publisher and publicist _ she signed and sold
some 900 books at each appearance, helping to muscle her tell-all
book, ``Monica's Story,'' to its current place at No. 1 on the
best-seller list of The Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has watched the scandal unfold from afar, with a mix of
horror and bewilderment. But the story has been so ubiquitous here
that Ms. Lewinsky has come to be viewed as the world's celebrity,
not just America's.
</P>
<P>
   David Crombie, the sales director for Michael O'Mara, the book's
British publisher, said 40,000 copies of the first printing of
100,000 copies had sold. By comparison, he said, the average first
printing of a hardcover book in Britain is 3,000 copies. ``By the
end of the tour, she will have signed 25,000 copies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appearances, which require Ms. Lewinsky to smile,
sign and say ``thank you'' for hours at a time, seem destined to
leave her with repetitive strain injury of the mouth as well as the
hand, they appear to have gone smoothly so far. Authors on book
tours tend to be surrounded by bubbles of good will, and most of
the people Ms. Lewinsky has met have been alternately awe-struck
and supportive. (The one exception was at Harrods in London, where
the rude questions of the boisterous paparazzi caused her to burst
into tears and flee the room.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky _ who in Manchester was an eggshell-blue-suited
vision of equanimity in a sea of chaos, her hair sprayed into
submission _ remained politely sphinx-like, hoping to let the book
speak for itself. ``The interest has been phenomenal,'' said
Crombie, describing how Britons' jaws drop when they catch a
glimpse of Ms. Lewinsky strolling into a hotel or restaurant. ``She
scared the living daylights out of a guy in a lift the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Lewinsky's grueling 17-day tour of Britain has her
publishers rubbing their hands in glee, her American publishers,
St. Martin's Press, do not have as much cause for elation. After a
huge initial burst of sales, ``Monica's Story'' has slipped to No.
3 from No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, behind books
by George Stephanopoulos and Tom Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because after her much-watched interview with
Barbara Walters, which sent people flocking to the stores, Ms.
Lewinsky left the United States and did not do any more publicity.
``We didn't want to oversaturate the audience,'' said John Murphy,
a spokesman for St. Martin's, a unit of Macmillian Publishers Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   But while she has been away, sales have fallen off
precipitously. At Borders, for instance, sales last Thursday were
only half of what they had been the Thursday before, said Jody
Kohn, the director of public relations for the Borders Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was expected back in the United States Sunday, to
attend the Vanity Fair Oscar party in Los Angeles and then to do a
book signing in Century City on Monday. She was then to return to
England briefly before heading to Paris, Germany and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Ms. Lewinsky has been given the full celebrity
treatment at every appearance, but many newspapers, frustrated at
her no-interview policy, have been snippy. Writing in The Daily
Telegraph, Vicki Woods called her a ``bubbleheaded dingbat with
California smog for brains,'' and several papers have gleefully
pointed out that ``Monica's Story'' is selling at a discount at
some stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this book is a disaster,'' Crombie said, ``give me more
disasters.''

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW: THE WIGGLE OF A FINGER SAYS A LOT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JACK ANDERSON    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcel Marceau presented another program of solo
sketches on Saturday night as part of his season at the Kaye
Playhouse. The works of this great French mime can be whimsical,
farcical, bitter, sweet and bittersweet. But most of them are
gentle in tone.
</P>
<P>
   He called one of his offerings ``The Seven Deadly Sins.'' Yet
this was in no way a portrait of human beings at their most
monstrous. Most of the follies depicted in this suite, which
received its first New York performance since 1964, were mere
peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the piece was evident in the way Marceau yawned,
bustled and then sank back into sloth in the laziness solo. He
mimed gobbling food and guzzling drinks at a charity dinner to
symbolize greed. Avarice was represented by a hunched-up and
supposedly meek beggar who, when out of everyone else's sight,
luxuriated in riches. Pride was a pompous chess-playing general.
Two artists of different temperaments evoked lust and envy, and
what began as a quiet automobile trip turned into a manic outing in
the anger episode.
</P>
<P>
   Marceau's ability to make even the slightest wiggle of a finger
expressive was evident in ``The Hands,'' in which, as the title
promised, his hands pointed, beckoned, implored and flew up in
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The entire second half of the program was devoted to sketches
concerning Bip, the fellow whose big hat has a red flower growing
out of it and who serves as Marceau's equivalent of Everyman. A new
solo, ``Bip Remembers,'' had its somber moments, as Bip mimetically
looked back upon his life and our own century, gesturally recalling
war and the gesticulations of a Hitler-like demagogue. But Bip also
had memories of going to parties, embracing a beloved and riding a
merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bip sketches were essentially comic. Even ``Bip
Commits Suicide'' was far from distressing. In this solo, Bip did
indeed try to end his life. Yet he discovered that every method of
suicide he contemplated was either unappealing or ineffectual. Thus
he realized that if he was going to shoot himself, he had to cover
an ear so as not to be disturbed by the noise. And a supposedly
poisonous concoction he invented apparently tasted delicious when
he drank it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bip as a Baby Sitter'' found him trying to entertain some
children. The tots were invisible, but one knew from his reactions
that they could be little devils. ``Bip as a Street Musician'' made
effective use of recorded music as Marceau portrayed a violinist
whose fiddling was drowned out by a passing parade.
</P>
<P>
   Gyongyi Biro and Alexander Neander introduced each sketch by
holding a placard bearing its title. And the poses these young
mimes adopted to do so ranged from the elegant to the comical.
</P>
<P>
   Marceau's performances continue through March 28 at the Kaye
Playhouse at Hunter College.

NEW YORK CITY OPERA: A LOVE OF GLITTER IN WORKS BY RAVEL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ravel at home was small, fastidious, obsessively
elegant in dress and well satisfied that visitors walking through
his rooms could find no trace, other than a piano, that he was
connected to music. Ravel also collected figurines and porcelain
ranging, his friends said, from the discreet to the ``quite bad.''
``L'Heure Espagnole'' and ``L'Enfant et les Sortileges,'' which
played at the New York City Opera on Friday night, would have fit
nicely on his shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the more graphic songs, these brief one-acters
constitute the composer's adventures into musical theater.
``L'Heure Espagnole'' is by far the thinner of the two. The
adulterous triangle of a Paisiello or Rossini comic opera is
expanded to five sides (three lovers, one husband, one wife), all
choreographed to the ticking of many clocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maurice Sendak-Frank Corsaro production, the Clockmaker
(ominously named Torquemada but gently played by John Lankston)
acts as a magical ringmaster, summoning his mechanical devices to
action with a wave and directing the people around him with similar
omniscience. Gonzalve the tenorial poet, done agreeably here by
Thomas Trotter, competes with the overweight charms of Don Inigo
Gomez, sung in a lovely baritone by Kevin Glavin.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Ollmann and Amy Burton take the principal parts. Both sing
with great competence and occasionally with real charm, and would
have made an even better effect without the self-referential smirks
and slightly exaggerated gestures imposed upon them.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a hard time grasping humor that resides in the
material alone, the kind that comes through only if offered with
deadly and unimpeded seriousness. Farce played by Hamlet is funnier
than farce in the hands of clowns. Corsaro is far from excessive,
but there is just enough editorial comment in his direction to
spoil the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sendak's set is as mild as the material he is working with:
cutouts of a Spanish cityscape and various props of mechanical
simplicity. Ravel's score, like his house, is charming, meticulous
and somewhat precious. The smoothed-over rhythms and phrygian
melody sound a little like musical Spain as Yves Saint Laurent
might market it.
</P>
<P>
   ``L'Enfant et les Sortileges'' inspires Sendak with more
ambition. Animated illustration and real people onstage collide
boldly. Cartoon flames leap around the flailing Child; clouds roll
in and out; the nursery is framed by the artist's fancifully drawn
house and trees. It is a fascinating attempt to connect the human
and the artificial, and one that needs more exploring. One day it
will truly convince the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ravel's opera _ the story of a bad boy whose toys, pets and
books take anthropomorphic revenge for his cruelty toward them _ is
much more substantial than its companion piece. Marguerite Krull
sings passionately as the Child. Surrounding her is a parade of
dancers and singers portraying armchairs, teacups, amorous cats,
trees and birds, all presented with great musical variety.
</P>
<P>
   Both works issue from the tinselly side of Ravel's brain, the
source of his love for ornament, glitter and the tastefully
sentimental. Absent is the austere, simple Ravel, the reverential
Classicist, the one, by the way, that I prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences who tolerate whimsy well will find satisfaction in the
City Opera double bill. George Manahan leads clean and competently
played performances. The productions provoke interest. The singing
is seamlessly good if only occasionally arresting. The next
performances come on March 25 and are worth a trip.

GATES BOOK OFFERS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Which is the real Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the author who insists, in his new book, ``Business (AT)
the Speed of Thought,'' that all interoffice communications should
flow ``over e-mail so workers can act on news with reflex-like
speed'' _ adding that meetings should not be ``used to present
information'' because ``it's more efficient to use e-mail''?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it the witness who testified in the government's antitrust
case against his company that he could not remember dozens of
e-mail messages he wrote or received in recent years, dismissing
one long internal message full of market data, by saying ``I don't
know what we're talking about'' and ``I mean, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., never mentions the
antitrust trial in the 470-page book, which his publisher, Warner
Books, a unit of Time Warner Inc., will begin selling next week. It
is a treatise on a favorite theme, the notion that just about every
corporate problem can be helped if not solved with the right
hardware and software, or ``digital infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates speaks of a ``digital nervous system'' and ``living the
Web lifestyle'' _ phrases that many Microsoft employees repeat in
conversation like the favored sayings of Chairman Mao. So it is
probably true that the voluble, enthusiastic Gates selling his
vision in this book more closely approximates the man than the
guarded, argumentative and poorly informed defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   The difference might have proved damaging to Microsoft, since it
could be perceived as undermining the credibility of Gates'
testimony. But it appears that damage is already done. Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case in U.S. District Court,
has already said he does not consider Gates an effective witness.
</P>
<P>
   While the antitrust suit being pressed by the federal government
and 19 states is not alluded to even obliquely in this book, many
of Gates' ideas and assertions do collide with parts of Microsoft's
defense in court.
</P>
<P>
   For example, throughout the book, Gates describes how he has
pushed Microsoft employees to do absolutely everything on line,
practically banishing paper. He demanded a few years ago to be
shown every paper form in use at Microsoft and then promptly banned
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this book goes to press,'' he writes, ``we have reduced the
number of paper forms from more than 1,000 to a company-wide total
of 60 forms.''
</P>
<P>
   When the blueprint for an office building on Microsoft's campus
could not be located immediately, Gates recalls, he insisted that
every blueprint and related paper for every structure Microsoft
owns be digitized and made available on line.
</P>
<P>
   He argues forcefully that a key to success is placing all sales
and marketing data on a company's intranet so everyone can see and
use it. ``There's incredible value in letting everybody involved
with a product, even the most junior team member, understand the
history, the pricing. They should be seeing their sales numbers,
expense breakdown, vendor and contractor costs and the status of
major projects on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing your numbers is a fundamental precept of business.''
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to explain the testimony of a key Microsoft witness,
Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when asked if he had
made any attempt to determine from the company's records ``how much
of Microsoft's reported profits come from operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee answered: ``I was surprised, but I will be honest
with you, the state of Microsoft's internal accounting systems do
not always rise to the level of sophistication one might expect
from a firm as successful as it is. They record operating system
sales by hand, on sheets of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee may get an opportunity to address this seeming
contradiction; he is expected to be one of the rebuttal witnesses
Microsoft calls when the trial resumes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Gates does offer a detailed narrative of his company's long road
to the Internet, a story that dovetails with Microsoft's
presentations on the subject in court but that government lawyers
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, we were not focused on the Internet,'' he writes.
``It was a fifth or sixth priority.'' The only Internet presence at
Microsoft then, he recalls, was a demonstration set up on a folding
table in an office hallway, ``with handwritten instructions'' and
cables held in place with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   But several junior employees hectored him and other executives
to pay attention, he writes; by the spring of 1994, after many
meetings, he announced in an e-mail to his staff, ``We are going to
make a big bet on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, that was only two days after Netscape
Communications Corp. had been founded. The government charges that
a key motivation for Microsoft's Internet strategy was to undermine
Netscape, the most important competitor in what was then an infant
market. In particular, the government contends that Microsoft
decided to bundle the Internet Explorer, its Web browser software,
with the Windows operating system to gain competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Microsoft's current strategy to counter that charge is
to stop using the word ``browser.'' At Microsoft, it seems, the
word is banned. Internet Explorer is not a browser at all, company
executives say. It is a package of ``Web browsing technologies''
that is part of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   At Gates' deposition, government lawyers questioned him about
this, asking, ``Is there an effort on your part or, insofar as you
are aware, on other people's parts, to change the way words are
used'' as a means of advancing Microsoft's case? He gave no clear
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally executives do slip and utter the B word. Among them
is Gates. On page 163, he notes that, after years of lagging in
Internet software and services, ``now we lead in several major
Internet areas and have a growing number of people using our
browser.''

2 BOOKS ON A NEW DISCIPLINE : WHITENESS STUDIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One is not born, one becomes a white person, to adapt
Simone de Beauvoir's famous dictum about becoming a woman. To
become a woman or a black means to become part of a system of
beliefs, habits or laws that generally rates you somewhere between
mildly sub-par and thoroughly inferior. To become successfully male
or white means that you should accept as right and natural a system
that, subtly or blatantly, declares you the most intelligent,
handsome and gifted of all people.
</P>
<P>
   But let us make this more personal. Let us follow the art
historian Maurice Berger into his mother's bedroom, where he sits
as a small child, watching her perform her daily beauty ablutions.
First, he writes in ``White Lies'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1999),
a memoir that is also first-rate social history and cultural
criticism, ``She would brush her jet-black hair, applying gobs of
foul-smelling, viscous pomades in an effort to relax her tight,
kinky curls into gentle waves.'' Then came moisturizer, then
concealer, then foundation, ``many shades lighter than her olive
complexion, and a dusting of chalky face powder.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's mother was a Sephardic Jew with a Hispanic-sounding
maiden name. She had been slapped with ethnic slurs, and she had
lost jobs (she was a singer) because she looked ``too dark'' or
``too Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the mutabilities and treacheries of race! In 19th-century
America, Berger observes, the law in many states would have
declared people black who were much fairer than his mother, because
of small traces of African blood. But: ``By the 1920s, my dark,
small grandfather could slip past rigid quotas and through U.S.
Immigration as white on the basis of his word and the implied
promise that he would strive to meet the immigrant ideal of an
all-American whiteness.''
</P>
<P>
   All-American whiteness requires high maintenance, and if it
isn't accompanied by social and economic privilege it will not
yield maximum profits. What did Mrs. Berger's beauty ritual do for
her?
</P>
<P>
   Her son writes: ``It kept away the black and Hispanic neighbors,
whom she loathed, and the white Jews who shopped in her favorite
supermarkets and whom she openly castigated but secretly envied
because they were not dark and because they were not poor. . . .
She didn't look whiter _ she looked like a person who was
concealing something under layers of greasepaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteness should appear natural and inevitable, as the film
historian Richard Dyer makes clear in ``White'' (Routledge, 1997),
his terrifically intelligent examination of how the visual media,
from painting to photography to film, represents whiteness as the
esthetic ideal of the West.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he observes, ``A person is deemed visibly white
because of a quite complicated interaction of elements, of which
flesh tones within the pink to beige range are only one: the shape
of the nose, eyes and lips, the color and set of hair, even body
shape may all be mobilized to determine someone's `color.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even that Teutonic goddess Marlene Dietrich needed help. Her
mentor and director, Josef von Sternberg, narrowed what he labeled
her ``broad Slavic nose'' by drawing a silver line down the center
and lighting it from above. (About illusion, they were never wrong,
the Old Masters.)
</P>
<P>
   Film technology spent decades struggling mightily with the
problem of how to turn all those pink and beige skin tones into
whiter shades of pale. Not to mention blondness: to achieve that on
camera, hair had to be backlighted and its strands arranged as
loosely as possible, a film manual of 1920 advised directors and
cinematographers.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the March 22 issue of The New Yorker traces this
obsession through the blazingly successful ad campaigns of the
post-World War II hair dye industry. ``If I've only one life, let
me live it as a blonde!'' cried millions of women, reaching for
their bottles of Miss Clairol.
</P>
<P>
   Of course politics and pseudo-science made invaluable
contributions. Dyer reminds us that the British spent much of the
19th century depicting the Irish as apelike rebels possessed of
Negro blood. Immigration to America helped them shed these
associations eventually. But Berger cites a race questionnaire
given to a group of Canadian schoolchildren in the 1970s. Asked
which groups they considered white, the children were divided about
Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians, and hesitated before awarding a
yes to the Greeks. Turks were given a resounding no, as were all
Latin Americans, from Argentines to Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   These are fine books. ``White'' is scholarly, densely researched
and cleanly written, drawing on the history of Christianity and of
colonialism, as well as painting, film and television. Dyer's
reading of that extravagantly popular television series ``The Jewel
in the Crown'' is canny and unsentimental without being snide.
``White Lies'' is small and intimate, joining memory, history,
sociology, popular culture and journalism into an emotionally rich
collage.
</P>
<P>
   It matters that Dyer and Berger are both white, for as Berger
writes: ``Black people cannot help but evaluate the status of their
blackness. White people, while vigilantly aware of the presence of
blackness, are most often oblivious to the psychological and
political weight of their own color.'' These books belong to a
field, even a genre, known as Whiteness Studies, and its aim is to
make such obliviousness impossible.
</P>
<P>
   One could choose to be cynical about this new discipline, for
reasons Dyer describes perfectly. First, there is the green-light
problem: ``Writing about whiteness gives white people the go-ahead
to write and talk about what in any case we have always talked
about: ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the ``me-too'' complex, the sense that ``amid all
this (all this?) attention being given to nonwhite subjects, white
people are being left out.'' There is good old guilt, which never
fails to block emotion and incite narcissism. I would add one thing
more: the kind of born-again passion that excoriates with tone-deaf
fervor all white people other than oneself.
</P>
<P>
   There is another irony here, too, as several historians in the
field have noted (David R. Roediger, Noel Ignatiev, Ruth
Frankenberg and Karen Brodkin are among the best). For it was black
writers and scholars who, more than a century ago, began a
sustained analysis of what W.E.B. DuBois called the souls and
Langston Hughes the ways of white folk.
</P>
<P>
   Will Whiteness Studies and narratives make these kinds of
critical insights more a part of the intellectual and literary
mainstream? Maybe. Probably. Almost certainly. But ``White Lies''
and ``White'' take intellectual and emotional risks, and the risks
pay off. I'll take good work wherever I find it. I believe that
genuine self-scrutiny breeds a kind of honesty and courage that
nothing else can.
</P>
<P>
   Black people love to play the game of ``Name That Negro,''
identifying all kinds of people _ movie stars, politicians
(preferably Southern conservatives), musicians _ who are passing
for white. The next time I play, I'll have to remind myself that
white people are passing, too.

<P>
   Without question, this has been the decade in which software
moved, big time, into the industrial designer's world. In corporate
offices across the country, engineers have been booting up programs
that let them tinker, in three dimensions, with every permutation
and combination of a product's design. Be the item as lowly as a
dinner plate or as complex as a Boeing 777 jet, the goal has always
been the same: to save time and money in getting products to
market.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time before engineers would aim their
computers at designing and refining the assembly lines on which
those products are made. And apparently, that time has come. To
wit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before it approves a design for a new car or van, Ford Motor
Co. checks the plan against computer models of its factory floor.
Often, through subtle changes like relocating a few seams or
shaving a few millimeters from the length of a fender, Ford can lop
weeks off the time it takes to prepare an old plant to make a new
car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dow Chemical Co. now uses computers to simulate its methods
for making plastics, running what-if scenarios to fine-tune the
temperatures, pressures and rates at which it feeds in raw
materials. Dow can now switch production among 15 different grades
of plastics in minutes, with almost no wasted material. Before
computer modeling, the process took two hours and yielded lots of
useless by-products.
</P>
<P>
   _ International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
computer maker and an early convert to factory simulation software,
has learned that its assembly lines can accommodate diverse
products of similar size, as long as IBM tweaked its conveyor belts
to deliver different parts and products to different work areas.
One early result: With almost no retooling, IBM expanded a plant in
Charlotte, N.C., that had made only banking systems to include
voice messaging systems, bar code readers and devices to program
pacemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to build a new assembly line, if they can reuse
the one they have,'' said Frank Lerchenmuller, an IBM vice
president for engineering technology solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But until the advent of software that can
simulate assembly lines and the movements of the people who run
them, no one really knew a good way to gauge what they could
salvage from an older factory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to software from companies like Tecnomatix
Technologies Inc. of Israel, Dassault Systemes of France, and Aspen
Technology in the United States, it is as feasible to design or
remodel an entire plant as it is to re-configure a car.
</P>
<P>
   Production engineers in industries as diverse as chemicals,
automobiles and aluminum smelting are manipulating virtual pictures
of their plants and processes to see whether moving a clamp or
adding a new ingredient will make existing equipment more
productive, or will enable the same assembly line to skip freely
from product to product. Some are even testing out a new virtual
reality program that enables engineers wearing special goggles to
detect problems by ``walking through and around'' a
three-dimensional model of their factory designs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire relationship between product design and production
engineering is being turned on its ear. No longer is it enough for
designers to create products that can be made and maintained
efficiently. Increasingly, management is asking them whether the
products can be manufactured with a minimum of retooling or work
stoppages _ and if not, whether it is worth giving up a particular
product feature in order to wring time and money from the
manufacturing routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This software is letting manufacturing influence design, not
just the other way around,'' said Steven A. Weiner, a Ford manager
of computer-aided analytical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   No one suggests that factory simulation software is a cure-all.
The programs can cost as much as $50,000 per engineer, when the
cost of dedicated hardware is counted. And the technology has the
same garbage-in-garbage-out problem that plagues all modeling
software.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, factory equipment works exactly as described by its
manufacturer. In truth, as robots and other machines age, their
movements become erratic. Then there is the tinkering that workers
often do to make a setup more efficient or comfortable _ rarely
entering such schematic changes into the data base. Such variables
can make computer models of a shop floor more approximate than
precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A production line can look fine in a model, yet a robotic hand
might still have to jiggle a component to get it to align with
another piece,'' observed Emory Zimmers, director of Lehigh
University's computer-integrated manufacturing laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is little allure to the time-honored
alternative to computer modeling _ setting up an actual assembly
line and trouble-shooting it piece by piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too risky and expensive to try new tools or methods if
you have to build prototype hardware to test every change,'' said
Rani Agarwal Finstad, director of manufacturing math-based systems
for GM Powertrain, a manufacturer of car components that recently
used simulation software to squeeze a month out of the process of
programming robots to machine new crank shafts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The market for simulation software is growing, if slowly.
Bernard Charles, Dassault's president, figures companies spent $300
million globally for software that simulates manufacturing
facilities last year. That's nothing compared to the $4 billion he
believes industry spent on product design software, but ``there's a
growing understanding that computer simulations can replace
physical mockups of plants the same way they've replaced mockups of
products,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, IBM agrees; it is marketing Dassault's factory
simulation software in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Brown, president of Dassault's Deneb Robotics
subsidiary in Troy, Mich., says his sales are growing 25 percent a
year. (He won't break out numbers now, but Deneb had annual sales
of $22 million when Dassault bought it in 1997.) The Israeli
player, Tecnomatix, founded in 1983, muddled along with sales of
maybe $35 million a year until a couple of years ago. Last year its
revenues topped $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials to the factory modeling idea are easy to find.
``With simulation software, we can optimize plant designs before we
start to build,'' said Richard A. Leupen, group president of ICF
Kaiser's Engineers and Constructors Group.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers who design the automation systems sold by Rockwell
International have used simulation to design assembly lines that
can handle different sized items, enabling factories to
cost-effectively produce small batches of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're headed to where modeling will let us design plants that
can efficiently build a single-lot size of one item,'' said Randall
L. Freeman, vice president of global marketing for Rockwell
Automation.
</P>
<P>
   Real-life examples of modeling's efficiency are mounting. Ford
says that one of its plants now uses the same assembly line to make
compact and mid-sized models. (Ford refuses to specify which cars
or where, citing competitive concerns.)
</P>
<P>
   Computer simulations of the tread-etching process has enabled
tire makers like Goodyear Tire and Rubber to switch production from
one type of tire to another in about an hour _ a process that
previously took an entire work shift. And simulations have shown
cookie companies like Nabisco how to use the same packaging
machines to make 5-pound bags for price clubs, 1-pound bags for
groceries and 6-cookie packs for vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Various forces are driving the trend toward computer modeling.
For one thing, computer technology has finally caught up with
manufacturing pipe dreams. ``Only recently have computers been
powerful enough to quickly simulate what happens if you change
something in a chemical reactor,'' said David E. Waite, Dow's
manufacturing manager for information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and marketplace forces are at work, too. Companies that
spent much of the 1990s paring ancillary product lines and work
forces are now trimming capital investment, lest shareholders think
they have lost their cost-cutting touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial community is unforgiving if you build a
billion-dollar plant and need another $200 million to change it
three years later,'' said Daniel Miklovic, a manufacturing
specialist at the Gartner Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, meanwhile, have grown increasingly picky and expect
to be able to choose among myriad colors, sizes and shapes for
almost any product. That means that manufacturers must mix and
match parts as the orders come in. And that, in turn, means having
tools that can respond to electronic commands to switch paint
wells, move clamps, or change packaging and labels.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive Tool and Industries Co. in Southfield, Mich., a
designer of car assembly lines, recently used computer simulation
to replace fixed-position clamps on one manufacturer's line with
ones that move on slides; the clamps pivot out of one another's
way, and thus can be programmed to react when parts of different
sizes or shapes come down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be awfully risky to try this without simulating it
first,'' said Donald A. Hemberg, Progressive Tool's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Global competition is also playing a role, spurring
manufacturers to replace old products with newer versions at an
ever-more-rapid pace. ``When you're facing a product life cycle of
nanoseconds, you can't drive revenues just by lowering unit
costs,'' said David Burdick, a Gartner Group vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries, even as new products arrive, older models
remain in production. Here, too, computer modeling can help.
</P>
<P>
   At Freightliner Corp., a truck maker in Portland, Ore., models
can overlap for four years because ``truckers are traditional, and
a lot of them still want the old looks,'' said Volker Mueller, a
Freightliner industrial engineer. But setting up assembly lines to
handle a new model even as they produce older ones can be a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller says that Freightliner, which is about to introduce a
new medium-sized truck, has modeled its entire assembly plant on
Tecnomatix software. The truck maker is running what-if scenarios
that Mueller expects will reveal the best way to mix old and new
models on the existing lines, and to map out a painless method for
converting the lines to handle both.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the modeling procedure has led to development of a
conveyor belt that can sense what model is in production and
instruct robotic arms to pluck the right hood or other part from a
storage bin and have it ready to meet the truck chassis as it moves
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew our conveyor system was too slow, but the computer
helped us figure out why,'' Mueller said. He said Freightliner was
now using work-flow simulation to figure out how to keep trucks
moving evenly from worker to worker, when some models need more
handling than others _ putting 12 bolts into a wheel well, for
example, instead of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a worker lost time on a difficult truck, we want him to
make it up on an easy one,'' Mueller said. ``You don't want to wait
until the line is set up to find out you could have prevented
bottlenecks.

OPEC PLANS PRODUCTION CUT TO FUEL RISE IN OIL PRICES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ As they slipped out of their black limousines
into luxury hotels dotting the contours of Vienna's graceful
Stadtpark Sunday night, officials of OPEC, the nearly moribund oil
cartel, were stirring with new life, ready to jolt oil prices back
up.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well at an emergency meeting set for Tuesday here,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in partnership
with major oil producers like Mexico and Norway who are not members
of the group, will take more than 2 million barrels of oil a day
out of world markets, starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark the first time in 13 years that the cartel has
taken such a drastic measure, largely because of the pressing needs
of the largest producer, Saudi Arabia, and other producing
countries to generate more revenue, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the move _ which has emerged as OPEC officials
formulated it in secret and in public talks held in Riyadh, The
Hague, Dubai, London and other cities in the last four weeks _ has
already pushed prices up 20 percent, bringing the American
benchmark brand known as West Texas Intermediate to $15 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   This has halted, for a while at least, the steady fall in prices
that devastated the world energy industry in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impact reflects optimism in the oil industry that
salvation is on the way. In the last decade, globalization,
competition from new oil suppliers and disputes within OPEC
combined to send oil prices into a seemingly endless tumble to a
point where gasoline and fuel prices today are, in
inflation-adjusted prices, the lowest since the end of the World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a confluence of new circumstances may help the cartel
reverse some of these trends. Among other things, the Asian
economic crisis, which erased more than 1.5 million barrels a day
in demand for oil, is stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil production is also stabilizing. In 1998 Iraq more than
doubled its oil production to 2.5 million barrels a day as the
United Nations allowed it to sell more oil under its oil-for-food
sanctions regime. That ceiling cannot increase much more now unless
the United Nations sanctions are removed altogether _ something the
United States would not allow.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pain of lower prices has piled mountains of debt
onto the economies of many oil-producing countries, cut their
government budgets down to a point of endangering social and
political cohesion, and ravaged oil company profits worldwide _
enough to create a consensus for OPEC discipline and worldwide
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst seems to be over,'' said Robert Mabro, director of
the Oxford University Institute for Energy Studies in England.
``They have to act because low prices are deeply hurting producing
countries and oil companies. Hard currency revenues are shrinking
dangerously in places like Nigeria, Venezuela, Russia, Mexico.
Multinational oil companies have cut costs to the bone, laid off
thousands of people and seen their profits evaporate. Everybody
wants a solution,''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the seriousness of the action, Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest oil producer and most important OPEC member, has
agreed to take the biggest cut, shutting down half a million
barrels of oil a day of its production starting in April. ``As far
as we are concerned, it's a done deal,'' said a senior Saudi
official in Riyadh, who asked not to be identified. ``We are
informing customers right now that deliveries will be cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Indonesia, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and Indonesia are joining in with cuts that
total about 1.5 million barrels a day. Norway and Mexico, major oil
producers and allies of the United States who are not members of
OPEC, intend to cut their production by a combined 350,000 barrels
daily.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable show of solidarity unseen since 1986, when
a similar collapse in prices led producers to drastic and
coordinated production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While still frowning on any concerted action to control prices
of such a vital commodity, the United States appears not to object
to stronger oil prices, which would also help the American oil
industry. It too has been deeply hurt by the price collapse,
resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that lower oil prices are good for consumers, but we
recognize they can have a negative impact domestically and on some
of our friends like Venezuela and Mexico,'' Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said in a telephone conversation from Washington on
Friday. ``So far, OPEC's response has been responsible and
restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Saudi Arabia, the cartel's undisputed master and America's
staunch Persian Gulf ally, that holds the fate of the accord in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the world's largest petroleum reserve, Saudi Arabia
had two ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could go back, as they have done now, revert to their old
standard of constraining production and hope that prices will go
up,'' said Anthony Miles, senior vice president at the San
Francisco office of the Boston Consulting Group. ``Or they can
swing all the way, pumping as much oil as possible, and the guys
with the most oil will win.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take some months to determine whether OPEC's new
discipline will hold. The big deterrent to cheating is Saudi
Arabia's unique ability to flood the market.
</P>
<P>
   With prolific oil fields, Miles and other experts point out, the
desert kingdom can pump more than 10 million barrels a day at
minimal extraction costs of $1 a barrel. This flooding would bring
prices down to as low as $5 a barrel in a few months. Few
oil-producing countries can take this possibility lightly. In the
long run, it would put many producers out of business in the United
States, the Caspian Sea, Russia and the prolific North Sea shared
by Norway and Britain, where production costs range from $5 to $10
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis' need to produce higher revenues has become
compelling. Piling one budget deficit over another in the last
decade, Saudi Arabia has accumulated a debt of $130 billion, the
equivalent of its entire annual economic output.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after tenaciously clinging to a level of production
set since 1990 at 8 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia for the
first time has offered to lower it to 7.5 million barrels a day.
This is a fundamental change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eight-million level was practically untouchable _ it had
become an icon-hobbling policy,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior
oil analyst at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston.
``The willingness to abandon it shows the urgency they attach to
higher revenues now.''

SNAP OFFERS NEW PORTAL TO `RICH MEDIA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snap, an Internet company partially owned by NBC, will introduce
a new service Monday that is designed for users of the Internet who
can connect at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The previously announced portal site, which was code-named
Cyclone and will now use the Snap name, is intended to be a free
guide and showcase for bandwidth-intensive applications, like video
clips and audio files, by making them easier for users to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first shot in the next big battleground in the
portal wars,'' said Edmond Sanctis, chief operating officer of Snap
LLC.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of a growing need for the sort of service he is
introducing, Sanctis said that about 10 of the top 50 search words
on Snap have been for some sort of so-called ``rich media'' _
material with animation, video or audio, such as the increasingly
popular MP3 music format.
</P>
<P>
   Though the current market for high-speed Internet applications
is small, it is seen by Internet content and access providers alike
as an integral part of the online industry's future. At the end of
last year, roughly 500,000 households had high-speed access, either
through cable modems or telephone technology known as asymmetric
digital subscriber lines, or ADSL, though NBC said more than 14
million people have broadband access in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research predicts that by the year 2000, 2 million
households in the United States will have faster connections at
home. That number could be accelerated, analysts said, by deals
like one made in January that provides high-speed connections to
America Online subscribers who are Bell Atlantic customers for an
additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the official introduction of its new high-speed name,
Snap will also announce Monday 20 new alliances with content
providers, distributors, and advertisers. They include agreements
with A&AMP;E Networks, the World Wrestling Federation, Tower Records,
Pseudo Programs, and Inktomi. In deals with phone service providers
such as Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions, GTE InterNetworking,
Cable and Wireless, and 12 others, customized versions of the new
guide will be available.

   ECON-SUSTAIN (Des Moines) _ Improvements in workers'

Eight years into the current expansion, labor shortages and rising
wages should be raising the annual inflation rate, now only 1.7
percent. That happened in the 1980s, during the last growth cycle,
when the Consumer Price Index reached 4.6 percent. Nor are profits
suffering noticeably, despite somewhat slower gains recently. By
past standards, profits should be hurting, caught as they are
between rising pay and stagnant prices. But many corporations have
come up with numerous ways to dodge the bullet, and confound the
view, so widely shared, that inflation is an inevitable result of
sustained prosperity. By Louis Uchitelle.

AHERN EXPRESSES OPTIMISM ABOUT RESOLUTION OF IRA DISARMAMENT
ISSUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said
Sunday that there would be a settlement of the dispute over Irish
Republican Army disarmament in time for the Northern Ireland peace
effort to advance by an Easter deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In his most sanguine statement on the year-old dispute, Ahern
said that he would meet with Northern Ireland political leaders
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern noted that there recently have been positive indications
from the leaders, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing,
and David Trimble, the Protestant First Minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly. Ahern said on Irish national radio: ``I have to
keep at them to move further. I believe we will find a formula.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has blocked the next step in the northern peace
effort _ the formation of a Protestant-Catholic cabinet in the
Assembly to accept home rule powers from Britain, which has ruled
the predominantly Protestant province directly since 1974. The
return of home rule is provided for in the peace agreement approved
last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is intended to end sectarian warfare in the
province and to give more power to the Catholic minority and more
influence in northern affairs to the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republic, to the south.
</P>
<P>
   While they did not confirm Ahern's optimism, Adams and Trimble
have refrained from the sharp attacks on each other that often
characterize their exchanges. They met privately in Washington last
week with each other and with President Clinton, who urged them to
settle the disarmament dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has insisted that the new cabinet cannot include Sinn
Fein members until the IRA has begun to disarm. Adams points out
that the peace agreement does not require disarmament before May,
2000 and contends that the IRA's 21-month cease-fire is evidence
that it wants peace.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Sunday that he welcomed the ``positive rhetoric''
from Trimble in recent days. But he repeated that he could not
deliver what Trimble calls ``a credible beginning'' to IRA
disarmament _ including turning over detonators, timing devices and
explosives. The IRA arsenal is estimated at 100 tons of weapons,
including explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern's statement Sunday renewed speculation among officials and
experts on what might be in a settlement formula. Most agree that
it would be based on a statement on disarmament that both leaders
could defend as honorable to their hard-line supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ahern and Adams, in interviews on Irish national radio,
also called for an independent investigation of the killing last
week by Protestant paramilitaries of Rosemary Nelson, a prominent
lawyer who represented Catholics accused of committing terrorist
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The killing led to three nights of violence in the northern city
of Portadown. Catholic protesters said they had been enraged by the
pounding of drums by Protestants, some of whom shouted approval of
the killing. Protestants said the drumming, at an Orange Order hall
near a Catholic area, was to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. A
Catholic leader, Breandon MacCionnaith, said he was beaten by
police during the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern said he would press Britain for an independent
investigation of allegations, which Ms. Nelson had said were mostly
relayed to her by her clients, that officers of the
Protestant-dominated northern police force had threatened Ms.
Nelson's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland police chief, Ronnie Flanagan, said the
allegations against his force would be investigated by a police
chief from the British mainland and by agents of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: AFFILIATE REFERRALS GENERATE BIG PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If 1998 was the Year of the Portal in electronic commerce, 1999
may be the Year of the Affiliate, as Web merchants realize that one
way to balance the books is to recruit other sites to help sell
their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships range from deals between companies with
established brands to arrangements that retailers make with
individuals who have built personal home pages. Members of the
Geocities personal Web community (www.geocities.com), for instance,
can earn commissions on purchases that result when they refer
visitors to Internet retailers that participate in Geocities' Pages
That Pay program.
</P>
<P>
   While the terms _ and success _ of such deals vary widely, some
retailers say affiliate programs are becoming a crucial source of
revenue, particularly as it becomes apparent that advertising
revenue alone cannot sustain most Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return is phenomenal,'' said Julie Wainwright, who until
recently was chief executive of Reel.com, a video seller. The
Reel.com affiliate program was so successful, she said, that it
``generated more revenue than any of our portal deals.'' Ms.
Wainwright left Reel.com last month to become chief executive of
Pets.com, an online peddler of pet supplies, where she intends to
develop an affiliate-referral network.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet bookseller Amazon.com is widely credited with
pioneering the affiliate model. The company began its ``associate''
program in 1996, offering to pay Web sites that refer customers to
Amazon a percentage of any resulting sale.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's legion of affiliates now numbers 230,000 _ a figure
that attests to Amazon's vaunted marketing prowess, of course, but
also to the considerable buzz that surrounds affiliate programs.
The music seller CDNow has the second-largest affiliate program on
the Web, with 207,000 members, while other large retailers'
programs are growing at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Why the buzz? The biggest draw of affiliate programs is that
merchants do not have to spend marketing dollars to acquire a
customer until a purchase is actually made.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry executives, top-tier Internet retailers
currently spend between $20 and $40 to acquire a new customer _ an
exorbitant amount compared with off-line retailers, and primarily a
result of the high cost of advertising on Web portals like Yahoo
and Lycos to develop brand name awareness. Often, merchants must
then spend time working with the portals to find the best approach
to delivering customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With affiliates, you pay for performance,'' Ms. Wainwright of
Pets.com said. ``You don't pay upfront and then work to get
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The best proof of the increasing popularity of these programs is
the fact that merchants are competing against each other to attract
affiliates, said James McQuivey, an electronic commerce analyst
with Forrester Research, a consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the bounty paid by merchants has grown
steadily, he said, ``from 8, to 10, to 12, now as high as 20
percent.'' For some high-margin goods like toys, in fact, bounties
can reach as much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For merchants, the real dollars flow from a small number of
affiliated companies that bring in the bulk of customers. According
to the research firm Jupiter Communications, 15 percent of
affiliates account for 85 percent of sales. In many cases, these
are high-traffic or highly focused sites like SCN Athlete
Daily.com, which tracks the activities of 125 popular athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Even with high-performing sites, though, merchants must do more
than simply post a link and wait for the registers to ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Superstore Online site (www.sportssuper.com), for
instance, has three full-time employees who work with more than
2,000 affiliates (including SCN Athlete Daily.com) on merchandising
techniques meant to improve the chances of a sale. The payoff: one
year after starting the program, the site gets 7.5 percent of its
revenue from affiliate sales. Helio Fialho, the company's chief
executive, said he hoped to push that to 18 percent by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies, including Sports Superstore or Amazon.com,
run their affiliate programs in-house, others have chosen to use
third-party services like Linkshare and Be Free to manage the
relationships. These so-called affiliate networks provide services
like sending small monthly checks to thousands of affiliates,
policing affiliates' sites for possibly offensive material and
dealing with the technical challenges that inevitably arise with
such programs.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet companies that sign up to be a retailer's
affiliate, one drawback is the risk of confusing viewers about the
site's mission _ a particularly thorny issue for media companies.
On the one hand, such sites do not want to risk appearing biased
toward advertisers, by essentially selling goods that appear on
news pages where they are mentioned. On the other hand, media sites
are loath to give up affiliate earnings as a source of revenue,
particularly since advertisers are paying less for banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely a fine line, but every media company is
drooling over the idea of getting involved in commerce,'' said Bill
Bass, a media analyst with Forrester Research. ``Of course, it
causes editors to clutch their stomachs whenever it's mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Such relationships do pose risks, Martin Nisenholtz, president
of The New York Times Electronic Media Co., acknowledged. Under an
agreement between The Times and Barnesandnoble.com, book reviews on
The Times' Web site are accompanied by a ``buy it online'' link to
the bookseller. ``It boils down to the perception that something
has changed,'' Nisenholtz said. ``The reality is that there's
absolutely no interaction between the editorial side of the book
review and the advertising side. We handle commerce the same way we
handle advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   To address the issue, Nisenholtz said the company would soon
``publish a very clear set of guidelines about these agreements and
what they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Another risk, for merchants and publishers alike, is that as
more sites go into the business of selling goods, the Web could
start to resemble a billboard-laden highway. And if consumers
become turned off by a constant barrage of sites trying to sell
them something, they could lose their appetite for buying anything
online.

THE EDGY AND OUTRAGEOUS FIND FAVOR ON CABLE TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Please note the use of the word ``retard,'' which may be
offensive to some readers, in the 2nd graf.) 
(lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next few months, as the broadcast network channels grow
more and more congested with repeats, you may find yourself channel
surfing and running into some unusual sights and sounds on cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers With Candy'' on Comedy Central is a sitcom featuring
a 46-year-old former drug addict who returns home to finish high
school, to live with her father, who is apparently already dead and
suffering from rigor mortis, and to have such adventures as being
recruited by the principal to investigate whether her lockermate is
what they call a ``retard'' passing herself off as normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asphalt Beach'' on MTV centers on life in a reform school and
stars four young men, two of whom just happen to be playing women.
``And we never own up to that,'' says Brian Graden, MTV's executive
vice president of programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Hour'' on the USA Network is a variety-style show
starring Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa, the sons of the late avant-garde
rock performer Frank Zappa, and features games and sing-along
competitions among guest stars like Christopher Darden, a
prosecutor of O.J. Simpson, warbling ``Louie, Louie'' and guessing
whether a close-up picture is of a rock star or a rodent.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the rambunctious next generation of cable television
shows. It is a generation of programming that owes a debt to two
phenomena of recent cable seasons: the rude and crude Comedy
Central animated series ``South Park,'' which for a time was the
most successful entertainment series on any cable channel, and the
apparently bottomless popularity, on three separate cable channels,
of professional wrestling, with its various programs accounting for
21 of the top 25 shows on all cable channels in the February sweeps
period.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for shows that can feed off the ground-breaking (and
chair-breaking) tone of these genres, cable television programmers
are seeking to up the ante in terms of, in their own words, the
``edginess'' and ``outrageousness'' of their new programming.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they are rewriting the old rules of television
program development, forgetting the tried-and-true method of
writers, backed by studio money, pitching ideas to network
development executives, in favor of new approaches like scouring
the Internet, independent film festivals and alternative books and
magazines. They are also on the alert for shows rejected by the
broadcast networks for pushing the issues of taste and content
beyond their limits.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to build the kind of audience base that brings in
advertising revenue. For channels like MTV Networks, which is owned
by Viacom Inc., and Comedy Central, owned by Time Warner Inc. and
Viacom, the concentration of young affluent viewers often results
in advertisers paying a premium above what they would normally pay
for the same-size audience. MTV, for example, is the leading cable
channel among viewers between 18 and 34 in homes with more than
$75,000 in income. Comedy Central is second.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central, with an audience 60 percent male, another
attraction to many advertisers, is also advancing an argument,
based on what the channel calls ``attentive studies'' that comedy
viewers pay more attention to shows they watch because they are
listening for punch lines and are ready to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The new cable strategy is built around the desire to capture the
allegiance of an audience that more and more is asking programmers
to, as Stephen Chao, the president of programming for the USA
Network, put it, ``Freak me out with the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: ``The Man Show,'' the upcoming series that Comedy
Central is most bullish on, a comedy-sketch show with an audience
that celebrates the most basic (as in the root word ``base'') side
of the male gender. That means go-go girls in the audience, a video
with one of the hosts asking women in the street of all ages if
they will have sex with him, numerous references to flatulence, and
various shots of sexy women jumping on trampolines with their
skirts flying up.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like wrestling? Eileen Katz, Comedy Central's
head of programming, hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is working in wrestling,'' Ms. Katz said. ``We think
`The Man Show' can exploit the same sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Chao, whose USA network owns about half of the growing cable
wrestling franchise, would like nothing better than to develop
entertainment shows that take advantage of what he called, ``this
diamond in our own backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chao said: ``Wrestling is great populist entertainment. No one
has successfully leveraged off its strength.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he would like to, both on the USA Network and its sister
cable channel Sci-Fi. Ms. Chao cited an upcoming show for the
Sci-Fi Channel called ``Metropolis'' (two cops investigate
paranormal and absurd crimes, but in the video verite style of
``Cops''), which is being created by Jason Hightman, a writer of
feature films, and Spike Jonze, the director of music videos for
the Beastie Boys, Weezer and the Breeders.
</P>
<P>
   Chao also mentioned ``GvsE'' for USA, which is an offbeat take
on the fight of good versus evil featuring a resurrected cop. That
one is ``completely different from anything I've seen on TV,'' and
has ``a Tarantino quality,'' Chao said _ referring to Quentin
Tarantino, the ``Pulp Fiction'' director. ``I like the idea of
putting Tarantino next to wrestling. People would get it, that
contemporary rambunctiousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central does not have wrestling, but it does have ``South
Park,'' the almost toxically irreverent cartoon series, which
instantly became the signature show for the channel when it went on
the air in the fall of 1997. The show did more than bring viewers
to Comedy Central; it defined the channel, or, in network executive
parlance, it ``branded'' it.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Katz described it, Comedy Central is now totally about
maintaining that brand image, one she said is based on ``attitude
and comic sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do `Frasier' or `Everybody Loves Raymond,''' Ms.
Katz said, though she acknowledged that these shows, which make
millions for their broadcast networks and have audiences each week
comparable to what a Comedy Central series might attract in a month
or perhaps a year, are indeed successful at delivering ``comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   She simply said that in itself would not be enough for Comedy
Central, which demands attitude with comedy. But she denied that
her channel was considering changing its name to ``Attitude
Central.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Man Show'' added to ``South Park'' and such other
coming fare as a new game show called ``Versus'' which pairs rocket
scientists against body piercers, bikers against soccer moms, and
cowboys against Indians (real ones from India) in a quiz format,
the ``comic sensibility'' of the channel might be best defined as
young and exceedingly male.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katz said there were Comedy Central shows that had
substantial female viewership but, at least where comedy is
concerned, ``If you're talking about trend setters and taste
makers, it's that generation and that gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ``South Park,'' of course, another animated series
emerged as a hit for MTV in the early 1990s: ``Beavis and
Butthead.'' Graden was not at MTV then but he had a deep personal
connection to ``South Park.'' He was the executive who first
identified the talent of the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt
Stone, and commissioned them to create an animated Christmas card,
which Graden sent out to friends in the entertainment industry.
That led to the deal with Comedy Central, for the series, which
originally listed Graden as an executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Now ensconced at MTV, Graden said he intended to rewrite the
rules for developing shows.
</P>
<P>
   Graden said his approach was to look for shows that came from
``natural sources rather than from process sources.'' As an
example, he cites how a performer named Jackie Beat came to star in
``Asphalt Beach'' playing one of the female leads. ``He is a drag
queen we saw in a short independent film and we put him together
with a couple of writers named Peter and Tom Spears, '' Graden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed MTV series, ``Sifl and Olly,'' is a
relationship comedy starring two sock puppets. Shows like this do
not come from pitches or deals with agents, Graden said. Instead
they come out of an idiosyncratic system at MTV that relies on
``two people whose job it is to be scavengers.''
</P>
<P>
   These two scavenger executives, who were hired by MTV's senior
vice president for original series, John Miller, have been charged
with screening independent films, surfing the Internet, reading
books and magazines by the scores seeking to identify people and
ideas that might be turned into television shows. One of these
executives, Kim Carranza, Graden labeled ``someone with just a
groovy bent on things''; the other, Drew Tappon, he called ``a
culturally obsessed person.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his own approach, Chao said, ``What I'd like to do
is break the patterns.'' He is the same executive who earlier in
his career broke several patterns and barriers by creating shows
like ``Cops'' and ``America's Most Wanted'' for News Corp.'s Fox
network as well as the game show, ``Studs,'' for syndication.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Katz at Comedy Central may have the best definition of
what it is these cable networks are looking for in this new form of
television series. ``I think we're looking for voices that say what
the network's point of view is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, ``The Man Show,'' a series originally developed and
ultimately rejected by ABC _ one clear reason for the bullishness
about it at Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled that ABC was not willing to do the show,'' Ms.
Katz said. ``But it does show me that they're getting closer on our
tail.''

<P>
   ON THE YELLOWKNIFE-EKATI MINE ICE ROAD, Northwest Territories _
He wants to hear what the ice says, so no matter how low the
temperature gets, Peter Paul leaves his truck window open.
</P>
<P>
   The sound changes. Sometimes it is like a real hard snap, he
says, a cold thunder fired through the blue Arctic ice. Sometimes
it is more brittle, like the dry crack of an ice cube when it
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means it's OK,'' said Paul, who has been driving huge
loads _ like the 25-foot-wide, 118,000-pound dump truck bed lashed
to his rig _ up and down the Yellowknife ice road for 15 years.
``It's when you don't hear anything that you start to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   During the coldest part of the tough winters here in Canada's
remote Northwest Territories, when the crazy quilt of big lakes and
small ponds in the region freezes over but the mines keep digging,
men like Paul take their trucks off the regular road and onto a
blue highway that crosses 400 miles of frozen lakes and
bleached-out tundra.
</P>
<P>
   This road is itself a metaphor for Canada: this is the wild cold
that novelists use to paint the country's dreamscape; the hard work
of rugged people who, together, turn the great cold to their own
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The road is also about money _ the millions it costs to create,
the many millions more it allows the mining companies to save by
bringing in heavy equipment on trucks rather than in planes.
</P>
<P>
   The season is short, from early February, when the ice turns
solid down four feet, to late March or, if they are lucky, the
first week in April, when the ice goes spongy, and silent.
</P>
<P>
   But while the ice road is open, these tundra truckers will carry
more than 1,200 heavy loads north. For the last two years, most
have taken fuel and heavy equipment to the Ekati mine near Lac de
Gras, Canada's first diamond mine.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the prospector who found the diamonds advised him long
ago to invest in the mine. Paul did not. ``I'm not a gambler,'' he
said. ``That's why I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not gamble on the road either. He rarely listens to
music, preferring to focus on the aqua blue strip of cleared ice
that winds through the vast white plains. Besides the rumble of the
apple-red, 18-speed Western Star diesel rig, the only sounds come
from the ice itself, and the three CB or satellite communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, 44, is not superstitious. There is no rabbit's foot or
horseshoe in the cab. Just a thermos of coffee, and Paul wearing a
pair of beaded moccasins, chain-smoking Export A menthol cigarettes
and popping small pieces of hard candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice don't bother me one bit,'' said Paul, a welder when
the ice road melts away. ``Some people can't do it. But there's no
gray hairs on my head. It's just like I was on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have long exploited the hard flat surfaces of frozen
lakes to travel in winter, but until recently they had never risked
putting such heavy loads in such great numbers on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a number of years to get the road where it's at,''
said John Zigarlick, chairman of Nuna Logistics, which creates and
maintains most of the road. ``But it's not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   A local company, Robinson Trucking, pioneered the first ice
route to the northern mines in 1979, and it still works on the road
and some of its spurs. At first the process was pretty crude. Using
native scouts and the intuition born of living in a harsh
environment, they blazed a rough trail across the lakes by
snowmobile. Then a plow cleared the snow, continuing on the land
portages between lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Zigarlick said, global positioning satellites guide
helicopters along an exact route across a lake. When the copter
lands on the opposite shore, the plow operator heads toward its
landing lights to keep the route true. Ice conditions are
continually checked with radar, and water is sprayed on the
surface, like repaving.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a special kind of driver to take a rig weighing over
150,000 pounds onto the ice. Some of the youngest ones picture
adventure but find boredom as they creep through the white desert.
They have been known to jam a stick under the dash to hold down the
accelerator, while they put their feet up on the seat and test the
capacity of their stereo systems' woofers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are veterans like Ralph Noseworthy and Terry Sparks,
who come from Newfoundland, and who revel in the camaraderie of the
road, telling tall tales and working hard to razz newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   What they all have in common is the ice, and their first
encounter with it: that moment of edging the behemoth trucks onto
the comparatively fragile and unpredictable surface that separates
them from a few hundred deadly feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I came up it was all the same as any other road
until I heard the noise of the ice,'' said Billy Fitzgerald, 43,
who brings his own truck out from Newfoundland to ride the ice
roads. ``It was almost like a pane of glass on a good frosty night,
and I was saying to meself, `What have I got into?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is barren country, where ravens rule the road. In great
numbers they dance grisly jigs behind the upturned ribs of slain
caribou left by local hunters. Sometimes, when Billy Fitzgerald's
truck rumbles by and he holds out a cracker, they come right up to
his open window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close enough to see the black in his beady black eye,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   When it snows too much or blows too hard to keep the road open,
the truckers hole up for a day or two at Lockhart Camp to wait out
the storm. That is when the tables outside the always-open kitchen
groan under the bombast and bragging about the ice road. They still
talk about the time the three loads of silver ore went right to the
bottom of Hottah Lake, or when Paul had to wait an hour and a half
for a herd of caribou to cross.
</P>
<P>
   They say the lakes are named for drivers who plunged through and
felt the icy fingers of the water close around their hearts. There
is Pat's Lake for one, and Pikrul Lake, where one unlucky soul
named Doug Pikrul was said to have gone through twice in one day.
They pulled him out, dried him off and sent him back on the road
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to sift lore from reality but it is clear that the
risk of breaking through is real. ``We've had trucks go through,''
said Dale Wheaton, freight manager at Robinson Trucking, ``but
we've never lost anyone yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is good, and the season is short. About half of the
drivers come from Newfoundland, where there is no work. (``That's
cause it's all been done,'' Sparks said). They can return home with
as much as $25,000 for a little over two months' work. They cram in
as many trips as they can, and only a near blizzard can keep the
trucks idling.
</P>
<P>
   As the days lengthen, and winter ends, the drivers start to pine
for home. ``Oh, when I'm driving back I'm thinking of me woman,''
Fitzgerald said. Then, inevitably, in the middle of summer, when he
is on his patio, having a beer, he will tell a story about the ice,
and about the boys who ride the blue highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `I got through it this time,' '' Fitzgerald
said. ``And I'll be hoping the next year will be the same.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will cover most of New England early Monday as
strengthening low pressure moves north through upstate New York.
Wind gusts over 50 miles an hour from the southeast will lead to
areas of coastal flooding in eastern New England on Monday morning.
In far northern Maine, an icy mixture will fall until late Monday,
when the precipitation will become all snow.
</P>
<P>
   To the west and south of the storm center, colder air will surge
into the interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic States on strong
winds from the northwest. Periods of snow will linger most of the
day over western New York and the mountains of northern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, snow showers will dust areas near the eastern
Great Lakes and central Appalachians. Meanwhile, clouds will break
east of the Appalachians in the Middle Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will have ample sunshine with afternoon
temperatures near or below the seasonal average. A few clouds will
linger along the southern Appalachians as well as near the east
coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy rain will develop across the central Plains as a
fast-moving disturbance streaks east from the Rockies. A bit of wet
snow is expected from along the northern periphery of the
precipitation from eastern Wyoming to northern Nebraska. Farther
south, scattered showers will develop in central Texas and Oklahoma
late Monday and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, interior sections will be mainly dry and mild. A
front with showers and intermittent mountain snow will reach the
coast from northern California to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Gusty Trades
</P>
<P>
   Winds that reached 30 to 50 mph in some areas swept across
Hawaii at the weekend. The unusual winds resulted from
intensification of the normal trade winds that bring steady breezes
to the island chain which average 20 miles an hour. The
northeasterly trade winds in Hawaii are consequence of the
clockwise circulation around the permanent high-pressure area that
girdles the globe around 30 degrees of latitude from the equator.
This past weekend, weak low pressure south of Hawaii combined with
high pressure to the north to enhance the pressure difference that
energizes the tropical trade winds.

 &HT;    Health the hard way
 &HT;    WITH DETOX-WHEATGRASS
 &HT;    By Julie Bonin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Who would have thought the road to health would
lead here, down a rural blacktop lined with mobile homes and rustic
homesteads in Bastrop County?
</P>
<P>
   But this is where people are coming, from all over the world,
for a nutritional and spiritual body purge called cellular
detoxification.
</P>
<P>
   At Optimum Health Institute, students are paying $600 to $700 a
week for an a spalike antidote to a toxic world.
</P>
<P>
   Name your poison: chemicals and preservatives in food and
cosmetics; diets heavy in fat and drained of important enzymes;
pollutants in the air, water and soil; spiritually bereft,
stressed-out lives.
</P>
<P>
   All of it leaves our bodies full of toxins, or so goes the
theory that spawned the first Optimum Health Institute 25 years ago
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Since a USA Today reporter, a cancer survivor, wrote about her
experiences at the Central Texas spa in a story that appeared last
month, CBS and ABC camera crews have been descending on the usually
peaceful place. The British Broadcasting Corp. is reportedly
planning a visit.
</P>
<P>
   But OHI, established two years ago, isn't well-known here.
Clients come to the 30-bed nonprofit facility from all over the
world, probably fewer than 10 percent from Texas, says director
Judith Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   Participants _ about 22 check in each week _ typically fall into
three categories: people who are very sick, people who want to lose
weight, and people who want to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully controlled program isn't for everyone. The diet
revolves around wheatgrass juice, plates full of raw vegetables, or
juices made from the juiced remains of those plates full of
uncooked veggies.
</P>
<P>
   Think ears of corn straight from the shuck, fermented foods like
sauerkraut and something called seed cheese. Even the fruit juice
is unconventional: a glass of watermelon juice served for breakfast
includes the pulverized rind. The system-cleansing regime includes
daily enemas and colon therapy, classes on basic human biology
(taught by a registered nurse) and instruction in meditation and
other techniques designed to enhance the body's ability to heal
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Walden, 75, came to Optimum Health Institute wanting a
fresh start on feeling better. Walden, a silver-haired woman in a
pale periwinkle blouse, sat outside reading Cosmopolitan magazine
in a rocking chair at the facility OHI one February day.
</P>
<P>
   Three of her friends were supposed to come with her, but they
backed out, Walden says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned the enemas and for some strange reason they just
dropped me like a fly,'' said Walden, who lives in Colorado and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they have done battle with cancer, are dealing with
health problems such as arthritis or diabetes, or are just trying
to feel better, it seems safe to say that everyone enrolled in the
program believes that eating a traditional American diet, taking
nutritional supplements and exercising is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message retired Presbyterian minister Russell Nees has
been preaching for much of his life. Nees, 69, helped his brother
Bob Nees open the original Optimum Health Institute in San Diego
more than two decades ago. Russell Nees was teaching classes on
expanded consciousness, and he and his brother were exploring
natural healing techniques when they learned about a
then-Boston-based program called the Hippocrates Health Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That program, devoted to teaching its students how to rid their
bodies body of toxins, inspired the Neeses' institute. OHI also
emphasizes the importance of the mind-body connection, says Nees,
who leads classes in meditation and biofeedback and credits the
diet with helping him beat a disabling case of angina.
</P>
<P>
   Nees, frequently seen pedaling around the grounds on a bicycle,
is the institute's spiritual guide. He often leads the healing
circles that precede meals, and emphasizes a connection between the
institute' s OHI diet and biblical teachings.
</P>
<P>
   After his wife Mary Helon was diagnosed with cancer and given
three months to live, she committed to the detox diet for two years
and was declared cancer-free, Nees says. Her death last year was
unrelated to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Though he and other staff members offer testimonials on the OHI
regime, the institute _ which draws clients mostly from word of
mouth and limited advertising _ makes no claims of curing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in competition with the medical profession,'' Nees
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a clinic at all. We're a school and a health spa.''
</P>
<P>
   But does any of this really work?
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shaw, a licensed dietitian and nutrition professor at
Austin Community College, has known people who've followed a raw
food regime and seemed to benefit as long as they followed the
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overlook the success some people have had,'' Shaw
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scientific realm, there's not much to validate it or
refute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every theory can find a line of research to back it up.
However, some recent research has shown that nutrients may be more
easily assimilated from slightly cooked foods than from raw. Some
raw foods, Shaw says, actually inhibit the assimilation of
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   The program's reliance on daily enemas and colon therapy also
raises questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just washing out your colon has no therapeutic advantages,''
says gastroenterologist Tom McHorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good, healthy diet certainly won' t hurt anybody. I'm not
aware of any research showing this as being beneficial or really
detoxifying the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before spending your money, you'd like to know that this is
scientifically useful. You'd like some proof that it works, other
than hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellular detox is not sanctioned by many practitioners of
conventional, traditional medicine. And because it's a school, the
facility is not state-regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the concept of cellular detox has caught on
among people interested in natural healing .
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bodies are breaking down, they feel bad, they start
reading publications or on the Internet that detox is a big part of
staying healthy,'' says Harry Lipp, a massage therapist who helps
customers choose vitamins and herbal supplements at Whole Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Those who aren't ready to commit to programs like OHI's are
picking up products. Companies are pitching everything from bathing
salts to herbal laxatives, all in the name of soothing bodies
reeling from toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   Austinite Henley Green, 33, began reading about the immune
system after back-to-back bouts with the flu a few years ago. She
had tried to detox on her own, but ``couldn't seem to do it,'' and
then heard about the spa in Bastrop County. After a week there,
Green, a freelance wardrobe consultant for films, was still having
a hard time getting the wheatgrass juice down. But she felt so well
and rested that she decided to stay another week, and had even
enticed her mother to experience it with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place, to me, feels very calming,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   To Walden, the stay at the spa was an energizer. She'd tried
fasting and had eliminated red meat from her diet, and was
intrigued with the idea of a program that was experiential,
something she could learn and practice at home.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her third week at the institute, Walden said
she felt rejuvenated and better than she had in a long while. She'd
lost a few pounds. Certainly her energy didn't flag during
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody would just sew my mouth shut at 6 p.m. _ that long
evening is what gets to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually eat very fast,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you're going to eat a plate of raw food fast.
You'd strangle to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatively healthy people like Walden and Green are advised to
stick to the detox diet for two or three months. A less-restrictive
maintenance diet (occasional cooked food, meat and dairy) follows.
</P>
<P>
   Those with ``health challenges'' (the word ``disease'' has been
banished by the positive-thought devotees here) are encouraged to
stick to the raw food regime for at least four to six several
months, Connelly says.
</P>
<P>
   The OHI kitchen is locked at night, and guests are asked not to
bring in contraband food, ``but there's no Gestapo that's going to
follow you around,'' says Connelly, who trained horses before
coming to work at the spa. ``If you want to go off and eat
someplace, no one is going to say one word. This is a
take-responsibility-for-your-health place.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeklong guests learn to grow their own wheatgrass, those who
stay two weeks learn to sprout their own seeds, and three-week
guests spend much of their time preparing OHI recipes in a
stove-free kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But once back in the real world, sticking to the diet proves too
big a challenge for many students, Connelly says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do a week or two and come back in six months
to clean up their act,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what students are told at OHI is information they've
heard somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat right, get some exercise,'' says Lou Ann King, a nurse and
colon therapist who teaches at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know this stuff. The problem is we don't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But people ready to make a drastic change in diet and lifestyle
in the name of health are hoping the Optimum Health Institute OHI
will help put them on the right path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any magic bullet here,'' King tells her
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not some magic bullet in a sprout bulb that we dole
out to every 10th person. If there is a magic bullet, you have it
inside of you. All we do is give you the tools.''

 &HT;    'Get it down one way or another'
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Wheatgrass, lovingly tended and ground into
jade-green juice, is a cornerstone of the Optimum Health
Institute's OHI's program.
</P>
<P>
   Director Judith Connelly says the spa's OHI's wheatgrass,
continually serenaded in the greenhouse by classical music, is
``unusually sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone can stomach the chlorophyll-rich liquid food,
which tastes something like the distilled essence of newly mown
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people who gag when they pass by the juicing room,''
Connelly says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just encourage them to get it down. It's so desperately
important to the process. People need to get it down one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   At OHI, they don't just drink wheatgrass, rich in vitamins,
minerals, enzymes and amino acids. Here and elsewhere, it's touted
as an externally applied tonic for everything from stuffy noses to
hair loss.
</P>
<P>
   Students are taught and encouraged to grow their own wheatgrass,
though the institute also ships fresh sprouts for juicing to those
who don' t.
</P>
<P>
   Powdered and tablet forms are sold at natural food stores. One
company is marketing its wheatgrass products as ``the perfect
survival food in the face of Y2K and other millennial surprises.''

 &HT;    Physicists to mark a century of feats
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the 10,000 physicists attending the world's
biggest physics meeting ever in Atlanta this week, it will be a
time to remember.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting marks the 100th anniversary of the American Physical
Society. To commemorate it, numerous sessions at the weeklong
meeting will focus on the milestones of physics during the past
century and offer new insights on how they came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at the Georgia World Congress Center, Energy Secretary
William Richardson will help unveil a giant time-line wall chart
developed by the APS: ``A Century of Physics.'' At 23 feet long and
4 feet high and consisting of 11 panels, the time line is a work of
art and a permanently open textbook and photo album covering the
last 100 years in physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time line will serve as a gift from the (APS) to more than
20,000 high schools, colleges and universities throughout the
country, as well as hundreds of research laboratories, museums,
libraries and corporate offices,'' says Brian Schwartz of the APS.
</P>
<P>
   The chart was planned in 1995 to celebrate the APS's 100th
birthday. Emory University physicist Sidney Perkowitz assembled a
database of more than 1,000 scientific events, from which he chose
130 for a series of posters that became the time line. One section
of the wall chart covers physics on the ``cosmic scale,'' telling
the story of the quest to understand the universe. Another deals
with physics on the ``atomic scale,'' the submicroscopic world of
atoms and quarks, the tiniest particles of matter known to science.
</P>
<P>
   The bedrock of modern physics, the wall chart notes, was
developed during this century _ Albert Einstein's theory of general
relativity, which explains gravity; his theory of special
relativity, which deals with the relationship between space and
time; and the development of quantum mechanics, which governs the

 &HT;    Consumer advocate's office would serve Georgia as well as Texas
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the final analysis, it wasn't Gov. Roy Barnes' bold
initiative to impose liability on managed care companies _ which
only two other states have _ that faced the greatest obstacles in
the Legislature. It was Senate Bill 200, the legislation to create
an office of insurance consumer advocate. The governor caved in to
supplemental insurance carriers (who also happen to be campaign
donors) and to legislators in the property and casualty business.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm still willing to bet the new independent consumer office
will serve the people well, especially in health care disputes.
That has certainly been the case in Texas, one of a handful of
states that have an independent insurance consumer office. That
office reported saving consumers $1.9 billion last year in proposed
industry-wide rate increases, and $65 million in individual company
increases. Of course, those figures are exaggerated in that the
insurance commissioner probably wouldn't have granted all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The most important job of the new consumer office will be to
collect and analyze data for rate hearings so the commissioner has
more than the insurance company's ``side'' to consider. Of course,
the counsel can intervene in lawsuits on behalf of classes of
consumers as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly important in Georgia, where the
commissioner relies largely on the industry for campaign donations,
some $1.5 million in the recent re-election of Commissioner John
Oxendine. Whether that affects the commissioner's judgment or not,
there's a public perception that the consumer has little voice.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the
Georgia commissioner should welcome the new office. It's
impossible, he said to act as an advocate for the people and a
judge on proposed industry rate increases. Hunter supported the
legislation Texas lawmakers approved to create a similar ``Office
of Public Insurance Counsel'' in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is an insurance actuary by profession. He now heads the
insurance division of the Consumer Federation of America, and
admits he was more inclined to listen to consumer complaints as
commissioner than some of his predecessors. But the industry also
profited from the advocate's office, he said. ``Having professional
data from both sides in front of me resulted many times in
decisions that were more favorable to the insurance companies than
looking at just one side might have allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though opponents of the consumer advocate office won't admit it,
a professional advocate actually helps prevent decision-making on
the basis of emotional individual stories. The advocate collects
data to determine whether an abuse is based on facts or is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   During the current Texas legislative session, lawmakers asked
the consumer office to investigate whether insurance companies are
following a law that requires them to give reasons for denial or
non-renewal. Lawmakers will examine data from the companies and
from the consumer office to see if the law needs tightening. If the
consumer office can't get the data, the committee will be asking
the companies why not. That's just one example of how the office
spurs openness and better enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the proposed Georgia office, which will depend on the
general fund, the Texas office is funded by a nickel charge on
every insurance policy. Although consumers would willingly throw in
an extra nickel for such, the state insurance lobby isn't likely
ever to let such a ``radical'' notion surface under Georgia's Gold
Dome.

 &HT;    Hit with right hook(er)
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former hooker has come up with a novel line of work that could
be coming to a street corner near you.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Hotaling, according to the New York Times, helped found
the world's first ``john school'' where she is paid to humiliate
and frighten men caught trying to buy sex from street walkers.
</P>
<P>
   Her partners in this thriving new business are the cops and
prosecutors who used to bust her for selling her services on San
Francisco's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Now rather than getting arrested for taking money to pleasure
johns, or customers, she is being paid by the cops to torment johns
in a form of hooker-aversion therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the years when she shivered on street corners trying to
pick up customers, nowadays Hotaling's johns are rounded up for her
by San Francisco's finest who, decked out in spiked heels and just
enough spandex to hide their badges, do the street-corner
shivering.
</P>
<P>
   In a way the johns are still paying for Hotaling's services
because their $500 fines must more than cover the cost of San
Francisco's First Offender Prostituiton Program, which is being
credited with sharp reductions in the city's outdoor sex trade.
</P>
<P>
   According toTimes writer Evelyn Nieves, four SFPD decoy hookers
and a dozen backup officers arrested 43 johns in only four hours on
a slow night. Virturally every man arrested chose john school over
prosecution, according to Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   Big bucks city
</P>
<P>
   That's $20,000 right there if 40 men took the daylong class
rather than have their arrest premanently recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, 2,181 men opted to take the class. Of
those, records show only 18 were re-arrested and prosecuted for
attempting to buy sex outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's indoor sex trade evidently is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this new line of work for former prostitutes could be
coming to a street corner near you is because all the nation's best
fads start out in California, except those invented by Al Gore, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, perhaps Gore invented the Internet during a visit to
California.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely reason that Hotaling's program could spread to
communities across the country is because cops, prosecutors and
city officials like it. No doubt former prostitutes who get paid to
shout ``I hated you!'' at the johns also like it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, according to Nieves, Las Vegas, Fresno, Toronto and
Nashville have come up with similar john schools.
</P>
<P>
   Last month 45 officials from Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C.;
Seattle, Portland, Ore.; Jacksonville, Fla., St. Paul, Minn. and
Springfield, Mo., traveled to San Francisco to study the program
modeled on all-day traffic schools where traffic scofflaws can keep
their tickets off their driving records.
</P>
<P>
   I've attended bad-boy (and bad-girl) traffic school, but it was
not a daylong humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   TheTimes story reported that the ex-hookers hurled insults at
the men in the john school. ``I wanted to stick a knife in you!''
one former prostitute shouted at an old man so hard that the
startled man knocked the glasses off his face.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors lectured the men on the soliciting law. The men were
shown close-up color slides of the effects of venereal disease. The
men received more lectures from police officers and residents and
business owners of neighborhoods tormented by prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants street walkers ruining his neighborhood. And
attacking the demand side of the problem, the johns, makes sense in
fighting prostitution just as it should make sense in fighting
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain, prostitution isn't called the world's
oldest profession for nothing.

 &HT;    Physicists to mark a century of feats
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the 10,000 physicists attending the world's
biggest physics meeting ever in Atlanta this week, it will be a
time to remember.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting marks the 100th anniversary of the American Physical
Society. To commemorate it, numerous sessions at the weeklong
meeting will focus on the milestones of physics during the past
century and offer new insights on how they came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at the Georgia World Congress Center, Energy Secretary
William Richardson will help unveil a giant time-line wall chart
developed by the APS: ``A Century of Physics.'' At 23 feet long and
4 feet high and consisting of 11 panels, the time line is a work of
art and a permanently open textbook and photo album covering the
last 100 years in physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time line will serve as a gift from the (APS) to more than
20,000 high schools, colleges and universities throughout the
country, as well as hundreds of research laboratories, museums,
libraries and corporate offices,'' says Brian Schwartz of the APS.
</P>
<P>
   The chart was planned in 1995 to celebrate the APS's 100th
birthday. Emory University physicist Sidney Perkowitz assembled a
database of more than 1,000 scientific events, from which he chose
130 for a series of posters that became the time line. One section
of the wall chart covers physics on the ``cosmic scale,'' telling
the story of the quest to understand the universe. Another deals
with physics on the ``atomic scale,'' the submicroscopic world of
atoms and quarks, the tiniest particles of matter known to science.
</P>
<P>
   The bedrock of modern physics, the wall chart notes, was
developed during this century _ Albert Einstein's theory of general
relativity, which explains gravity; his theory of special
relativity, which deals with the relationship between space and
time; and the development of quantum mechanics, which governs the
interactions of protons, neutrons and electrons.
</P>
<P>
   Those stunning advances helped pave the way for developments
such as nuclear energy, computers, lasers and rocketry. Einstein's
theories helped scientists understand the big bang that created the
universe some 15 billion years ago; the expansion of the universe;
and the discovery of mind-boggling structures such as neutron
stars, black holes and galactic clusters.
</P>
<P>
   During this week's meeting, scientists will recount these
developments in more than 30 symposiums and discuss what scientists
are still struggling to understand and discover. The symposiums
include:
</P>
<P>

enough matter in the universe for gravity to eventually halt the
expansion of the universe.

is nearly 40 years old and continues to have enormous impact in
physics and fields such as electronics, medicine and chemistry. A

   HAITI-FUTURE _ PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ With American taxpayers
more than $2 billion in the hole when it comes to Haiti, a growing
number of Congressmen are increasingly concerned about the
effectiveness of U.S. aid to the h00emisphere's poorest country.
But as Haiti faces its worst political crisis since a U.S.-led
force restored the democratic process there in 1994, what could
make aid more effective? Many Haiti watchers argue aid should be
more focused on rural areas, noting that only 7 percent of U.S. aid
now goes to rural areas, home to two-thirds of Haiti's population.
Still others argue that all aid should be cut off except emergency
food aid. Bottom line: Whatever the solution, U.S. policy toward
Haiti cannot continue as it now stands. (Emling, Cox News Service)

   HAITI-HANDICAPPED _ PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Extremely shy,
Maderges is the type of child who greets strangers by turning her
head. Nine years old, she's of the age when typical American girls
might be enjoying soccer, cooking, or playing with Barbie dolls.
But she's not like American girls. Born with no arms, and born in
Haiti -- the hemisphere's poorest country -- Maderges was abandoned
by her parents0 when s he was three months old. But, fortunately,
she was deposited at the front door of the privately funded St.
Vincent's School for Handicapped Children, the only place in this
Caribbean country that takes care of children with disabilities. At
the school, a dilapidated building that looks more like an old
motel, she has learned to accept the challenges of her disability
by using her feet -- to eat, to write and to dress. Developing.

   COXNET FOCUS 0319: HAITI FUTURE _ Five years from now, U.S. aid
officials envision a very different Haiti. They see a place where
elections draw a majority of voters, and the average woman bears
only four children; a place where mayors provide garbage pick-up,
and tourists swarm seaside cities. But they've had these kinds of
visions before, however. (Emling, Cox Washington Bureau) Art

 &HT;    Life University coach appreciates run of success
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All the way down to the minute before his team began
Sunday's practice in preparation for tonight's 8 o'clock appearance
against favored Mobile (Ala.) in the NAIA National Championship
game in Tulsa, Okla., Life University coach Roger Kaiser was still
raving about the run of success his suburban Atlanta team has had
during a push toward its second national title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this team entered the tournament unseeded and
saddled with the worst regular-season record in the eight-year
history of the program. After posting a 77-71 upset of No. 7-seeded
Azusa Pacific (27-6) Saturday night in a semifinal-round game, the
Running Eagles (28-10) are in the finals for the third time in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it amazing? This has been an incredible run for us _ no
matter what happens,'' Kaiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Life, beaten at home by Auburn-Montgomery in the Southeast
Regionals 10 days ago, had to depend on an at-large bid to make the
32-team tournament. But in its first game last Wednesday, Kaiser's
squad knocked off No. 11-seeded Faulkner (Ala.) State 64-58.
</P>
<P>
   Then Thursday night, while Kaiser was in a Tulsa hospital
recuperating from kidney stone surgery, the Running Eagles, with
assistant John Barrett in charge, registered an 87-74 upset of No.
6-seeded Oklahoma City, a team that had beaten Life twice in
previous Final Four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   With Kaiser back in the lead chair Friday night, guard Corey
Evans, a 6-1 junior from Cocoa, Fla., and forward Derrick Shaw, a
6-1 junior from Pearson, continued to lead the way to victory _ as
the Eagles fought from a 16-point halftime deficit to defeat
Concordia (Calif.), 83-67.
</P>
<P>
   With Life down by nine with seven minutes left against Asuza
Pacific Saturday night, Evans responded with eight of his
career-high 35 points en route to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't stop Evans. He just went off tonight,'' Asuza
Pacific coach Bill Odell lamented after his team's loss.
</P>
<P>
   While Shaw, despite his size, has dominated the boards,
indicated by 12 and 13 rebounds in the first and fourth tournament
games, Evans has scored 99 points. His 24.9 point average in the
tournament is 10.5 points higher than his regular-season average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evans has been unbelievable,'' Kaiser said. ``But everybody on
the team has stepped up when they had to. It's a bunch that has
come together and shown a lot of deternination.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Mobile (32-2), which was ranked No. 4 in the nation the
first week in March, Life will again be an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're big and they're quick,'' Kaiser said of the
Rams. ``But it's great for us to be in the championship against
them. If we can keep playing as well as we have since we've been
here, we've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Life, which suffered a 99-81 loss to Oklahoma City in the '94
finals, won the NAIA national title in '97 with a 73-64 victory
over Oklahoma Baptist in the championship game.

 &HT;    Hawks progressing at halfway point
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a fragile team, one in which the parts appear to
exceed the sum of the whole. Fresh faces, lockout hangover, injury,
bad habits among old hands. All of that.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do the Hawks rate at the midpoint of this abbreviated
season? Could be better or marginally worse. Be nice _ give them a
C.
</P>
<P>
   The good part is that they appear headed to better days. When
Pete Babcock, Lenny Wilkens and Stan Kasten put this team together,
they moved with one eye on today and the other on tomorrow. It
isn't simply desirable that the Hawks start to peak next fall in
their first year at the Philips Arena; it's mandatory, with all
those luxury boxes and club seats and the ordinary seats filled
with people who want a good time. That means more than the arena's
sophisticated video equipment. It means winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a better team next year,'' Wilkens said, ``because
we'll have a full training camp and because we'll know one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Dikembe Mutombo said, ``It's gotten to the point where
every year a few of us walk in and all we see are new faces. How
can you play together when guys don't know each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bosses would argue logically that they feel an
obligation to field the 12 best players they can find within the
salary cap. And with as many as four draft picks possible, plus a
$4.4 million trade exception, look for more change next season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the modest record, it is clear that management has moved
this club forward. And if injury and unfamiliarity among players
has brought confusion over the first 25 games, it's a price the
organization is willing to pay for progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would take 20 games,'' Wilkens said. ``I thought
it would take at least that long for us to come together. We did it
in pieces, but we also had a few setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, the reserves gave back leads carved out by
the starters. So Wilkens cut short his rotations.
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Smith went out for six games with a sprained right
knee and Alan Henderson sat four games with back spasms, the
coach's hand was forced. Young Anthony Johnson and Roshown McLeod
got their chance. When McLeod got sick, Chris Crawford got to play.
Then LaPhonso Ellis suffered his rib-cage injury, giving Lenny's
Kids more time. For veteran swingman Ty Corbin, too. When Ed Gray
went south, Corbin stepped in and made half his shots over a span
of eight games.
</P>
<P>
   But the starters also faltered. Mutombo only now is emerging
from his lockout-induced haze, rebounding and blocking shots with
better timing and focus. Henderson has had brilliant moments and
some sour ones. A free agent then, he did not play ball during the
lockout, fearing injury. His good efforts have tended to come in
alternate games. Mookie Blaylock tends to stand around, pound the
ball and take ugly long shots that miss. He admits he is at his
best coming off a pick, catching a pass from Smith and shooting in
rhythm. Why don't the Hawks do that more often?
</P>
<P>
   On defense, why don't they always make those crisp rotations,
forcing shooters to give up the ball? Why do they sometimes defend
the pick-and-roll as though they've never seen it?
</P>
<P>
   Lack of intensity, absence of energy, new faces. And remember,
they were away from the game for about eight months. That's what's
wrong league-wide. Utah might be an exception. The Hawks are not.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for Grant Long, it would be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Long, in his second tour with the team, was the last member of
the 12-man roster to sign a contract. If you factor out the
statistics and only look at the plays that turn games around, Long
is the most valuable player on the team, the deciding factor in at
least six victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Grant Long,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks sold Long and Stacy Augmon to Detroit for draft picks
so they could open cap room for Mutombo. They are not about to let
him get away again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say we want to keep Grant here for the
foreseeable future,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   There's stability for you.
</P>
<P>
   HAWKS REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE: D
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are among the lowest-scoring teams in the league.
Outside shooting often is a disaster, with Blaylock and Gray
struggling. The team does not have enough passing, ranking near the
bottom in assists.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE: B
</P>
<P>
   Long and Johnson join Mutombo in forming a much-stronger weapon.
Improved switching is holding down shooters. The press is
potentially the team's best since the days when Mike Fratello was
coach.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDING: B
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo and Long are strong, but Henderson is lacking. On
offense, the numbers look good because the shooting is so bad. On
defense, with Mutombo, it's a staple.
</P>
<P>
   STARTERS: C+
</P>
<P>
   They tend to stand around but are making strides.
</P>
<P>
   BENCH: B
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, the subs are coming on.

when the Consumer Price Index reached 4.6 percent. Nor are profits
suffering noticeably, despite somewhat slower gains recently. By
past standards, profits should be hurting, caught as they are
between rising pay and stagnant prices. But many corporations have
come up with numerous ways to dodge the bullet, and confound the
view, so widely shared, that inflation is an inevitable result of
sustained prosperity. By Louis Uchitelle.

NEWS ANALYSIS: FOR MILOSEVIC, A LAST CHANCE TO PEACEFUL SOLUTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ By preference and habit, Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, has always waited until the last
moment before revealing his real bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the bloody game of chicken that is now the Kosovo crisis,
Washington and NATO want Milosevic to believe the last moment is
here _to understand that both his options and his time to choose
one of them are limited.
</P>
<P>
   But reading Milosevic's mind is never easy for Washington, since
the preservation of his power comes first, before patriotism or the
welfare of his people. And a pure ultimatum that says capitulate or
get clobbered is not likely to produce a deal, some Serbian and
Western officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Of all his Western interlocutors, Milosevic is said to put most
trust in the American, Richard C. Holbrooke, who is headed here
Monday for what Washington calls a last chance for a peaceful
solution before the bombing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs feel Holbrooke at least understands that peace in the end
requires compromise and face-saving, especially given the
importance of Kosovo, site of the finest Serbian Orthodox monuments
and their greatest historic battle, for Serbian tradition and
national myth.
</P>
<P>
   But Serbian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, are
concerned that Holbrooke will arrive from Washington with limited
instructions and little ability to negotiate, and that his mission
is really designed to placate nervous NATO allies more than to stop
bloodshed. Milosevic understands that NATO's bombers can do him and
his military great harm. But he also understands that NATO is still
divided, with its credibility on the line just ahead of its 50th
anniversary celebration in Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has heard congressional doubts from Washington about
the wisdom of American policy, and he has heard doubts from other
NATO countries over what might amount to a NATO declaration of war
against a sovereign state dealing with an internal insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   And Milosevic understands, a senior Western official suggested,
that once bombing starts _ marking the failure of the threat of
force as a diplomatic tool _ NATO loses considerable control over
what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic does not comply, does NATO keep bombing?'' asked
a Belgrade journalist, Ljiljana Smajlovic, no fan of Milosevic.
``And if bombing fails, will NATO have to invade? I don't agree
with this notion that just a little bombing will be enough to get
him to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also exercising a degree of care in his military
operations in Kosovo, senior Western diplomats and officials said.
Using an unusually high level of professional troops with some of
the Yugoslav Army's best equipment _ M-84 tanks, for instance, the
Yugoslav version of the Russian T-72 _ he is moving to disrupt the
Kosovo Liberation Army's hold on the province.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces, these officials say, are driving large numbers
of ethnic Albanian civilians out of their villages to create an
added burden on the Albanian fighters. But the Serbian security
forces have not been killing large numbers of people, the officials
say, so much as trying to disrupt the still fragile organizational
structure of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and cause new
recruits to think of peeling away to take care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more channeling and moving people now rather than
destroying and killing,'' said a senior official with access to
intelligence reports. ``They can deal with that later on. These
troops are professional enough so that if they're ordered not to
massacre people, they seem to be able to restrain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic clearly is in violation of the October cease-fire
agreement he negotiated with Holbrooke. But the Yugoslav leader has
been out of compliance almost from the moment the deal was sealed,
without any NATO retaliation. Even now, he is apparently hoping
that an effort to keep civilian casualties down will keep NATO from
attacking while his troops take the opportunity to strike the armed
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The West's decision to withdraw the 1,400 unarmed foreign
monitors on Saturday _ apparently intended to underscore the threat
of imminent bombing _ has given the Serbian military an opportunity
to try to disrupt and damage the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
Popular support for the rebels is strong in Kosovo, a province of
southern Serbia where 90 percent of the 2 million residents are
ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic decides to accept the peace plan for Kosovo,
he will be able to argue that he did so under duress, and only
after dealing out real punishment to the rebel army, which under
the agreement is supposed to disarm anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic retains almost complete freedom of action at home to
resist NATO or to do a deal. In October, Serbs were more panicky at
the thought of bombing and ran around hoarding sugar and cooking
oil. ``Now, people are oddly resigned and ready to take whatever
Milosevic brings them,'' Ms. Smajlovic said. ``It's amazing. People
are saying, `Let's get it over with.'''
</P>
<P>
   The current joke, said a young woman named Zorica, is, ``Are
they going to bomb or shall I paint the house?'' The cover of the
weekly Vreme showed the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic,
throwing up his hands under the headline: ``The Serb strategy: Que
sera, sera.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zorica, on a Sunday walk near the conjunction of the Sava
and Danube rivers with her husband, Danko, said she expected, in
the end, that NATO forces under some rubric or other will come to
Kosovo, as much as she and other Serbs detest the idea. ``We are a
small country,'' she said. ``Power is power. You can't change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   State television and media bristle with nationalistic bravado,
punctuated by citizens' rallies in support of Kosovo and Milosevic,
who has used the current tension to move against independent
newspapers in Serbia proper and Albanian-language ones in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the bluster of official propaganda, Holbrooke's
trip here was not mentioned until the 33rd minute of the main state
news Sunday night. And then it merited only one sentence, which
noted the request of the U.S. Embassy here for assistance in
arranging a meeting for Holbrooke with Milosevic.

CHECHEN LEADER SURVIVES ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The leader of the breakaway republic of Chechnya
survived an assassination attempt Sunday when a bomb exploded near
his motorcade in the region's major city.
</P>
<P>
   Several people were wounded in the blast in central Grozny,
including some of the bodyguards in the motorcade. But Aslan
Maskhadov, the leader of the separatist region, was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came just two days after a devastating bomb attack
in Vladikavkaz, 30 miles from Chechnya. The Vladikavkaz attack,
which took place in a busy marketplace, killed more than 50 people.
And it shocked many Russians, who already are accustomed to a
regular diet of accidents, tragedies and contract killings.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, flags flew at half-staff as Russia held an official day
of mourning for the Vladikavkaz attack victims. Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin declared that religious extremists might have
carried out the bombing in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the Russian
republic of North Ossetia and the scene of ethnic clashes between
Ossetians and the Ingush, a Muslim people, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian government does not appear to have any firm
clues about the culprits or about how to prevent such assaults in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Both bombings, as well as chronic kidnappings, underscore the
lawlessness in the Caucasus region more than two years after the
end of the bloody Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, who led Chechnya's fight for independence, is one of
his republic's most moderate politicians. He was elected president
of Chechnya, which calls itself the independent nation of Ichkeria,
by an overwhelming margin in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Russia does not recognize Chechnya's independence,
it accepts Maskhadov as the republic's leader. He is one of the few
Chechen politicians with whom the Kremlin can communicate, even
when the two sides differ.
</P>
<P>
   Georgi Bovt, a Russian journalist, summed up the prevailing
attitude in Moscow when he wrote in 1997 that the Kremlin should
support the ``sane'' Maskhadov against the ``insane'' Chechen
warlords and former field commanders, like Shamil Basayev. And
Alexander Lebed, the Siberian governor who negotiated with
Maskhadov, has also described Maskhadov as a useful interlocutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I insist that Aslan Maskhadov is a man who is in full command
of his senses,'' Lebed said. ``There is a difference between the
rhetoric and the actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Maskhadov's rhetoric was on full display Sunday
night. Striking a nationalist pose, he said the assassination
attempt was part of a conspiracy by ``certain forces'' in Moscow to
create an excuse for declaring a state of emergency and canceling
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's bomb attack in Grozny and the explosion in Vladikavkaz,
he said, were ``links in single chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, the director of Russia's internal intelligence
service, insisted that the charge was ludicrous, asserting that the
plotters of Sunday's assassination attempt could be found among the
faction leaders and criminals in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov certainly has plenty of enemies at home. He escaped a
similar assassination attempt in July. By some counts, Sunday's was
the fifth assassination attempt against him.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has his differences with local faction leaders, who
have resisted his efforts to establish order and who have pushed
for the establishment of a radical Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he promised to solve the kidnapping of Gen. Gennadi
Shpigun, a senior Russian Interior Ministry official who was
abducted at the Grozny airport early this month. Six suspects have
been arrested as part of that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There have been also been reports that Maskhadov was planning to
meet soon with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov or other senior
Russian leaders. Analysts said the plotters might have been trying
to thwart such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's blast occurred near the presidential residence in
Grozny. NTV, the independent Russian television network, reported
Sunday night that the bomb consisted of two antitank shells and a
mine. It was hidden by a tree and went off just a moment after
Maskhadov's car passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maskhadov,'' NTV said, ``survived by sheer luck.''

HOLBROOKE TO MEET MILOSEVIC IN FINAL PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story will be updated and expanded with a 1st lead as
soon as possible.) 
(See also KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-ASSESS and KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC) 
(lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Sunday dispatched a
special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, to meet with President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia in what senior officials described as a
final effort to persuade him to accept a peace agreement for Kosovo
and avoid a NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after President Clinton warned that the Serbs had gone
beyond ``the threshold'' of violence in their southern province,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she was sending
Holbrooke to present Milosevic with a ``stark choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That choice, she said, was for him to agree to the settlement
signed in Paris last week by the ethnic Albanians who make up most
of Kosovo's population, or face NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   As Holbrooke prepared to leave Sunday night, Milosevic's forces
remained unintimidated. Taking advantage of the absence of 1,400
international monitors who withdrew from Kosovo on Saturday, they
continued their rampage through Kosovo, burning ethnic Albanian
villages.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where Holbrooke will
stop Monday morning before flying on to Belgrade, U.S. officials
presented NATO ambassadors with a plan for stepped-up bombing
targets in Kosovo, a move intended to strengthen Holbrooke's
position with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Sunday that another diplomatic push by Holbrooke was justified
``one final time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we owe it to the American people,'' Berger said on the
CBS program ``Face the Nation.'' ``We owe it to our military
people, our allies, to make that final attempt, even as the
preparations continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that plans for NATO airstrikes were simultaneously
moving forward. ``The preference is to find a peace agreement that
will bring stability to Kosovo, peace to Kosovo, and rights to the
Kosovar people,'' Berger said. ``If we can achieve that with the
imminent threat of force, that will be a good result.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has negotiated for hundreds of hours with
Milosevic over the last four years, appeared to have a particularly
difficult assignment this time.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton administration officials said Sunday that
Holbrooke was being sent to deliver Milosevic the message of peace
or war.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has shown a pattern in the past of backing down at
the last minute. Should he show signs of doing so this time,
Holbrooke will likely be left with the task of negotiating around
the edges of the peace settlement that the ethnic Albanians signed
at the Paris peace talks last week. Changes to the terms of the
peace settlement could well drive the ethnic Albanians to renege on
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic is ready to agree to a NATO-led force which
can include other nations, we're ready to discuss it without
betraying the ethnic Albanians,'' a senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The official acknowledged that there was ``very little
maneuvering room, because of the 81-page document out of Paris.''

NEW YORK'S ELITE KEEP A POSTHUMOUS WATCH OVER ONE OF THEIR OWN  
 TV VIES FOR INTERVIEWS WITH REAL LIFE GRIFTERS  
 A WEB SITE BECOMES A BOOK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Eric M. Breindel, the conservative talk-show
moderator and former editor of The New York Post opinion page, died
last year at the age of 42, his funeral drew hundreds of mourners,
including Henry A. Kissinger, Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. There were so many eulogies that the ceremony lasted four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those people are keeping a careful eye on his image.
When a New York magazine reporter, Craig Horowitz, was preparing a
profile of Breindel for the magazine's March 21 issue, its editors
got calls from concerned relatives like his mother, Sonia; friends
like Lally Weymouth, a columnist for The Washington Post, and even
representatives of public figures like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Cristyne F. Lategano, the mayor's communications director,
called New York's editor in chief, Caroline Miller, to register
concern about the article, which highlights the mayor's friendship
with Breindel and says that in 1993 Breindel used his working
relationship with Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp. to
persuade Murdoch to endorse Giuliani as a mayoral candidate. But
Ms. Miller said that Ms. Lategano's concern was mostly personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cristyne was calling as a friend of the Breindel family to
discourage me from running this piece,'' Ms. Miller said. ``And I
assured her that I thought the piece was fair and civilized, and
even generous, and that I planned to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz attributed the number of phone calls to the fact that
powerful people are anxious to preserve the memory of one of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``To what can one attribute the concern?'' Horowitz said. ``I
think that he was a beloved member of the ruling class in New York.
And as such, the people around him were very protective of his
memory. He was a friend and an ideological ally for many of those
people and it's a friendship they took very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Breindel used to say that you could tell who was
your friend by who would help you bury a body at 3 o'clock in the
morning, and by that measure he had a lot of very good friends.''

   The Battle for Interviews with Sante and Kenneth Kimes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes,'' it seemed, had won. After battling off the
competition, the CBS news program had landed one of the biggest
Manhattan crime-story interviews of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On March 11, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, the reputed mother and son
``grifters'' con artist team who are charged murder in the
disappearance of an Upper East Side millionaire last summer, sat
down with the reporter Steve Kroft for their first extensive
on-camera interview. The mother and son are scheduled to go on
trial in the murder of Irene Silverman later this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the interview, in the Manhattan Detention Center, was brief
and ended badly, say jail officials who were present. After 30
largely innocuous minutes of talk, in which the Kimeses professed
their innocence and discussed life before they landed behind
Manhattan bars, the Kimes' lawyers objected when Kroft asked a
question about their life style.
</P>
<P>
   The interview resumed again, jail personnel said, but was
repeatedly halted by the Kimes lawyers, who said the mother and son
could not answer any questions about alleged past ``bad acts'' that
could be raised against them at trial. The end came when Kroft
asked Kimes about college, beginning a question with ``I see from
your transcripts that you got an A in acting.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer, Matthew Weissman, leapt to his feet and
shouted ``Cut!'', according to jail personnel. Despite much
negotiation, the interview never resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for ``60 Minutes,'' said he could not
comment on a piece currently in production. Weissman said the
Kimeses complied with the ground rules agreed to prior to the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The false start was far from a first. Last August, the program
``Fox Files'' spent $15,000 to fly two members of the Kimes defense
team to Grand Cayman to shoot supporting footage for a promised
exclusive interview with the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But while Fox was shooting in Grand Cayman, Cindy Adams of The
New York Post printed a telephone interview with Mrs. Kimes from
jail. Eric Shawn, a senior correspondent on ``Fox Files,'' said the
Kimes' lawyer, Mel A. Sachs, never told him about The Post
interview, which was conducted the night before the group left for
the tropics. Fox ended up broadcasting a statement Mrs. Kimes left
on Shawn's answering machine on Fox News Channel on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Shawn has not given up. He was back in the Criminal Courts
Building on Friday, talking to Mrs. Kimes and seeking an on-camera
interview.
</P>

   _ DAVID RHODE
</P>
<P>
   From the New Media Back to the Old
</P>
<P>
   The world of work _ not to mention, publishing _ is vastly
different from the days when the oral historian Studs Terkel set
about chronicling it in his book ``Working'' 25 years ago. Which is
why the staff at the online magazine Word (http://www.word.com) was
inspired to conduct a series of interviews about how people make
their livings in a regular column published on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the column is to be collected in a book, part of a growing
trend of such Web-inspired publications. The built-in audience that
a Web site provides is a growing attraction to publishers who were
once dismissive of the electronic medium. The Web also provides a
testing ground for material, a dry run for potential publishers to
see what works and what does not.
</P>
<P>
   For the Word book, Crown Books has signed a deal in the ``high
five figures,'' said Marisa Bowe, the publisher of Word, to publish
the collection. Included in the book, to be titled ``Gig,'' are
interviews with people who offer a decidedly hip twist on Terkel's
original.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: a tofu manufacturer, a workfare street cleaner, a
UPS driver, a heavy-metal roadie, a drug dealer and a squash
instructor. (``I'm a prostitute, a therapist and a squash pro, in
that order.'')
</P>
<P>
   While 70 percent of the book will be interviews that have been
published on line in Word and are archived on the site, the rest of
the interviews will be newly generated. Release is scheduled for
spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Pepper, the editor at Crown who bought ``Gig,'' said the
publisher had printed another book inspired by a Web site. The
creators of the Onion (http://www.theonion.com), an online news
satire site, came up with Our Dumb Century, a collection of 150
fictitious front pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we have a really funny book here, whether you've
heard of the Onion or not,'' Pepper said. ``It's not really a Web
or Net book. It's a book that happens to stem from a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Griscom, the co-founder of a Web site about sex called
Nerve.com (http://www.nerve.com/), said that the notion of a book
was foremost in his mind when he started the site. ``Nerve,
Literate Smut: The Book'' (Bantam), which contains 33 essays
originally published on the site, was released in October, and is
in its third printing.
</P>
<P>
   He said the anthology had helped him raise money for his
business. ``There's something persuasive about physical matter,''
he said.

SAUDIS RESTRICT USE OF U.S. AIRCRAFT AGAINST IRAQ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ Nearly three months of U.S. bombings
against Iraq are proving an irritant to ties between the United
States and Saudi Arabia, as senior Saudi officials acknowledge that
the kingdom refuses to allow U.S. warplanes based here to take part
in what it regards as punitive raids.
</P>
<P>
   The kingdom is the main base for U.S. warplanes in the region,
and its stand has forced the United States to tailor its tactics in
what has become a low-level war against Iraq, by relying more
heavily on Navy aircraft and on warplanes at other bases.
</P>
<P>
   While Saudi officials make clear privately that they too would
like to see someone other than Saddam Hussein ruling Iraq, their
position is a clear indication of the discomfort felt here over the
American-led campaign. The strikes by British and U.S. jets have
occurred on average once every other day since Dec. 28, hitting
more than 110 targets, mostly air-defense sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever has to do with going out and hitting targets in Iraq
will not have the support of the kingdom,'' a senior Saudi official
said in an interview, spelling out for the first time in public a
position that has frustrated U.S. military planners.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi position is not new, as the kingdom has distanced
itself from overt military action against Iraq since the end of the
Persian Gulf War in 1991, but it is at odds with the more assertive
U.S. military strategy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Saudis have objected to the loosened rules of
engagement for U.S. warplanes, which include an expanded definition
of self defense that has allowed pilots to strike Iraqi
anti-aircraft batteries, missile launchers, communications towers
and other targets even when they present no direct threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi officials said their government was insisting that
Saudi-based warplanes be kept under a tight leash, authorizing the
use of force in Iraq only in response to a direct threat, such as
signs that aircraft were being targeted in preparation for the
firing of an antiaircraft missile.
</P>
<P>
   The defense secretary, William J. Cohen, and other U.S.
officials have portrayed the shift in U.S. strategy as defensive,
saying that it was prompted by aggression on the part of Iraq,
which has vowed to shoot down U.S. warplanes patrolling the
no-flight zones. But that explanation has been viewed with
skepticism across the Arab world, where it is seen as a cover for
an undeclared campaign to step up pressure on the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   When Cohen visited Saudi Arabia and five other friendly Persian
Gulf countries earlier this month to explain the policy, he won no
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one senior Saudi security official said that his
government had obtained information suggesting that the recent
American-led attacks had ``substantially weakened'' the Iraqi
leader, and made it ``much more likely'' that segments of the Iraqi
military might attempt to topple him.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. military spokesman in Saudi Arabia said he could not
discuss whether the U.S. aircraft in Saudi Arabia were operating
under different constraints than those elsewhere in the region. He
also would not say whether U.S. planes based in Saudi Arabia had
taken part in any of the recent strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I am prepared to say that we've had good cooperation from
all the host nations,'' said the spokesman, Capt. Michael Shavers
of the Air Force. The kingdom was the base for the U.S.-led
military operations that drove Iraq from Kuwait in the Persian Gulf
War of 1991, and at least 60 Air Force F-16s and F-15 warplanes are
currently based here.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi officials who agreed to discuss the issue would do so
only on condition of anonymity. But their willingness to do so may
have been prompted by a propaganda assault from Iraq, which has
lambasted Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for what its officials have
called their complicity in the U.S.-led attack.

</P>
<P>
   In January, Saddam called on Arabs in the region to rise up
against governments that he portrayed as stooges of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations last week, Abdulrahman al-Ahmed, charge
d'affaires at the Saudi mission, issued a letter that dismissed
Iraqi allegations about the use of Saudi territory as a base for
military strikes as ``completely gratuitous and unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia consistently has refused to allow U.S. combat
planes based in the kingdom to join in any new overt military
campaign against Iraq. In early December, when American and British
forces launched the four-day air campaign known as Operation Desert
Fox, that meant that the warplanes based in the kingdom _ nearly
half of the strike aircraft in the region at the time _ were
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Saudi policy forced U.S. military planners to
rely more heavily on other forces in the region, including
carrier-based Navy F-14s and F-18s, and on cruise missiles launched
from the sea and from B-52 bombers based on the British island of
Diego Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and since, Saudi and U.S. officials say, American
warplanes based in Saudi Arabia have continued to patrol the skies
over the southern Iraq, their main military mission.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, known as Southern Watch, is intended to enforce
the no-flight zone that the United States, Britain and France
imposed in that region after the Persian Gulf War of 1991, to limit
the mobility of Iraqi military force. Of the 110 or so targets hit
since December, 45 have been in southern Iraq, said Shavers, the
U.S. military spokesman in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been for years, Saudi officials said, U.S. pilots
based in Saudi Arabia remain authorized to use force against Iraq
in situations of direct threat. But the Saudi officials said their
government has refused to accept the looser rules of engagement
that American commanders have now put in effect, which have allowed
much broader latitude for American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We object to any nation taking matters into its own hands, and
using bombing as an instrument of diplomacy,'' a senior Saudi
security official said. ``We have adopted the principle that our
bases will not be used as a means of punitive operations that go
beyond the purpose of the no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December, that meant that planes going out of here to hit
Iraqi targets were not allowed, and they are not being allowed
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Only if the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of military
force against Iraq would the Saudi position change, the Saudi
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 200 American planes now in the region, as part of
Operation Southern Watch, about half are based in Saudi Arabia,
including support planes for refueling and reconnaissance as well
as the fighter aircraft. About 60 others are Navy planes aboard the
aircraft carrier Enterprise in the Persian Gulf, with the remainder
scattered among bases in other Gulf countries, including Kuwait,
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Navy has a smaller share of the force, its fighters
have played a slightly larger role in the attacks on southern Iraq,
according to U.S. military officials. They say that 55 Navy
aircraft have taken part in strikes on 47 targets in southern Iraq
since Dec. 28, compared to 52 planes from the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force planes based at a United States base in Incirlik,
Turkey, are responsible for patrolling the no-flight zone in
northern Iraq, and they have carried out the strikes on the more
than 55 targets there.

SOFTWARE SEPARATES PERSONAL TELEPHONE CALLS FROM BUSINESS CHARGES  
 JELLYFISH EXTRACT MAKES FOOD GLOW IN THE DARK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Canada)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad news for workers everywhere who surreptitiously award
themselves an unofficial perk: a Canadian inventor has patented
software that can identify personal long-distance calls made from
telephones in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-distance charges total about $100 billion a year in the
states, and half of that is business related,'' said David Yanor,
an entrepreneur and sales manager in Vancouver, British Columbia.
``Experts say anywhere from 10 to 30 percent is unreimbursed
personal long-distance calls. That's a black hole for most
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanor recently discovered for himself what that was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a visitor in my house who made copious phone calls to
friends across the continent on the same phone I used for
business,'' he said, ``and I had a very hard time determining which
were mine and which had to be collected from someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, businesses have had few remedies to control this
abuse other than installing systems that block all outgoing
long-distance calls. Phone companies have not offered much help,
especially since they charge for these long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yanor hopes his software will change that. His system enables a
business to establish a directory of approved business numbers,
such as those of other branch offices, customers, clients and
suppliers. The system then cross-references phone bills with that
directory, matching numbers called with those in the authorized
directory. Finally, it produces one of two reports: either bills
with enhanced information about who was called, or a list of
unauthorized long-distance numbers only. The latter can identify
the holders of those numbers with data taken from directory
assistance information.
</P>
<P>
   Yanor's patent says his software would search national and even
international telephone directory data bases. Presumably, a
business owner would thus be able to determine if an unauthorized
call was placed to a potential new client, or to an employee's
friend or relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially how it works is that I will license it to phone
companies that will offer it as an additional enhancement, which is
where they're making all their money these days, for corporate
customers and even residential customers,'' Yanor said. ``All it is
is an enhancement to a phone bill, so a business gets on every line
the name of the company and person called. It's not Greek anymore,
you can actually see it all on the phone bill. I call it Call
Recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would suddenly permit the company, without saying
anything, to change behavior in employees, because people would
know they are being monitored closely,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Yanor said he had approached phone companies in Canada and the
United States with his idea, but they were less than enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phone companies feel this would diminish their long-distance
revenues,'' he said. ``But bill enhancements typically have a 75
percent profit margin, while long distance typically has a 10 to 11
percent profit margin.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that many phone numbers, such as
unlisted numbers or cellular phone numbers, would remain
unidentifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Yanor received patent 5,842,174. &QL;

   Food That Glows In the Dark
</P>
<P>
   Birthday cakes look especially impressive when presented in a
darkened room with candles ablaze. They might look even more
dramatic if the ``happy birthday'' wishes on the cake glowed in the
dark, even after the candles were blown out. Partygoers might then
toast the guest of honor with luminescent soda pop or beer.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is extract of jellyfish, glow worm or firefly mixed
into the cake frosting or the drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bryan, a surgeon and founder of a Pittsburgh company
called Prolume Ltd. has won a patent for a self-illuminating
extract made from bioluminescent creatures. His patent covers using
the extract to create glowing textiles, ink, paints, paper, toys
(``particularly reloadable squirt guns that eject a bioluminescent
fluid''), dolls (and ``dummies with internal organs or parts that
glow'') toy cigarettes (``that produce glowing smoke''), toy eggs
(``with glowing yolks and/or whites''), bubble-blowers, fountains
that expel glowing fluid, and bioluminescent ``fireworks.'' He even
envisions glowing fish food to feed transgenic fish so they'll
light up after they've eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Additives that make the food or beverages glow are derived from
the genes of a variety of creatures, most of them underwater
inhabitants like jellyfish, crustaceans, molluscs and vampire
squid. Some worms and fireflies qualify as well. Bioluminescence is
rare, and occurs when an enzyme or other protein is combined with a
fuel molecule. The addition of oxygen energizes the molecule. As
the energy subsides, it is released in the form of light.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it is working on a cake frosting that glows
bright blue for up to half an hour, and on luminescent yogurt, ice
cream and beverages.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement of the patent explains that the company's
researchers ``believe that these additives are safe since they are
present in the ocean's food chain.'' But the Food and Drug
Administration still has to examine and approve them for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bryan's patent also covers using bioluminescence to
``attract attention, such as for advertising goods and/or services
that are associated with a logo or trademark.'' He received patent
5,876,995. &QL;

RANGERS AIM TO EASE CULTURAL ADJUSTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STAR-TELEGRAM STAFF 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Twenty-one-year-old Ruben Mateo is the
hottest prospect in the Rangers' organization. He could be
patrolling center field in Arlington by next season.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Rangers believe the Dominican Republic native will be
much better prepared to handle the move to the majors off the field
than young stars they've promoted from Latin America in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, for example, speaks better English than Rangers all-stars
Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez did at a similar stage in their
careers. Mateo said he appreciates the effort the Rangers are
making to help him adjust to a new culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers try to make you a better player on and off the
field,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' effort to ease the cultural shock of adjusting to a
foreign country is understandable. The organization has long been a
leader in tapping the pipeline of talent from Latin America. There
are 75 Latin American players in the farm system, but immigration
laws limit the team to having a maximum of 32 playing in the United
States at one time. The rest play in the Rangers' Dominican summer
league and the farm club in the Venezuelan league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the faster they make the cultural
transition the more successful they can become on the field,'' farm
director Reid Nichols said. ``We try to go the extra mile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers began a computer program last year to help foreign
players speed their grasp of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our guys that different instructors can say the same
things over and over, but it will be that one sentence or phrase
that clicks with them,'' Nichols said. ``We don't want them to miss
that one sentence or phrase that can change their careers, so we
tell them they need to learn as much English as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers hired a cultural director for their Dominican
Baseball Academy, Juan Peralta, this winter. He instructs players
on how to organize their lives away from the park, including basics
such as renting an apartment and ordering food at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Rangers hired Jaime Garcia as their Latin
American liaison in the United States. He helps players throughout
the minor-league system in this country make the adjustment. Last
week, for example, he worked with Latin players to get Social
Security cards. Garcia is also a pitching coach for the Rangers'
rookie league affiliate in the Gulf Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also ask major-leaguers to talk to younger prospects
about adapting to life in the United States. Gonzalez, Rodriguez
and Rangers infielder Luis Alicea went to the minor-league complex
recently to talk to players.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Rangers have a Rookie Career Development
Program to educate teammates about the problems Latin players face.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they know what's going on,'' Nichols said. ``So they won't
be judgmental, so they'll be understanding and try to help these
guys make the adjustment.''

FOREIGN ATHLETES AT TCU STRUGGLE WITH A VARIETY OF THINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
WITH FOREIGN PLAYERS PACKAGE 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A chance to play basketball brought TCU
guard Vladimir Jaksic to Texas from Croatia two summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   He just had a small problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``English,'' Jaksic admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Jaksic, few programs existed at Blinn College,
a two-year school, to help him adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned by practicing,'' Jaksic said of his English. ``Some
days were hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaksic, like many foreign student-athletes, realized many
challenges awaited him when he left Zagreb, Croatia. He soon
realized he would be dealing with a lot of them by himself.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of foreign athletes participate in college
athletics in America, and universities such as TCU, UT-Arlington
and North Texas find themselves trying to discover ways to help
them adjust to the differences in language and culture as well as
the demands of being a student and athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five percent of our students are international
students,'' said Dr. David Keitges, associate director of
international studies and programs at North Texas. ``I would think
foreign athletes would have the same needs as other foreign
students.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU and UNT have programs for foreign students, although the
schools lack specific programs for foreign student-athletes. Jaksic
said TCU coaches have played a big role in helping him adjust to a
new culture, and advisers available to all student-athletes have
provided academic help.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Keitany, a TCU distance runner from Kenya, said fellow
foreign students have been helped her adjust to everyday issues
like laundry.
</P>
<P>
   It was David Lagat, another distance runner from Kenya, who
explained a washer and dryer to Keitany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' Keitany said.

STARS' GLOBAL CHANGE SPARKS NEED TO ADAPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
WITH FOREIGN PLAYERS PACKAGE 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When the Stars moved to Texas in 1993, about the
biggest transition a Stars player had was adapting to Southern
cooking and learning to say y'all. But then the Stars' organization
began to change.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of the success of division rival Detroit in bringing
in foreign talent, the Stars beefed up their European scouting and
began the move to a more global organization. They drafted four
Finnish players _ including Jere Lehtinen, the Selke Trophy winner
as best defensive forward last season _ and a Swede in the 1992 and
1993 drafts. In 1994, they drafted their first Russian-born player,
Evgeny Petrochinin. In the past two seasons they have used eight of
15 draft picks on foreign players.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change for the organization came in 1996, when
they traded for Sergei Zubov, signed Sergei Makarov and Arturs Irbe
as free agents, brought Lehtinen from Finland and assigned goalie
Roman Turek from the Czech Republic to their minor-league affiliate
in Kalamazoo, Mich. Then, the European transition became an issue
the club had to tackle head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we traded for Zubov, we decided it was very
important that as an organization we do everything we could to help
him adapt,'' said Dan Stuchal, director of team services for the
Stars. ``We had heard things were a lot harder for him in
Pittsburgh than they were in New York, and we didn't want that to
play any role in him not enjoying his time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov had been traded from the New York Rangers to the Penguins
the previous season and had a difficult time adjusting in
Pittsburgh after leaving friends he had made in a Russian community
in Brighton Beach, N.Y. So Stuchal went out of his way to find a
similar community in Dallas. He scouted Russian bookstores,
restaurants, delis and clubs. He found Zubov a real-estate agent
who speaks Russian, as well as providing help in continuing to
learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was most interesting to me is that I learned Dallas
really does have a very large and very strong Russian community,''
Stuchal said. ``I think sometimes we don't really see the world
around us when we're not looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov didn't grow up with dreams of playing for the Stanley Cup.
He didn't think about big-dollar contracts and fancy cars. He
certainly didn't think much about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just played hockey,'' the Stars defenseman said of his
youth in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   So, when NHL teams began plucking players out of the Soviet
Union in the early 1990s, he wasn't prepared for the move. All he
knew, he said, was: ``It was time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with only a few words of English, Zubov was shuffled into
the Rangers organization in 1992 and was sent to minor-league
Binghamton, N.Y. Along the way, he simply went where the team went,
did what the team told him and kept to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, very hard,'' Zubov said. ``You leave your family
and friends, you come to a new place and can't speak the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still hard for Zubov, 28, though he communicates well in
English. There are still times, he said, when he doesn't get a
joke, when he feels left out in a conversation, when it would be so
much easier to speak Russian. He is smart but self-conscious, and
struggles with on-camera interviews. He rarely does them for fear
of sounding unintelligent.
</P>
<P>
   But, he's become comfortable in his Dallas surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time, but it's good now,'' said Zubov, 28, who is
married and has a young son. ``You get friends, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Stuchal and the Stars have helped assimilate
Lehtinen and Lind from Finland, Sergey Gusev from Russia and Turek
and Petr Buzek from the Czech Republic. In the process, the Stars
have shed their image as a North American stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization, I think it is something that can be
important to your success,'' Stuchal said. ``We're going to do
everything we can to make it easy for them to adapt. Because we
know how hard it is.''

FOREIGN INTRIGUE: MAVERICKS' NOWITZKI ADJUSTS TO AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 Fixes 3rd graf, miles from family 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a good thing Dirk Nowitzki has broad shoulders,
considering that he carries with him the future of basketball in
his native Germany, the future of the long-downtrodden Mavericks
and, right this minute, an acute craving for a TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too homesick,'' Nowitzki said of adjusting to life
away from Germany. ``But I miss most of all Mom's kitchen. She
cooks everything. My cooking, it doesn't taste pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   How together were you at the age of 20? Now imagine yourself 7
feet tall. Now imagine yourself leaving the comfort of your home,
your friends and your family to live thousands of miles away. Now
imagine that you've done all this while saddled with the
expectation that you are destined to be an all-star, a Great White
Hope, a messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki is the latest experiment in the growing trend of pro
teams in North America going international. The Mavericks' Nowitzki
and Chris Anstey (Australia), two first-round draft picks, are from
overseas. The Stars have used eight of 15 draft picks the past two
years on foreign players. The Rangers have 75 players in their
minor-league system from Latin America, including their No. 1
prospect, center fielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks general manager Don Nelson doesn't dismiss the
difficulty foreign players have in adjusting to life in the United
States. That doesn't stop him, however, from gambling on their
talent. He said the learning curve for a player like Nowitzki is
longer than for U.S. players but that that's no reason to not take
a chance on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 4 billion people in the world,'' Nelson said. ``It's
a little silly, maybe even a little arrogant, to think that the
only good basketball players are within some tiny radius of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nowitzki to succeed, however, Nelson knows he needs to make
the transition to American life off the court, as well as on, where
he has struggled to keep up physically with the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy America,'' Nowitzki said. ``But I don't think when I'm
old I'll be here. And when the season ends, I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how he's making the adjustment, put yourself
in Nowitzki's size-15 shoes. Slip into 48 hours of being Dirk.
Starting now:
Tuesday evening The Suns-Mavericks game should have been over by
now. But moisture on the Reunion Arena floor causes a delay of more
than an hour. Nowitzki's body clock is confused, believing it's
time to do postgame interviews, then time to eat a snack, then time
to be in bed before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' Nowitzki said after the loss in which he plays only
10 minutes, ``I was still up at midnight. Shopping. I had no food
in my household.'' So, he made a midnight run to Albertson's.
``Weird. Nobody else in the whole place.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV dinner scarfed, Nowitzki went to bed, first with music,
then with a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to everything,'' he said. ``I like Lauryn Hill. Rap,
soul, black music. When I was young I liked AC/DC. In Germany we
have something called `technogroove.' I like it.''
Wednesday morning Nowitzki is up at 9 a.m. and feeling sheepish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually get up earlier than this,'' he said, almost
apologetically. ``But it's OK, because my apartment is so close to
\Rthe team's practice facility.\S''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the arrangement is cozy. Mavericks teammates Hubert
Davis, Anstey and Steve Nash live in the same complex. Logically,
Anstey _ a 7-foot-tall second-year pro who shares Nowitzki's
passion and skill for tennis _ has become a close friend. Nash,
meanwhile, is a baby sitter of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve helps me so much,'' Nowitzki said.
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to write checks,'' Nowitzki said. ``I'd never
done anything like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson of the living
arrangements: ``It was sort of a coincidence. But Steve helps take
care of that homesickness thing. It's kind of preventative
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast, Nowitzki has Frosted Flakes. A steady diet of TV
dinners and Frosted Flakes? One can't help but suggest that
Nowitzki will someday need some sort of medicine, preventative or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki arrives at the practice facility at 10 a.m. driving a
rental car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big long car, so I like it,'' he said. ``I just decided
to rent it for three months. Maybe next year I'll buy one. When I
was little I always liked Mercedes-Benz, but it's not important
now.'' Besides, he added, ``I'm hardly ever driving. Apartment,
Reunion, practice, and to the airport. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   At practice, Nowitzki gets schooled by veteran A.C. Green.
Nowitzki is three inches taller and forever wider than ``Gramps,''
but the vet knows tricks. Green's side runs a series of
pick-and-rolls, forcing Nowitzki's side to adjust and switch men.
In one sequence, Nowitzki finds himself guarding the 6-9 Green,
then bullish forward Gary Trent, then Davis, a guard.
</P>
<P>
   Green _ who implores his unit with screams of ``Fourth quarter,
who wants it?'' _ leads his team to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Green assaults Nowitzki with good old-fashioned American trash
talk. Nowitzki grins. The kid may have the easiest smile in the
NBA, except sometimes one gets the impression he guffaws at the
joke although he doesn't get the punchline.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's just that trash talk is absolutely not my style, so I
laugh,'' Nowitzki said. ``I don't know who needs it. I'm a shy
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To end practice, most of the Mavericks disband from the
scrimmage to work individually on free throws. But Nowitzki, Anstey
and fellow young big man Samaki Walker are summoned to one end of
the gym, where they work one-on-one on their inside games.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nowitzki and the Mavericks embark on the tiresome
part of their work day. First comes a practice-ending session with
coaches. Then comes an NBA security meeting. Then come visits with
the media. Then comes a mandatory weight-lifting session.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there's the 20-20 rule,'' Nowitzki said. ``If you
don't play 20 minutes \Rin the previous night's game\S, you've got
to ride the \Rexercise\S bike for 20 minutes. Fun.''
Wednesday evening Time for another $30 visit to the grocery in
preparation for tomorrow's visit from Nowitzki's father and in
satisfaction of two more dietary cravings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love sweets,'' Nowitzki said. ``And I drink lots of Sprite.
Lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki also stops by Target to purchase sheets and pillows for
the new bed he bought for the visit from his father, Joerg.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., the bed is set up, the sweets are gone and it's time
for a rare look at the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Americanized in that I don't watch any TV, really,''
said Nowitzki, who is watching the National Invitation Tournament
on ESPN with Nash as his visitor. ``I watch some basketball games
on TV, but nothing like soap operas or anything. In Germany, we get
CNN. And there's a superchannel that shows Jay Leno and Seinfeld
and The Cosby Show, all translated. But it's not my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki is asleep by 10:30, anticipating a home game tomorrow
night against the tough Orlando Magic, dreaming of performing well
in front of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw my first game in Seattle because it was broadcast on
German TV,'' Nowitzki said. ``But this will be the first time he's
seen me in person in America. And it will be his first time in the
States. Both of us are excited.''
Thursday morning Nowitzki is happy to clear up misconceptions about
his hometown of Wurzburg, misportrayed by the Fort Worth-Dallas
media as a sleepy little backwater village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is small by American standards, I think, but quite large by
German standards,'' he said. ``Very cultural. It was completely
bombed in the Second War. But it's been rebuilt. A cultural center.
A castle. Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Nowitzki's day would normally follow a typical NBA
player's game-day pattern, except for the fact that his father and
the boyfriend of Dirk's sister will soon arrive at Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to talk to my girlfriend back home every day,'' Nowitzki
said, speaking softly as he mentions Sybille Gerer, 20. ``I do miss
her. She's been here twice, and wants to come back again soon. But
she doesn't like the States too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nowitzki, Gerer is a basketball standout. She plays forward
on a club team in Germany. But Nowitzki said they almost never talk
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Gerer lived here, he would go out more. More
restrictive, however, is his age. While his father is visiting,
he'll try to get out to a Dallas steakhouse. But that's as
adventurous as his nightlife gets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried going out a bit, but every time I go to the bar,
they want to see my passport,'' said Nowitzki, adding that he
half-expected the occasional barkeep to not bother carding a 7-foot
man. ``In Germany, 18 is the age you can drive. And 16 is the age
you can drink a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything especially American Nowitzki is looking forward to as
part of his 21st birthday June 19?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be able to drink here,'' he said. ``But to be honest, I
don't like your beer. Ugh. It's like lemonade.''
Thursday afternoon Joerg Nowitzki and his daughter's boyfriend
arrive. After Dirk picks them up, Joerg expresses disappointment at
his first glimpse of the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't it be hot?'' he said, smiling. ``It's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirk drops his guests off at the apartment, arranges for them to
take a cab to Reunion and bids them goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 p.m., it's time for the short drive that precedes a
seven-hour night at Reunion Arena that, for him, will produce only
a few minutes of on-court time.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:20 p.m., Nowitzki makes his first appearance with 5:55 left
in the second quarter, the ninth man in Dallas' rotation. He scores
a basket on his first shot and commits a foul on each of the next
two possessions. But at least he contributes something (seven
points and two rebounds) in what will be a 93-76 upset victory
against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Near halftime, Joerg Nowitzki is interviewed on the Mavs' TV
broadcast. ``Hello, Dallas Mavericks!'' Joerg said into the
microphone. ``I love you!''
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, and a 48-hour peek into his life, Nowitzki has
time to reflect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about the pressure of being a German, or about
my role in the future,'' he said in a festive post-game locker
room. ``No, not at all. I'm just 20. I'm struggling the last two or
three weeks. Riding the bench. I must just worry about my game.
That's enough for me right now.''

NATO SAID TO BE FAVORING PLAN FOR HEAVY BOMBING IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-U.S. and KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC) 
(ms) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO Sunday appeared to be moving toward
agreement on a U.S. plan that would authorize heavy bombing
directly against elite Serbian units carrying out attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the allied ambassadors had authorized a short, sharp
attack of cruise missiles on Serbian military installations,
followed if necessary by strikes at Serbia's air defenses, in their
effort to force the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept
an agreement on autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, alliance members are increasingly convinced that
it will take heavy bombing against the 40,000 Serbian troops and
police now on the offensive in Kosovo, the southern Serbian
province whose two million people are almost all ethnic Albanians,
for Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, officials said, wants to give NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana authority to order strikes directly
against Milosevic's attacking forces. NATO commanders _ who have an
armada of more than 400 U.S., British and French airplanes as well
as ships with cruise missiles in the Adriatic _ could launch such
strikes within hours of getting the order, officers say.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the U.S. plan here Sunday, the allies failed to
reach a decision, however, and said they would reconvene Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations were taking place in an atmosphere of mounting
crisis, not only for the tens of thousands of civilians now fleeing
the offensive in Kosovo but for the alliance's own credibility 50
years after its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the alliance shows that it is prepared carry out its
threats, one high-ranking NATO official said Sunday, Milosevic is
increasingly unlikely to halt his offensive and accept a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks are no surprise,'' the official said.
``Milosevic has taught the West over many decades that he only
listens to force, or to threats of force.'' Milosevic responded to
heavy allied bombing in Bosnia in 1995 by agreeing to force Serbs
there to accept a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get across to President Milosevic that we are
serious,'' Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said on BBC
Radio Sunday. ``This is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine have sounded equally tough since peace talks on Kosovo
sponsored by France and Britain collapsed on Friday, blaming the
failure on Serbian intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use every opportunity we can get,'' said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who chaired a meeting of the 15
European Union foreign ministers here Sunday, ``to achieve a
peaceful solution and avoid a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment,'' he added, ``it seems Belgrade is determined
to risk that confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   They hoped that the threat alone would get Milosevic to agree to
peace talks in France. He did agree, but on his instructions
Serbian negotiators refused to accept a settlement that would
provide autonomy for the province and 28,000 alliance-led
peacekeepers to guarantee it for at least three years, and the
talks broke off in Paris last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes alone, an experienced military officer cautioned,
could not stop the Serbian forces in Kosovo from carrying out
further attacks against rebel forces and the civilian population
that supports them.
</P>
<P>
   They could disrupt and delay such attacks, but most importantly,
this officer said, air strikes would show Milosevic that, after
nearly half a year of verbal threats, the alliance actually meant
business.
</P>
<P>
   If air strikes do not make Milosevic back down, the allies could
yet be forced to decide whether the 28,000 planned peacekeepers
should fight their way into Kosovo from Macedonia to make the Serbs
accept peace. That is a step no one yet seems ready to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has tested its credibility in the new,
post-Cold War era more directly than Soviet leaders ever did while
the Cold War lasted, even though they had an enormous army whose
tanks could have rolled westward into Germany over allied defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of United States nuclear retaliation for any such
attack was taken so seriously that Moscow never tried one. So
NATO's first 40 years ended with the collapse of communism in
Europe without a shot fired by the allies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the second time in four years, the alliance is
confronted with the need to respond to the threat of instability in
the Balkans caused by Milosevic. ``We're witnessing a tragic
escalation of the fighting, caused by Serb aggression against the
civilian populace,'' NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark of the United States, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, the chief of the alliance's
military committee, gave the ambassadors of its 19 countries _
including three formerly Communist ones, the Czech Republic,
Poland, and Hungary _ a report Sunday on what he called ``a very
rapidly deteriorating situation on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Defying earlier threats by the allies and breaching commitments
he gave last fall to the United States special envoy for the
region, Richard C. Holbrooke, Milosevic has now increased the size
of Yugoslav National Army and special police forces in the province
to about 40,000, a high-ranking NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes could strike those forces using intelligence on
their positions gathered from pilotless reconnaissance planes that
have been flying over the province.
</P>
<P>
   Three allied officers are still in Belgrade providing liaison
with the German units that carry out the missions.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes Sunday, officials said, Solana was consulting
with international leaders involved in the crisis to see whether
they all shared the determination, expressed by President Clinton
and the British and French leaders, to go ahead with bombing over
Russian opposition if that was what it finally takes to get
Milosevic to change his mind.

AND NOW THE NBA ENVELOPE, PLEASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ridiculous as it seems, the NBA's 50-game irregular season
reaches the halfway point this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dennis Rodman's annual AWOL brought an ironic sense of
business as usual, this surreal spring has the Bulls with only
seven wins, the Clippers with only 21 losses and Don Nelson with
job security.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to look closer to see them while simultaneously
tuning out the critics screaming about woeful shooting and low
scoring, but there are some good players playing good basketball.
In lieu of an All-Star break and as an undercard to tonight's
Oscars, one observer's mid-season award winners:
</P>
<P>
   MVP: Allen Iverson, Sixers. Like Mike, he can create and make
any shot from anywhere on the court. Without him, the overachieving
Sixers are lottery fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive Player of the Year: Alonzo Mourning, Heat. He
intimidates, rebounds, blocks shots and grabs every loose ball with
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year: Paul Pierce, Celtics. He can't dunk like
Vince Carter or pass like Jason Williams, but the versatile Pierce
is by far the most polished of an impressive new crop.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth Man of the Year: Darrell Armstrong, Magic. As Penny
Hardaway's energetic backup, Armstrong leads all players who have
not started a game in scoring (11.7 ppg), assists (6.2 apg) and
steals (2.1 spg).
</P>
<P>
   Most Improved Player of the Year: Joe Smith, Timberwolves. A
disaster in Golden State and Philadelphia, Smith is suddenly a
legitimate low-post threat in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year: Pat Riley, Heat. Despite injuries to starters
Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard, the master motivator has
developed his team into the toughest mental bunch in the league.
</P>
<P>
   East All-Stars: PG: Tim Hardaway, Heat; SG: Allen Iverson,
Sixers; SF: Grant Hill, Pistons; PF: Shawn Kemp, Cavaliers; C:
Alonzo Mourning, Heat.
</P>
<P>
   West All-Stars: PG: Jason Kidd, Suns; SG: Kobe Bryant, Lakers;
SF: Rasheed Wallace, Blazers; PF: Karl Malone, Jazz; C: Shaquille
O'Neal, Lakers.
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
Teammates, fans not sure Pippen belongs with Rockets
</P>
<P>
   Consider Scottie Pippen's honeymoon over in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For years the lead ball-handler and devastating slasher in
Chicago's triangle offense, Pippen is now reduced to standing
around watching Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley plod in the low
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes
I'm playing \R40.6 per game, fourth in the NBA\S, I'm not involved
in the offense. It makes the game not any fun anymore. My next step
is to find why this organization wanted me. I want to sit down and
ask, `What's my position on this ballclub?' If it's just from the
defensive standpoint, if that's the point, then I can feel much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   After having Barkley rip him for taking his feelings public,
Pippen got a chance to sit down with coach Rudy Tomjanovich. Both
say the problems have been smoothed over, but teammates and fans
are beginning to wonder if Pippen is a good fit for the half-court
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a puppeteer,'' Tomjanovich said. ``The guy's got to
make that decision right there. That's what basketball is. It
becomes instinctive. My job is to put them in a situation where
they have freedom to be who they are. Then it's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
Around the East
</P>
<P>
   With John Calipari fired across the Hudson River, focus in New
York is now on Jeff Van Gundy's future with the Knicks. ``I guess
basketball season has started in New York,'' he said. Don't forget,
this is the guy who still has a framed copy of the infamous New
York Post back page on his office wall, the one where his mug is
staring at a noose. ``If they ever let Jeff go,'' said Patrick
Ewing, ``they might as well trade me. It would be a stupid move.''
... Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse has been struggling mightily on the
court because of off-court concerns. Stackhouse's mother is ill
with diabetes, a disease that already has taken his sister's life
earlier this season and also has stricken his father.
</P>
<P>
   Best and worst
</P>
<P>
   Best crossover move: Sixers coach Larry Brown might have saved
his job and Iverson's career by switching the blur to shooting
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Worst crossover move: Though we see palming violations every
night, rarely is it called. Just ask Sacramento's Jason Williams.
Inexplicably, referee Bernie Fryer called a crucial turnover on
Chicago's Mark Bryant with the Bulls trailing by two with 2:33
remaining in a loss to Orlando. Can you say double-standard?
Numbers Game
</P>
<P>
   5-0: Pacers' record against the Celtics with Larry Bird as
coach. ``He doesn't really talk about it, but you can see the look
on his face,'' said Reggie Miller of Bird facing his old team. ``We
know we always have to beat the Celtics.''
Around the West
</P>
<P>
   Go figure: Portland has six players averaging nine points or
more, no national television appearances and a 14 percent
ticket-price decrease at the Rose Garden. ... Minnesota has until
April 1 to decide whether or not to take New Jersey's pick from the
Marbury trade unconditionally. ... Taking Hack-a-Shaq to a new
level, the Timberwolves activated 7-foot-1 center Trevor Winter for
one game last week. After fouling O'Neal six times in 13 minutes,
Winter went back on the injured list the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Quote to note
</P>
<P>
   ``Steph wants better endorsement, more TV exposure. I wonder if
he's noticed the Nets are 4-19. If he wants to be on TV with them,
he better get cable.'' _ Timberwolves general manager Kevin McHale
on Stephon Marbury desiring a trade to a bigger media market such
as New Jersey.
Offbeat beat
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had been the butt of nightly jokes by Jay Leno on
the Tonight Show, one of which was a segment called ``Things you'll
never hear people say.'' There was a big picture of Chris Ford on
the screen, and Leno said this is what you won't hear the Clippers
coach say: ``We won.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, the Clippers broke their 17-game slide, and Leno
hosted Ford and several of the Clippers, who paraded down the aisle
under a confetti shower and a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it too much,'' said Clipper Sherman Douglas of
Leno's Clippers jokes. ``I didn't participate going on Leno. That's
not me, not with one win. I'm here to win games, not be laughed or
joked about.''
\Nsubheds:Inside the numbers

BOXING MUST MAKE CHANGES TO REGAIN RESPECT, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former boxing referee Mills Lane has worked more than 100 world
championship bouts, and seen his share of real deals and raw deals.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis decision a week
ago, he said, was a ``joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way the beleaguered sport can protect itself against
embarrassment, according to Lane and other boxing experts, is an
overhaul in the way fight judges are selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some changes have got to be made,'' Lane said. ``And they must
be made right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane stopped short of saying the fight last weekend at Madison
Square Garden _ declared a draw although most observers believed
Lewis was clearly dominant _ might have been rigged. But Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has convened a grand jury to
investigate the outcome, and whether the three judges were
improperly influenced.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest fiasco, politicians were involved in
boxing reform. The National Association of Attorneys General has
created a boxing task force, spearheaded by New York's Eliot
Spitzer. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), an avid fight fan, has
introduced the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act in conjunction with
Sen. Richard Bryan (D-Nev.).
</P>
<P>
   The Ali Act, introduced in June 1998 and brought back Jan. 26,
deals primarily with protecting boxers from exploitation at the
hands of promoters and sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the \RHolyfield-Lewis\S controversy is symptomatic of
serious underlying problems in professional boxing,'' said McCain,
who watched the fight from ringside.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a former Nevada district judge who hosts TV's Judge Mills
Lane Show and the referee who disqualified Mike Tyson for biting
Holyfield's ears, said officials for all bouts should be chosen by
state authorities. That would avoid conflict of interest or the
appearance of one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges for the Lewis-Holyfield fight were chosen by
sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Williams, the American who judged the fight 115-113 in
favor of Holyfield, was picked by the International Boxing
Federation. The IBF and World Boxing Association recognize
Holyfield as heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   English judge Larry O'Connell had it 115-115. Stanley
Christodoulou of South Africa was the lone judge who saw Lewis as
the winner, 116-113.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell represented the World Boxing Council, which lists
Lewis as the champ. Christodoulou was selected by the WBA.
</P>
<P>
   That the judges were chosen by the competing boxing groups that
declare champions ``shows how deeply entrenched conflicts of
interest are in boxing,'' McCain said. ``I do not question the
judges' motives, but I do question the system which led to their
selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the controversy, salaries and expenses of the
judges were paid by powerful fight promoter Don King, Lane said.
King counts Holyfield among his clients, and has considerable
influence with boxing's various alphabet groups. Lane said
promoters will always pay for judges, whether directly or
indirectly, because they handle financial aspects of a big fight,
such as pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that sanctioning groups should have no
involvement whatsoever in choosing officials,'' Lane said. ``Boxing
shouldn't have a system where officials can feel beholden to anyone
... not the sanctioning groups and especially not promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Spider Bynum, who has judged or refereed several
dozen title fights, said he agrees that changes should be made in
how judges are picked. He said the judging of the Holyfield-Lewis
fight was ``horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bynum, a legal adviser to the WBC and the North American
Boxing Federation, said the problem isn't the involvement of boxing
groups. Rather, he said, too many incompetent judges are chosen to
work big fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas and Nevada and California, the states are going to
insist on a local referee in 90 percent of the occasions, and at
least one local judge,'' Bynum said. ``But judges should be
selected on their competence and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many boxing officials, Bynum said, believe that in a
championship fight such as Holyfield-Lewis, no American or British
judge should be allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea of neutrality,'' he said, ``is that we should choose
officials who are going to referee or judge a fight correctly,
regardless of who's in the ring, what country they're from and what
color they are. I don't think there is enough money to buy a
competent referee or judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Bynum said he has known O'Connell for 20 years and considers him
a good and honest judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have a bad day at the office,'' he said. ``Most
good referees and judges know when they screw up, and Larry has
admitted it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bynum said, Williams has defended her
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good judges are out there,'' Bynum said. ``But they aren't
always being used.''

 &HT;    Jack Tarver, former Atlanta Journal-Constitution publisher and
AP chairman, dies at 82

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Tarver, who rose from a country editor to
publisher of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution and
chairman of the Associated Press, died Sunday afternoon. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Cause of death was not immediately available. H.M. Patterson &AMP;
Son Funeral Home in Sandy Springs, Ga., is handling arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver wielded great influence in the fortunes of the
Journal and Constitution and in Atlanta. He was a newspaperman
first and last, a columnist with a biting wit, a business
executive, civic leader, corporate board member and raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   He served the newspapers as general manager in 1952-56; vice
president in 1956-57; president in 1957-58; publisher from 1958 to
1976; and vice-chairman of the parent Cox Enterprises Inc. from
1976 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   His influence spread in journalism circles around the world as
chairman of the Associated Press, a non-profit cooperative news
service serving 1,400 newspaper members and 3,600 broadcasters,
from 1977 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta and the state, he served in many roles. He was a
member of the state board of education at the age of 26, for
example, and he was chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta in 1961-68.
</P>
<P>
   The late Ralph McGill hired Mr. Tarver, then a Macon News
editor, to be a humor columnist for The Atlanta Constitution in
1943. ``I am, by way of background, a Georgian by birth, a
Methodist through sprinkling, and a Roosevelt man out of
obstinacy,'' Mr. Tarver wrote in his first column.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver's years in the management of the newspapers brought
some controversy. He was too close with a dollar for the papers'
good, his critics said. His supporters said Mr. Tarver made the
papers so prosperous that they could afford to take some unpopular
stands.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest payoff came in the years when publisher Ralph McGill
was preaching racial moderation in his front-page column. That was
an enormously controversial task, but one that won Mr. McGill a
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McGill's columns also yielded venomous hate mail,
circulation boycotts and threats to withdraw advertising from the
papers. Mr. Tarver stood in the middle, acting as a calming
influence on Mr. McGill and as his protector when more
business-oriented executives worried that an unmuzzled Mr. McGill
would bring the papers to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   YOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Williams Tarver was born March 2, 1917, in Savannah, the
only son of Otis M. Tarver, a hotelkeeper, and Mrs. DeLuth Williams
Tarver. He entered the University of Georgia, intending to become a
veterinarian. However, he later told friends, the hard times forced
him to leave UGA and enroll at Mercer University in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   He went out for the Mercer football team, but a broken shoulder
ended that project. He became business manager of the football team
and sports editor of the student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with a degree in journalism in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started on a little old, teeny weeny weekly. He couldn't
have started on a lower level,'' recalled Jack Spalding, retired
editor of The Atlanta Journal.cq
</P>
<P>
   That weekly was the Vidalia Advance, where Mr. Tarver worked for
$15 a week. A year later, he was ready to launch his own newspaper.
He moved the six miles to Lyons, a town that was much smaller than
Vidalia but was the seat of Toombs County. Mr. Tarver established
the Toombs County Democrat in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   South Georgia was still recovering from the Depression, and Mr.
Tarver traded advertising for groceries, dry cleaning, even for
games of eight-ball at a pool hall. ``I also was one of the big
givers at the church,'' Mr. Tarver said later. ``I had a deal with
the preacher to print the weekly bulletin, and he would give me
credit for a contribution of $10 a week.''
</P>
<P>
   During his Lyons period, in 1940, Tarver married Margaret Birch
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   His first move toward the big city came as a result of a column
he wrote about ``Gone With The Wind,'' a movie that had put most
Southerners, and Southern editors, in a swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver's thoughts were iconoclastic. He described Rhett
Butler as a cross between Jesse James and Little Boy Blue and said
Scarlett was ``as changeable as a baby's underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   The column was reprinted in about 40 newspapers, and the new
owner of the Macon News spotted it in the Chicago Tribune ``I had
just gotten married and the paper was well in the black, and I was
going to be satisfied just to spend the rest of my life being a
country editor.''
</P>
<P>
   COLUMNIST
</P>
<P>
   But the owner of the Macon News and talked Mr. Tarver into a new
job.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by The Atlanta Constitution in 1943, with the dual
responsibilities of writing a humor column and handling a number of
administrative details.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Martin, a former associate of Mr. Tarver's, described him
at the time as a ``bespectacled, innocent-looking young man,''
whose style at the typewriter was ``verbal acupuncture.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, for example, Mr. Tarver reported that restrictions had
been placed on travel by Congressmen. ``And about time, too,'' he
wrote. ``We've had too many third-rate politicians traveling
first-class.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1950, a major career change was in the works. Post-war
expansion had made the Constitution a money-loser, and Mr. Tarver
was drafted to turn the situation around. Within months, he
converted losses of as much as $150,000 into modest profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution and Journal came under the same ownership in
1950, and Mr. Tarver was named assistant to the president of
Atlanta Newspapers Inc. In 1952, he was made general manager of the
corporation. He discontinued his column and made himself a
full-time manager.
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver joined the elite circle of powerful people who for
many years were credited with a leading role in running the city's
affairs. He did not seek publicity, but the signs of power were
there. In 1960, for example, when banker Mills B. Lane Jr. got up
the group that founded the Commerce Club, Mr. Tarver was one of the
14 original board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to make more fun of the power structure than anybody
else,'' former Journal editor Jack Spalding recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarver was as straight as hell,'' Spalding continued. ``He
would stand up and fight anybody who tried to influence the paper.
He'd say, `Hell, no!' He was absolutely incorruptible. That goes
back again to his personality. He was not impressed by anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved up to become president of the parent Cox Enterprises in
1969, and vice-chairman of Cox in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   WRITING AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver resumed writing his column in 1974, and it appeared
regularly until 1977, when he was named chairman of the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Though his political attitudes seemed to have been formed in the
``old boy'' days, Mr. Tarver was not unhinged when the power of the
old bloc began to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Spalding recalled: ``Tarver had a great sense of the
ridiculous. He could spot a fool or a phony five miles off, and he
loved to deflate anybody pompous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarver never took himself very seriously,'' Mr. Spalding
added.
</P>
<P>
   AFFILIATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta, Mr. Tarver was chairman and director of Theaters Service
Co., and a director of Southern Bell, American Motors and Maccabees
Mutual Insurance Co. until retiring from those three boards at age
70.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his chairmanship of Associated Press, he was a
member of the American Society of Newspaper Publishers, chairman of
its Bureau of Advertising in 1962-64 and president of the society
in 1976-77; member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors;
and member of Sigma Delta Chi.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the state Board of Education in 1942-43 and a
trustee of Mercer University. He belonged to the Capital City,
Piedmont Driving, Commerce and Stadium clubs. He was a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver was awarded the humanitarian of the year award of the
Institute for Human Relations in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Margaret Birch Tarver; a son, Jack
Tarver Jr. of Atlanta; a daughter, Margaret Tarver Jason of
Jacksonville, Fla.; and four grandchildren.

GRIDIRON CLUB SENDS UP AN APPRECIATIVE _ MOSTLY _ BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the long and harrowing struggle to defeat
impeachment, President Clinton finally joined in the general
laughter at his plight on Saturday night when he sat through a
satirical dinner and had the last word with the announcement of his
White House memoir: ``My Story, and I'm Sticking to It.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of guffaws and applause greeted the president as he
gingerly kidded himself in topping off a long night of political
ribbing by Washington's press establishment at The Gridiron Club's
annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past year I have learned valuable political lessons,
important personal lessons and more than I ever wanted to know
about the presidency of Andrew Johnson,'' Clinton observed after
being lambasted in song and sketch through all the embarrassing _
hilariously embarrassing _ details of the sex-and-mendacity scandal
that threatened his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, through it all, I still believe in a place
called ... Hell,'' the president from Hope, Ark., added with
perfect timing in doing a turn on his campaign theme as the
gathering of 600 guests cheered him.
</P>
<P>
   For a 114-year-old tradition that once eschewed off-color
material, The Gridiron plunged into the president's sex scandal
with abandon after a brief note of homage to the good old days
``when the Oval office was used to raise money and the Lincoln
bedroom was used for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, scrutinized by his audience at each punch line, was
stalwart at some barbs, convulsed in laughter at others. He was
serenaded with such song parodies as ``Sex Is a Definition Thing''
(``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'') and had to hear a character
posing as Vice President Al Gore wax jealous at how the scandal
only improved Clinton's poll ratings. To the tune of ``Embraceable
You,'' the ersatz Gore sang woodenly: ``Impeach me, so I can be
popular, too. Impeach me, I can be sleazy for you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the clowning rehash of his troubles, the president
noted the political field is nevertheless already crowded with
fresh presidential aspirants. He shook his head, smiled and told
the gathering, ``Now who in the world could have looked at the
presidency over the last year and thought, `Wow! That could be
me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians were skewered _ notably former Sen. Bob Dole,
the Kosovo peace negotiator and Viagra pitchman, who suffered
repeated Viagra jokes. ``Does Slobodan Milosevic know what Bob is
on?'' Sen. John McCain, the featured Republican speaker, anxiously
asked. A skit performer asked of Dole's wife, Elizabeth, the
presidential candidate, ``Is Mrs. Dole running for the White House
or away from Bob?''
</P>
<P>
   But the brunt of the evening was born by the president and the
other major impeachment figures in performances stippled with
Monica Lewinsky berets. In a parody of ``I Believe,'' presidential
loyalists sang loudly of their unyielding belief in him, not to
mention their faith in ``Santa Claus and unicorns and Tinkerbell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you? Laughing away?'' Sen. John Kerry, the featured
Democratic speaker, suddenly asked the president after needling him
with a draft-dodging joke. Turning back to the audience, Kerry
asked, ``Did you ever think we'd see the day where the president
would sit there and say, `Oh good, they're changing the subject to
Vietnam.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain, a prisoner of war for five years in the Vietnam War,
drew some of the strongest laughs when he stepped up with his
tuxedo lapels covered in burlesque military medals and gently
offered himself as presidential hopeful, ``incredibly self-effacing
guy'' and ``genuine war hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that sustained me through those hellish years
was the thought that some day I would come home and invent the
Internet,'' McCain continued straight-faced in one of the evening's
several tauntings of Gore's assertion that he created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's humor, too, was self-directed as he noted how he married
his wife, Teresa, the Heinz fortune heiress, after receiving a love
letter from her mailed in a big envelope he said was imprinted:
``You May Already Be a Winner!'' With a standup comic's polish, he
also zinged the Republicans' assortment of flat-tax and
``flat-earth'' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Forbes is just Ross Perot without 35 voices in his
head,'' Kerry said, and the pundit-ridden audience loved it. Then
he gravely interrupted himself to announce: ``Ladies and gentlemen,
on a purely social note, I want you to know that last night in
South Carolina, Strom Thurmond's next wife was born.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the star of the night was John Glenn, astronaut,
former senator, and rather courageous baritone. He was disguised in
the show's chorus while two singers posing codgerly as Sens. Strom
Thurmond and Jesse Helms, to the tune of ``There's a Place
Somewhere,'' pleaded: ``Save a place for us, a ride in space for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn suddenly stepped forward in his astronaut's suit and
finished the song, firmly serenading the two others: ``This may
sound just a little trite; you don't have stuff that's right.'' He
brought down the house with simple dedication and clean wordplay.
An encore was demanded in the evening's one clear sign that
impeachment jokes might be paling in favor of the sort of wholesome
anachronism that is The Gridiron Club's forte.
</P>
<P>
   The club's annual show is a whimsical, long-winded inner sanctum
affair put on by its 60 members braced by professionals who can
carry a tune. After enduring more than four hours of mixed
performances, Clinton arose to pronounce himself gratefully
``singed, but not burned.'' But also, he said, wearily mindful of
the country song, ``I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go
Bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's don't kid each other: this was an awful year,'' Clinton
finally conceded after joining in the laughter at his scandalous
travails. ``It was a year I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.'' But
then he paused and slowly grinned. ``I take that back.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ At the Maytag Corp. factory in nearby Newton,
four young people stand around a large Lazy Susan, as if it were a
coffee bar, assembling washing-machine doors.
</P>
<P>
   As the plastic door molds circle slowly by, each worker adds one
metal part, and every 37 seconds a finished door comes off the
revolving table.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazy-Susan system is a triumph of productivity. The same
four workers produce 90 more doors every hour than they used to,
roughly a 15 percent improvement. Until last fall, each had
assembled an entire door, one after another, in a much slower
process. ``I had to keep a full set of parts at every station,''
said Diana Brown, who now delivers them only to the central system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's pay, $18 an hour after 23 years at the plant, is
nearly double that of her younger colleagues, and at 48 she sees
herself as their ``mother hen.'' Seniority indeed sets her apart.
</P>
<P>
   New hires now must start below union scale, marching to full pay
through semiannual raises that show up in the nation's pay
statistics, but without squeezing Maytag's profit. As veterans like
Ms. Brown retire, the new hires represent a larger share of the
plant's 2,800 workers. The shift in the work force holds down the
average wage, and Maytag's total labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are flattening our labor costs,'' said Leonard A. Hadley,
chairman of Maytag. ``It is problematic whether we can flatten
labor costs over the long term. But short term, we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maytag's experiences, like those of many corporations, help to
explain the central puzzle of today's economy. Eight years into the
current expansion, labor shortages and rising wages should be
raising the annual inflation rate or shrinking profits. Yet neither
is happening.
</P>
<P>
   The annual inflation rate is only 1.6 percent, in sharp contrast
to the last growth cycle, in the 1980s, when the rise in the
Consumer Price Index reached 4.6 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are profits suffering noticeably, despite somewhat slower
gains recently. By past standards, profits should be hurting,
caught as they are between rising pay and stagnant prices. But many
corporations have come up with numerous ways to dodge the bullet
and confound the widely held view that inflation is an inevitable
result of sustained prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   How companies are managing this balancing act is abundantly
evident here in central Iowa, not only at Maytag, which is based in
Newton, but at two giant companies in Des Moines: the Principal
Financial Group, which manages retirement plans for 43,000
companies, among other businesses, and Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc., a
Midwestern supermarket chain with 179 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics of these profitable companies _ a manufacturer, a
financial services firm and a retailer _ are essentially the
tactics of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity improvements play a growing role at all three
companies in squeezing out more revenue for each hour of pay, and
thus more profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazy Susan is just one of many examples that executives at
the three companies pointed to during tours of their operations;
changes that have raised the annual rate of improvement in the
nation's productivity _ the output of goods and services per worker
_ to 2 percent since 1995 from 1 percent in the early '90s. Other
circumstances have also helped. Low interest rates, for example,
saved Hy-Vee $1 million last year in debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the matter, however, lies in two gradual changes in
behavior that have allowed corporations to forgo price increases in
the face of intense global competition, yet raise wages and still
make healthy profits. Normally by now, the Federal Reserve, fearing
higher inflation, would have pushed up interest rates to slow the
economy. It has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   One key change is the increased corporate flexibility in
manipulating labor costs. Maytag's below-scale starting wage is an
example.
</P>
<P>
   Principal and Hy-Vee engage in another popular practice:
``accordion'' scheduling, the use of temporary workers and
part-timers whose wages are up but whose hours are adjusted day to
day _ and even in the middle of a shift _ so that an operation is
never overstaffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Manpower at 5 p.m. and have people in the next morning
for any number of tasks,'' said Max F. Johnson, vice president for
human resources at Principal, which since 1996 has nearly doubled
the use of temporary help, such as telephone workers, computer
operators, clerks and the like. ``We are matching work to demand
much more closely and less expensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Shifting work to lower-cost cities, a practice that has been
popular for decades among manufacturers, is now common among
service companies, too. Principal, for instance, shifts work,
through computer transmissions, to offices in smaller cities like
Waterloo and Ottumwa, Iowa, where wages are 5 percent to 10 percent
lower than in Des Moines. Today, 36 percent of Principal's 4,000
employees in the pension division work outside Des Moines, up from
26 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers themselves are much less likely to resist such
shifts,'' said Alan Krueger, a Princeton labor economist. ``They no
longer insist on maintaining wage scales across a company's various
operations, or even see the need to do so. And when that breaks
down, so does the pressure on prices that once came from
across-the-board raises.''
</P>
<P>
   The other key means of relieving pressure on prices is through
the introduction of fancier products and services. Because the
government lists these as new items rather than higher-priced
variations of existing ones, they are not counted as price
increases in the Consumer Price Index. If they were, the annual
inflation rate, now 1.6 percent, would be over 3 percent, a study
by government economists found.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The washing-machine doors at the Maytag plant are for use in one
of these new, upscale products _ the Neptune, a front-loading,
spin-action clothes washer that Maytag says removes stains better
than other machines. The Neptune's price tag of $1,099 is $450
above Maytag's most expensive existing washer, and a big chunk of
the price difference covers extra profit, not added cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a conscious effort to tilt the sales mix toward
our premium brands,'' Hadley said. ``They were 70 percent of our
major appliance sales in 1998, up from 50 percent a decade ago. The
goal is to keep driving up prices and profit margins with new
features.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Thompson, in a white chef's coat, is a soldier in this
universal campaign. To find her in Hy-Vee's vast, softly lighted
supermarket in West Des Moines, circle the outer perimeter where
all the high-margin items are on display.
</P>
<P>
   Go past the flower shop, the pharmacy, the cosmetics, the
greeting card rack (grown to 140 feet in length from 12 in most
stores a decade ago), the T-shirts, the Parisian and Italian white
breads, the tortilla wrapped sandwiches, the special cuts of meat,
the New York delicatessen salads (low cholesterol displayed in
heart-shaped platters), the chilled and packaged dinners (a
favorite is meatloaf with three side dishes), the salad bar, the
Chinese food counter, the Italian takeout.
</P>
<P>
   There, at the Italian Express station, Ms. Thompson, 37, who
trained for a decade at Pizza Hut, presides over three full-timers
and five part-timers _ roughly the ratio for all of Hy-Vee's 42,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Her part-timers, teen-agers mostly, work accordion schedules,
adjusting their hours to store traffic ``to keep sales revenue per
worker pretty steady,'' Ms. Thompson said, echoing the corporate
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   She and a friend who followed her from Pizza Hut handle the
lunch traffic, their three biggest sellers being pepperoni, cheese
and Italian sausage pizzas at $7.99 each. The lunch business has
risen to $700 a day from $500 a few months ago, but Ms. Thompson
has not added staff. She and her friend work a little harder, she
said, to get the orders out _ an extra effort that more than covers
Ms. Thompson's recent 4 percent raise to well above $400 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner-hour sales are mostly packaged meals taken home and
heated _ meat lasagna for four ($12.99), pizzas ($2.25 to $10.99)
and pastas ($4 to $6). ``We try not to run up the cost by making
labor-intensive foods,'' she said, ruling out, for example, pasta
shells stuffed with several types of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are straightforward. All the high-end items around
the store's perimeter yield a margin of 30 to 70 cents above the
cost of ingredients for each dollar of sales versus 20 to 30 cents
for standard supermarket fare, the company says. Apply an overhead
charge calculated at 24 cents per dollar of sales at the West Des
Moines store and upscale merchandise becomes essential to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hy-Vee's payroll, which was pushed up in part by a 21
percent increase in the minimum wage in 1997, rose at a faster rate
than sales. But operating profits rose anyway. The reason was
high-end merchandise. ``Many of our stores are getting 25 percent
of their revenues from these specialty items, and that is more than
double what it was 10 years ago,'' said Ronald D. Pearson, chairman
of Hy-Vee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are doing well and trading up,'' he said. ``They are
buying ground beef with 90 percent lean meat at $2.50 a pound and
not the 70 percent ground beef at $1 a pound that was popular five
years ago. We hardly stock the 70 percent beef anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But that raises some uncertainties. A sinking economy would
reverse that trend, Pearson acknowledged, making those high-margin
items a lot harder to sell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outlook, corporate America is not letting up in its
ingenious strategies for holding down labor costs. Just watch John
E. Beal in action at Principal Financial Group on a recent
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A Blue Cross employee _ Principal manages Blue Cross' 401(k)
plan _ has called to apply for a $5,000 loan against his savings,
and Beal, taking the call, suggests that the caller would get his
loan more quickly if he used the push buttons on his phone rather
than a live operator.
</P>
<P>
   Tactfully, Beal walks the caller through Principal's
``Teletouch'' system, watching the progress on his computer screen.
Midway through, the caller makes a mistake and Beal helps him undo
the damage. ``He had pressed the button for a biweekly repayment
plan and he wanted bimonthly,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all the right buttons are pressed and the loan
application flows into Principal's computers, which automatically
print out the necessary papers for mailing. Otherwise Beal would
have had to handle the paperwork, at more cost.
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult requests that come into Principal's call
center in Des Moines are routed to people like Beal, whose college
diploma hangs on a cloth partition wall near his computer. He earns
$30,000 _ up 3.5 percent from his starting salary 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   New computer programs are gradually reducing the need for
skilled operators like him. But for now, he pays for his own
raises, in effect, by helping to herd toward automation the 2.9
million people in retirement plans managed by Principal.
</P>
<P>
   The economics, as Principal lays them out, are clear. Human
intervention, by Beal or any operator, costs $5.90 a call.
Transactions that clients complete on their own by touch-tone phone
are 45 cents, while those performed on the Internet come to 14
cents a hit. That is the big push now, switching the clientele to
the Internet, which keeps a lid on the number of employees. ``I had
projected 250 people in our call centers by now,'' said Michael J.
Daugherty, assistant director of pension administration.
``Teletouch and the Internet have held the number to 175.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 other employees, however, process paperwork that
arrives by mail, including lists of monthly 401(k) contributions
that Principal's corporate clients have collected from their
workers. The lists are scanned into Principal's computers and
adjusted at various computer stations. To bypass this
labor-intensive process, Principal has shifted 30,000 companies to
Internet filing since mid-1997 and has notified some companies of a
surcharge until they make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to service the small company,'' said Daniel J.
Houston, a Principal vice president, ``but we need them to deliver
electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   How many more labor-saving efficiencies are still out there? Ask
that of David McConnaughey, a Maytag vice president, and the answer
comes back, intensely, ``We have just begun.'' The executives at
Hy-Vee and Principal are also believers. But sales are more
problematic. And profits depend on them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity enters here. If the economy slows, demand will fall
for fancier, more profitable Maytag washing machines or Hy-Vee's
high-end merchandise. Principal is similarly at risk; it charges
clients a percentage of the pension money in their plans. That
percentage has remained below 2 percent since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But if pricing is unchanged, revenue and profit are not. Both
have risen as the total pension money managed by Principal has
grown _ through the monthly contributions and the rising stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Principal had 42 percent of the pension money invested in
stocks late last year, up from 20 percent in 1994. A falling market
would be a blow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the era of Dow 10,000, stocks are not falling. Prosperity
still reigns, and companies across America keep their balance _ at
least for now _ between rising wages and steady prices.

DESPITE LAW, FEW NEW APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE EQUIPPED FOR
HANDICAPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Nev., Fla., Ohio, Md., Ariz., Mont.)  (lh) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after a federal law went into effect
requiring new multi-family dwellings to be accessible to people
with disabilities, the measure has been widely ignored, the Justice
Department and advocates for the disabled say.
</P>
<P>
   There are no nationwide figures on how many of the more than 2
million apartments and condominiums that have been constructed
since the law went into effect in 1991 comply with the regulations,
which among other things require that first-floor units and common
areas be accessible to people who use wheelchairs or walkers. But
surveys conducted by advocates for the disabled around the country
indicate that only a tiny percentage of the multi-family buildings
in their communities are in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Chicago, for example, advocates for the disabled
found that out of 50 newly constructed multi-family developments,
49 had not followed federal law. In Baltimore a similar survey
found that 75 percent of 59 new apartment and condominium complexes
were not in compliance. Arizona advocates found that 75 percent of
the new multi-family buildings in Tucson and 50 percent in Phoenix
had not followed the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and disability rights advocates in
Chicago, Baltimore, Cleveland, Miami, Las Vegas, and Cocoa Beach,
Fla., have begun suing architects and developers to force them to
conform to the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are popping out all over the place,'' said Chris
Brancart, a lawyer from Pescadero, Calif., who has sued a developer
of condominium projects in Billings and Missoula, Mont., over the
buildings' lack of accessibility. ``People are no longer willing to
say it's a new law, let's give people an opportunity to comply.
There is a feeling that this law has been on the books for a long
time, and it's time to start pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in lawsuits against builders and architects generally
do not seek the complete reconstruction of apartment and
condominium complexes. Rather they ask the courts to order
developers and architects who have violated the law to rebuild the
common areas to make them accessible and to set up an escrow fund
so that individual owners and tenants can make the necessary
improvements if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have settled in virtually every lawsuit since
they cannot dispute the fact that they have designed or built a
building that violates the law. ``You can measure something and see
if it's in compliance, as opposed to a typical race discrimination
case, which is a `he said, she said situation,' '' said Lauren E.
Willis a lawyer in Baltimore who has sued the developers of six
projects in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the home building industry agree that many
architects and developers have not complied with federal
regulations. But they assert that the reason is lack of familiarity
with the law's provisions, rather than deliberate attempts to evade
their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for builders and architects not to comply
with these requirements,'' said Rhonda Daniels, a lawyer with the
National Association of Home Builders. ``They were not properly
educated on what the requirements are. Our association attempted to
educate our members. But everybody is not a member of our
association, or if they are, they may not have been paying
attention at the time when the law was passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, a federal judge in Baltimore ruled that architects
and builders of a condominium development in Anne Arundel County,
Md., had violated the law by making the residence inaccessible to
people in wheelchairs or who require walkers. It was the first
ruling in favor of disabled plaintiffs alleging violation of the
1988 law, though the Justice Department and advocates for the
disabled have reached settlements in a number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter E. Black, Jr., ruled that the
architect and developer had failed to provide enough handicapped
parking spaces, that walkways from the parking lot to the housing
units contained needless steps, that people had to climb one step
to enter ground floor units and descend one step to exit onto
balconies, that interior doorways were too narrow for wheelchairs
and that there was insufficient clearance in bathrooms and kitchens
for people in wheelchairs to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by Kevin Beverly, 39, who uses a wheelchair
and who had gone to the condominium development to possibly
purchase a unit. But he found he could not even get into the sales
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a person who is disabled, to see new construction going
up and to see that folks are still ignoring a law that says an
individual like me has right to live here, it makes you feel bad,''
said Beverly. ``My wife and I were out looking for a place to raise
our children. To run into a place like this, which is brand new,
which is optimum in all other ways, is disheartening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Black has scheduled a trial to determine the extent of damages
the architects and builders of the development, known as Lions
Gates Garden Condominiums, must pay.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly widespread violation of the federal regulations
and the resulting spate of litigation is an example of how a
ground-breaking law that is passed with much fanfare is often
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by disability rights advocates and the Bush
administration, Congress amended federal fair housing laws in 1988,
requiring for the first time that multi-family buildings with at
least four units be accessible to people with physical
disabilities. The measure required all first floor apartments and
condominiums built after March 13, 1991, in buildings without
elevators and all units in structures with elevators be made
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives people with disabilities the right to sue
architects and builders if their building violates the law. People
who are able bodied when they rent an apartment or purchase a
condominium and later become disabled _ or have disabled relatives
or friends who cannot visit or live with them _ can also sue.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress did not require that municipal agencies that issue
building permits enforce the law. As a result, many architects and
developers were not told of the federal requirements by the only
governmental agencies _ municipal planning departments _ that
approve their blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big defect in the law when it was passed, and
nobody realized it at the time,'' said Ms. Daniels. ``When they get
their permits they think they're in compliance with all rules and
regulations. But these federal requirements stand outside of the
normal local building requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Some disability-rights and fair-housing advocates are not
completely sympathetic to this argument, however. Advocates in
Baltimore, for example, noted that a local fair-housing
organization called Baltimore Neighborhoods, Inc. has been offering
seminars to architects and developers to acquaint them with the
law. Until the lawsuits started being filed, few showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're skeptical about the claim that people didn't know about
it,'' said Joan Magagna, chief of the Housing and Civil Enforcement
Section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ``There
has been a lot of information out there about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thea Spires, the special assistant for disability policy to
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, said in a statement that the
department has over 150 ongoing investigations into violations of
laws requiring accessibility. The department has set aside $1
million for a nationwide study of accessiblity compliance and
provided $2 million to disability groups to assist in enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Some reluctance to comply with the law may have to do with
costs. Though complying with the federal regulations adds only
about one-quarter of 1 percent to the cost of building an apartment
or condominium unit, requiring ramps, handrails and other features
adds 6.4 percent to the costs of exterior site improvements,
according to a study by Steven Winter, a Norwalk, Conn., architect
who is an expert in designing accessible buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Winter and others say it is much cheaper to conform to
the regulations when the building is being constructed then to have
to go back and make the improvements later. ``To tear down walls
and rebuild them and rip apart bathrooms and redo them, there is no
question that that is more expensive,'' Winter said.

INCIDENT AT CABINET MEETING HINTS AT GERMAN TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At Germany's most recent Cabinet meeting, Juergen
Trittin, the environment minister, pointedly took out a newspaper
and began reading while important government business was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extraordinarily rude, apart from anything else,'' said
one astounded minister who was present and who watched as Joschka
Fischer, the foreign minister, called Trittin to order by whistling
at him across the table.
</P>
<P>
   The incident says much about the tensions and unpredictable
turbulence that persist in the government of Europe's most powerful
country 10 days after the abrupt resignation of Oskar Lafontaine as
finance minister. Far from bringing calm, Lafontaine's departure
has only shown further divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A center is missing, and in its place there is a bazaar,'' the
respected weekly Die Zeit commented. ``Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's political style brings to mind those Spanish soap
operas in which the viewing public has the chance to write scripts
that will decide the fate of the show's characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Germany's 6-month-old governing coalition of Social
Democrats and environmentalist Greens remains unclear. But it is
already clear that the heady euphoria and bold ambitions that
marked the birth of the country's first Red-Green government have
vanished in a pall of confusion. Long stunningly predictable,
Germany today gives a frequent impression of being rudderless.
</P>
<P>
   Trittin, who is a Green, is angry because his plan to shut down
nuclear power stations that provide about a third of Germany's
energy needs has stalled as business leaders have pressed Schroeder
to reconsider or to postpone any action.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Trittin clearly shares Lafontaine's deep
frustration that the room for governing in some distinct and
reformist way in a closely united Europe is now extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red-Green'' was supposed to stand for all sorts of new things:
an end to nuclear power, a different approach to economic policy
involving possible wage increases to stimulate demand and
elimination of NATO's first-strike nuclear option. But reality has
proved harsh for such bold ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   That reality is of a Germany where the business lobby is
extremely strong, where laws and regulations tend to inhibit
reform, where fear of experiments persists and where a European
central bank in Frankfurt sets a monetary policy for the continent
that Lafontaine tried haplessly to change.
</P>
<P>
   Trittin has grown impatient with the slowness of Germany's
consensus politics. And apparently convinced that the chancellor is
a friend of business with no interest in any left-leaning or
environmentalist reform, Trittin loses few opportunities to show
his contempt for the government of which he is a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red-Green as a reform project is dead,'' Trittin told Stern
magazine last week, adding that he saw the Social Democrats as
virtually indistinguishable now from the Christian Democrats of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He added that the Greens might even
consider future political alliances with the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   These extraordinary comments, later played down by Schroeder,
were made before Trittin pulled out his newspaper in the Cabinet
meeting. The chancellor, who has been touring European capitals,
was not present at the meeting, which was chaired by Fischer as
vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The approach to government taken by these two men illustrates
the tensions within the Green Party, of which they are both
members. While Fischer has proved generally pragmatic, Trittin has
brought to governing the fervor and idealism that were strengths of
the party in opposition. But those qualities are hard to square
with the day-to-day grind of getting anything done in Germany.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Trittin raised his newspaper, Fischer was in the midst of a
presentation of foreign policy, said the minister who observed the
scene and spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Fischer whistled
sharply, and Trittin put his paper down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is now widespread that Trittin may follow
Lafontaine's example and resign. But the Greens, having never
before tasted power, are becoming attached to it, and Trittin may
swallow his misgivings and hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is clearly anxious to avoid further disruption. The
press here has been busy calling him ``the lifestyle chancellor'' _
a reference to his frequent appearances at fashionable parties and
on talk shows _ and referring to ``the unbearable lightness of
Schroeder.'' He badly needs a solid political success to bolster
his image.
</P>
<P>
   This week, at a European Union summit meeting in Berlin, he will
try to secure that boost through an agreement on reform of European
Union finances that would slowly cut Germany's huge contribution to
the European budget.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an important achievement, but it seems unlikely to
impress Trittin or to put an end to the dissent in a coalition that
still seems to find the discipline and strictures of government an
uncomfortable burden.

THOUSANDS IN KOSOVO FLEE SERB DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-U.S., KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC, and KOSOVO-ASSESS)

 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PREKAZ, Yugoslavia _ This village, birthplace a year ago of the
armed Albanian revolt against Serbia's rule of Kosovo, was empty
and burning Sunday, a symbol of the Serbs' sudden punch into the
guerrilla heartland, an assault born in vengeance and intended to
spread fear.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Prekaz that Adem Jashari, the first martyr of the
rebel cause, was killed along with dozens of members of his clan
last March. That daylong battle marked the beginning of Kosovo's
undeclared war. Earlier this month, the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
rebels' increasingly well-organized force, paraded hundreds of
troops before commanders and thousands of spectators to commemorate
Jashari's death, and the start of the armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, it was the Serbs who controlled Prekaz. As flames
and dense smoke engulfed the village, dark blue armored police
vehicles pulled away from the deserted, ruined settlement. Nearby,
more smoke rose from houses burning in the town of Srbica, which
was taken over by Serbian security forces on Saturday as they took
advantage of the departure of 1,300 unarmed foreign monitors and
pushed into the guerrilla heartland known as Drenica.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, refugees were still fleeing the region, pouring out
along roads and tracks southward, on foot and on tractors, as
shellfire reverberated behind them.
</P>
<P>
   On the move for hours, many were terrified and unsure where to
go. Nexhmije Haxha, 35, said she had spent 20 hours lying face down
in an open field, her seven young children about her, trapped by
fighting on either side.
</P>
<P>
   She fled her home in Prekaz at 6 a.m. on Saturday, she said,
after a shell landed near the village school. With her elderly
mother-in-law and her seven children, the youngest 8 months old,
the eldest 13, she headed down the hill toward the nearby village
of Gornja Klina. Her husband stayed behind, with fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Haxha described hours spent in terror of the fighting. ``We
were lying in a dip in the land, face down, flat on our stomachs,''
she said. ``The children were screaming and crying, especially
these two daughters.'' She started to cry herself as she cuffed two
freckle-faced children on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The other children clung to her, silent and staring, their brows
creased and eyes anxious. ``It was cold, and we had no blankets,''
she said. ``But I had some bread and cheese and fed that to the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after midnight, she said, did the shooting cease. Mrs.
Haxha and her children dared to make the climb down to a relative's
house in Gornja Klina. They arrived at 2 a.m., she said. Hours
later, the Serbian police told her to leave Gornja Klina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police said we should move all the women and children out,
because they always get blamed for harming women and children,''
she said. They managed to board a bus for the nearby town of
Mitrovica. On the way, they passed their village, in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all burning,'' she said. ``We probably have no home
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the third time we have fled the village,'' Mrs. Haxha
added, alluding to the last year of fighting. ``I think this third
time they will just level the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, Serbian tanks and heavy concentrations of troops
and artillery surrounded Drenica. Tanks looked down from the hills,
and a police squad aimed its guns from a sandbagged position on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting was continuing not far away in the village of Poljance.
Although the front line did not seem to have shifted much in the
last two days, floods of new refugees flowed down from villages
further west, as shellfire came closer.
</P>
<P>
   There was some indication Sunday night that the Serbian assault
had stung the Albanians into new tactics. In the deadliest incident
in recent memory in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, four Serbian
policemen died in a hail of automatic weapons fire from a passing
car, the Serbs' Media Center said. The Reuters news agency also
quoted witnesses as reporting the ambush of another police patrol
near the southern town of Suva Reka. In the town of Glogovac, one
bridge was blown up near its northern end, and another was damaged
by explosives, Reuters reported. It was not clear whether the
rebels were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees estimates
that 40,000 people have fled their homes in the last week alone and
some 20,000 in the last two days, according to Fernando del Mundo,
the agency's spokesman in Kosovo. They are virtually all from the
Drenica region, fleeing as the Serbian military operation has grown
in breadth and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mundo said he counted 1,000 refugees traveling in 20 trucks
and trailers on one muddy back road. They had fled eight different
villages in western Drenica. Hundreds more were still trying to
flee the town of Srbica as their houses were set alight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a replay of last summer,'' del Mundo said, recalling the
huge offensive of July and August, which eventually forced more
than 100,000 people to flee their homes across Kosovo and take
shelter in the woods and mountains. Snow prevented people from
doing that this time, so they are moving from village to village or
seeking safety in the towns.
</P>
<P>
   But del Mundo said he was now also anxious about the people in
the towns. The Serbian move into Srbica on Saturday set off a flood
of 14,000 refugees in two days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that the next fighting will be in the
cities,'' he said. ``I do not know what will happen, but if this is
a foretaste, it is going to be terrible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Glogovac, another town father south, had swelled with 4,000 more
refugees in recent days and was in a precarious position, close to
the front line, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed policemen blocked access to Srbica on Sunday, part
of an order issued throughout the province to prevent journalists
from reaching the Drenica region. Townspeople who had managed to
leave Srbica said the police were going from house to house,
arresting the men and telling the women and children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Miftar Kerolli, 57, a house painter, was gathering his family
together to flee when the police arrived and arrested him, his
24-year-old son and dozens of other ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   He said they were interrogated, driven to a nearby town, and
then released.
</P>
<P>
   They received only mild abuse at police hands, he said. People
seem to be emerging from the area physically unharmed but severely
traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   The police were in a swaggering, aggressive mood Sunday, and did
not temper their language.``I pray to God that NATO will bomb,''
said one policemen, adding a crudely expressed desire to do more
harm to the Albanians.

BALLOONISTS RECORD-SETTING FLIGHT WAS AIDED BY FOAM THAT CONSERVED
FUEL

   GENEVA _ After Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones safely
landed their Breitling Orbiter 3 Sunday in a remote desert site in
Western Egypt, the balloon's mission headquarters at Geneva Airport
calculated that the two men had covered a record-smashing 29,054.6
miles since they took off from Chateau d'Oex in the Swiss Alps
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   They passed their round-the-world finishing point on Saturday,
when they flew over a point at 9 degrees 27 minutes west longitude
in Mauritania. But they decided to continue through the night,
flying over Libya into Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Their landing site was west of Luxor, near a camel track (at 9
degrees 32 minutes north latitude, 21 degrees 72 minutes east
longitude).
</P>
<P>
   The balloon bounced twice before settling to the ground at about
6 a.m. GMT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard and Jones face a hero's welcome when they fly to Geneva
from Cairo Monday.The balloon was sponsored by a Swiss watch-making
company, Breitling, and its captain, Piccard, is Swiss. The
co-pilot, Jones, is British and the balloon was built in England.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Sunday, Don Cameron, whose company in
Bristol, England, Cameron Balloons Ltd., built the Breitling
Orbiter 3, disclosed some of the technical innovations that helped
bring the balloon to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Balloons has built many long-distance balloons,
including those flown by various competitors in recent
round-the-world attempts.
</P>
<P>
   All these balloons were Roziers _ hybrid balloons lifted by
separate compartments containing helium and hot air, which is
generated by propane burners. (Such balloons are named for their
inventor, Jean Pilatre de Rozier, whose hydrogen-and-hot-air
balloon exploded in 1785, making him the first person in history to
die in an air accident.)
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling Orbiter 3 stood 180 feet high _ about the height
of the Leaning Tower of Pisa _ and was filled with a volume of gas
and hot air equivalent to that of the water in seven Olympic-size
swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the most important improvement we built into
the Breitling Orbiter 3,'' Cameron said, ``was a layer of foam
insulation we installed around the helium-filled central section
just a few millimeters thick. The foam filled the space between the
gas-tight inner cell and the outer, aluminized plastic cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helped to keep the helium from heating up, expanding, and
leaking out during the day, and also kept the helium from cooling
and contracting too much at night, forcing the pilots to heat air
with their burners to maintain altitude. The net effect was to save
propane fuel and extend the balloon's duration and range.''
</P>
<P>
   How effective was the new foam insulation?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Breitling Orbiter 2, which lacked the foam layer, ran out
of fuel after only 10 days and had to land far short of going
around the world,'' Cameron said. ``The Breitling Orbiter 3 stayed
up for 20 days and still had propane to spare. Judge for
yourself.''

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ After a final night soaring across North Africa,
the first balloonists to circle the globe touched down early Sunday
morning in the soft sands of southern Egypt _ and then spent hours
waiting for a ride home.
</P>
<P>
   The landing, some 300 miles southwest of Cairo, brought a bumpy
end to a record-setting journey that had lasted nearly three weeks.
The balloonists, aboard the huge Breitling Orbiter 3, had hoped to
land to near the Pyramids of Giza, but unfavorable winds kept them
from that storybook ending.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they scuttled to a stop in the sands of the Sahara,
after two aborted attempts, and then had to gouge holes in their
still-inflated balloon to keep it from dragging them further across
the desolate desert.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Brian Jones, a
Briton, landed just after 8 a.m. local time. Then, after 19 days,
21 hours and 55 minutes aloft, they spent seven hours on a lonely
desert plateau before an Egyptian army helicopter arrived to pick
them up.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the oasis town of Dakhla, Jones said
the flight ``was the most amazing experience.'' Both men appeared
elated by their achievement, yet drained by the effort and the
endurance it took to claim the elusive prize of having circled the
world in a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me now whether I'd do it again, I'd say no,'' Jones
said. ``But ask me later.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they became firm friends during the trip, squeezed
into a capsule that measured just 16{ by 10 feet. ``In several
stages, we were able to support each other,'' Piccard, a
psychiatrist, said at a news conference in Cairo Sunday night.
``When one of us was about to give up, the other would support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the worst thing was enduring the cold. ``All of our
water froze at night, so we waited till day to fill the kettles,''
he said. ``It was very, very cold up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard added, speaking of the trials and tribulations of the
flight: ``It was not a matter of setting records; it was a fabulous
metaphor of life. To try is the only way to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair completed their circumnavigation on Saturday, crossing
an invisible line in the air far above Mauritania. After a trip
that took them across North Africa, South Asia, the Pacific Ocean,
Central America and the Atlantic, they decided to push on, in
search of a soft landing and the romance of the 5,000-year-old
Pyramids _ one of the world's most enduring symbols of human
perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said that the hours they spent in the desert had
given them time to reflect on their experience and to appreciate
the extraordinary diversity of the bleak habitat that surrounded
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not heroes,'' Jones said in Cairo. ``We just proved
that dreams could come true.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why it had taken so long for Egyptian
helicopters to recover the two intrepid balloonists, whose plans to
speak at a news conference in Cairo were postponed for hours
because of the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Their landing, timed to take advantage of a postdawn lull in
desert winds, was observed by mission controllers aboard a
chartered plane, and their exact location was pinpointed by the
global positioning satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   In Dakhla, where they answered journalists' questions, the pair
appeared drawn and thin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the state of their balloon, Jones _ who, like
Piccard, wore a blue flight suit and was sipping soda from a wine
glass _ said: ``It's completely deflated, like me, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the record-setting team described the landing as
having been ``a 10'' on a scale of 1 to 10, and they said that
weather conditions had been perfect. The team's fuel supplies were
near empty when they landed, team members said, and there was no
question of the pair continuing on for another night.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, a 51-year-old former member of the British air force,
described a scene that sounded somewhat more chaotic, with strong
winds tipping the balloon over after the landing. ``We had to run
around the balloon with our knives to make holes to keep from being
dragged across the desert,'' Jones told reporters in Dakhla.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government spokesman, Nabil Osman, said that the
weather-driven changes in plans for the balloon's landing had
slowed the military's plans for swift recovery of the crew. ``There
was no delay,'' Osman said. ``It was a combination of how to react
and how to get the helicopters to that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge silver balloon, 180 feet tall, landed atop a remote,
plateau about 45 miles north of the desert town of Mut.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Egyptian security and tourism officials had advised
people across Egypt that they had nothing to fear from the craft
that would descend from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting mission had received little attention here
through most of the long journey. But the prospect of a landing
near the Pyramids _ which would had made for extraordinary
publicity _ galvanized the government into action.

SURVEY SUGGESTS CONSUMERS ARE TAKING TO E-COMMERCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New evidence that the rise of electronic commerce is a wave, not
a bubble, comes from Odyssey, a market research firm. In survey
results to be released Monday, Odyssey found that half of the
American households that are online are making purchases over the
Internet, and that the total number of online purchases in the last
six months jumped fourfold from the comparable period a year
earlier, to 56 million.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in online shopping during the year-end holidays has
been much reported, discussed and analyzed. But most of the
research on the phenomenon has come from retailers' estimates of
sales, while the Odyssey survey is from the consumer perspective.
Every six months, the San Francisco-based researcher interviews
2,500 randomly selected households by telephone, asking them about
their use of personal computers and electronics gear.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Odyssey study, conducted in January, points to a
clear trend: more people are making purchases on line, more often,
and they are using advertisements they see on the World Wide Web to
make decisions about what to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of online shopping has been fueled by the falling
price of personal computers. Today, half of American households
have personal computers, up from 42 percent a year ago, according
to Odyssey. The percentage of all households on line has increased
to 33 percent from 23 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But online shopping is growing even faster than the increase in
computer use and Internet access. Of households with Internet
access, 47 percent made at least one purchase on line in the latest
six months, up from 30 percent a year ago, Odyssey reports. Of the
households buying on line, the average number of purchases is 3.7
over the last six months, compared with 1.7 purchases in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal of electronic commerce, even in its current nascent
state, keeps consumers coming back,'' said Nicholas Donatiello,
president of Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say how much of the rise in online shopping
is a result of tireless promotion of electronic commerce by America
Online; but that is a big factor. Some 40 percent of all households
with access to cyberspace get there through America Online _ 10
times the share of its nearest rivals, Microsoft's MSN and AT&AMP;T's
Worldnet, Odyssey reports.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to garner a larger proportion of its revenue from
advertising and transactions, America Online has encouraged its
subscribers to try online shopping. ``What America Online does is
what happens in this market, because it is so dominant,''
Donatiello said. &QL;

   ECON-SUSTAIN (Des Moines) _ Improvements in workers'
productivity help to explain the central puzzle of today's economy.
Eight years into the current expansion, labor shortages and rising
wages should be raising the annual inflation rate, now only 1.7
percent. That happened in the 1980s, during the last growth cycle,
when the Consumer Price Index reached 4.6 percent. Nor are profits
suffering noticeably, despite somewhat slower gains recently. By
past standards, profits should be hurting, caught as they are
between rising pay and stagnant prices. But many corporations have
come up with numerous ways to dodge the bullet, and confound the
view, so widely shared, that inflation is an inevitable result of
sustained prosperity. By Louis Uchitelle.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis):
</P>
<P>
   March 22, 1994: The Lakers replace Randy Pfund with Magic
Johnson as coach. They win five of the next six to battle for the
final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Then they lose nine
straight. Johnson decides not come back, paving the way for Del
Harris' hiring.
</P>
<P>
   March 22, 1968: As the epilogue to the Game of the Century, UCLA
avenges its two-point regular-season loss to Houston in January
with a 101-69 victory over the Cougars in the NCAA Tournament
semifinals at the L.A. Sports Arena. A record 15,742 watch along
with those at six closed-circuit TV locations (there was no
national TV broadcast). (47) .
</P>
<P>
   March 22, 1969: In the 88th win in the 90 games of the Lew
Alcindor era at UCLA, the Bruins crush Purdue 92-72 in Louisville,
Ky., to give John Wooden his fifth NCAA basketball championship.
It's the third straight for senior Alcindor, who was 15-of-20
shooting for 37 points to go with 20 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   March 23, 1968: The day after beating Houston in the semifinals,
UCLA's fourth NCAA basketball title comes at the L.A. Sports Arena,
a 78-55 win over North Carolina as junior Alcindor scores 34 with
16 rebounds and six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   March 23, 1974: UCLA's streak of national titles comes to an end
with an 80-77 double-overtime loss to North Carolina State in the
NCAA semifinals at Greensboro, N.C. David Thompson scores 28 points
and has 10 rebounds to senior Bill Walton's 29 and 13. Coach Wooden
calls it the ``most devastating loss'' of his career.
</P>
<P>
   March 23, 1994: The Kings' Wayne Gretzky becomes the NHL's
all-time leading goal-scorer, racking up No.802 to pass Gordie
Howe.
</P>
<P>
   March 24, 1980: An improbable run by Larry Brown's UCLA
basketball team ends in the NCAA title game with a loss to
Louisville 59-54 at Indianapolis.

defeats Jim Ryan in the mile run at the International Track
Association meet at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   March 25, 1967: UCLA's third NCAA basketball title comes with a
79-64 win over Dayton at Louisville, Ky. Sophomore Alcindor scores

</P>
<P>
   March 25, 1972: UCLA's sixth NCAA basketball title in a row is
celebrated at the L.A. Sports Arena in an 81-76 win over Florida
State. Sophomore Walton leads the way with 24 points and 20
rebounds, while Keith Wilkes scores 23 with 10 boards and Henry
Bibby adds 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   March 25, 1990: Loyola Marymount's emotional run through the
NCAA basketball tournament ends with a 131-101 loss to eventual
champion UNLV in the West Region final at Oakland. LMU advanced to
the Great Eight with a 62-60 win over Alabama two days earlier. The
Lions averaged an NCAA Tournament-record 105 points a game in their
four appearances in that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   March 25, 1978: Senior Ann Meyers guides UCLA's Billie
Moore-coached women's basketball team to a 90-74 win over Maryland

<P>
   March 26, 1973: In probably the greatest individual performance
in an NCAA basketball tournament final, Walton's 21-of-22 shooting
for 44 points in the final against Memphis State gives UCLA its
seventh title in a row. Walton's output in the 87-66 win at St.
Louis was all the more impressive since the junior picked up his
fourth foul with 9:27 left and the Bruins protecting an eight-point

OPEC PLANS PRODUCTION CUT TO FUEL RISE IN OIL PRICES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct coding.)   (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ As they slipped out of their black limousines
into luxury hotels dotting the contours of Vienna's graceful
Stadtpark Sunday night, officials of OPEC, the nearly moribund oil
cartel, were stirring with new life, ready to jolt oil prices back
up.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well at an emergency meeting set for Tuesday here,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in partnership
with major oil producers like Mexico and Norway who are not members
of the group, will take more than 2 million barrels of oil a day
out of world markets, starting in April.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark the first time in 13 years that the cartel has
taken such a drastic measure, largely because of the pressing needs
of the largest producer, Saudi Arabia, and other producing
countries to generate more revenue, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the move _ which has emerged as OPEC officials
formulated it in secret and in public talks held in Riyadh, The
Hague, Dubai, London and other cities in the last four weeks _ has
already pushed prices up 20 percent, bringing the American
benchmark brand known as West Texas Intermediate to $15 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   This has halted, for a while at least, the steady fall in prices
that devastated the world energy industry in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the impact reflects optimism in the oil industry that
salvation is on the way. In the last decade, globalization,
competition from new oil suppliers and disputes within OPEC
combined to send oil prices into a seemingly endless tumble to a
point where gasoline and fuel prices today are, in
inflation-adjusted prices, the lowest since the end of the World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a confluence of new circumstances may help the cartel
reverse some of these trends. Among other things, the Asian
economic crisis, which erased more than 1.5 million barrels a day
in demand for oil, is stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil production is also stabilizing. In 1998 Iraq more than
doubled its oil production to 2.5 million barrels a day as the
United Nations allowed it to sell more oil under its oil-for-food
sanctions regime. That ceiling cannot increase much more now unless
the United Nations sanctions are removed altogether _ something the
United States would not allow.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the pain of lower prices has piled mountains of debt
onto the economies of many oil-producing countries, cut their
government budgets down to a point of endangering social and
political cohesion, and ravaged oil company profits worldwide _
enough to create a consensus for OPEC discipline and worldwide
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst seems to be over,'' said Robert Mabro, director of
the Oxford University Institute for Energy Studies in England.
``They have to act because low prices are deeply hurting producing
countries and oil companies. Hard currency revenues are shrinking
dangerously in places like Nigeria, Venezuela, Russia, Mexico.
Multinational oil companies have cut costs to the bone, laid off
thousands of people and seen their profits evaporate. Everybody
wants a solution,''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the seriousness of the action, Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest oil producer and most important OPEC member, has
agreed to take the biggest cut, shutting down half a million
barrels of oil a day of its production starting in April. ``As far
as we are concerned, it's a done deal,'' said a senior Saudi
official in Riyadh, who asked not to be identified. ``We are
informing customers right now that deliveries will be cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Libya, Indonesia, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and Indonesia are joining in with cuts that
total about 1.5 million barrels a day. Norway and Mexico, major oil
producers and allies of the United States who are not members of
OPEC, intend to cut their production by a combined 350,000 barrels
daily.
</P>
<P>
   This is a remarkable show of solidarity unseen since 1986, when
a similar collapse in prices led producers to drastic and
coordinated production cuts.
</P>
<P>
   While still frowning on any concerted action to control prices
of such a vital commodity, the United States appears not to object
to stronger oil prices, which would also help the American oil
industry. It too has been deeply hurt by the price collapse,
resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that lower oil prices are good for consumers, but we
recognize they can have a negative impact domestically and on some
of our friends like Venezuela and Mexico,'' Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said in a telephone conversation from Washington on
Friday. ``So far, OPEC's response has been responsible and
restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Saudi Arabia, the cartel's undisputed master and America's
staunch Persian Gulf ally, that holds the fate of the accord in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the world's largest petroleum reserve, Saudi Arabia
had two ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could go back, as they have done now, revert to their old
standard of constraining production and hope that prices will go
up,'' said Anthony Miles, senior vice president at the San
Francisco office of the Boston Consulting Group. ``Or they can
swing all the way, pumping as much oil as possible, and the guys
with the most oil will win.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take some months to determine whether OPEC's new
discipline will hold. The big deterrent to cheating is Saudi
Arabia's unique ability to flood the market.
</P>
<P>
   With prolific oil fields, Miles and other experts point out, the
desert kingdom can pump more than 10 million barrels a day at
minimal extraction costs of $1 a barrel. This flooding would bring
prices down to as low as $5 a barrel in a few months. Few
oil-producing countries can take this possibility lightly. In the
long run, it would put many producers out of business in the United
States, the Caspian Sea, Russia and the prolific North Sea shared
by Norway and Britain, where production costs range from $5 to $10
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis' need to produce higher revenues has become
compelling. Piling one budget deficit over another in the last
decade, Saudi Arabia has accumulated a debt of $130 billion, the
equivalent of its entire annual economic output.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after tenaciously clinging to a level of production
set since 1990 at 8 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia for the
first time has offered to lower it to 7.5 million barrels a day.
This is a fundamental change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eight-million level was practically untouchable _ it had
become an icon-hobbling policy,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior
oil analyst at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston.
``The willingness to abandon it shows the urgency they attach to
higher revenues now.''

MEXICAN REBELS HOLD A REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's Zapatista rebels, in a characteristically
imaginative but one-sided attempt to put their isolated movement
back in the limelight, held a nationwide referendum Sunday on their
proposals for peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The four questions on the ballot were so politically loaded that
they were likely to reveal little about Mexicans' current views on
the rebels' 5-year-old organization _ a hybrid between an armed
guerrilla force and a grass-roots Indian rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   But preparations for the vote over the last 10 days brought much
political theater. And the news media blitz made it clear that the
Zapatistas and their chief strategist, known as Subcomandante
Marcos _ who did not leave Chiapas _ retain a flair for populist
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas organized balloting in every county in Mexico _
and 5,000 masked Zapatista followers propagated their peace
proposals across the country. They were allowed to travel outside
Chiapas, because they were not armed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a half-dozen masked Indian rebels stopped in for lunch
at a storied cafeteria here called Sanborn's. They sat at the same
counter where the fighters in broad sombreros supporting Emiliano
Zapata, the revolutionary for whom the modern-day rebel
organization is named, had a meal after marching to Mexico City in
1914.
</P>
<P>
   Masked Zapatista women, with babies strapped in shawls across
their chests, turned up studying the bikinis on the beach in
Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising encounter was a lunch on Thursday between
three Zapatistas and several top business executives at the
Industrialists' Club, the posh and exclusive meeting place for the
captains of Mexican capitalism. Participants said the businessmen
urged the Zapatistas to make peace with the government, while the
Zapatistas urged the businessmen to urge the government to make
peace with them.
</P>
<P>
   The government responded with its own press campaign. President
Ernesto Zedillo traveled to Las Margaritas, a Chiapas Indian county
that used to be strongly pro-Zapatista but is increasingly divided.
He blamed the Zapatistas for holding up the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas also faced more criticism from other quarters
than in years past. In Chiapas, a communique from a group of 79
evangelical Christian communities called for the Zapatistas ``to
surrender immediately.'' Pro-government Indians complained that
Zapatistas were threatening to make them participate in the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   A national poll by the University of Guadalajara revealed
Mexicans' complex views about the rebels. In the sample, 83 percent
said they did not believe that Indians enjoy the same rights as
other Mexicans. But 32 percent said they had a ``bad'' image of
Marcos, while 29 percent said they had a ``good'' one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The peace talks collapsed in September 1996 after the government
sought to change some terms it had previously accepted. The sides
remain divided on a relatively few, but difficult, issues. The
Zapatistas want to give more importance to collective property in
Indian communities, while the government argues that the changes
they propose would generate land battles all over Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One question on the Zapatistas' yes-or-no ballot is: ``Do you
agree that we should reach a true peace through dialogue,
demilitarizing the country by sending the soldiers back to their
barracks as the Constitution and the laws require?''

REPUBLICANS LOOKING RIGHT AND LEFT FOR TAX-CUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.M., Fla., Va., Texas, Ala., Wash., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Kasich, the irrepressible Ohio congressman who
is running for president on a theme of grass-roots empowerment,
wants a 10 percent across-the-board cut in federal income-tax
rates. ``The more money people have in their pocket,'' he says,
``the more they control their destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich is hardly unique in the Republican presidential field.
Dan Quayle, the former vice president, is calling for a 30 percent
tax cut for every American. Steve Forbes, the publisher, is once
again advocating a flat tax. In fact, one way or another, every
potential Republican candidate has embraced the theme of tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich, unlike the others, is also the chairman of the House
Budget Committee, with an influential role in fiscal policy. The
budget plan he drafted along with other Republican leaders is
scheduled for a House vote this week.
</P>
<P>
   That blueprint sets aside at least $800 billion over a decade
for tax reductions, which is enough to phase in the 10 percent tax
cut. But Kasich has run into trouble selling his idea to the rest
of the Republican Congress even though he has such prominent
figures as Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, on
his side.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans of all stripes have made so many
counterproposals that the search for the right tax cut has begun to
look like a carpet auction. Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, now calls a 10 percent tax
cut unlikely. And even Kasich concedes, ``We're going to have a big
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's dilemma shows the strange situation in which the
Republicans find themselves nearly two decades after Ronald Reagan
swept into office with a call for a bold across-the-board tax cut.
Once, a tax cut was a sure-fire Republican battle cry. But just
when the new era of surpluses makes dreams of large tax cuts
possible again, the fickle American public seems less interested
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   A private poll that the National Republican Congressional
Committee distributed to House Republicans at a party retreat last
month in Williamsburg, Va., found that 67 percent of Americans
favored a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. But the endorsement
looked less overwhelming, Republicans familiar with the poll say,
when people were asked more specifically how they wanted the
federal government to use the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Given a list of options, 31 percent of those questioned wanted
the money devoted to Social Security, 26 percent to reducing the
national debt and only 18 percent wanted tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken last month,
64 percent of all Americans said they wanted any surplus money
devoted to Social Security. Only 12 percent said they wanted taxes
to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists say that, in part, Americans are shying
away from tax cuts because they still do not believe there really
is a federal surplus. And with the strong economy putting money in
their pockets, voters are more focused on issues like retirement
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``People simply don't believe the surplus is large enough to
save Social Security and Medicare on the one hand and to have large
across-the-board tax cuts on the other,'' said Mark Mellman, who is
a pollster to the congressional Democratic leadership. ``People are
not fools.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., argues that the falloff in support
for sweeping tax relief is partly a result of the economic
expansion. ``Republicans have always been dominated by
supply-siders who said `Cut taxes' at every possible moment and it
will cause the economy to boom,'' he said in an interview. ``The
lesson of 1995 and '96 has been if you cut federal spending,
markets respond, interest rates drop and the economy explodes that
way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Williamsburg retreat, Scarborough reminded his House
colleagues of the 1996 presidential campaign when Bob Dole made the
promise of a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut a centerpiece of
his losing race. Of the proposal for a 10 percent across-the-board
tax cut, Scarborough said wryly, ``Maybe it will work as well for
us in '99 as it worked for Dole in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, tax cuts remain important to the Republicans' core
voters, and other Republican strategists argue that tax relief is
not high on the broad public agenda, simply because their party has
failed to talk about the issue enough. ``As this debate goes on,''
said Jim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, ``and the more people
think there's a surplus out there _ it will help the tax-cut
argument.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Davis III of Virginia, the new head of the House
Republicans' re-election effort, argues that Dole never gave more
than glancing support to his plan for an across-the-board tax cut.
``He talked about it for a month and then abandoned it,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   He points instead to the example of James Gilmore III, the
governor of Virginia, who won in 1997 by pledging to eliminate the
unpopular personal property tax on cars.
</P>
<P>
   So to fire up the public, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House
majority leader, along with lobbying groups like the National
Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of
Manufacturers, has begun a series of town meetings across the
country to try to stoke the demand for tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey is not promoting any particular tax-relief plan
because the debate is still running high in Republican circles over
what kind of tax cuts will prove politically appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups favor measures like a reduction in the capital
gains tax. Some Republicans want to eliminate the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives want to eliminate the so-called marriage
penalty, which results in many married couples paying more in taxes
than they would if they were single. Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala., said,
``It's just an abomination to me that we would penalize something
that we pay a tremendous amount of lip service to _ families and
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans have come to believe that the kind of targeted
tax-credit approach that President Clinton has made his own _
proposing tax credits for particular needs like child care or
long-term health care or education _ might have greater resonance.
In his budget proposal, Clinton called for $4.1 billion in tightly
targeted tax credits in fiscal 2000 and $32.6 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe they get the bang for the buck with 10
percent, the way they do when we personalize tax reduction,'' said
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Dunn is co-sponsor of a tax-cut package that she calls
the ``lifetime tax-relief act'' because it includes a potpourri of
things like eliminating the marriage tax, eliminating the estate
tax, and raising the personal exemption to provide tax relief for
single people too. Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., has proposed her
own tax-cut package that moderates have rallied around.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich argues that such an approach leaves broad swaths of
Americans without any benefit. ``We've done targeted tax cuts in
the past few years,'' he said, ``but there were too many people who
were left out.''
</P>
<P>
   He is still pushing hard for his own proposal. ``You ought to be
reducing taxes whether times are good or bad,'' he said last
Thursday as he headed for another weekend on the campaign trail.
``We're going to have a fight inside our party,'' he said. ``That's
OK.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Let 'em give out Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   We've got a deli case full o' Oscar Mayers _ for the biggest
sports 'dogs who couldn't help themselves and took a prominent role
in a motion picture that some actually paid to see in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   First, we respect Ray Allen 's performance too much in ``He Got
Game'' to include him in consideration here. This was no Alex
English. And the Spike Lee flick coulda flopped but instead made us
forget all about ``Cornbread, Earl and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   We coulda picked on Howie Long , but his picture deal with Fox
shows he means biz-ness. And his slushy scenes with co-star Suzy
Amis in ``Firestorm'' will only help now that Amis is shacked up
with director James ``Titanic'' Cameron . (In Hollywood, it's not
so much who you swap spit with on the screen, but who they're
swapping spit with off the screen.)
</P>
<P>
   And too bad that Superhero Shaq , who had a forgetful cameo in
``He Got Game,'' didn't follow up ``Steel'' with anything. He got
wise.
</P>
<P>
   Naw, for the biggest wiener-gone-loser of '98, the Oscar Mayer
goes to...
</P>
<P>
   Gheorghe Muresan in Billy Crystal 's career-ending ``My Giant.''
Crystal plays a Hollywood agent who stumbles on Max (Muresan) in
Romania and tries to get him into movies. Talk about art imitating
life.
</P>
<P>
   And because Gheorghe of the Jungle messed up the arches in his
feet during the shoot, he shot his NBA career in the foot. All he
could get after that was a role (uncredited) of a giant Spanish
soldier in ``The Mask of Zorro.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he can't even get a casting call, let alone a
three-second call. What a giant lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   _And how John Madden finds time to direct ``Shakespeare in
Love'' and do NFL games is beyond logic....
</P>
<P>
   _There's got to be some Academy recognition for Bob ``Don't call
me Robert Quinlan'' Costas , who, after the cheek-pinching cute
portrayal as himself in ``BASEketball,'' came out and ragged on the
stupidity of the movie. He couldn't see that going in? At least
fellow thespians Al Michaels , Jim Lampley , Bret Lewis and Tim
McCarver refrained from such pettiness....
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob ``I said don't call me Robert Quinlan'' Costas
</P>
<P>
   is more in his element tonight as a contestant on ``Jeopardy!''
(Channel 7, 7 p.m.), beating the smarty pants off co-celebs
</P>
<P>
   Robin Roberts and Keith Olbermann ....
</P>
<P>
   _And, finally, a happy 47th b-day today to Bob ``If you call me
Robert Quinlan one more time I'll sue, and don't call me diminutive
either'' Costas , who's now No.2 behind
</P>
<P>
   Billy Barty in oldest-living ``little person.''...
</P>
<P>
   _Postscript to the DiMaggio-Monroe marriage of superstar
athlete-actress: We missed Andre Agassi and ``Garth'' Brooke
Shields . Mainly because who thinks of Agassi as an athlete or
Shields as an actress anymore?...
</P>
<P>
   _A marketing group in Minnesota announced plans to start an NBA
``Legends Tour,'' a 30-game series of exhibitions featuring guys
like James Worthy, Michael Cooper and Spencer Haywood . ( Norm
Nixon must still be rehabbing that torn ACL from the last
``Legends'' appearance).
</P>
<P>
   Don't we have enough out-of-shape tall guys playing in the
regular NBA, or do attendance figures indicate there's a thirst for
this?...
</P>
<P>
   _Can't help it, but every time we see the guy in the Lakers
No.41 jersey spot up 30 feet out, we're about to scream: ``Don't
shoot that, Elden!''...
</P>
<P>
   _Why it matters how many teams from a conference are invited to
the NCAA Tournament _ each game a school plays, it receives
$170,000, no matter what round. And the cash is split among the
conference reps. So the 'Zags pull in $680,000, and WCC partners
Pepperdine and LMU make a nice chunk of change for doing
nuthin'....

 HOW DO YOU GET DNA INTO A PLANT? BLOW A HOLE IN IT
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
When plumbers or contractors encounter a tough problem they often
reach for a bigger wrench or hammer.
</P>
<P>
   A similar logic apparently prevails in the submicroscopic world
of genetically engineered plants. With one difference. When
agricultural bioscientists encounter a defiant grass cell, some
grab a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously. Biotech industry lore credits former Stanford
researcher Mike Fromm with showing his colleagues the way to
science through superior firepower.
</P>
<P>
   I caught up last week with Fromm, who now heads a private
biotech firm in Hayward, for a firsthand account of his shotgun
technique.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that in the late 1980s, bioscientists ran into a
problem. Genetic engineering involves piercing the walls of target
cells and introducing altered DNA into the cells' interior.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers working with animal or human cells turned
out to have it relatively easy. They found that the walls of animal
cells could be pierced by chemical or electric shocks, which opened
tiny holes through which altered DNA could ooze into target cells.
</P>
<P>
   But when ag researchers tried to use these same techniques to
genetically engineer corn, wheat and other grass cells, they ran
into unexpected trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a microscopic scale, the wall of a grass cell is like a
concrete bunker,'' Fromm said.
</P>
<P>
   In research conducted between 1987 and 1990, when he worked at
Stanford and UC Berkeley, Fromm collaborated with scientists at
Cornell University to create a gun designed to crack that bunker.

   This bio-shotgun _ which had a seven-inch barrel, about a
quarter the normal length _ fired a plastic shell bearing thousands
of microscopic pellets, which had been soaked in genetically
altered DNA. He aimed the gun at a petri dish covered by a sheet of
bulletproof plastic. In the center of this bulletproof cover he
drilled a hole one-eighth inch in diameter. Below, on the surface
of the petri dish, he smeared grass cells.
</P>
<P>
   He aimed the gun, like a deadly microscope, at the hole, pulled
the trigger, and BANG! The plastic stopped the shell casing, but
some of the microscopic pellets sped through the one-eighth-inch
hole, pierced the walls of the grass cells below, and delivered
their DNA payload to the cells' interior. Success!

   Fromm, whose discovery led to a seven-year stint with Monsanto
Corp., returned to the Bay Area two years ago to found Mendel
Biotechnology. Now, he's looking for kinder, gentler ways to
genetically engineer crops.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about the controversy surrounding such efforts in the
Bay Area, a hotbed of pie-throwing activists out to smear
agricultural biotech executives. We didn't reach any conclusions on
what promises to be a complex and contentious debate about genetic
crops.
</P>
<P>
   But it's interesting that we have someone of Fromm's, shall we
say caliber, in the neighborhood, to help state the industry's
case.
</P>
<P>
   THE DNA FILES: Speaking of genetically engineered crops, KQED-FM
(88.5) will broadcast an hourlong special report on the subject
Thursday evening from 8 to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Plants, Animals and Transgenics: A Tomato by Any
Other Name,'' is the fourth in a nine-part series on how DNA
technology works and the questions it raises.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist John Hockenberry narrates the reports, which were
produced by SoundVision Productions, a nonprofit group in Berkeley.
KQED's Web site (www.kqed.org) lists show dates and descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   After SoundVision executive producer Bari Scott alerted me to
the series, I tuned in to show No. 3, on prenatal genetic testing.
The excellent report made me sorry I'd missed the earlier sessions
on the human genome project. But several of the most provocative
issues have yet to be aired, including the question of whether
genes determine our fate.
</P>
<P>
   JOB ACTION: Here's a fresh angle on the report I filed March 1
about the layoff of a third of the staff at Scios Inc. in Mountain
View.
</P>
<P>
   On D-day, company officials gathered the 80 axed employees in a
meeting room to discuss severance issues. Someone stood up, looked
around at all the faces, and said, ``Would everybody here like to
stay in touch?''
</P>
<P>
   The nods that went around the room led to the creation of a Web
site, www.jaws.com/scios, maintained by analytical chemist Enona
Gopinath, one of those squeezed out in Scios's belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of BIOSCOPE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Gopinath and her colleagues have used the site to exchange
messages and share job leads. Scios alumni at other firms have
posted alerts on the site about job openings.
</P>
<P>
   The job market for scientists isn't bad right now, Gopinath
said. But it's never easy to be forced into a job hunt. And at a
certain professional level it gets tricky finding the right
opening. So the site is low key, and dignified, like the jobseekers
themselves. No posters reading: ``Will sequence genes for food.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a group of professionals, banding together to zig past
one of life's unexpected zags.

 HOW Y2K COULD HOBBLE BUILDINGS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
T hese days, any modern office or large apartment building relies
heavily on computer systems and microprocessors to run everything
from air conditioners to elevators.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it was an eye-opener when half of the people in a
roomful of San Francisco building owners and managers last week
said they haven't even started looking for potential Year 2000
problems that could affect those computers and chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are not prepared at all,'' said James Szel,
whose company, Syska Hennessy Inc., is helping hundreds of building
managers around the world with Year 2000 problem planning.
</P>
<P>
   And with only nine months left, some of the city's biggest
commercial real estate managers ``are just getting started,'' Szel
said. ``I think there will be some buildings that will not be fully
operational.''
</P>
<P>
   Szel, senior vice president for Syska Hennessy's facilities
management division, and Steven England, a national real estate
consultant for E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal of San Francisco, headed a
panel discussion on Y2K challenges and risks sponsored by the
Building Owners and Managers Association of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Both have spent the past two years advising commercial property
owners, hospitals and defense facility managers around the world
how to prepare for Y2K, the programming shortcut that could cause
computers to misread the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Many building managers, like the general public, were skeptical,
thinking Y2K was only an affliction of databases and mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as England noted, during the past 30 years, buildings have
replaced electrical switches and other machinery with chips and
programs that may contain the Y2K shortcut. Operations like lights,
elevators, climate controls and security are run by computers that
may or may not fail on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 6 billion chips in facilities and buildings
around the world,'' England said. ``The Year 2000 risk isn't going
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing has already uncovered Y2K glitches. For example, Szel
said one of his clients who owns a major building in Mexico City
had staff spend six months working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   They even had letters from companies that made key microchips
and computer systems certifying that everything would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   But when the staff reset the computer clocks over to January 1
as a test, ``every system, air conditioner, fire, security, all
froze,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, tests of a Concord building's individual
computer controlled systems like security were successful. But when
engineers ran a full test of the building's main computer that
controlled those individual components, the whole system locked up
and had to be reset.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting, though, that dire consequences like elevators
plunging to the ground didn't happen. And engineers could step in
and manually operate building systems.
</P>
<P>
   Building managers trying to exterminate the Y2K bug may have the
most trouble with complex security systems that employ a variety of
chips and software from various manufacturers, Szel said. He said
elevators, which use fewer components, should be ``in relatively
good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   One building owner had a security camera system controlled by a
VCR, which had an internal clock that failed the date test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recommending having extra security people on hand,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Szel and England said there's still time for building managers
to start Y2K hunting, begining with an inventory to learn which
computer systems could go down.
</P>
<P>
   The building owners association has published a book on
commercial real estate Y2K testing and contingency planning.
Information about the book can be found at www.boma.org/year2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is a wake-up call for technology, how we plan for it and
how we manage it,'' England said. ``We didn't take it seriously
enough in the '60s and now we've got a trillion-dollar problem on
our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   I'VE GOT THE BUG: The Y2K Problem has been dubbed the
``Millennium Bug,'' but nobody has actually seen the notorious bug.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dennis O'Sullivan, who owns a medical products company in
Healdsburg, claims to have captured the Bug as it chomped on
computer parts in the middle of the wine country north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So, like any good entrepreneur, he's selling T-shirts, mousepads
and coffee cups to mark the occasion, captured in a fanciful
cartoon drawing by Santa Rosa artist Marc Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept hearing about the Y2K bug, so I said why don't we make
a bug and bring some levity to the situation because everybody's
running around worried to death,'' O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon shows a mechanical bug munching on a computer, which
is displaying the position the planets in our solar system as they
will be in on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   His other company, Synektics Inc. of Healdsburg, has
manufactured special orthopedic pillows for the medical industry
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan last week signed a deal with a national marketing
company that plans to sell the Bug as a corporate promotional item.
He has sold about dozen so far from his Web site at
www.knowwear.com.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC Y2K HELP: Y2Kbase.com, a new Web site in San Francisco,
can help consumers find out if products in their homes are Y2K
ready.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.y2kbase.com, has a searchable database with
information and Web links about hundreds of products and services
in 10 categories, including hardware, software, electronics and
financial services.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking new markets beyond its mainstay corporate data network
software, Novell Corp. plans Monday to announce an Internet
technology intended to give Web surfers greater control over their
identities as they travel through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Novell hopes the technology, called Digital Me, will gain
acceptance as a standard means of controlling identity on the World
Wide Web, permitting network users to reveal or retain as much
personal information as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   At Novell's annual users group meeting Monday in Provo, Utah,
the company plans to demonstrate a simple personal computer version
of the Digital Me software, which acts as a digital safe-deposit
box for personal information _ not only name, address, credit card
numbers and such, but also possibly the telltale electronic codes
that can identify a person's PC and be used to trace his or her Web
travels.
</P>
<P>
   When an individual visits a Web site, the Digital Me software
would enable the user to control how much personal information the
Web site collects from this digital deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Besides protecting privacy, such an approach might also make it
possible for users to sell or barter their personal data for
rebates, discounts or other special considerations from online
merchants. Digital Me also permits computer users to store and
exchange lists of information like Web site bookmarks or song
lists, work groups or groups of friends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the announcement, Novell plans to say that the
financial services company Citigroup and the credit card provider
First USA will test new services based on the Digital Me software.
Those companies also intend to support Novell's effort to turn the
technology into an industry standard for online companies hoping to
reassure customers that personal digital information will not be
used in unauthorized ways.
</P>
<P>
   In tackling electronic privacy, Novell, which is still the
market leader in corporate network software but is feeling
increasing pressure from Microsoft Corp., has embraced one of the
Internet's lightning-rod issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet has become increasingly commercialized,
companies have employed various electronic means to identify
computer users, track their movements over the Web and employ
so-called data mining techniques to create digital dossiers on
individual consumers. In response, privacy-rights and consumer
advocates have demanded that users be given more control over their
online identities and personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a promising arena,'' said Marc Singer, co-author of
``Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules''
(Harvard Business School Press, 1999). ``The challenge for Novell
is finding the right business model. But the reason this can work
is there is value for both the consumer and the merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital Me is the first significant new technology from the
company under Eric E. Schmidt, a former Sun Microsystems Inc.
executive who became Novell's chief executive in March 1997 and was
given the mandate of helping the office network software company
remain relevant in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   The technology itself is the brainchild of Michael Sheridan, a
longtime software designer who was one of the three creators of
Sun's Java programming language. Last May, Sheridan left Sun to
join Schmidt at Novell as vice president involved in new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, corporate Web sites are Hoovering virtually
everything you do on the Internet,'' Sheridan said, using industry
slang for the Hoover vacuum-cleaner approach that data miners often
take in gathering up all loose user information. ``They are talking
about `sticky' Web sites and `capturing eyeballs,' and I'm not sure
I like this language.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet commerce companies are increasingly reliant on
their ability to aim advertising at individual consumers, many Web
surfers are not aware of the extent to which computerized matching
technology is being used to keep tabs on them.
</P>
<P>
   Novell plans initially to release the Digital Me technology in
this year's third quarter in a form that would permit users to
establish multiple online identities _ perhaps one for work,
another for use with friends and a third for anonymous Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Identity, according to Schmidt, is the Internet's next frontier.
He cited an axiom set forth some years ago by the network innovator
and entrepreneur Robert Metcalfe, positing that the value of a
computer network can be expressed as the square of the number of
devices connected to it. ``Now we're in a new phase,'' Schmidt
said. ``Today, the value of the network is the square of the number
of human relationships on the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   While Novell plans to sell and license Digital Me products and
technology, the company has also decided to make the end-user, or
client, portion of the software freely available under so-called
open source terms, in the hope that other software developers will
expand the market for Digital Me by building compatibility into
software for e-mail, personal information management and Web
navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's receptivity to Digital Me will be a crucial test
of Schmidt's ability to expand Novell's business beyond its
corporate networking niche, where its Netware flagship is under
fire from Microsoft's Windows NT and the coming Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year before Schmidt arrived, Novell was
profitable, earning $126 million on sales of $1.3 billion. But even
then, sales of Netware were stagnant, and the company was widely
perceived as a once-innovative player that had failed to adapt to
the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After Schmidt oversaw several money-losing quarters of painful
revamping, Novell returned to profitability in 1998. And last
month, the company reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $29
million, or 8 cents a diluted share, which was more than double its
earnings in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct sense of optimism at Novell's Provo campus
these days, where word of delays in Microsoft's Windows 2000
networking software has given the embattled company a sense of
reprieve. Certainly, Novell's share price has reflected Wall
Street's renewed optimism in the company. The stock, which closed
at $26.1875 last Friday, is up 44.5 percent this year. And the
company's overall market value now stands at $8.8 billion, compared
with barely $2 billion before Schmidt took over.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Me's 47-year-old godfather, Sheridan, holds only a vice
president's title. But as a member of Novell's eight-person
executive committee, he is clearly a part of Schmidt's brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   A 1974 graduate of Claremont College, where he studied economics
and Russian history, Sheridan was initially drawn to the world of
small publishing and became a protege of Grant Dahlstrom, whose
Castle Press was an exemplar of the small publisher devoted to
high-quality book printing.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan's work led to an interest in computerized typography.
And after growing close to two well-known Stanford University
computer scientists who specialized in the field, Chuck Bigelow and
Donald Knuth, Sheridan was accepted for graduate studies at
Stanford. Before he took his first course, though, he got
sidetracked by his first start-up company, Imagen, one of the
world's first laser printer companies, which was eventually sold.
Later, his second Silicon Valley start-up, a typography software
company, was bought by Sun Microsystems in 1988, and he went to
work there.
</P>
<P>
   After a number of development projects at Sun, where the main
product line is high-powered computer work stations, Sheridan
branched off with a development project for hand-held computers
that eventually led to the Sun Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, long before Java reached the market, Sheridan had
tired of what he perceived as political infighting over the
project. He moved east to attend film school at American University
in Washington, and later made a PBS documentary, ``The Image of the
Spirit,'' about a group of Russian religious iconographers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, though, Schmidt persuaded him to return to Sun, which
is based in Mountain View, Calif. Two years later, he followed
Schmidt to Provo.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan continues to make his home in Oak Hill, Va., but spends
most of his time in Provo supervising the small ``skunk works''
development laboratory that he has filled with people he has
selected from throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the group's warren of offices was identified
only by a sign that read ``Documentation Center.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign now reads ``NPI: New Product Initiatives,'' as the
company has become more open about the Digital Me project and
another half-dozen projects in the pipeline _ or, to use Schmidt's
term, the Pipe. Most of those projects involve refinements to
network directories, the computer-system equivalent of telephone
books, which are a strength of Novell's Netware.
</P>
<P>
   More than a label, the Pipe is an incentive program for
soliciting innovative ideas from throughout the company and
fostering an entrepreneurial, risk-taking corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem,'' Sheridan said in a recent interview, ``was, how
do you use Novell's collective brain?'' The answer: pay employees
$2,000 for any idea for a new Novell project that a small review
committee accepts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the employee, who can come from anywhere in the
company, gets the opportunity to assemble a small team of people to
begin the process of transforming the idea into a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Eric's mantras is that `It's OK to fail,''' Sheridan
said of the Pipe, which was set up five months ago.

 THE DOWNSIDE TO FREE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JON SWARTZ &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Part of the Internet's allure is the ease with which anyone can
freely and anonymously exchange ideas on virtually any topic. The
constant flow of debate and criticism can be astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   And, unfortunately, it can sometimes be irresponsible and
destructive: Just ask a couple of Northwest companies that were
trashed in one of Yahoo's popular bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   In January, someone with the e-mail moniker ``Delusional5''
allegedly posted a message on Yahoo's finance message board,
claiming that Wade Cook, who runs an investment education firm, had
been arrested for accepting kickbacks from companies he touted
online.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Cook Financial Corp. denied the allegation, but Yahoo
refused to remove the remarks from its bulletin board, said Kiman
Lucas, general counsel for Seattle's Wade Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to their opinions, but to say our founder
is in jail is absurd,'' she said. ``This is a short-seller's dream
and a major concern to our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Wade Cook filed a slander suit against 10 as-yet
unidentified users of the Yahoo bulletin board. &UR;  &LR; Wade Cook hinted
it will subpoena Yahoo to get the real names of those users.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this so egregious is that falsehoods are posted on
Yahoo message boards for millions of people to read, and we can't
remove them from the Internet,'' Lucas said. ``This isn't like
graffiti written on a bathroom wall'' that only a few hundred
people might see.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In a similar case, ITEX, a Portland, Ore., online financial
services company, is suing two former employees for allegedly
posting false and defamatory information about the company on the
same Yahoo message board last year, said Stephen Pearson, assistant
general counsel at ITEX.
</P>
<P>
   It is seeking up to $1.5 million in damages from the defendants,
who purportedly claim ITEX is in deep financial trouble and that
``corrupt'' management has engaged in bribery, extortion, shady
stock deals and the promotion of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ITEX obtained a subpoena to force Yahoo to track down the
message-board users' e-mail addresses. After Yahoo complied, ITEX
gained a court order to force Internet service providers to divulge
the names of the individuals who posted the messages, Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Communications Decency Act protects Yahoo and other Web
sites from being sued for libel for false statements that appear on
their bulletin boards and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yahoo officials are rightfully conflicted about
protecting users' privacy and not being a conduit for slander.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lawyers say Internet users have a First Amendment right &UR;  &LR; to
rant online without divulging their identity.
</P>
<P>
   But with free speech, there also comes responsibility. And many
are abusing their rights when they knowingly spread malicious
rumors about a company or individual over the World Wide Web, which
reaches more than 100 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone _ including the government _ believe that the
First Amendment allows individuals to post anonymous messages,''
said Michael Overly, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in
Internet privacy. ``But that becomes a problem when the messages
are libelous. For the first time, any individual can cause a great
deal of harm to companies over the global communications network
for just a few dollars a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Fortune 500 firms are hiring cyber sleuths to find out what
the public is saying about them.
</P>
<P>
   EWatch, based in Dallas and New York, trolls thousands of
bulletin boards and chat rooms on behalf of corporate customers.
Its specialized software can sniff out negative comments about a
company, but it can't stop them from being posted.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo alone has about 1,000 bulletin boards and chat rooms that
get tens of thousands of messages daily.
</P>
<P>
   The posting of lies on bulletin boards ``is nearly impossible to
prevent,'' admits Patrick Naughton, executive vice president of
products for Infoseek, the Santa Clara, Calif., portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Even when someone is kicked off a bulletin board or chat room
for using profanity and or spreading falsehoods, they often pop up
the next day with a new e-mail account, Naughton said.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK 'EM, ABA: Independent booksellers, attempting to stave off
archrivals Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com, last week announced
the creation of their own national online bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The American Booksellers Association introduced Book Sense.com,
one in &UR;  &LR; a series of countermeasures to promote the faltering indie
market, which has lost members and market share to the big
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when it opens August 1, the virtual store will
feature 1.5 million titles, a search engine and credit-card
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers don't expect to bowl over the online giants but hope
to stem a sharp decline in market share. Since 1992, the ABA's
membership has declined to about 3,300 from 5,200, while their
slice of consumer book sales shriveled by half, to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the financing to take Amazon.com and others
straight up, but we can make sure customers of independent
bookstores have more than two choices on the Internet,'' said ABA
marketing director Michael Hoynes, who predicted more than 1,500
booksellers will be part of the site by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a knowledgeable, passionate merchant who cares
about books, and they want to support community businesses,'' said
Hut Landon, executive director of the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association in Corte Madera. ``It's like
the difference between going to a bed-and-breakfast and going to a
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S MUD IN YOUR EYE: Sure, the Webbies _ the Internet's
answer to the Oscars _ grabbed all of the attention at last week's
digital-do at Herbst Theater. But how about the list of
semifinalists for the ``Mud Brick Awards for World's Ugliest Web
sites,'' which were announced last Friday?

HUNDLEY TAKING IT SLOWLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ For the second straight day, Dodgers catcher
Todd Hundley threw on the side and was encouraged by it. But he
wasn't ready to proclaim himself on target for the April 5 season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging what manager Davey Johnson said a day earlier,
Hundley said Sunday he would rather start the season on the
disabled list and be healthy for the long haul rather than rush
into catching the opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks and wind
up hurt a month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to deal with the reality of it,'' a frustrated
Hundley said. ``I'm going to do everything I possibly can to get
there and (catch the opener). But you have to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has yet to catch a spring training game because of
soreness in his surgically repaired right elbow. He could be behind
the plate Wednesday when the Dodgers host Cleveland, but he's
expected to take a few more weeks to get into game shape.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitter now wears a neoprene-type brace on his right
elbow, and took batting practice from the left side for the first
time in more than a week. But it's now time for Hundley to back off
a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days I've thrown it's felt great so now we don't
want to push it over the edge,'' Hundley said. ``We're back on the
upswing now. The elbow is getting better. We went through a dead
time, which you're going to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Dodgers don't want to rush Hundley's recovery, so
he might catch only a few innings in his first few spring games.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some time next week he'll get in a game,'' said Johnson,
who added that it didn't mean Hundley would catch. ``We're going to
need to test him and see how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace of mind: Gary Sheffield returned to left field for the
Dodgers, his first appearance in eight days after getting a
cortisone shot for his ailing right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield wasn't in the original lineup, but after batting
practice he went to Johnson and asked to go in. ``I threw the ball
and felt fine,'' Sheffield said. ``I didn't have any pain. It's
improved. I felt pain-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who is 1 for 14 at the plate, said he'll try to play
again today against the Kansas City Royals so he can get a few more
at-bats. After the Dodgers' day off Tuesday, Sheffield said he
hopes to get four at-bats in most of the games.
</P>
<P>
   Peace of mind, Part II: Outside of the minor back stiffness that
knocked second baseman Eric Young out of the lineup for a few days,
everything was peachy during spring training. The last test he set
for himself was sliding, since the last time he did so he broke his
right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Expos he slid for the first this spring, and about
five seconds later he slid again. Young led off the bottom of the
first with a single, stole second and went to third when the throw
went into center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of the way. I'm at peace with it now,'' said Young,
who went 2 for 3. ``Things are coming along well.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Right-hander Dave Mlicki pitched two
innings in a Triple-A game. A week ago, he experienced stiffness
near his right shoulder blade and hadn't pitched in a week. He
threw 31 pitches and pitching coach Charlie Hough said the results
were fine. . . . Right-hander Antonio Osuna, bothered by elbow
soreness, played long-toss with Johnson before the game. ``He had
giddy-up on his fastball,'' Johnson said. . . . Right fielder Raul
Mondesi and coach Manny Mota left Dodgertown to tend to personal
business in the Dominican Republic. Both are expected to return
Tuesday. . . . Utility infielder Jose Vizcaino started at third
base for the Dodgers, his first appearance there since 1992.
Johnson said he likes Vizcaino's versatility in the field, having
played second, shortstop and third.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paper dolls still cling to the walls of the
deserted loft where Purple Moon LLC sought and failed to make a
viable business out of computer games for girls _ titles that in
contrast to current top-sellers, were not about eyeshadow
selection, nail-polish tricks or adventures around the pressing
question, ``Where's Ken?''
</P>
<P>
   The cut-outs, representing girls of different colors and sizes
kicking soccer balls and holding hands, reflect the company's goal
of creating a Barbie alternative that would inspire preteen-age
girls to embrace the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Purple Moon's chief executive and sole remaining
employee, Nancy Deyo, looked as forlorn as the abandoned dolls as
workers arrived to cart away the last copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the deal she had been struggling to close when
the company ran out of money last month went through _ albeit in a
much-altered form. In a move that seemed bittersweet if financially
pragmatic, Barbie's corporate parent, Mattel Inc., announced plans
to purchase Purple Moon's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Purple Moon made a difference for girls, and I'm proud
to have done that,'' Ms. Deyo said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the story of Purple Moon mirrors that of hundreds
of Silicon Valley start-ups that spend millions of dollars each
year only to fail before they can change the world and make huge
returns for their owners in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Small and unknown, Purple Moon faced an unforgiving battle for
shelf space with Mattel, which had 6 of the top 10 girls' titles
last year _ all Barbie themes _ according to PC Data, a market
research firm. The four others featured Madeline, French heroine of
the much-loved children's books, in titles published by the
Learning Company, which Mattelalso is acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   That Mattel was eager to scoop up Purple Moon's products _ for
an undisclosed sum _ helps refute assertions that the small
company's failure confirms that girls just want to play Barbie
Magic Hair Styler.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel said it planned new titles based on Rockett, Purple
Moon's spunky heroine, who favors spiky orange bangs and such
issues as whether to join the popular clique at school. The Los
Angeles-based Mattel also was impressed by the popularity of Purple
Moon's World Wide Web site, which has 250,000 registered users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the research they've done to show that there is
a different way for girls to play with computers,'' said David
Haddad, president of Mattel Media.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when electronic commerce and Internet portal sites
are the darlings of Wall Street, Purple Moon's business failure
invites scrutiny of the steps and missteps that led to the
dismissal of the company's 40 employees _ at more than 80 percent
women, the reverse of Silicon Valley's typical gender ratio _ on
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Brenda Laurel, a game designer whose credits
include Atari in the early 1980s, Purple Moon evolved from her work
at Interval Research Corp., which was financed by Microsoft's
co-founder Paul Allen. Over four years, Ms. Laurel interviewed
1,000 girls in researching how to apply the principles of their
play to computer games.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the company was spun off, underwritten by Interval
and Allen's Vulcan Ventures, it seemed clear to Ms. Laurel that
girls were not turned off by the violence in boys' games so much as
they found dying and starting over again tedious. Boys liked overt
competition; girls liked covert competition. Boys liked superheroes
and fantastical adventures; girls liked challenges they could
recognize in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda thought it through better than anyone else, and it
still failed,'' said Henry Jenkins, director of comparative media
studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jenkins, an
editor of ``From Barbie to Mortal Kombat,'' an anthology on gender
and computer games published by MIT Press, added, ``That's very
frustrating and very worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   The company used radical game features like emotional navigation
and relationship hierarchies to carve out a space for girls in a
market that had long been aimed at boys.
</P>
<P>
   The approach attracted plenty of media attention. ``A ROM of
Their Own,'' a Time magazine headline proclaimed before Purple Moon
introduced its first products.
</P>
<P>
   Spending was not spared. Early on, at a company retreat, the
development team role-played the proposed game characters to try to
understand their inner lives. In Christmas seasons, Purple Moon
bought television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The exhaustive research in which the company had its roots
continued with 25 additional studies. One, an ethnographic study of
girls' interest in sports, led to a product line featuring soccer,
which Mattel appears least interested in continuing. Some critics
argue that Purple Moon's strong focus on research proved no
substitute for more nimble business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a criticism that Ms. Laurel acknowledged in her keynote
address to the Computer Game Developer's Conference in San Jose,
Calif., on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised to talk to you about some approaches to research
and design that will help us grow both our audiences and our
ideas,'' she said, addressing the pony-tails-and-sneakers crowd in
a green print dress, horn-rimmed glasses and sensible shoes. ``But
since Purple Moon did not make it to the big IPO or a lavish
acquisition that made everybody rich, it would be understandable
for you to conclude that the methods I'm advocating don't
necessarily work.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. Laurel _ who said she had spent the last few
weeks answering e-mail from parents and girls distraught at the
news that Purple Moon was no more _ blamed tough competition, bad
timing and perhaps unrealistic expectations by her private
investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fundamental disagreement over how the company
should be valued,'' said Ms. Laurel, a board member and the
company's vice president for design.
</P>
<P>
   Purple Moon had been seeking a buyer since the board decided
last fall that a public stock offering was out of reach, she said.
Even so, she said she was surprised when the investors, including
Institutional Venture Partners of Menlo Park, Calif., and the
investment banker Allen &AMP; Co. gave up, in part because she believed
that the deal being discussed with Mattel could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Laurel and Ms. Deyo now say that they should have
considered exit strategies sooner. But others close to the company
criticized Ms. Laurel's grasp of business.
</P>
<P>
   David Liddle, chairman of both Interval and Purple Moon, said:
``Did Interval make a lot of money from this? No, I was
disappointed. We had hoped the company would be big and successful
on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its business failings, Ms. Laurel suggests, Purple Moon
may have helped broaden girls' attitudes toward technology and the
software industry's attitude about girls and technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data, the market for girls' CD-ROM titles grew
38 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel says it will soon offer a line of interactive products
that includes Barbie, a series based on American girls in different
historical periods, and Rockett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have created value,'' Ms. Laurel said. ``It would
have been nice to have created enough value to send my kids to
college. But I certainly got an education.''

 COMPETITION INTENSIFIES IN TRACKING WEB SURFERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Knowing what Web sites surfers visit and for how long is crucial to
advertisers. Competition to measure that behavior intensifies
Monday as Nielsen/NetRatings, a partnership between the television
ratings giant and a local Web company, goes live with its tracking
service.
</P>
<P>
   N/NR will do battle with Media Metrix, a New York company with
three years of Web audience tracking under its belt. Media Metrix
has about 300 clients _ advertisers and Web sites that want to know
how they rank _ and a very large panel of computer users _ about
40,000 individuals whose every digital move is monitored.
</P>
<P>
   N/NR combines the sampling expertise of Nielsen Media Research
of Westport, Conn., and the Web skills of NetRatings, a Milpitas
company that used to be No.3 in the market, trailing Media Metrix
and Relevant Knowledge, which merged with Media Metrix late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen last fall jettisoned its own Web measurement system
before it was launched to join forces with NetRatings. Today, NNR
has 50 clients and a panel of 9,000, which it hopes to expand to
12,000 by May.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While tracking Web surfers' behavior may seem an obscure
pastime, audience-measuring services are actually a crucial piece
of the Internet formula because so many Web sites are underwritten
by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Web currently attracts only about 2 percent of U.S. ad
dollars _ or about $2 billion projected for this year. Advertisers
say uncertainty about who their ads reach is a primary obstacle to
greater Web spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audience measurement is, no question, the bedrock of an
ad-supported Internet medium,'' said Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, a trade association. ``Getting it
right is one of the industry's top priorities _ and we still have a
ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NIELSEN2 (74150 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Media Metrix and N/NR each have distinct strengths and
weaknesses, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Both services recruit panels that are representative of the
wired population. Participants initially provide information about
themselves, such as their age, income, address, hobbies and
vacation habits. Then software is installed on their computers to
track their digital travels. &UR;  &LR; That way advertisers can see which
sites are attracting, for example, male teenagers who live in the
Midwest or golfers who make at least $100,000 a year. Advertisers
rely on such information in all media, including television, radio
and newspapers, to help decide where to place ads. Web publishers
use the data to find out who their visitors are and to attract
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether both companies will ultimately survive is anybody's
guess. Here are some key differences between them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Media Metrix boasts a massive consumer panel, which it claims
allows measurement of 15,000 Web sites with some measure of
statistical accuracy. The corresponding number for N/NR is several
hundred, said Tim Meadows, a vice president at NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of tracking smaller sites is a subject of
debate. &UR;  &LR; ``Even 12,000 (panelists) isn't a lot for an online sample
because the audience is so fragmented'' that a larger sample is
needed to project activity at sites with few visitors, said Jim
Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation. ``I would
guess you'd need sample sizes of 40,000 to 50,000'' to get a broad
picture of Web activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research, said small
sites are largely irrelevant to advertisers. The 25 most popular
sites garner 60 percent of Web ad revenues, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts raise questions about Media Metrix's
sampling methodology since it combines data from two different
panels that are tracked in two different ways _ the former Relevant
Knowledge group and the original Media Metrix panel. ``People
really interested in methodological purity have some problems with
that,'' said Nail.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Ann Packo, Media Metrix president, said the data mesh
perfectly because both use the same ``clickstream'' method that
reveals when people click and where they go.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; -- N/NR receives results from its panel in real time, which
allows quick turnaround of reports. That's handy for measuring Web
activity related to specific events, like the Super Bowl or the
release of the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Media Metrix collects real-time data only from its former
Relevant Knowledge panel. Data from the original Media Metrix group
is sent to the company on disks at the end of each month, although
Media Metrix wants to speed up the information gathering, Packo
said.
</P>
<P>
   -- N/NR's greatest advantage is its ability to track viewing of
banner ads, said Nail. Web advertisers are eager to find out where
their competitors are putting their Web ad dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   N/NR employs a proprietary technology to count the total number
of banner ads in a given campaign and the performance of individual
ads. It can track who saw the banners and who clicked on them.
Media Metrix does a very limited amount of banner analysis. ``To
me, this is sort of the trump card N/NR can play,'' said Nail.
</P>
<P>
   -- About 5,000 people in Media Metrix's sample are tracked at
work as well as home whereas N/NR tracks activity only on home
computers. The work side is critical because up to half of surfing
time occurs at work, said Nail.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of NIELSEN2 (74150 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  N/NR is working with employers and industry groups to get
permission to monitor work computers _ something many employers are
leery of, said Manish Bhatia, vice president of interactive
services with Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; -- Media Metrix can track what users see on ``offline''
services such as PointCast, which uses push technology, as well as
online movement. N/NR tracks only the Web, although it has begun
doing some limited monitoring of America Online's members-only
system.
</P>
<P>
   -- While not very relevant today, N/NR will have a significant
leg up when the Web and television merge into the same box because
of Nielsen's TV ratings system, said Spaeth. ``It's a huge
advantage to them,'' although WebTV isn't expected to be
commonplace for five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   -- Media Metrix comes to the table with the status of an
industry leader. Its list of top Web sites is frequently cited in
the media and it already has relationships with hundreds of
heavy-hitting clients.
</P>
<P>
   N/NR points out that Arbitron was the original TV audience
tracker but has ceded the job to Nielsen. With the Web, an infant
medium, the competitive situation is even more fluid.
</P>
<P>
   -- Media Metrix is expected to go public next month, which will
give it access to more capital. Like many Web companies it is
focused on growth and has never posted a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, a $402 million public company with 1998 profits of
$48.8 million, has the option of supporting its Internet division
with funds from its established operations. That could be an
advantage in the event of a protracted, expensive battle for market
share, although Bhatia said N/NR intends to become profitable as
soon as possible.

T he blooms of spring, a source of joy for most of us, also fill
the air with pollen, causing stuffy noses and wheezy lungs for the
millions of people who suffer from hay fever and asthma.
</P>

   Those who dread the onset of the sneezing season might breath
easier in a few years, if biotech firms succeed in current efforts
to create a new class of drugs to nip hay fever and asthmatic

   These potential remedies aim to go beyond today's antihistamine
pills, nasal sprays and steroid inhalers _ which treat hay fever
and asthma symptoms _ to attack the root causes of a body's
overreaction to pollen.
</P>
<P>
   But don't empty your medicine cabinets yet. Genentech Inc., the
company furthest along in developing these new hay fever blockers,
still has a huge hurdle to clear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Each month for the rest of the year, scientists working with
the South San Francisco biotech giant must inject some 1,100 hay
fever and asthma patients with a compound known as anti-IgE.
</P>
<P>
   If these test injections safely reduce hay fever and asthma
attacks, Genentech will seek Food and Drug Administration approval
next year to sell its new drug _ presumably under a catchier name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Other experimental asthma drugs from biotech firms like
Seattle's Immunex Corp. are just beginning human tests, so they are
even further away from proving their safety and usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech firms have huge incentives to attack these respiratory
ailments. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology
says 40 million of us suffer from allergic rhinitis, commonly known
as hay fever. Another 14 million Americans are afflicted with
asthma, a chronic swelling of the airways that can cause shortness
of breath _ with severe asthma attacks often triggered by hay fever
fits.
</P>
<P>
   Americans with hay fever and asthma spent roughly $6 billion
last year on prescription drugs to help them breath easier,
according to IMS Health Research.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Boushey, director of the University of California at San
Francisco's Asthma Research Center, has helped Genentech test its
anti-IgE compound on human volunteers. Boushey explained how the
drug tries to interrupt the hay fever cycle that can go on to
trigger asthma attacks.
</P>
<P>
   TRIGGERS IMMUNE SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   It all begins when pollen enters the nose, eyes or lungs. For
reasons not completely understood, in people who are allergy-prone,
the presence of invading pollen triggers the immune system to
produce extra amounts of an antibody known as IgE.
</P>
<P>
   As Boushey described it, IgE is a double agent in the war on
pollen. On the upside, IgE is one of several antibodies that sweep
free-floating pollen particles out of the bloodstream. That's good.
</P>
<P>
   But some IgE also binds to a certain type of cell _ called a
mast cell _ found in the mucosal lining of our airways. When this
``grounded'' IgE captures a pollen particle, it becomes a turncoat.
IgE and the pollen particle team up to trigger the mast cell to
release histamines and other chemicals associated with hay fever
and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Umetsu, chief allergy and immunology researcher at Stanford
University, said the IgE-pollen-mast cell reaction amounts to an
immune system false alarm. Scientists think the histamine in mast
cells is meant to kill invading parasitic worms, not to attack
relatively harmless pollen that could be swept out by other bodily
defenses as simple as phlegm.
</P>
<P>
   RELEASING HISTAMINES
</P>
<P>
   But in people with allergies, IgE overproduction releases
histamines, whose effects can range from mild sneezing to serious
asthmatic attacks that can _ as happens over 5,000 times a year _
actually lead to death.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech is taking a deceptively simple approach to breaking
the allergy/asthma cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In the current trials, researchers will give patients monthly
shots of anti-IgE, a protein designed to seek out and bind to IgE
in the bloodstream. Robert Fick, Genentech's senior project
scientist, said the idea is to sop up the excess IgE before it can
land on a mast cell, team up with a pollen and cause a histamine
eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Can IgE be removed from the body safely?''
Fick said. He hopes the tests will show that when anti-IgE
neutralizes excess IgE, other immune system agents _ the body has
backups for everything _ step in to remove pollen without IgE's
negative side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's trial, which it is conducting with the help of the
Swiss drug firm Novartis and privately held Tanox Biosystems, is
designed with FDA regulators in mind. To win approval for the new
drug, Genentech must prove that anti-IgE's mopping-up action
greatly reduces the number and intensity of allergic or asthmatic
attacks in test patients.
</P>
<P>
   To amass this comparative data, Genentech will give half its
1,100 test patients a placebo. Neither the scientists nor the
patients know whether their monthly shots are the drug or the
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Genentech will compare the two groups _ those
with the placebo and those with anti-IgE _ and hope the data show
that the anti-IgE cohort had half as many allergy or asthma attacks
as the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech would also like to show that patients treated with
anti-IgE made less use of inhaled steroids and other asthma drugs,
which can have their own side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with both sets of data _ proof that anti-IgE works and
that it reduces use of other medicines _ Genentech could make the
strongest case for FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While Genentech is nearing the end of its test process,
Immunex is just beginning human trials on a drug that seeks to stop
the asthma reaction even earlier _ by disabling IL4, another immune
system protein, which plays a role in producing IgE.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Leung, editor of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology in Denver, explained that IL4 is one of the chemicals
that is released when our immune system detects pollen inside the
body. Immunex intends to neutralize IL4 before it can stimulate the
production of IgE, heading off the allergic and asthmatic cascade
at an even earlier point.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex has so far only completed Phase I trials of its anti-IL4
drug, which it calls Nuvance. Those studies merely establish that
it seems safe to administer Nuvance to human subjects. An Immunex
spokesman said the company hopes to soon begin second-stage tests,
commending the long process of establishing whether or not Nuvance
helps control asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier still in the development cycle, privately held Rigel
Inc. is doing lab tests into the most fundamental level of the
allergy cycle. Don Payan, chief scientist at the South San
Francisco biotech startup, said scientists don't understand what
internal signals prompt immune system cells to make proteins like
IL4 or IgE.
</P>
<P>
   Rigel is trying to peer inside cells in the hopes of finding the
switch that can turn off the creation of such asthma-triggering
chemicals before they enter the bloodstream _ so we wouldn't need
other drugs like anti-IgE or Nuvance to perform their
search-and-destroy missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how biomedical discovery works,'' Payan said. ``Every
new advance creates a deeper understanding, and points to a new
drug strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Engelberg, who follows biotech finance for AmeriCal
Securities in San Francisco, said he doesn't pay too much attention
to scientific optimism until new drugs are almost ready for
pharmacists' shelves. He said it's still too early to estimate the
potential revenues of Genentech's anti-IgE, much less the earlier
stage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But even if anti-IgE makes it to market, Engelberg questions
Genentech's marketing spiel. Genentech suggests consumers will find
rolling up their sleeves for a monthly shot of anti-IgE more
convenient than taking three to five pills and inhaled medications
each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most patients, given their druthers, would rather take
a pill or inhaler than a shot,'' Engelberg said. That would limit
use of anti-IgE to the sickest asthma patients, rather than the
larger group of hay fever sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pamela Reed of Hayward is living proof that some people
would willingly brave a monthly needle to be freed from dependence
on a daily regime of pills, sprays and inhalers.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 36, has suffered from allergy and asthma all her life.
Christmas is usually her worst season, because she's allergic to
pine. She recalls that it was during the holidays when she took
part in one of the earlier anti-IgE studies conducted by UCSF's
Boushey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't tell me at the time whether I got the drug or
the placebo, but I was sure I got the anti-IgE,'' Reed said. ``Even
my husband noticed that my asthma didn't act up that winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who afterwards learned she was indeed part of the drugged
cohort, is hopeful that the final tests lead to approval.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I would gladly take the shot,'' she said.

 HOW ALLERGY SUFFERERS CAN EASE THEIR PAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
In a couple of years, bioscience may create new drugs that can stop
allergies before the first sneeze. That's scant comfort during hay
fever season, but meanwhile there are steps allergy sufferers can
take to minimize or ward off problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Goldsobel, allergy doctor and president of the Northern
California Chapter of the Allergy and Asthma Foundation, had these
tips for hay fever and asthma sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Use air filtration system to limit exposure to indoor pollen.
Be pollen-aware when outdoors by using the National Allergy Bureau
Web site (www.aaaai.org/nab) to get daily pollen and mold counts.
</P>
<P>
   -- For serious conditions consult a physician. They can
prescribe new antihistamines, without the drowsy effects of older
remedies, and lung-opening inhalers. The American Academy of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) in Milwaukee, Wis., offers
free 24-hour physician referral at (800) 822-2762.
</P>
<P>
   -- The American Lung Association in New York is another source
of hay fever and asthma news. Reach it by phone at (800) 586-4872
or on the Web at www.lungusa.org _ and sign up for the Breathe Easy
Asthma Digest, a monthly e-mail newsletter.

FAB 400 SERIES LINKS MARKETERS TO POPULAR CULTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Beatles came to America, they were dubbed the Fab Four.
Thirty-five years later, an elaborate marketing and promotional
program centered on popular culture is being called the Fab 400.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the program is actually conflation, bringing
together advertisers and retailers seeking to associate themselves
with the growing American appetite for everything related to
entertainment, from celebrity biographies to box-office results to
awards shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about connecting with consumers through movies, music,
television and entertainers,'' said Michael J. Kelly, publisher at
Entertainment Weekly magazine in New York, ``looking at what has
shaped popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fab 400 is a project of Entertainment Weekly, part of the
Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., focusing on what its editors
consider to be the popular culture milestones of the 1950s through
1990s. At the center of the program are four themed issues of the
magazine, which will be supplemented by features on Entertainment
Weekly sites on the World Wide Web (www.ew.com and www.fab400.com)
and related television programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see more people tying into the passion for pop culture to
reach the consumer,'' said Fred O. Nelson, vice president for
marketing and promotion at Entertainment Weekly, particularly ``the
young, urban entertainment junkie who buys the CD the week it's
released and sees the movie the weekend it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing executives at the magazine assert that such a culture
vulture is also on the cutting edge of consumerism _ likely to be,
as Nelson put it, ``the first to test-drive a new car, buy a new
fashion, try a new fragrance.''
</P>
<P>
   One marketer agreeing with that assessment is the Ford Motor Co.
Its Mercury brand of vehicles is a lead advertiser of the Fab 400,
both in the pages of the magazine and as the sole sponsor of an
online reader poll on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment is highly relevant to the Mercury target we call
the individualists, the people who paddle their own canoe,'' said
Ian Beavis, marketing communications manager for the Lincoln
Mercury division of Ford in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the opposite of all the other millennium proposals
that crossed our desks,'' he added, referring to programs from
other magazines related to 20th-century achievement and history.
``We didn't have one person not say it was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   (How far the Mercury marque makes it into the next millennium
may be under discussion at Ford. USA Today reported on Friday that
after Ford recently announced plans to discontinue selling most
Mercury cars in Canada, automotive industry analysts suggested a
similar fate awaited the brand in the United States. Ford said the
Canadian cutback was not related to marketing plans for this
country.)
</P>
<P>
   The retail partner for the Fab 400 described the initial results
of the program as ``tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a true pop culture synergy going on,'' said Christos
Garkinos, vice president for marketing and product management in
Los Angeles for the Virgin Entertainment Group unit of Virgin
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin Megastore chain is promoting merchandise that can be
linked to the content of the four Fab 400 issues. For instance, in
connection with the first issue, published last month and devoted
to ``the 100 greatest moments in television,'' there were special
displays in the stores featuring tapes of television programs,
music from television soundtracks and books devoted to television
series like ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The next issue of the Fab 400, due on May 28, will present ``the
100 defining moments in music.'' The movie issue is planned for
Sept. 24 and the one on ``the 100 greatest entertainers'' for Nov.
8. Each issue will have a rate base, the circulation guaranteed to
advertisers, of 1.55 million, 8.8 percent higher than the regular
Entertainment Weekly rate base of 1.425 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said some of the marketers in addition to Mercury that
had agreed to run ads were the Disney Channel unit of Walt Disney
Co., Hershey Foods Corp., the MTV and VH1 cable networks owned by
Viacom Inc., Philip Morris Cos. and Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   As for the television tie-ins with the Fab 400, there is a
commitment from MTV for a music program in May, Nelson said, adding
that there are discussions with the TNT cable network, which like
Entertainment Weekly is part of Time Warner, for a show tied to the
entertainers issue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Fab Four will be part of the Fab 400?

 &HT;    BALLOONISTS, BACK ON EARTH, SPEAK OF IDEAL LIFE IN THE CLOUDS
 &HT;    670&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ A day after they flew into history with the first
nonstop balloon trip around the world, Bertrand Piccard and Brian
Jones tried Sunday to explain the meaning of their voyage.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 21 days dangling miles above Earth in a small
capsule, they were entitled to some high-flown rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   For Piccard, the philosophical Swiss psychiatrist and scion of a
line of adventurers, the rigorous journey was a ``metaphor for
life'' _ about confronting the fear of the unknown and accepting
forces that cannot be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip had set, Piccard said, an ideal example of man's
place in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not nature on one side and human beings trying to
make an advantage on the other side,'' he explained. ``There is no
separation between technology and ecology. There is a harmony, and
we lived 21 days in that harmony. It was absolutely beautiful, and
this is also something we want to share with you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jones, a no-nonsense British balloon pilot, the trip was the
ultimate expression his craft. He noted that a balloon
circumnavigation of the globe has been sought since long before
there were airplanes, and long after all the feats of winged
aviation had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the ultimate challenge for a balloon pilot,'' he
said. ``To anybody who would say it is frivolous, I would say you
simply don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Both appeared in good health, but tired. It had been a long day
for Jones, a 51-year-old grandfather, and Piccard, a 41-year-old
father of three girls.
</P>
<P>
   The pair completed a full trip around the globe over western
Africa on Saturday. They touched down early Sunday in the
southwestern Egyptian desert at dawn, when their 9-ton craft could
avoid the troubling winds that build as the desert day heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Steered by the winds to a remote area, they tried to set down
near one of the few roads in southwestern Egypt. But when they hit
the desert surface, ice that formed during the craft's
high-altitude flight broke free, and the balloon ``bounced'' 500
feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   It bounced again on a second approach, then landed smoothly, two
hours later than planned and on a hard-to-reach plateau about 300
miles southwest of Cairo, near the sparsely populated oasis region
of Dakhla.
</P>
<P>
   Though the balloon quickly deflated and lay on the ground, the
wind grabbed it and pulled the gondola nearly on its side. Piccard
and Jones cut holes in it to let the wind pass through.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to sleep, but ice water dripping into the gondola
kept Piccard awake. Both men washed their hair with leftover water
from their trip, and passed time contemplating the ancient deserts
in which their high-tech craft had deposited them.
</P>
<P>
   The rocky terrain thwarted a ground recovery by their chase
team, and roughly six hours after their landing, an Egyptian army
helicopter picked up the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it was fitting that they would be totally alone for
the first hours after emerging from the 18-foot-long metal capsule
they had shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see absolutely nothing on any horizon, and it just
seemed right somehow,'' he said. ``We had time to collect our
thoughts, to get ourselves together.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard said, ``It is incredible how well you can feel when you
are in front of emptiness, because you are really in front of
yourself,'' he said much later at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   And, the pair felt pretty good about themselves. They had
floated 29,056 miles since taking off from the Swiss Alps on March
1 on the third attempt sponsored by Swiss watchmaker Breitling.
</P>
<P>
   Though the trip cost untold millions of dollars _ the sponsor
refuses to disclose the costs _ the pair will receive a $1 million
prize from the Anheuser Busch brewing giant. Half will be donated
to a charity, and the two will divide the other $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   They said it won't be the money that will leave the biggest mark
on their lives. Piccard says he feels closer to God, thanks to the
``invisible hand'' that guided their craft.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The balloon crew withstood foul air and 45-degree temperatures
as their sealed pressurized cabin sailed in the swift jet stream
winds 30,000 feet above the planet. Piccard and Jones said they
alternately shored up each others' spirits during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   They had a third passenger _ a teddy bear named ``Sean'' given
to them by an airline crew member. Jones took a couple of books he
never had time to open. They listened to compact discs, including
the score to Les Miserables and selections from Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard said the trip's worst period was over the Gulf of
Mexico, when they were sick and considered stopping because the air
currents had stalled. But they climbed to higher altitudes and
caught winds that moved them at more than 100 miles an hour across
the Atlantic and to their goal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the two never exchanged a ``cross word.'' Piccard
came to tears a couple times as he met with reporters at an air
base immediately after their recovery.
</P>
<P>
   He would later describe their 21 days as ``paradise,'' but noted
that many of the countries they passed over were far from peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really heartbreaking to think that while we were having
so much pleasure there were people suffering on the ground,''
Piccard said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he looks forward to his place in the history books
and expects to get ``15 minutes'' as a hero at home in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of their new celebrity, the pair faced a gantlet of
photographers and well-wishers as they entered the Swissotel/El
Salam(cq) Hotel in Cairo on Sunday night. A quartet, in robes and
turbans, played traditional Arab music at the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Noble, the flight controller who had flown to Egypt on
Saturday after directing the voyage from a control tower at the
Geneva Airport, tried to explain how the trip played on people's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the troubles in the world, Kosovo and such, here's a
story people can really like,'' he said, looking sunburnt from four
hours of trying to approach the balloon by car in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Egyptian army to take another helicopter trip out
to the desert in order to recover the huge balloon and gondola,
which was left tilted on its side on rocky, hilly terrain that no
truck could cross.
</P>
<P>
   In the land of the pyramids and the Sphinx, he noted that
Egyptians are expert at recovering historic artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there,'' he said, ``is a historic artifact.''

SHAQ IS KIND TO ORLANDO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Shaquille O'Neal's much-anticipated annual return to
the city he once dismissed as ``a dried-up little pond'' was
supposed to be another hate-fest, but turned into a shocking
display of nothing but peace, love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   There were no taunts directed to the sellout crowd of 17,248, no
postgame crowing session after beating his old team 115-104, and
shockingly, not a single unkind word about the city that loves to
hate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the hell can I dislike the whole (bleeping) city? That
don't make no sense,'' O'Neal said afterward, abandoning his
formerly spiteful stance. ``It's a beautiful city, the people here
are beautiful, but we all do things in life. I don't regret what I
did three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago'' being the July 1996 day he decided to pack
up his dunks and rap lyrics, and head to Hollywood and the promise
of $121 million from the Lakers. O'Neal, a the No. 1 draft pick in
1992 and the Magic's franchise player for four years, still has a
home here but has taken plenty of potshots at the city and team in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   And the city has fired back. Last year the fans booed lustily
and the public address system cranked tunes aimed at him such as
``Lies, Lies, Lies'' and ``Money Changes Everything.'' The Magic
won that game, and former teammate Nick Anderson openly mocked
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The booing was less frequent this time, as O'Neal scored 16
first-half points, and anti-Shaq signs were few.
</P>
<P>
   ``No human can hurt my feelings by what they say or by what they
write or by what they show on TV,'' O'Neal said. ``Nobody can hurt
my feelings. The reason they boo me is because they respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing special in the win?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good win for us, I'm glad we won,'' he said. ``I'm
glad to see my old friends in some of the media, some of the
organization, some on the team. . . . All that stuff that happened
three years ago, I forgot about it a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper, who played for the Magic last season, said he
sensed the win meant a little more than O'Neal let on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wants to do well against this team,'' he said.
``He obviously was a huge piece of what they wanted to do as a
basketball team and a franchise, and he left. You have to move on
in life. That can't linger. It's a business and you deal with it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: J.R. Reid did not play for the first time in six
games since joining the Lakers and was reported to have a swollen
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The injury could pave the way for an anticipated move _ the
activation of rookie guard Tyronn Lue from the injured list. The
Lakers are overloaded on forwards again with the return of Dennis
Rodman but are carrying only four guards on the active roster.

ST. JOHN'S LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, WITH OR WITHOUT ARTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyrone Grant had finally poked his head out of the tent of
towels he had constructed in his despair after St. John's lost the
South Regional final to Ohio State, 77-74, on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Erick Barkley weeping beside him, Grant, the team jester,
now speaking in a whisper, was able to put this season in
perspective: ``I'm very happy the young guys got this experience.
Going into the season, they'll know how good they can be. As long
as Coach Jarvis doesn't change a thing, I don't see anything but
success for the young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis' Red Storm played perhaps its worst game of the
season Saturday night in Knoxville, Tenn., beaten in the backcourt
and intimidated in the frontcourt by Ohio State. It was a terrible
way for a terrific season to end.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody had expected the Red Storm to get within a few
seconds of the Final Four. St. John's did not appear in any
preseason polls, and there were plenty of questions about how
quickly the players, some of whom had considered leaving after Fran
Fraschilla was fired as coach, would take to Jarvis. During the
search for Fraschilla's replacement, Ron Artest, who would become
the focal point of the team, said he hoped the school would not
hire a knucklehead.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. Even though Jarvis told his players on their first
day of practice that he agreed they could win a championship, he
knew that realistically it would be at least two years, and
probably three or four more players, before this sort of run was
possible. So despite the devastation in the locker room over the
mental mistakes that cost St. John's a rematch with Connecticut in
the national semifinal, this season was a resounding success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged to know that old-fashioned things like
teamwork and fundamentals and hard work still pay off,'' Jarvis
said. ``What you learn when you coach kids is that anything can
happen. Until they get to the point where they're older and more
mature, they're not going to get to the point of being consistent
every night. They're amateurs, and sometimes they are made to play
like amateurs. There's always a chance you're going to revert back
to old habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes will be made for next season, but by failing to make the
Final Four, St. John's may have averted a personnel switch it does
not want: Jarvis, who has never denied his interest in a NBA job,
was already being mentioned for a pro position. That talk will
probably cool for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Jarvis will get Anthony Glover, who was
academically ineligible this season. Glover is a 6-foot-5-inch
forward so tough that Jarvis said of him, ``If Anthony Glover plays
Saturday, we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Ohio State center Ken Johnson, Jarvis added,
``After he blocked that first shot, Anthony would have put him 10
rows up, and he would have been looking over his shoulder the rest
of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis needs more depth. The bench gave him just seven points
against the Buckeyes. He needs a defensive stopper at guard, which
was obvious when Michael Redd scored 20 points for the Buckeyes. He
would like a big man, because he views the 6-10 signee Jack
Wolfinger as more of a long-term investment, and because 6-9 Carlos
Boozer, one of the top recruits in the country, is also considering
Duke and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   He would like a backup to Barkley, a splendid guard whom Jarvis
will be lucky to keep around beyond next season. And Jarvis talks
of the need to improve the attitude and maturity of the team. Some
little-used players will almost certainly be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fate of Artest hangs over all this. His abysmal
performance against Ohio State showed why his game would benefit
from at least one more year in college. Artest had just nine points
and played only 11 minutes of the first half after picking up two
quick fouls and committing five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   He played as if his mind were elsewhere, and it most likely
already is. After the game, Artest said the chances were 50-50 that
he would take his versatile but immature game to the NBA draft this
summer. But almost nobody believes he will return to St. John's,
especially because some scouts peg him as a lottery pick. Artest,
who has cited his desire to help his family as a prime factor in
his decision, said he would take a few days to think it over.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jarvis' job may be easier next season even if Artest leaves.
Artest is a huge talent, but he has also shown flashes of
hardheadedness and selfishness that have irritated his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he will get some spiritual guidance as well as
monetary guidance before he makes the decision,'' Jarvis said.
``Whatever he decides to do, St. John's will continue to grow and
get better. It would be a tremendous loss, but if we're going to
build a great program, we're going to suffer great losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Artest's decision, the standard for success has been
raised sharply. A tournament run this year was a gleeful surprise.
Next season, it will be a requirement. This year, St. John's
players were alone in thinking they belonged in the Final Four.
Next year, the crowd of expectations will close in.

DECIPHERING HITLER AND THE NATION THAT NURTURED HIM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ian Kershaw was hard to miss. He was the one walking
around the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan with a picture of Hitler.
OK, it was an early photograph and it was on the cover of his new
book, ``Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris'' (W.W. Norton), but anyway, he
stood out.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, Kershaw, professor of modern history at the
University of Sheffield in England, has spent the last decade in
the shadow of Hitler, whom he calls ``the most central figure of
our century, possibly the most central figure of all.''
</P>
<P>
   A result, the first half of a two-volume biography that seeks to
demythologize Hitler and re-examine the environment from which he
sprang, has been received warmly by scholars and critics on both
sides of the Atlantic. Kershaw was in New York recently to
publicize his book, the first Hitler biography to make full use of
the diaries of Josef Goebbels, which were recently discovered in
Moscow. Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, portrays a
formative Hitler prone to bumbling and vacillation.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times Book Review Walter Reich, a former
director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, praised Kershaw's
``masterly analysis'' and said he ``successfully illuminates the
strange and at times ecstatic dance in which Hitler and Germany
engaged as his power grew.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was it like to live so long in the company of a
repulsive figure who, in Kershaw's words, ``has not the slightest
attractive feature?''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, he said in the sonorous northern burr of his native
Manchester, he approached his task as the medieval historian he has
long been, with an eye to exhaustive research and detached
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   On the other he was dealing with Hitler. ``That does grab hold
of you,'' he said. ``The moral dimension really does intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   What finally overwhelmed him, he said, were the personal tales
of anguish. He was going through the large Jewish archival
collection in a Vienna library, reading account after account of
family torments, when he felt ``almost physically nauseated and had
to go outside for a breath of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   He posed the next logical question: ``Numerous people said, `For
goodness sake, why are you working on this? It's so horrible. Why
not work on the Renaissance or papal history?' But it always struck
me it was of such vital importance to the 20th century.'' He
continued, ``This is not very long ago, and yet it seems to be on
another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   His detour from medieval history began almost 30 years ago when
he began learning German to read monastic records for a planned
work on peasant protests in medieval Europe. In 1972 he found
himself in Grafing outside Munich where, on a rainy Sunday
afternoon, he stopped at a cafe and fell into conversation with one
of the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to talking about the 30s,'' Kershaw recalled. ``I said
it must have been a bad time. He said, `Best times we ever had.'
Then he said: `You English, you missed the real chance here. You
should have come in the war with us. Together we would have
defeated the Bolsheviks and conquered the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw said he was trying to contain his astonishment when the
man blurted, ``The Jew is a louse.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode, he said, made him ponder what had gone on in that
little town and in Germany as a whole. He joined a research project
on Bavaria under the Nazis, studying the grass roots of German
society while scholarly debate was polarizing around the question
of Hitler's centrality. Was he the only one who mattered in the
Third Reich? Or, at the other extreme, was he a weak dictator
carried along by outside forces?
</P>
<P>
   There were many other questions, Kershaw said. Given Germany's
problems after World War I, it was not surprising that a strongman
would emerge. But how did a rank outsider like Hitler, with no
apparent talents beyond rabble-rousing in Munich beer halls, even
get close to the corridors of power?
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1918 nobody sees or listens to him,'' Kershaw said.
``Then suddenly, as he says, `I can speak,' he finds he's got a
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``The answer is to be found more in the changed
circumstances in German society following the lost war and
revolution than it is in Hitler's personal attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's supposed physical abnormalities and sexual proclivities
interest him far less than they did, say, Ron Rosenbaum, in his
book, ``Explaining Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a character, who knows?'' Kershaw said of Hitler's
reputed penchant for masochism. ``I suppose it's possible.''
Efforts to document these and other such accounts proved fruitless.
``I searched worldwide for a picture of Hitler in the bathtub with
Eva Braun and failed to find it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most lurid stories about Hitler turn out to be shakily
sourced or spread by Hitler's enemies, Kershaw said. If Hitler was
masochistic or had unusual sexual tastes, ``what would it explain
about the development of the Third Reich?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no point in searching for the moment when Hitler
became Hitler, Kershaw said. It was a process, a cursed confluence
of the man and his times. Hitler came close to getting killed or
sidetracked on innumerable occasions before he led the world to
bloodshed, Kershaw said, but each time, to the world's colossal
misfortune, fate contrived to save him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck of the devil,'' said Kershaw.
</P>
<P>
   Stories that Hitler had Jewish forebears, spread by the
condemned Hans Frank at Nuremberg, do not stand up, Kershaw said,
distancing himself as well from other sources he called dubious,
including Herman Rauschning's ``Hitler Speaks'' and the
``table-talk'' monologues supposedly transcribed in Hitler's
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hitler's deep hatred of Jews almost certainly did not
stem from any single encounter, as Hitler claimed in ``Mein
Kampf,'' but rather from associating Jews with the ``November
criminals'' who supposedly cost Germany World War I and plunged
Munich into chaotic Socialist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scholars, Kershaw found no directive or utterance
from Hitler ordering the Final Solution, the extermination of the
Jews. ``Hitler never spoke, as far as we can tell, even in private,
about specific killing,'' he said. ``He spoke always in grandiose
terms, horrific but generalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kershaw said he found an intriguing entry in Heinrich
Himmler's desk diary, which came to light in Moscow only after the
fall of Communism. In an entry recording a private meeting with
Hitler on Dec. 18, 1941, Himmler, the SS chief, wrote ``Jewish
question'' on one side of the page and on the other, ``Jews to be
rooted out as partisans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings him as close as anything you're going to find, I
guess,'' Kershaw said. The disclosure is reported in the
biography's second volume, to be released next year.  &QL; 
(MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Why was the viciously anti-Semitic Hitler so careful to distance
himself from the slaughter? He was secretive by nature, Kershaw
said, but his rationale remains a mystery. Perhaps in an odd way,
he said, Hitler feared the Jews as more powerful even than the
Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   The hazards of putting incriminating words on paper, moreover,
became clear to Hitler after he was maneuvered into personally
authorizing the euthanasia program in 1939. When the Roman Catholic
Church later questioned the killings, he was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Kershaw, there was almost certainly no
Hitlerian Rosetta stone to be unearthed, despite new material about
the SS and killing squads likely to emerge from the former Soviet
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   If Hitler is a biographer's biggest challenge, he will probably
always remain so, a ``black hole'' to scholars, Kershaw said.
``Outside of his politics, he doesn't exist really.''
</P>
<P>
   The biographer himself has few memories of the war. Born in 1943
in Oldham, outside Manchester, he and his family largely were
spared suffering, although a few stray German V-1 rockets destined
for Manchester landed on Oldham.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has graphic descriptions,'' he said. ``I'm in her
arms, there's the whine as the engine cuts out and then a crash.
I've dreamed of it. In my dream it's as if I'm there, but it's only
because she told me about it.''

LACK OF A POINT GUARD COSTS CONNECTICUT A TRIP TO THE FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Although top-seeded Connecticut was favored to win
the Mideast Regional and advance to the Final Four, Iowa State had
one thing that the talent-rich Huskies did not _ a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a great point guard is essential to being really good
in this tournament,'' UConn coach Geno Auriemma said, following his
team's 64-58 loss to the Cyclones on Saturday night in the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Cyclones had that floor leader in Stacy Frese.
The junior guard scored 16 points, had five assists and was almost
flawless in the closing minutes at the Shoemaker Center. The
Cyclones hit five of their final seven 3-point attempts in the
closing minutes to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut finished the season at 29-5 after a 15-0 start. The
Huskies' struggles date to late December, when freshman point guard
Sue Bird tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. At
the time, the Huskies were 8-0. Since then, they often relied on
their two best scorers, Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea Ralph, to
handle the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the pair struggle running the offense in the
halfcourt, but the burden of handling the ball disrupted their
scoring responsibilities. The pressure on Abrosimova and Ralph was
most apparent on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph was 2-of-12 from the field and 0-of-9 from 3-point range.
Abrosimova missed 16 of her 19 shots, including 7-of-8 3-pointers.
She also committed seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different every night,'' said Ralph when asked who runs
UConn's offense, adding that the team really needed a floor leader.
``Svet and I have such a scorers' mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma played down Bird's injury as a factor in his team's not
advancing. He said his young team, which featured the top freshman
class in the nation, was not mentally prepared for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of younger players who are not quite able to get
over the hump yet, and it's a mental thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, who lose only one key contributor, senior Amy
Duran, figure to be a preseason top three team next season, and
perhaps No. 1. But Auriemma said his team must be more attacking,
more relentless to perform better in the NCAA tournament next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired of people saying how talented our freshman class
is,'' Auriemma said. ``This time of year, nobody cares how talented
you are. People only respond to aggression.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Dennis Rodman returned to the Lakers on Sunday _ a
significant event because he says he considered not returning at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman arrived at 1 a.m. Sunday and just nine hours later
rejoined his teammates, ending an eight-day sabbatical during which
he attended to vague ``personal issues'' and cleared his head at
the craps tables in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problems were, they are resolved for now, and
Rodman said he's back for the duration of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gotta understand that you can't control Dennis Rodman.
He has to make his own decisions,'' Rodman said. ``Everything's
fine. All you guys wanna guess it's this or that, personal
problems, marriage, it had nothing to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to get away, because I didn't know if I really
wanted to play basketball. Even though we won 10 games in a row,
that still wasn't satisfying for me, to go out there and play and
to be snubbed by the NBA. And the lifestyle of being in L.A., I had
to fix that and visualize that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't elaborate. Rodman had complained even before he signed
with the Lakers that the NBA's labor agreement restricted his
income _ to about $12,195 per game or $1 million in a normal,
full-length season.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodman was vague over what prompted his flight, he said
the issues have ``subsided, and I can go out there and just kind of
focus on what I can do. . . . I think people have to understand
this is me. Just let me do what I gotta do and everything will be
all right. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you're a basketball player, you're a human being. And
you've got to take care of that person first. The hell with this
game. This game don't mean anything to me. I'll always be happy as
long as I can keep my head (straight).''
</P>
<P>
   He thought seriously about retiring, but his actress wife,
Carmen Electra, talked him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen told me, `Dennis, go out there, suck it up and do it.
Just do it. I know you love the game,' '' he said. ``She's the only
one who really hasn't pressured me to do anything. She just said,
`I'm behind you 100 percent. If you want to quit, quit. If you
don't, just go out there and win.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were no warm welcome-backs from teammates, just an
acknowledgment that the absence was essentially forgiven, and
everyone was grateful to have his defense and rebounding skills
back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't expecting these guys to come over and shake my hand
or kiss my butt, anything like that,'' Rodman said, and he offered
no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to do that. I won't do that. Actions speak louder
than words. . . . My teammates know I'm gonna go out there and give
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Are teammates forgiving?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``It doesn't do us
any good to harbor ill feelings or resentment or anything like
that. . . . They wish it hadn't happened, but they're all fine with
him coming back and they're happy that he is back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said co-captain Shaquille O'Neal: ``We all said what we had to
say to him, and he said he's gonna be back the rest of the year. He
said he has some personal problems . . . but you just have to
respect the guy, and our organization was gracious enough to let
him go to Vegas and gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said he was fined $700, or $100 per day. The team
initially called the absence ``excused,'' but imposed the fine once
Rodman extended his leave and detoured to Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Another such incident, and the Lakers would probably cut him
loose.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said he was given no ultimatum upon his return but noted:
``I've used up my hall pass. I'll be here for the rest of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Converse has severed its shoe contract with Rodman,
allegedly reneging on a deal to pay him $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Converse wants to kind of screw me and take my money like
everybody else wants to screw me and take my money,'' he said.

JAIME SABINES GUTIERREZ, POPULAR MEXICAN POET, DIES AT 72
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Jaime Sabines Gutierrez, the poet whose lyrical
hymns about desire and loss were embraced and recited by
generations of Mexicans, died at his home here on Friday at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer complicated by infections after a fall in
1989, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he shunned public attention, Sabines was a truly
popular poet. His sometimes melancholy, often wry, occasionally
brutal, but always accessible renderings of the travails of the
heart had special appeal for Mexicans caught between a
tradition-bound culture based on close families and the tumultuous
changes imposed by modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaime Sabines' great accomplishment was his following,'' said
Carlos Monsivais, the culture critic. ``In Mexico he is read, he is
memorized, he is loved.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of the last of the rare readings he gave in his later
years, Sabines drew an overflow crowd in 1996 to the Palacio de
Bellas Artes, the national theater of Mexico. Thousands of his
followers remained in the plaza outside, content simply to hear his
raspy voice on loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sabines avoided conventional intellectual circles. Growing
increasingly conservative, Sabines made a midlife foray into
politics, which put off the largely anti-government intelligentsia.
He served two three-year terms as a federal legislator, in the
mid-1970s and again from 1988 to 1991, representing the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which in practice was Mexico's
government for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, his work was not universally extolled by the
literary class. But in 1983, when Sabines was awarded the National
Prize for Letters, Mexico's highest literary award, Octavio Paz,
the Nobel Prize-winning poet who died last year, said, ``His
intense personal opus is in my view among the most important in
Latin America and the Spanish language.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabines was born on March 25, 1926, in Tuxtla Gutierrez, in the
rural southern state of Chiapas. He was the son of a brusque
Lebanese immigrant who became an army major. To please his father,
he spent three unhappy years studying medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, my poetry was a trinket, something superficial
and full of other people's vanity,'' Sabines said in a 1998
interview. ``During those three years of medical school I found out
what it was to suffer. I realized that my poetry had to become
absolutely necessary, with no paper-pushing or cheap conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   His poem ``Something About the Death of Major Sabines'' (1973)
was his child's cry of rage and helplessness after his father's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sabines' poems have been everything for everyone: a bond of
union for lovers, relief for the lonely, comfort for orphans,
praise of pleasure, a hail of stones against suffering,'' wrote the
critic Jose Emilio Pacheco in a 1994 essay.
</P>
<P>
   Although he remained married to his first love, Sabines was
never reluctant to tell stories about his unabashedly passionate
life, full of the fleeting but incandescent affairs he so often
wrote about.
</P>
<P>
   Probably his most repeated poem is one of his earliest, ``The
Lovers,'' published in 1950. ``The lovers say nothing,'' it begins
in a translation by W.S. Merwin, the American poet. ``Love is the
finest of silences,/the one that trembles most and is hardest to
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sabines read this poem to Mexican audiences, they
invariably chanted it word for word along with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a voice completely on his own,'' Merwin said. ``His
poetry is extremely intimate and plain, but powerful, sometimes
shockingly powerful. It spoke to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sabines shattered a hip by tripping on a step 10 years
ago, he underwent surgery more than 30 times. The accident jolted
his touch for poetry. He did not write a significant poem again.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo attended the wake for Sabines and
offered to place his coffin in the Palacio de Bellas Artes for a
homage. Sabines' family declined, saying the poet had requested a
simple funeral.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Josefa Rodriguez Zebadua; a son,
Julio, and three daughters, Julieta, Jazmin and Judith.

   TAMPA, Fla. _ Joe Torre's cancer was confined to his prostate,
according to the results of pathology reports, the Yankees
announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' manager had surgery Thursday to remove his
prostate, and the pathology tests show there is no trace of cancer
in the lymph nodes. More tests will be conducted in a month to
determine whether further treatment is necessary. Torre, operated
on in St. Louis, is expected to be released from the hospital this
week. He called Don Zimmer, the interim manager, at 6:30 Sunday
morning _ 5:30 in St. Louis _ to chat with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also have learned that thyroid cancer has been
diagnosed in Jaime Torres, a minor-league catcher. Torres, 28, will
have surgery soon, and doctors believe he will recover fully, after
missing six weeks.

FEINTS AND PARRIES APLENTY IN THE BATTLE FOR GUCCI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands, France, Italy)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Earlier this month, over a lunch of baked fish at the
Paris town house of Francois Pinault, Domenico de Sole began
thinking he might be home safe.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, 54, chief executive of the Gucci &UR;  &LR; group, found he had
quite a bit in common with Pinault, one of France's brashest and
most unconventional venture capitalists. Pinault, 62, who owns
France's biggest department store chain, Au Printemps, and the
London auction house, Christie's, had been mulling an entry into
the luxury goods business for about two years.
</P>
<P>
   On-again-off-again talks had taken place between Pinault and
Sanofi &UR;  &LR; SA, France's No. 2 drug maker, to buy Sanofi's cosmetics
and fashion units, which included the rights to such high-end
brands as Yves Saint Laurent and Oscar de la Renta. But in the end,
Sanofi's brands, as attractive as they were, were not judged to be
the ``right entry point,'' as one of Pinault's advisers put it.
</P>
<P>
   Enter de Sole. Since January, he had been feinting and parrying
to fend off a hostile bid for control of Gucci by another powerful
French investor, Bernard Arnault, the 49-year-old chairman of LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest maker of luxury
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, de Sole objected to the shape of the LVMH offer.
Arnault was not willing to make a bid for all Gucci's outstanding
shares. Instead, using a technique he had honed carefully in
previous acquisitions, Arnault had assembled a 34 percent stake,
and was now seeking a voice on Gucci's board. For de Sole, that was
tantamount to opening the chicken coop to the wolf; Vuitton, one of
the jewels in Arnault's crown, was a head-on competitor of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, a lawyer by training, tried all the defensive tricks.
In February, he announced the creation of an employee stock option
plan that would increase Gucci's capital by issuing 20 million new
Gucci shares and dilute the Arnault stake. But Arnault countered by
dragging Gucci to court in the Netherlands, where Gucci is
incorporated, and the Dutch court ordered the two sides to
negotiate an amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   These developments attracted the attention of Pinault, who used
the investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to line up a meeting
with de Sole. Their first encounter took place March 8 in London,
where Pinault ``wanted the deal done immediately,'' said an
executive who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paris lunch at his town house four days later, Pinault
was joined by the chief executive of his Pinault-Printemps-Redoute
group, Serge Weinberg. Accompanying de Sole was Gucci's chief
creative director, Tom Ford. The Gucci executives already had
concluded that the value of the Gucci brand had been mined nearly
to its limits. For further growth, they decided they needed a
multi-brand strategy. From such considerations an intricate plan
emerged:
</P>
<P>
   Pinault would proceed with a deal using his holding company,
Artemis, to take over the Sanofi brands. He would then use
Printemps to acquire a controlling stake in Gucci. As the final
step, Gucci would then acquire the Sanofi brands from Artemis to
form the nucleus of a global luxury goods producer _ one large
enough to compete even with giants like Arnault.
</P>
<P>
   Working at a fast pace, the companies had the terms of their
agreement drawn up and placed before Gucci's board, which approved
it. The deal was announced Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Gucci is the right company,'' Weinberg, 49, said in
an interview. ``We thought with them, we could really build a new
luxury goods group. We see a very good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   De Sole agrees. ``Pinault is not a competitor,'' he said in an
interview, ``and he is giving us $3 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Aligning Gucci with the much larger Printemps, whose 1998 sales,
at $18 billion, were double those of LVMH, would benefit Gucci.
Since de Sole and Ford took Gucci public in 1995, sales have
exploded to more than $1 billion. Gucci has weathered the crisis in
Asia well, and the sex appeal of its brand is unchallenged among
the young and acquisitive. Pinault has the cash and the
distribution reach to be of benefit to Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if successful would eliminate Gucci's weakness _
vulnerability to takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But if de Sole and Printemps liked the idea of their fit,
Arnault thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he began a counteroffer on Friday for all of the
Gucci shares he did not yet own. Then he petitioned the court in
the Netherlands to invalidate the Gucci-Pinault deal. A hearing is
set for Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault's executives openly accuse de Sole of a double standard.
In the past, de Sole has argued that the offer by Arnault offended
his sense of fair play, since LVMH sought to take control of Gucci
by buying only a majority stake and not making a tender offer to
all shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet de Sole, LVMH argues, has no apparent objections to
Pinault's doing exactly that _ controlling Gucci with only a 40
percent stake, hardly more than Arnault himself now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, laws in the Netherlands, allow such a tactic, known as a
creeping takeover. Pinault and Gucci contend that they have a
watertight case for the Dutch court. Their deal was signed in Paris
Friday morning and they say there is nothing in the Dutch court's
earlier ruling that bars the Gucci board from entering into such a
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Gucci's board met in Amsterdam to discuss its
options. Gucci is expected to make a statement Monday morning,
before the courts, and the markets, open.

SONICS STUMBLE ON ROAD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ To say that the Sonics experience uneasy times
away from KeyArena would be putting their situation mildly.
</P>
<P>
   The road has been downright brutal.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Sonics could blame their 3-7 road record
on the absence of simple basketball luck, having lost several tight
games in the final two minutes. However, about the only thing
gut-wrenching about Friday night's 90-78 loss to Golden State at
Oakland Arena was the Sonics' performance.
</P>
<P>
   In having their three-game losing streak snapped, the Sonics
brought very little to the court.
</P>
<P>
   No intensity. No baskets. No answer for a Golden State team that
had lost four straight but dominated from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done the little things,'' said Sonics forward
Detlef Schrempf, who led the team with 21 points off the bench.
``We do a lot of the little things wrong when on the road you need
everything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With point guard Gary Payton shooting 5 of 19, the Sonics played
with a huge void in their offense. The team shot just 34 percent
and tied a season-low with 23 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had company in the shooting doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker was 2-for-11 and Dale Ellis missed all eight of his
shots.
</P>
<P>
   One would have never known that the Sonics were coming off two
days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we make shots it's a ballgame,'' Ellis said. `` ... We're
just not getting it done. We're just too inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics knew they were in for a long night from the start.
</P>
<P>
   After Payton hit a 3-pointer that put the Sonics ahead 3-0,
Seattle missed its next eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State went on a monstrous 16-0 run, scoring effortlessly
from inside and out. The Warriors were particularly forceful around
the rim while the Sonics seemed flatfooted.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example was when 5-foot-3 Muggsy Bogues rebounded
Antawn Jamison's missed jumper. Bogues then fed Jamison, who cut to
the basket for an easy layup. The Sonics fell behind 26-9 on that
play, and they managed to score just 15 points in the opening
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a fast-starting team. We watched them on tape,''
Schrempf said. `` ... That (first quarter) set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's younger legs and aggressive play kept the Sonics
befuddled. The Warriors twice held 19-point leads in the second
quarter. Although the Sonics cut the deficit to 51-40 at the break,
the Warriors never relinquished a double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no acceptable explanation _ we respected the
Warriors,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``We didn't come in
thinking they couldn't take it to us. They've been a real
successful team at home. ... There's no reason not to match their
aggressiveness, but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics finally welcomed back swingman Billy Owens, who
played after missing the past two games with a sore left knee. But
Owens did little to help. He played just four minutes and collected
two points _ all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal frantically searched for someone to provide energy so
he inserted rookie Vladimir Stepania in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania's energy _ on the boards and defensively _ compelled
Westphal to start him in place of Ellis in the second half.
Westphal, who searched for a sparkplug all night, even used
19-year-old rookie Rashard Lewis when Stepania got into foul
trouble with 8:22 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed some energy,'' Westphal said. ``We were sleepwalking
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania gave the Sonics somewhat of a lift. Asked whether the
6-foot-11 forward would receive more playing time, Westphal said:
``I would think so. If a guy hustles as much as he does, we'll have
to find a place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania might be called upon to fulfill Baker's role.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also did not start the second half after suffering a
sprained right thumb in the second quarter. He went back on the
floor with 5:37 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win the game,'' said Baker, who was in pain after
the game. ``It was hurting, but it would have been hurting worse
just sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he had already been advised to rest his injury three
to four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to wait,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sonics can't continue their lull on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to win on the road,'' Baker said. ``Teams are
playing well against us when we come to their gym. ... Regardless
of our record, teams come ready to play the Sonics. We have to
match their intensity.''

HOLBROOKE TO MEET MILOSEVIC IN FINAL PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Expands and updates earlier story.)  (See also KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-ASSESS, KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC) 
(lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Sunday dispatched a
special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, to meet with Slobodan Milosevic
in what senior officials described as a ``last chance'' to persuade
the Yugoslav leader to accept a peace agreement for Kosovo and
avoid bombing by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after President Clinton warned that the Serbs had gone
beyond ``the threshold'' of violence in their southern province,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she was sending
Holbrooke to present Milosevic with a ``stark choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That choice, she said, was for him to agree to the settlement
signed in Paris last week by the ethnic Albanians who make up most
of Kosovo's population, or face NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   As Holbrooke prepared to leave on Sunday night, Milosevic's
forces appeared unintimidated, however. Taking advantage of the
absence of more than 1,300 international monitors who withdrew from
Kosovo on Saturday, they continued their rampage through Kosovo,
burning ethnic Albanian villages in a region at the heart of the
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where Holbrooke will
stop Monday morning before flying on to Belgrade, U.S. officials on
Sunday presented NATO ambassadors with a stepped-up plan for
bombing in Serbia, a move intended to strengthen Holbrooke's
position with the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Sunday that another diplomatic push by Holbrooke was justified
``one final time,'' even as the administration came under new
criticism that it was dithering over what to do about Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we owe it to the American people,'' Berger said on the
CBS News program ``Face the Nation.'' ``We owe it to our military
people, our allies, to make that final attempt, even as the
preparations continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that plans for airstrikes were simultaneously moving
forward. ``The preference is to find a peace agreement that will
bring stability to Kosovo, peace to Kosovo, and rights to the
Kosovar people,'' Berger said. ``If we can achieve that with the
imminent threat of force, that will be a good result.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who negotiated a Kosovo cease-fire last October that
Milosevic has flouted for two months, appeared to have a
particularly difficult assignment this time.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton administration officials said that Holbrooke
was being sent to deliver Milosevic the message of peace or war.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has shown a pattern of backing down at the last
minute. Should he give signs of doing so this time, Holbrooke will
likely be left with the task of negotiating around the edges of the
peace settlement that the ethnic Albanians signed at the Paris
peace talks last week. Changes to the terms of the peace settlement
could well drive the ethnic Albanians to renege on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Milosevic is ready to agree to a NATO-led force which
can include other nations, we're ready to discuss it without
betraying the ethnic Albanians,'' a senior administration official
said. The official acknowledged that there was ``very little
maneuvering room, because of the 81-page document out of Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   By sending Holbrooke to what some officials are calling ``last
chance'' talks, the administration opened itself to accusations,
even by some supporters, of being too accommodating toward
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, sent earlier this month by the
administration to break a logjam in the talks between the Serbs and
the ethnic Albanians, said he believed Holbrooke's visit was
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to make any more overtures to
Milosevic,'' Dole said on NBC News' ``Meet the Press.'' We've done
enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who has been a proponent of the
airstrikes, suggested that the administration was dithering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great alliances and great countries don't remain great if they
issue threats and don't keep them,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others charged that the Holbrooke mission ran the risk of
allowing Milosevic more time to conduct his new military offensive
against the ethnic Albanian population and the guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to send an emissary, every day you wait to do
so you give Milosevic more time to attack,'' said James Hooper, the
executive director of the Balkans Action Council, a nongovernmental
group that has supported airstrikes against the Yugoslav leader.
``Why wait until Monday? And at least get it over quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the ethnic Albanian delegation, who signed the
accords in Paris last Thursday, said they feared that Holbrooke, in
an attempt to forge an agreement with Milosevic and avoid bombing,
might undermine the terms of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that Holbrooke went to Belgrade 10 days ago on
a very limited mission _ to deliver a message about the terms of
the Kosovo settlement and to indicate that not signing would mean
NATO airstrikes _ and failed to convince Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they said, it appeared that Holbrooke would negotiate
with Milosevic, even as Serbian forces were using tanks, heavy
artillery and mortar in their new offensive in Kosovo, Serbia,
whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. The region was
stripped of broad autonomy by Milosevic in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree that Ambassador Holbrooke should go to Belgrade
with an ultimatum, but this is not a new ultimatum,'' said Bujar
Bukoshi, the prime minister of the shadow government of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, who is also a member of the delegation to the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, whose traveling party includes Lt. Gen. Edward
Anderson and Greg Schulte, a National Security Council specialist
on the Balkans, will be preceded in Belgrade by the three
negotiators from the Paris peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the negotiators, Ambassador Wolfgang
Petritsch, the Austrian envoy to Belgrade, the trio _ Petritsch;
the U.S. ambassador, Christopher Hill; and the Russian ambassador,
Boris Mayorsky _ will meet Milosevic on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to put everything on the table with Mr.
Milosevic,'' Petritsch said. ``We want to make it clear to him what
is in the accord _ there has been such a propaganda war against the
accord in Belgrade people won't give credit to what is in the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Petritsch said he would stress that the accord allows Kosovo to
stay within Serbia as an autonomous region and that it gives the
Serbian minority protection.
</P>
<P>
   To stress NATO unity, President Clinton spoke Sunday about the
situation in Kosovo with President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of
Germany, a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials also said that the planned visit to
Washington by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia would not
affect the timing of possible NATO action. Primakov, who opposes
the bombing by NATO, begins meeting with administration officials
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, questioned on whether the administration would ask
Primakov to postpone his visit, said, ``No, I think that would be
his decision to make if it came to that.''

TEMPLE FINDS ITS BEST JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 
(With BKC-DUKE-TEMPLE)  (ms 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There were two and a half minutes left
in Sunday's National Collegiate Athletic Association East Regional
final, and Rasheed Brokenborough, Temple's shooting guard, peeked
at the scoreboard. Duke was leading by 18 points and was heading
toward the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point,'' Brokenborough said, ``I didn't feel we had
much of a chance. There's not much you can do. You're playing a
team with better players, and when you play with too much emotion
the way we did, you sometimes help the other team. You have to take
the loss like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minutes 14 seconds remaining, John Chaney, Temple's
67-year-old coaching legend, took Brokenborough out of the game.
There was a long hug from Chaney for his only senior, a hometown
player from Philadelphia who paid his tuition as a freshman because
he lacked the grades to get an athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   After Duke's 85-64 victory, the coach and the player left the
court together. When they arrived in the locker room, the other
players were sitting quietly on stools in front of makeshift
lockers, heads down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach came in and sat down and was crying,'' said Mark
Karcher, Temple's best 3-point shooter. ``That hurt me. He told us
to keep our heads up. He said we lost the battle Sunday, but
somebody had to win the game, somebody had to advance, somebody had
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokenborough said: ``Coach showed a lot of emotion. He said,
`You played the best basketball you could.'''
</P>
<P>
   Did Brokenborough think his team played its best? ``Defensively,
no,'' he said. ``But I think we did the best job we could do and
lost to a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss is a loss, but the realization that this Duke team is
something special seemed to ease the pain a bit for Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced maybe the best team in America,'' said Pepe Sanchez,
Temple's point guard, ``but if you want to win it all, you have to
face Duke. We did our best. We're very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud but helpless against Duke's inside-outside offensive
poison. On Saturday, Brokenborough said Temple was ready to shut
down Duke and its hefty All-America center, Elton Brand, and take a
chance on Duke's 3-point bombers.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Temple could do neither. With the game barely
six minutes old and Temple leading by 9-7, Trajan Langdon, Duke's
All-America guard, buried three 3-point shots in a span of 89
seconds. That led a Duke 17-2 run and made Temple change its
defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our hands in his face,'' Karcher said, ``and he still
hits those 3s. We put pressure on him after that, so they went to
something else.'
</P>
<P>
   That something else was Brand in the deep post. As Brokenborough
said: ``We became wild animals trying real hard on defense.
Eventually, we started cheating toward the outside shooter, and
they penetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple did not stop Langdon but merely slowed him. He made 5 of
6 of his 3-point shots and scored 23 points. Inside, Brand made 8
of 10 shots and scored 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, a desperate Temple started trapping at
halfcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to trap them because we were losing,'' Brokenborough
said. ``We tried to slow them down a bit. We did a good job of
trapping, but they came up with easy buckets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Langdon destroyed Temple, the Owls knew all about
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times, we reached him and he shot over us,''
Sanchez said. ``We knew he would be good. We didn't know how good
he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon and associates were so good that they shot 60 percent
from the floor and 58.8 percent on 3-pointers against one of the
nation's premier defenses. That earned Temple's respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never let down,'' Karcher said, ``but I can't say we played
well.''

   Sanchez marveled at Duke's deep talent. ``Most teams have two
good players,'' he said. ``They have 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The Temple players felt bad for Chaney. He is only the 22d coach
in NCAA history to win 600 games, but this is his 27th year and he
has never reached the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm so disappointed,'' Karcher said. ``He's like a
father to me. I feel I let him down. But next year, all of us
except Rasheed will come back. We will be better next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Sanchez about next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``I don't feel like looking ahead. I
have to soak this up and suffer so next time we won't lose.'' &QL;

LIVING WITH A GRIEF THAT WILL NEVER DIE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Jim Larson is accustomed to the stares and to
the pity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will see me and say, `Is that him?''' Larson said. Is
this the man, they wonder, who lost two women he loved to random
killers, seven years apart, whose life was twice torn by men who
enter others' lives only in bad dreams?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First it was his sister, Sonja Larson. She and a roommate were
stabbed to death in 1990 by Danny Rolling, a serial killer who said
demons spoke to him from inside his head. Rolling killed and
mutilated five college students in Gainesville, Fla., in ways that
made his victims' families, and people across the country, shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Larson remembers how he fell to the floor once, in his despair,
and how his wife, Carla, hugged him, how she promised him that the
evil that touched them was over and done. Rolling was sent to death
row and the Larsons soon had a baby, Jessica, the symbol of their
new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Carla Larson was abducted in a supermarket parking lot
by a man on vacation at Disney World. The police found her body in
a shallow grave. Larson, his hate used up, went dead inside. After
his sister's death, he burned with rage. This time he just
sleep-walked through a terse, private agony.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in March, his wife's killer, John Huggins, will join
Rolling on Florida's death row, beginning a slow countdown to
possible execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a celebrity, but for nothing good,'' Larson
said. ``I'm labeled as this poor, sorry person. If I knew someone
like me, I'd ask, `What's this guy doing wrong?'''
</P>
<P>
   Larson said he sometimes felt as if he was trapped in a
revolving door. Inside it, spinning with him, are the murders, all
the sadness and horror of losing his sister and his wife. Outside
is a safe and sane place that he has to get back to, but the doors
just keep on turning.
</P>
<P>
   It has left him with an emptiness and a dull and unrelenting
pain, Larson said recently, as he sat in the neat living room of
his house in a quiet, tree-lined suburb of Orlando, a home most
people in middle-class America would see as safe. But they do not
look at the world through Jim Larson's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonja was safe in her bed when she died, and my wife was at a
Publix supermarket at 12 noon, not in a nightclub, not in a
7-Eleven at 2 a.m.,'' said Larson, 38, a trim man whose narrow face
has a sadness in it that shows through even when he smiles. ``No
one in my family had ever been to jail, because we just didn't have
that kind of life. I felt we were good people. So, why? Why did it
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who are Catholic, and I've heard them say that
because they are close to God, bad things won't happen,'' he
continued. ``My sister never did anything wrong. My wife never did.
I guess I just don't know what the plan is anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson is talking about finding reasons to go on living when a
2-year-old girl, with golden hair and laughing eyes, stomps into
the room in fuzzy slippers. She crawls around the floor, then spots
a stack of books. She wants a bedtime story.
</P>
<P>
   And, because it happens every night, Larson finds his reason to
keep on living in the face of his daughter, Jessica, and between
the pages of Dr. Seuss. She prefers ``Horton Hears a Who.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica,'' he said, ``is the reason I'm still here.''

 ORLANDO: still here.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Figuring that his daughter is years away from understanding the
crimes that took her mother and her aunt, he keeps on talking about
them even as she pulls herself up into his arms.
</P>
<P>
   It began in the summer of 1990, a summer of terror in the
college city of Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Larson, who wanted to be a teacher, had enrolled as a
freshman at the University of Florida. One night in August she went
to a Wal-Mart with her roommate, Christina Powell, to buy some odds
and ends.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling, a drifter who claimed that he was possessed and that he
followed the instructions of the demon ``Ynnad'' (his name, Danny,
spelled backwards), saw the two young women and followed them home.
He caught them in their beds, and stabbed them again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He confessed to killing five people,'' Larson said. ``He cut
their heads off, then played with them. He did the worst things you
can possibly do to somebody, and he's still alive. Why is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Larson railed, at the time, about the sickness of it, the
cruelty, and said he would have killed Rollings with his own hands.
During the trial, he sat day after day in the courtroom as the
defendant's nightmare world took shape. One day, Larson said, he
``just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran back to my hotel in tears and rocked myself back and
forth in a corner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson said he was certain that his wife, Carla, saved him. She
wrapped her arms around him, reminded him of the good things, of
reasons to live, to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   She had just graduated from the University of Florida as a
construction engineer, and they moved to Atlanta, then back to
Florida, chasing work, building a life. She wanted a child, but he
did not want to bring a child into any world where people like
Danny Rolling stalked the innocents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after counseling, Larson said he found some peace of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica was born. The Larsons bought a small house on a dead-end
street in Orlando. They installed good locks and a home security
system. They bought a guard dog, a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   The car Mrs. Larson drove was a big Ford Explorer, with air
bags. He believed he had done everything he could to make them all
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla always told me we would get through it,'' he said,
``that she would always be there.''
</P>
<P>
   She was working for a construction contractor, building a new
Disney resort, in the summer of 1997. On June 10, she left work to
go to a Publix supermarket outside Orlando, to buy some fruit for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   John Huggins, a landscaper who had been in and out of jail all
his life, was on vacation with his wife and their five children.
They were staying in a motel across the street from the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   In broad daylight, in a busy parking lot, he walked up to Mrs.
Larson, punched her in the stomach and kidnapped her, driving away
in her car.
</P>
<P>
   He drove to a remote field and strangled her to death. Unlike
Rolling, he had never killed before.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Larson was missing for two days. Some husbands might have
held out hope, but Jim Larson knew his wife was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed blank,'' said a friend and neighbor, Scott Peterson.
``You could stare right through him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the police found her, half-covered in the sand, ``he didn't
feel one way or another,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The police were so puzzled by Larson's behavior that they gave
him a lie detector test, to see if he was involved in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to an Orlando area radio talk show even accused Larson
because he had seemed so blank during press interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But what he was, was used up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in disbelief that this had happened to him twice,''
Peterson said. ``He stopped eating and sleeping. He lost a lot of
weight and walked around with dark circles under his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Huggins' wife who pointed the police to the killer. She
told them that he had left her and the children in the motel at
noon the day of the murder and came back that afternoon, sweating
and jittery. Investigators found Mrs. Larson's engagement ring in
the home of one of Huggins' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that haunts Larson most is this: Carla,
because of what happened to Sonja Larson in Gainesville, knew how
it would end when John Huggins took control of her. Her last
moments would have been spent in a terrible understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But while the death of his wife left Larson with a grief he may
never get over, it also left him with a responsibility, for
Jessica. He has gone back to counseling and, slowly, is pulling
himself back from the despondency that threatened to take over his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He has a girlfriend, Brenda Benson, whose husband was killed
when a tree fell on his Jeep. ``We rely a lot on each other,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have lost friends or relatives to murderers look
to the execution of the killer as a place to dump some of their
sadness. As a relative, he has a legal right to witness the
executions of the two men if the state of Florida wins its legal
battles to put them to death. But Larson is not certain that he
needs to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would go to it,'' he said, to make sure it is over,
to make certain some appeal or a smart lawyer does not set one or
both of them free. ``I don't really care anymore,'' he said. ``It's
not going to be even. Those two lives don't compare to Carla's
life, or Sonja's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The men will be housed, prison officials said, ``within spitting
distance'' of each other at the Florida State Prison in Starke, in
northern Florida. They could, conceivably, meet in an exercise yard
or in some hallway. They could, perhaps, discuss their crimes,
discuss Carla Larson, discuss Larson's little sister, Sonja.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect does not chill him. What happens on death row, he
said, tiredly, he cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   But, it being an age when people can profit from even the most
shameful acts, he does worry that they might write a book, he said,
adding, ``I don't want them making money off what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he does what other people do. He goes to work, cares
for his daughter, finds happiness when he can. He just lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has this TV movie mentality,'' Larson said, meaning
that everyone in a television drama, no matter how sad, can be all
smiles after the commercial. ``It's not a happy ending,'' he added.
``I don't feel good.''

EDITORIAL: THE NEW ABORTION RHETORIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 22:
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatists within the Republican Party have come to regard the
abortion issue as an albatross that could ruin their chances of
maintaining control of Congress and winning the presidency in 2000.
While all of the party's declared presidential candidates describe
themselves as pro-life, the real issues debate among them has not
been over how to outlaw abortion, but how to keep it from playing a
central part in the upcoming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican
presidential hopeful, does not talk about ending the right to
abortion, but about reducing the number of abortions by encouraging
adoption and requiring that minors seeking abortions obtain
parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also weaves the abortion issue into a larger ``reverence
for life'' agenda that includes everything from combatting drunken
driving to promoting sexual abstinence. It is far more appealing
than the old anti-abortion rhetoric, which frequently sounded harsh
and judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-choice movement, which has succeeded in portraying the
Republican abortion opponents as extremists who would deny
abortions even to victims of rape and incest, would have a far
harder time combatting this fuzzier and less threatening approach.
The American public always has been uncomfortable with abortion.
Polls show that a strong majority prefers the hands-off option of
leaving the issue up to a woman and her doctor. But when prodded
about specifics, people tend to be far more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican strategists, including some from the religious
right, now favor chipping away at abortion through targeted fights
on the most winnable issues, like parental consent and the
procedure known as ``partial birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we win one, we're going to find a new one and keep
pressing,'' says Ralph Reed, the social-conservative consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion pragmatists are hoping to leave the pro-life
plank in their party platform intact as a sop to the social
conservatives, and then duck the issue through the presidential
campaign. Gov. George Pataki has made that more difficult with his
recent bold call for elimination of the plank. Pataki, who is
eyeing the presidential race, should be commended for tackling the
issue in a way that makes many other moderates look evasive by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-choice movement cannot rely on a few brave voices
within the Republican Party. It must remind the public that the
abortion debate, no matter how it is presented, is always about
each woman's right to make her own intensely personal decisions
relating to pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, extremists within the Republican ranks made
things easy for the pro-choice side by portraying the abortion
fight in the starkest terms possible. But it is very likely that
the opponents of abortion will use much subtler strategies this
time around.

WEAKENED OLYMPIC ORGANIZATION FACES TOUGH TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Humbled and humiliated, the
International Olympic Committee last week sought to kick an
addiction to a potent mix of independence, power, and the reflected
prestige of the world's finest athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Like an addict on the first rungs of a 12-step ladder, the IOC
distanced itself from its most incorrigible friends, sought outside
help, rallied around its chastened leader, and vowed never to
indulge again.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the self-congratulatory statements and claims of
catharsis after the $1.2 million Salt Lake City bribery scandal,
the IOC fell into the trap that bedevils many would-be ex-addicts:
assuming that the mere act of claiming sobriety is the same thing
as being truly sober.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, as IOC members disperse to the far reaches of
the globe, the weakened organization faces even tougher tests in
the months and years ahead _ involving performance-enhancing
strategies by athletes, threatened congressional action, its
relationship to sponsors, and other challenges that observers say
will determine not only its own future but the future of the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable among the hurdles confronting the IOC is its
inability to gain world consensus on the use of drugs and
performance-enhancers by athletes, or doping, a problem that
Olympic observers say could do far more damage to the Games than
the revelation that IOC members traded bid city votes for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to the doping issue, the bribery issue is a passing
cloud,'' said John MacAloon, professor of social science at the
University of Chicago and an Olympic historian. ``The entire
credibility of the Olympic movement is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the bribery uproar, Olympic boosters continually
reminded the public, the pollsters, and the pundits that, when the
smoke and stench clears, what really matters are the efforts and
achievements of Olympic athletes. Observers say the Games would
suffer immeasurable, perhaps irreversible, damage if those
achievements were seen as the product of doping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership crises and scandals such as we've been through can
be fixed,'' MacAloon said. ``The heart of the attraction is the
athletic competition, and if more and more publics around the world
become convinced that athletes can't be trusted to be clean then
the whole Olympic phenomenon is shaken at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a February doping conference here, the IOC failed to win
worldwide support to create an agency that would conduct drug tests
on athletes in and out of competition, refine analyses of urine and
blood samples, and warn children about the dangers of doping. IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch had hoped to head the agency, with
day-to-day management being handled by Prince Alexandre de Merode,
head of the Olympics' antidrug committee since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly became apparent that _ in light of the IOC's
credibility gap _ most industrialized nations had no interest in
seeing the IOC retain control of antidoping efforts. Also
unresolved was an IOC proposal to require a minimum two-year ban
for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are bigger than the IOC,'' said British sports
minister Tony Banks. ``It might come as a surprise to the IOC to
find there is actually something bigger than the IOC, but there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Those results proved that ``the international federations and
the IOC have lost moral authority over the doping question,''
MacAloon said. ``Whether the sports organizations can win their
moral authority back remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also has to contend with an emboldened US Congress, most
notably a committee led by a senator with designs on the
presidency, that happily would upgrade its own image by claiming to
have cleaned up or cracked down on an organization that arguably is
held in even lower regard than it is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the IOC's actions this week did little to cool the
ardor in Washington for a US legislative response. Among those IOC
actions were changing the way the 2006 Winter Games host city will
be chosen; establishing an ethics committee with a majority from
outside the IOC's ranks; and creating an IOC 2000 study commission
with carte blanche to suggest changes in everything from how the
IOC chooses its members to how it spends its money.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is chairman of
the Senate Commerce Committee, was unimpressed, pressing ahead with
plans for an April 14 hearing. McCain dismissed the reforms as ``a
sad commentary for an organization which exists to embody the
highest ideals of the human pursuit of excellence in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   He took particular umbrage at the announcement that Samaranch
would lead the ethics panel and the IOC 2000 Commission. Samaranch
said the Olympic charter required that he preside, but McCain
dismissed that as a blatant conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who is 78, had heard widespread demands for his
resignation since the scandal broke in December. He began the week
by hinting he might step down before his term ends in 2001. But he
ended the week emboldened by an 86-2 vote of confidence and said he
would serve out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Among the topics to be considered at the Senate hearing are
removing the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States and
redirecting hundreds of millions of dollars in television rights
fees from the IOC to its US affiliate, the United States Olympic
Committee. The tax and television rights issues are significant
because they could choke off the fuel that turns the Olympic rings:
American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the committee indicated Friday that the results
of the IOC meeting had made congressional action more, rather than
less, likely.
</P>
<P>
   Another front on which the IOC may have to do battle is with its
biggest financial supporters, the 11 companies _ nine of them based
in the United States _ that are the worldwide Olympic sponsors. All
will have to decide whether to renew or end their relationships
with the IOC at various points within the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal, and most critical, sponsor has been Boston-based
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and its president, David
D'Alessandro.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to agree to have oversight and an ethics commission
and to study term limits is real progress. But it's not reform
yet,'' D'Alessandro said. For instance, he said, ``Samaranch can't
be seen as controlling these committees. Who are these `outsiders'
going to be, and does this group have authority?''
</P>
<P>
   Other sponsors have taken a more measured approach, but all have
said they are closely watching their investments, which average
between $40 million and $50 million each for a four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectation is that they are going to continue to move
swiftly and forcefully through this issue,'' said Ben Deutsch,
spokesman for longtime Olympic sponsor Coca-Cola, whose commitment
to the IOC extends through 2008. ``If they do not, the IOC cannot
be successful in restoring confidence in its leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Less of a direct threat to the IOC _ but still a potential stain
on its reputation _ is an ongoing Justice Department investigation
of the Salt Lake bid efforts. Indictments, if any are forthcoming,
are considered most likely to affect American citizens involved in
the Salt Lake effort, as opposed to IOC members, who for a variety
of reasons are essentially immune from the process. Still, any
action by prosecutors can only serve to remind the public of the
scandal, possibly at a time when the IOC is basking in the expected
glory of the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC might also find itself named a ``public international
organization'' by President Clinton. Such a designation would make
anyone who bribes an IOC member subject to penalties under the
chief federal law against international bribery, the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act. The law only covers bribe-givers, as opposed
to takers, so IOC members would not be directly affected.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers have expressed doubts the IOC can be
named a public international organization. However, former Senator
George Mitchell of Maine _ who first made the suggestion as
chairman of an independent ethics commission _ has continued to
press for the designation as a sign that dealings with the IOC no
longer will be considered above or outside US laws.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the horizon is the question of whether the powerful
international sports federations that control the actual Olympic
competitions will seize the moment and demand financial and other
concessions from the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Another test for the IOC will be internal, involving its
ultimate acceptance of the very reforms its surviving members were
so proud of this week. Answering to other people is an unfamiliar,
some say unwelcome, concept to a self-appointed, self-perpetuating
oligarchy that was designed by founder Pierre de Coubertin to
answer to nobody on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the long-term results of the scandal seem certain to
strip the IOC of its most treasured possession: independence.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved part of IOC lore is a story about how the IOC forced
the Nazis to take down ``Dogs and Jews Not Allowed'' signs from
outside public toilets at the 1936 Winter Games in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the five-ringed Olympic flag is raised over the stadium,
it is no longer Germany,'' IOC President Henri de Baillet-Latour
informed Adolf Hitler. ``It is Olympia, and we are masters there.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Lords of the Rings left here last week after the
most important and agonizing meeting in their 105-year history, the
erosion of that storied independence _ as well as their moral
authority _ was plain to see. The question is whether the
organization that said no to Hitler now will have to say yes to
just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not deaf,'' said IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz of
the United States. ``We hear what people tell us.''

IMPRESSIVE COMEBACK FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Throw out all the drama _ and there's been a surplus _
strip away all the changes in players and coaches, ignore for a
second the soap-opera subplot of Dennis Rodman's sudden
disappearance and reappearance . . . and what you have left is the
Lakers team that dominated the second half of Sunday afternoon's
victory over the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   When all the chaos subsided, all the parts were again in place.
And with all the missteps of the last several days behind them, the
Lakers displayed the best 24 minutes of basketball any team has
played this season.
</P>
<P>
   Their 72 second-half points were the most by any team this
season, and their 115-104 victory was the most impressive win in
recent memory, coming after a 24-point deficit in a disastrous
first half.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Shaquille O'Neal vengeance on his old team. Rodman,
immediate redemption for his one-week vacation. Kobe Bryant, a
career day with 38 points _ 33 in the second half. And the Lakers,
renewed cohesion after two straight losses and three in the last
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge confidence builder,'' coach Kurt Rambis
said. ``It's something we have to build upon. It's a game that in
the grand of scheme of things that if we don't continue to build
on, it will mean absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that what the guys saw they're capable of doing in
the second half, they can realize if they do that on an
all-the-time basis, we're gonna be real tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   How tough?
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and O'Neal (31 points) both cleared 30 points. Glen Rice
and Derek Harper drilled seven huge 3-pointers between them in the
final two quarters. As a team, the Lakers were this dominant: a
17-8 rebounding margin, a season-high 41-point fourth quarter, a
season-high 60.3 percent shooting rate for the game, 83 percent in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   All of it combined to negate one of their worst first halves of
the season, in which they let the Magic shoot 50 percent and let
rookie Michael Doleac score 16 points en route to a career-high 25.
They also let reserve Darrell Armstrong fire away for 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here (at halftime) and just jumped down each
other's throats,'' O'Neal said. ``I think when we can have that
type of camaraderie on this team, where we can yell at each other
and nobody will take it personal, it's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt got on Kobe. Kobe got on me. Ruben (Patterson) got on me.
The rookies told us we needed to play harder. We did it. We came
out, sucked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback started with stifling defense and a pick-and-roll
scheme adjustment that stunted Doleac and fueled the Lakers
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks flew as Bryant hit 7 of 8 shots in a 15-point third
quarter, and Harper and Rice started drilling open 3-pointers. But
it started with defense, and Rambis couldn't have been happier
after a mostly defenseless road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe the turnaround from the way we've been
playing,'' Rambis said, ``the way we played the first half, all the
adjustments we made, the intensity, guys helping each other, it was
beautiful to watch them, how they worked so well together
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 20 to open the third quarter, the comeback came gradually _
a steal, a block, a fast-break dunk, a few Rodman rebounds. ``I'm
in good shape,'' he said after getting six boards, two assists and
four points after returning from his eight-day layoff.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of 3s from Harper got the margin down to six, but the
Magic fought back to make it 84-74 at the end of the quarter.
O'Neal and Bryant took over in the fourth again, keying a 20-10 run
that gave the Lakers their first lead since the first quarter.
Orlando never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very disappointing loss,'' Magic coach Chuck Daly
said, ``but they are what they are. They are a traveling All-Star
team.''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, playing like one.

 &HT;    10,000 milestone is captivating to investors
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lots of people find peace in the 350-year-old
graveyard of Trinity Church, the quietest spot on Wall Street, a
resting place for the quick and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Strollers gawk at hundreds of crumbling, time-blackened
tombstones. At noon, office workers shove their way off bustling
sidewalks and, sack lunches in hand, dart between bumper-to-bumper
yellow cabs and fume-belching buses to get to the ancient burial
ground first. The quickest fill the few benches.
</P>
<P>
   There's no pushing and shoving. No hawkers handing out leaflets
for massage parlors. And no red, green or blue jackets worn by
denizens of the nearby New York Stock Exchange, a notoriously
superstitious lot. Especially now, with the Dow Jones industrial
average hovering like a ghost near 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees it's an important number, a major psychological
threshold, a portent of something. The question is what.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Dow continue its remarkable rise, or will that big,
round number spook the public into selling? How will it affect the
masses, since it's psychology _ fear, greed, rationality and
irrationality _ that drives the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   ``A number like 10,000 captures public attention, makes them
make decisions,'' says Charles Smith, 60, chair of sociology at
nearby Queens College and author of the classic book, ``The Mind of
the Market.'' ``In that sense, it's a psychological mark, and no
one can predict how the public will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychology is the science of what makes people tick, why there's
a tendency for people to believe in magic, even to the degree they
allow superstitions to guide their judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clear belief in transcendent powers at times like
this, that external forces we don't understand control the
market,'' says Smith. ``It's magical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why red-ink pens are verboten among stock traders
scribbling down orders. It implies blood, loss, bad luck; why
expensive Cross pens are the rule, implying success; why traders
won't spend time among Trinity's gravestones, most engraved with
skulls and crossbones that people of the 17th century thought would
ward off evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number 10,000 has become a kind of Rorschach test,'' says
Smith, referring to the famous ink blots that psychologists use in
personality evaluations. ``What we have here is the classic mass
psychology syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The number, he feels, could create a lemming mentality in either
direction, making people buy stocks because they think everyone
else is, or sell for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are easily swayed,'' says Smith, whose latest book,
``Success and Survival on Wall Street,'' is due out this summer.
``There are all these young Turks who've never been through a bear
market who think the sky's the limit. I know people whose minds
tell them to stay out, but their sons and daughters have been
riding this market up, so they are following them into the
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Vyse, a psychologist at Connecticut College, says 10,000
on the Dow should be meaningless, but its impact on the public
psyche could be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To optimists, it's a great breakthrough,'' says Vyse, author
of ``Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition.'' ``To
pessimists, it's the foretelling of a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because nobody knows, he avows, everyone will be looking for
omens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use numbers as goals, like the year 2000,'' says
psychologist Jerilyn Ross of the Ross Center of Anxiety and Related
Disorders. ``It's why we mark our 50th birthdays but don't notice
47 or 38. It's just pure superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   But superstition affects psychology and makes people act.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example is the Elliott Wave Theory. Made famous by
psychologist Bob Prechter Jr. of Gainesville, once the most popular
analyst on Wall Street, it holds that markets grow and decay in
five steps _ up, down, up, down and up, and that each move can be
predicted with mathematical precision. Supposedly, these ``waves''
reflect collective psychology. In the '80s his predictions were
blamed, or credited, for causing many ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lipson, a finance professor at the University of Georgia
who's spending this year doing research at the NYSE, doesn't
believe in the magic of numbers but still got swept up in the
euphoria last Tuesday when the Dow first surpassed 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically speaking, the 10,000 mark means nothing,'' Lipson
says. ``So why the excitement? Why did I go down to the floor four
times in hopes of seeing it happen? Why did I cheer when it finally
did and I was there? Why did my face light up with a grin, and why
did I really enjoy the event? It's just like when you see the
odometer of your car turn over from 9,999 to 10,000. Though you
know the car is just the same before and after, you feel like you
witnessed a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terence Sandbek, a clinical psychologist and expert in
paranormal beliefs, says numbers are psychologically fascinating
because they represent limits _ or starting points.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `Wow, 10,000.' It must really have some
significance,'' Sandbek says. ``To a numerologist, all numbers have
some sort of esoteric significance. The human mind likes to
simplify so that a nice number with lots of zeroes is more pleasant
than a mean number that is hard to remember. The stock market is
random, but Wall Street is full of people who've convinced
themselves it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Many prognosticators employ ``Fibonacci analysis,'' based on a
numerical phenomenon discovered in the 13th century by an Italian
mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci. In the Fibonacci sequence,
each number after zero equals the sum of the two preceding it _ 0,
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on to infinity. Divide the
larger into the next smaller _ 34 into 21, for instance _ and the
answer approximates 0.618. The ratio was supposedly used to
construct the Parthenon, and such creative work using the ratio is
thought to be pleasing to the human eye.
</P>
<P>
   Modern disciples claim the numbers capture a law of nature, and
that Dow gyrations can be predicted by looking for the ratio in
sawtooth chart patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But even more down-to-earth analysts, who scoff at such
numerical notions as superstitious nonsense, see Dow 10,000 as
momentous.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities,
says it's likely to affect the psychology of millions of small
investors, and the mutual fund managers who control the funds of
millions of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be good, because there's a certain amount of national
pride in hitting 10,000,'' he says. ``This rooting effect can push
it higher, drawing in more money, adding fresh fuel to the bullish
fires.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many might see 10,000 as a limit, a top, a
slippery slope atop Mount Everest. Yardeni has a foot in both
camps. He's predicting a Dow of 11,000 by summer but that it'll
plunge to 7,400 by year's end. He correctly predicted in the early
'90s that the Dow would hit 5,000 in 1995. That same year, he
predicted the Dow would hit 10,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened sooner than I expected,'' Yardeni says.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Larkins of Legacy South in Atlanta feels the public has
been deluged with so much media hype that their psyches will tell
them to put more money into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the market down now is like holding a beach ball under
water,'' Larkins says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's been shown time and again that it's
dangerous to predict the psychological impact on Americans of
anything that happens on Wall Street. The Dow quickly recovered
from the 1987 crash, and hardly anyone thought mass psychology
would turn against George Bush _ who'd led the nation through the
successful Gulf War _ simply because the Dow was headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gilovich, a Cornell University psychologist and author of
the book ``Why We Know What Isn't So,'' says hitting 10,000 will
cause a reaction, one way or the other, ``even if the basis of that
reaction is irrational, and that's the psychologically interesting
part. It's likely to give people pause, at least for a short time.
But because of the way psychology works, people will soon
generalize, even from an event that has no meaning. Some will
decide 10,000 means this is just a start, and others, that it's the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Seijas, a top executive for Fleet Specialists and a
member of the Big Board, says euphoria already is pulling in
suckers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about the garage mechanic losing two years' savings
on Internet stocks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But while it may take awhile to see which way mass psychology
blows the market, it's clear that small investors are upbeat, even
though many of the ``money runners'' who control their funds
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is a momentum machine,'' says Phil Judson, 51, a
tourist from Dallas who was visiting the NYSE with his family last
week. ``We get nervous when it gets this high, but we're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not even thinking of selling.
</P>
<P>
   Others who up to now have never owned stocks are thinking about
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put some money in the market now that it's hit
10,000,'' says cabbie Abu Na-aata, 42, letting out a passenger in
front of Trinity Church. ``It seems like it's going up more.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's that kind of talk that sends chills up the spines of
experts. Wall Street lore holds that when small fry start buying,
it's a bad omen for big fish.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be symbolism in the fact that though Wall Street
dominates world finance, it's only seven blocks long and starts at
a river and ends at a graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's.

HOLBROOKE TO MEET WITH MILOSEVIC IN LAST TRY FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that NATO bombers are already warming their
engines, the Clinton administration dispatched a top envoy to
Yugoslavia Sunday in ``a final attempt'' to warn its president,
Slobodan Milosevic, that he faces military attack if he does not
end the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans cautioned that President Clinton
was close to entering a war without a clear plan for how to end it,
and a Democratic lawmaker, Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, said
the president had not yet convinced the American people that the
United States should get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's forces have been crushing an ethnic Albanian
separatist movement in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The
fighting has already driven 400,000 ethnic Albanians from their
homes, and Clinton has cautioned that a broader war could develop
as the refugees cross international borders, potentially drawing
Turkey, Greece, and Macedonia into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   US officials announced Sunday that a special US envoy, Richard
Holbrooke, would meet Milosevic late Monday in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital. Holbrooke ``will make clear that Milosevic faces
a stark choice: to halt aggression against the Kosovar Albanians
... or bear the full responsiblity for the consequences of NATO
military action,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials emphasized that the mission gives Milosevic one
last chance to stop NATO airstrikes _ even ``with the smell of
exhaust fumes in the air from the aircraft,'' said Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic appeared to ignore the threats Sunday, as several
reports said that his forces continued to pound rebel positions in
central Kosovo, setting houses ablaze and driving ethnic Albanians
into the hills. Government forces launched a powerful offensive on
Saturday, when 1,380 international monitors left Kosovo in advance
of the expected NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Sunday about Kosovo with French President Jacques
Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. The conversation with Blair lasted for 25
minutes, and ``they agreed the situation was increasingly
serious,'' Blair's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 NATO ambassadors met at the alliance's headquarters in
Brussels to discuss the situation and review military options. The
NATO allies have already authorized airstrikes, though separate
approval would be needed before ground troops could be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   While raising the rhetorical attack on Milosevic, the Clinton
administration faced two political tests of its Kosovo policy. The
second-ranking Senate Republican, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma,
said Senate debate begins Monday on Clinton's policy and on a
possible resolution authorizing the use of force in Kosovo _ a
measure he said would probably fail if it came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a NATO attack could be complicated by the
expected arrival in Washington this week of Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov. The Russians oppose NATO airstrikes in Kosovo,
and initiating them while Primakov is on US soil would be seen as
an affront to the Russian official.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Robert Dole, who traveled to the region at
Clinton's request in an unsuccessful attempt to win a peace
agreement, on Sunday said that Clinton should scrub Primakov's tour
to remove any possible impediment to the NATO strikes. ``Cancel
that visit. Just don't give Milosevic more time to create more
havoc in Kosovo, which is precisely what he's doing,'' Dole said on
the NBC program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not suggested to Primakov that he delay
the trip, and the decision to come is up to him, said Mike Hammer,
a spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer would not say directly whether the United States would
support initiating a bombing campaign while Primakov is on American
soil. ``We understand the Russian government is opposed to
airstrikes, but the determining factor for NATO will be the
situation on the ground in Kosovo and what Mr. Milosevic chooses,''
he said. ``We are well aware of Russian views, but that's not the
determining factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's primary goal on his visit is to win support from an
international lending agency for more aid for the ailing Russian
economy. A meeting with Clinton is set for Thursday, the last day
of his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles, speaking on the ABC program ``This Week,'' said that
the Senate might debate whether to cut off funds for US
intervention in Kosovo, which he called ``a civil war.'' Kosovo is
a province of Serbia, which itself forms the majority of
Yugoslavia. Milosevic and his troops are ethnic Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles also said Clinton has not laid out what NATO should do
if the airstrikes fail to end the fighting. ``I just don't think
there is an endgame. I don't think there is a strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have absolutely no choice. We know what the
consequences are if we do not act,'' answered Senator Joseph Biden,
Democrat of Delaware, on the same program. ``It will be tens of
thousands of additional refugees, further destabilization of the
region. ... This is going to spread if we do not act.'' He said
Milosevic was ``engaged in what is essentially genocide and in the
middle of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Nickles, two other Republicans _ Senator Jon Kyl of
Arizona and Representative John Kasich of Ohio _ appeared on ``Fox
News Sunday'' and said Clinton did not have clear goals in the
potential attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``To simply bomb at this point without any strategy is not a
good thing for the US or NATO to do,'' Kyl said. He said airstrikes
alone would probably not repel Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On the CBS program ``Face the Nation,'' Breaux said he supported
Clinton's plan but said ``the American people are not yet convinced
of the importance of this. I mean, most people couldn't point out
Kosovo on a map if they had to.'' He said Clinton had kept Congress
informed of his plans, but he needed to lay out the reasons for
military action to the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is scheduled to stop in Brussels on his way to
Belgrade, where he will consult with British and French officials
and with General Wesley C. Clark, the supreme commander of NATO.
Holbrooke will also meet NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.

NEW YORK CITY'S NEW LABOR LEADERS ARE GETTING MORE AGGRESSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a wave of corruption investigations swept away
many of New York City's longtime labor leaders, a new cast of union
leaders is starting to make the city's labor movement more vigorous
_ and more combative _ than it has been in decades, labor experts
and union officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Having been on the defensive for months over corruption, unions
are now planning a series of aggressive actions, like mounting a
drive to organize 50,000 home health-care workers and demonstrating
at Fifth Avenue department stores that use nonunion janitors.
</P>
<P>
   And to increase labor's political clout, several unions have
formed a new coalition with black and Hispanic politicians that
aims to remake the state's Democratic Party and reshape government
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, there's been a real sea change,'' said
Gregory Tarpanian, executive director of the Labor Research
Association, a New York consulting group. ``Unions are ready to
play a much bigger role in the political life of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   This new aggressiveness, including a large labor rally scheduled
for City Hall Park on May 12, is expected to strain the contract
negotiations scheduled for next year for more than 250,000 city
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But while New York labor seeks to rebound, it will have to work
to shed its reputation for having the most corruption problems in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the city's unions have been placed into trusteeship
after union leaders faced allegations of embezzling money or taking
kickbacks, and labor's resurgence could be set back this spring
because several former leaders of District Council 37, which
represents 120,000 city workers, are expected to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for labor's more militant stance is an infusion of
new blood, including Denis Hughes, the new president of the 2
million-member New York State AFL-CIO. On the political front, the
city's three most powerful union officials _ Dennis Rivera, who
heads a 150,000-member health care union; Lee Saunders, the new
trustee of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, and Randi Weingarten, president of
the United Federation of Teachers _ have allied themselves with
black and Hispanic political leaders to form a group called the New
Century Movement.
</P>
<P>
   This alliance has developed a 13-point program that calls for
smaller classes in schools, more publicly financed child care,
health insurance for uninsured adults and a program that moves
workfare workers into permanent jobs. The alliance also opposes
privatizing city-owned hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we coalesce around these issues with politicians and
community organizations, we can be a force that will have to be
dealt with,'' Saunders said. ``The city and the state now have
substantial surpluses, and they are talking about building stadiums
and providing tax breaks to multibillion-dollar corporations. On
the other hand, you're looking at a public hospital system that's
being torn apart, and the quality of health care is being
diminished. I don't think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve its goals, the coalition hopes to strengthen the
state Democratic Party and to make it focus on providing more
government services. On March 30, hundreds of union members are to
distribute leaflets outlining the group's goals at 60 subway stops
in New York City and at locations in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse
and other upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this movement,'' said Rivera, president of
1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, said,
``is to fight for improvement in the lives of our members _ and of
all working New Yorkers _ and to use our power not just at election
time but all year round in public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, whose union merged two years ago with the Service
Employees International Union, said he hoped to advance the group's
goals through a political action committee that aims to collect $1
million a month. The service employees union will ask its more than
300,000 members in New York state to contribute $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the laid-back labor leadership we saw, there seems
to be a very aggressive, proactive type of leadership,'' said Rep.
Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat who is chairman of New York's
Coalition of Black Elected Officials, which has joined the New
Century Movement. ``This new alliance is going to make a tremendous
difference for the Democratic Party.''

COMMENTARY: STARTING A TRADE WAR WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The consumer-confidence polls report that Americans have never
felt better about the country's economy. But a vote in Washington
last week indicates that politicians suspect the confidence is not
very deep.
</P>
<P>
   By a margin of 289 to 141, the House voted to impose import
quotas on foreign steel. Those quotas would be imposed on all
countries, not just those whose producers were selling below their
costs. Never mind whether someone else is more efficient. We are
going to protect our own industry.
</P>
<P>
   There is a school of thought that dismisses the vote as
irrelevant. The Senate, goes the theory, will never go along with
such protectionism. If it did, President Clinton would veto the
bill. So the vote was a free one, and legislators could take the
popular position of protecting the domestic steel industry without
fear of actually enacting what most of them know would be bad law.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis probably will prove to be accurate. But the steel
industry's cries for protection have had far more impact than most
expected. The industry's complaints began when the collapse of
demand from Asia created a worldwide glut of steel, and steel began
flooding the United States and other places where demand was still
strong. Feeling the rising political pressure, the Clinton
administration took action against Japan and Brazil for dumping
steel, and negotiated an agreement to cut Russian exports. But that
was not enough to stop the House from passing this misguided bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disconcerting to see people talking about this in
economic times like the ones we have today,'' said Rep. David
Dreier, the chairman of the House Rules Committee and an opponent
of the steel bill, after his side lost. He noted that there were 40
times as many American workers in industries that use steel _ and
benefit from lower prices _ than there were in the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the bill is nonsense. Aside from the theoretical
arguments regarding the benefits of free trade, the damage to the
American economy from raising prices for steel users would be far
greater than the savings for the uncompetitive steel companies. The
traditional argument against dumping _ defined as selling below
production costs _ is that the companies are trying to drive their
competitors out of the market so they can raise prices later. That
is obviously not the case here.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign companies were desperate to find new buyers because
Asian demand virtually vanished overnight, and their production
costs had fallen because their workers and local suppliers could be
paid with currencies that had fallen sharply against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the economic arguments that swayed so many votes.
It was a belief that voting that way was good politics. The fact
that 91 Republicans chose to vote for the steel bill may be a sign
that there is considerable nervousness about the durability of the
good times. Republicans who were surprised to see that tax cuts did
not seem to play in Peoria might yet conclude that protectionism
will play there, particularly if the economy starts to slow.
Patrick Buchanan will carry the flag for trade war in the
presidential primaries, and might make an impressive showing in a
divided field.
</P>
<P>
   If the American economy has an Achilles' heel, it is in trade.
The United States will run a record balance-of-payments deficit
this year, but seems to have paid little attention to ways of
dealing with it other than protectionism. For now, it does not
matter, since foreigners have been eager to invest here, thus
recycling the dollars we export to pay for the flood of imports.
But if that changes, the dollar could come under severe pressure
and the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to support the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the world economy is reviving, that global
steel demand will rise and that steel imports will come down even
without protectionism. But this bill _ and similar efforts in
Europe _ is a reminder that trade wars are easy to start.
</P>
<P>
   If such a bad bill can get so many votes in good times, what
will happen in bad ones?
</P>

 &HT;    Rain saves crashed Jeff Burton
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ For Winston Cup's best drivers, Sunday's
TranSouth 400 at Darlington Raceway wasn't a race against
pole-sitter Jeff Gordon or the worn asphalt dubbed the ``track too
tough to tame.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a race to beat inclement weather and darkness at the
50-year-old egg-shaped oval, but the clouds couldn't have come soon
enough for Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   After rain delayed the event for two hours and 47 minutes,
Burton won his first race here in 11 attempts. He earned his second
victory of the season, despite getting caught in a crash near the
end of the 162nd lap, only two laps shy of the finish in the
rain-shortened event.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who took over the Winston Cup points lead for the first
time in his career, was exiting the backstretch of lap 162 when
Ernie Irvan's No. 36 Pontiac spun out leaving turn 4. Irvin hit the
outside wall and collected five other cars, including Burton's and
Gordon's.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's No. 99 Ford Taurus smashed into the outside wall on the
frontstretch, but he still managed to maintain a slight lead over
Jeremy Mayfield and Gordon, who finished second and third,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the wreck and I got slowed down,'' Burton said. ``It was
really dark because of the weather and all of the smoke. I wrecked
that car and it's torn up good. I got into the wall hard. I rode
around the last lap on the wheel with sparks flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin sparked the accident, which also damaged the cars of Kenny
Irwin, Jerry Nadeau and Kenny Wallace. It brought out the third
yellow flag of the race. After two more laps, rain started to fall
again and NASCAR officials called for the red flag, which parked
the cars on the apron of the 1.366-mile track.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin ``just lost it off turn 4 and that just started it,'' said
Irwin, whose car hit head-on into the pit-road wall. ``It started
to sprinkle and everybody was on old tires, so I think that was the
cause of him spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers, including Gordon, believed NASCAR officials were
too late in bringing out the caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have thrown a caution a lap earlier,'' Gordon
said. ``There would have been a lot less wrecked cars. My
windshield was just covered with rain. It was wet and we were all
sliding (into the pileup). Some of us made it out, some of us
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton didn't, but after waiting about 10 minutes after parking
his car, he received official word of his victory. After weather
reports indicated that the showers wouldn't stop anytime soon,
NASCAR officials cancelled the remaining 129 laps of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were praying for rain,'' Burton said. ``I just knew it
wasn't going to rain long. But I knew it didn't have to rain long
because it was so dark. I just kept thinking that we had the
fastest car all day, we made the best pit-stop decision and I
wrecked. I was mad at myself. If it hadn't rained, we wouldn't have
won the race. But if it's your day, it's your day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long day at Darlington. After completing only 44 laps
of the scheduled 293-lap event, the drivers spent nearly three
hours waiting for a restart. Shortly after 4 p.m., the restart
finally came, but radar indicated only an hour-long window to
complete 103 more laps, which would complete half of the event and
make it official.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who led the first 38 laps of the race, was back in front
on the restart and led 12 laps. There were eight lead changes
between five drivers over the next 63 laps, but when all the
remaining cars made their final green-flag pit stop on lap 119,
Burton had the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   And Burton gained it by gambling. On lap 114, Burton and Dale
Jarrett, who finished fourth, were the only drivers to make pit
stops. Burton, who was running third at the time, beat Jarrett off
pit road and pulled away shortly thereafter. Gordon, Mayfield and
Mark Martin pitted one lap later, but they could never challenge
Burton the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gordon) had newer tires (at the end),'' Burton said. ``He
would have been stronger on the long runs. If the caution had come
out while we were in the pits, we would have been a lap down. It
was a gamble based on the rain coming.''

 &HT;    Labonte lasts 44 laps
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Despite driving with a broken right shoulder
blade, Bobby Labonte lasted 44 laps in Sunday's TranSouth 400 at
Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding to relief driver Matt Kenseth only one lap before
a nearly three-hour rain delay, Labonte watched his No. 18 Pontiac
finish 10th in the rain-shortened event, which helped him remain in
the top five in standings points, only 26 behind leader Jeff
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte was expected to drive only one lap in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby wasn't feeling very good so we were lucky to get that
first rain,'' said Kenseth, a Busch series driver who plans on
jumping to the Winston Cup circuit next season. ``We were also
lucky to get that long green because pitting on the backstretch was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who was injured in an accident during Friday's pole
qualifying, led the 44th lap before the driver change one lap
later. When the race restarted following the rain delay, Kenseth
was in the 34th postion, but he made his way through the field
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Bobby could make it as long as he could in the race
car,'' Kenseth said. ``We had good pit stops and a fast race car.
I'm glad I did well and didn't hit the wall and was able to give
them a decent finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte expansion
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Motor Speedwayin Charlotte, the nation's second-largest
auto track, will get even larger. Seating at the track will grow in
the next eight years by 62 percent from 157,000 seats to just over
255,000 seats. By 2007, Speedway Motorsports Inc., which owns the
facility, plans on having seats completely surrounding the 1.5-mile
track. Speedway officials have already added 40,000 seats since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an exploding business, and we're in a strong growth
curve,'' said H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, the speedway's president and
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to jump on it and be very aggressive, because the
day will come when it slows down.''
</P>
<P>
   School spirit
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin will debut a paint scheme honoring Tennessee's
national title in college football in three Busch series races. The
skirt of the predominantly orange Chevrolet will feature the orange
and white checkerboard pattern, much like that of the end zones in
Knoxville's Neyland Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin will race the car in events at Nashville on April 3 and
Bristol, Tenn., on April 10 and Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been a UT fan for as long as I can remember,''
said Marlin, a native of Franklin, Tenn. ``We're even inviting the
coaches to come to the races and cheer us on from the pits. If we
could get one of those linemen under the car, we probably wouldn't
need a jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Pit stops
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet officials, who were hoping to debut the `99 Monte
Carlo at the Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis on Aug. 7, now say the
car probably won't race this season. ... It didn't take Gordon long
to lap the No. 66 Ford of Waltrip. Gordon lapped Waltrip on lap 25,
then passed him a second time only 13 laps later. ... When Derrike
Cope failed to qualify for the second time this season, Bryan Foods
moved its sponsorship to the No. 90 Ford of owner Junie Donlavey.
Bryan says it's sticking by Cope for the long term, though. ...
Utah Jazz guard John Stockton isn't the only pro athlete from
Gonzaga. Jack Roush Racing driver Chad Little, a native of Spokane,
Wash., is a graduate of the Gonzaga School of Law. ... Former
points leader Mike Skinner struggled, finishing 32nd and two laps
behind the lead-lap cars. He fell to fifth in the standings points,
66 behind Burton. ... Tony Stewart got his first top-10 finish at
sixth and was the highest-finishing rookie for the fourth time this
season. ... By finishing 41st on Sunday, Waltrip dropped out of the
top 25 in owner points, meaning he'll have qualify on speed next
week at Texas to make the field.

IT'S ONLY ROCK AND BUSINESS, BUT THEY LIKE IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As an opening line, ``Please allow me to introduce
myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste'' is hard to beat. But when
the Rolling Stones play two dates at Boston's FleetCenter this
week, Mick Jagger's lyric could be borrowed by a mutual-fund
manager cozying up to a prospective client.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of concert seats priced at $300 apiece, and $650
individual ticket packages that add perks like a backstage buffet,
exclusive parking, and autographed merchandise, the live album from
this high-rollers' Stones tour ought to be titled ``Get Yer
Platinum Card Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks into the group's 20-city tour, concert figures
already read like a Microsoft quarterly report, with the band
itself grossing around $2 million per date. The cheapest
FleetCenter seat costs $39.50. A Rod Stewart concert earlier this
month set a FleetCenter record of $85 a seat. The Stones shows are
obliterating that mark with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy was, `Will it work?' And it did work,'' says
local promoter Don Law, noting that both shows are sold out save
for a few $300 tickets to Monday night's concert.
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for sweet irony? Three decades ago, when the
Stones were rolling in notoriety, not dough, fans typically traded
in illegal substances and political tracts at their concerts.
Today, they're more apt to be dealing in account commissions and
strategic partnerships. ``Sticky Fingers,'' the title of the band's
seminal 1971 album, has taken on a whole new meaning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Durant, chief executive officer of Techprint Inc. in
Lawrence, a specialty printer, snapped up six tickets to Monday
night's VIP reception. A longtime Stones fan, Durant, 57, calls the
outing with friends ``purely social'' but says if the chance to do
a little networking arises, well, he just might get some
entrepreneurial satisfaction, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales is a 24-hour deal, and everyone you encounter is a
potential customer,'' he says. ``You never know who you'll wind up
talking to. This could be an interesting crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   FleetCenter president Richard Krezwick agrees that part of the
VIP package appeal lies in its potential for winning friends and
influencing clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to put that prestige ticket in one of their
customer's hands,'' says Krezwick. ``For us, the goal isn't the
event's bottom line. It's to produce goodwill for our own preferred
customers, so they will renew (seat licenses and luxury-suite
leases).''
</P>
<P>
   He equates what Jagger &AMP; Co. offer to well-heeled fans to what
Disney World provides its customers, an analogy that would have put
diehard Stones fans in a coma 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk up to the Disney window and think tickets are
expensive,'' Krezwick explains. ``But when you leave the park, you
only think about what a good time you had, not what you spent. It's
the same for a Stones show here.''
</P>
<P>
   One hallmark of the No Security Tour is that graying fans with
green to spend have more than just ``Honky-Tonk Women'' on their
minds. The same crowd that's jockeying for Ryder Cup golf and Major
League All-Star Game invitations this summer is buying up, and in
some cases writing off, high-priced Stones tickets as business
expenses. Whether the draw is guitarist Ron Wood or golfer Tiger
Woods, it's much the same phenomenon: gaining access to a coveted
event that caters to those with the means to impress.
</P>
<P>
   As rock tours have become more corporation-driven, so has the
fan base for venerable acts including the Stones, Jimmy Buffett,
and the Eagles. With those fans not just aging but prospering,
concert promoters are delivering the same level of service that
patrons of golf tournaments and major museum openings have come to
expect. Claude Monet, meet Keith Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at these Stones shows are bragging about how much they
paid for their tickets,'' says Bob Grossweiner, senior editor at
Performance magazine. ``The Stones are definitely going after the
people with money. They're not going after the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The oldsters are going after Broadway prices,'' adds Gary
Bongivanni, editor of the trade magazine Pollstar.
</P>
<P>
   Boomer troubadour Jimmy Buffett, who recently played the Fleet,
offered $400 packages to his fans, similar to what the Stones'
promoters are marketing. All the VIP tickets sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tickets are in such demand because people use them to
entertain other people,'' says Buffett, who knows plenty about the
corporate schmoozing game. ``I went to the Super Bowl this year
and, honestly, how many real football fans ever get to go to the
Super Bowl? The reality is that I go to my shows and see fans in
the front row and I'll say, `How did you get those tickets?'
They'll say, `Oh, we just buy them from scalpers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Buffett: ``Do I sit here as an artist and say, `Do I want a
piece of a $400 ticket that the scalpers are going to get anyway?'
And the answer is, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference between a Stones concert and an event like the
Super Bowl is that rock shows have historically postured as
anti-establishment gatherings _ even if the performers themselves
were raking in more than Goldman, Sachs partners. The Stones, who
once sang ``Street Fighting Man'' as an anthem of defiance, now
ride into cities such as Boston on streets paved with gold. The
irony of the band's rebel image playing to an Armani-clad crowd is
not lost on industry veterans such as Peter Wolf, who once sang
lead in Boston's own J. Geils Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when selling even a T-shirt at a concert was
considered vulgar. No serious musician would dream of that,'' says
Wolf, adding that he has spurned six-figure offers to turn his
songs into advertising pitches. ``Now many people think that if
your song is used in a commercial, it's an accreditation. ...
Twenty years ago, they would have thought you had sold out. Now,
it's a case of `Hey, that's cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   Music historian James Isaacs, who won't be attending a Stones
show this week (``I wouldn't pay $5 to see them,'' he says), likens
big-ticket rockfests to the luxury-box syndrome that has infected
sports _ where, according to Isaacs, people go less to see the game
than to do deals, high above courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I queasy about this?'' Isaacs asks. ``Not really. Our
generation was the one that was going to change everything. But
Woodstock wasn't a beginning, it was an end. Everything since has
moved from the event to the marketing of the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat that to rabid Stones fans such as Kevin Phelan and Tony
Pelusi, and they might say, `Who cares?' Both have tickets to see
the band in concert for the first time. They will occupy seats that
cost what a decent used family car did when the Stones first toured
America in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Phelen, a real estate executive who's in his early 50s, worries
mostly about what to wear. ``Do I dress up or down? That's the
question. After all, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelusi, a 46-year-old Cambridge lawyer, is taking his brother
and two friends to the show. ``I've never been motivated, or had
the financial ability, to see the Stones in concert before,'' he
says. ``Since this could be their last tour, if I'm going, I want
the best seats I can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend _ a chiropractor _ also bought tickets, says
Pelusi. Asked if a Stones concert sounds like a promising place for
his friend to drum up business, Pelusi laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until you mentioned it,'' he says.

EDITORIAL: PRIMAKOV COMES CALLING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, March 22:
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months that he has been Russian prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov has restored a measure of stability to his shaken
nation. Under his cautious leadership, Russia has avoided the civil
unrest and collapse of central authority that seemed possible in
the chaotic days after the ruble was devalued last summer. But as
Primakov heads to Washington this week, he remains a caretaker
figure with a socialist tint who is mostly marking time until a new
president, possibly Primakov himself, is elected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, a wily but amiable veteran of the Soviet bureaucracy,
has little governing latitude. He is caught between an ailing and
erratic president, Boris Yeltsin, and a benighted and cranky
Parliament dominated by Communists. Primakov has navigated these
rapids by pursuing a foreign and domestic agenda that recalls
Mikhail Gorbachev's early years in power, when he was still
confident he could make socialism work and assert Soviet power
abroad while diminishing tensions with the West.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign affairs, his area of expertise, Primakov has pressed
traditional Russian security interests in Europe, Asia and the
Middle East more vigorously than Yeltsin's previous prime
ministers, but has not so far fulfilled fears in Washington that he
would oppose the United States at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, he is working with the Clinton
administration on several fronts to limit the spread of nuclear
weapons and technology, one of the issues he will discuss with
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. The escalating crisis in Kosovo
promises to test his tolerance for cooperation with the United
States, especially if NATO takes military action against Serbia, a
longtime Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's economic program borrows heavily from failed Soviet
formulas without entirely giving up on the market forces that have
developed in Russia in recent years. This is hardly surprising,
since the price for his confirmation by Parliament was that he
place economic policy primarily in the hands of Yuri Maslyukov, a
Communist retread.
</P>
<P>
   The government is still failing to collect taxes and operating
with a budget plan that bears little relation to economic
realities. Over time, these policies will further stunt
development, and they have done nothing to reverse the economic
decline that accelerated last fall. But they have eased the
financial panic that threatened to engulf the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because Russia has not printed enough rubles to pay all its
bills, inflation has not risen out of control. Many Russians are
thankful for the relative calm, and relieved that Primakov is
concerned about the inequities produced by Russia's unbridled,
criminal-infested brand of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, and in
discussions about how Russia will treat the creditors who made the
mistake of lending to it last year, Primakov's government has taken
a surprisingly haughty attitude. It has delayed telling the
creditors how they will be able to invest the small amount of money
they are being allowed to recover and has demanded that the IMF
provide new loans without asking too many questions. Clinton and
the IMF should resist this pressure until Primakov puts the economy
back on a reform path and the IMF is satisfied that its loans will
not be diverted to private, off-shore bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, like his predecessors, can never be sure whether
Yeltsin suddenly will fire him. The political turmoil in Moscow
over Yeltsin's effort to dismiss the country's top prosecutor, Yuri
Skuratov, has added to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   In such conditions, Primakov and his countrymen will be
fortunate to get to the next presidential election without another
change of cast in the Kremlin. Given the dangers of political
instability in a nation with thousands of nuclear weapons, that may
be the most Washington can hope for as well.  &QL;

GRECO MUST STEP UP FOR UCLA WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UCLA is counting on history to repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, point guard Tyus Edney's injured wrist kept him out of
the NCAA championship game, but the Bruins prevailed behind Ed
O'Bannon's leadership and capable play by Cameron Dollar at the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Bruins women (26-7) meet Louisiana Tech (29-2) in
the West Regional final at 9:07 in the Sports Arena. To the victor
goes the Final Four berth Friday in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Erica Gomez probably won't play, having sprained her
right ankle and suffered ligament damage just 35 seconds into
Saturday's game with Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   So the third-seeded Bruins know in order to beat the top-seeded
Lady Techsters _ something UCLA has never done in nine tries _ they
will need the leadership of Maylana Martin and Janae Hubbard. They
will need to stay out of foul trouble, as they did Saturday night
when Hubbard scored 21 points and took 16 rebounds, and the team
took 26 offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   And they need freshman Michelle Greco.
</P>
<P>
   Greco is the Crescenta Valley graduate making just her third
start of the season. She proved she was capable Saturday night,
when she played 39 minutes, 25 seconds with just two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greco, she was the MVP of the game,'' Tech coach Leon Barmore
said. ``The kid makes two turnovers, two assists. Colorado State is
jumping up and down, pressing, and she had two turnovers. That girl
impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana Tech, the Bruins will face a press unlike anything
they have seen this season in the Pac-10. The Lady Techsters thrive
on pressuring, causing turnovers, and running the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Amanda Wilson leads with 16.3 points and 7.9 rebounds a
game, followed by junior guard Tamicha Jackson with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Greco has seen this kind of pressure before, at Tennessee on
Dec. 21. She didn't start that game but said Sunday she was
displeased with the way she handled it then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look to get the ball to everyone and not put so much on
Michelle,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said. ``(Saturday) it wasn't
like we needed Michelle to touch the ball all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins must also use their height advantage and slow the
tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our offense is forcing some turnovers so we can get
some easy baskets,'' Barmore said. ``If we can't put pressure on
them, we can't beat them. It's got to be pressure defense. We can't
back up and be passive, or it won't be a contest.''

DUKE RETURNS TO FINAL FOUR AFTER A FOUR-YEAR ABSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 BY JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ One is a self-described money player who
got that way on the glass-strewn, double-rimmed playgrounds of East
St. Louis, Ill. The other is a long-range sharpshooter who honed
his eye on the polished hardwood in Alaskan gyms. Before Chris
Carrawell and Trajan Langdon could share a triumphant hug Sunday in
the final minute of a tussle with a determined Temple team, they
first had to share the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And they did, over and over, in Duke's 85-64 victory over the
Owls in the East Regional final that sent the Blue Devils (36-1) to
the Final Four in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament for the eighth time in Coach Mike Krzyzewski's 19 years.
Duke will play Michigan State next Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   It is a return trip that comes nearly a year to the day after
Duke blew an 18-point lead in the South Regional final against
Kentucky, and four years after Krzyzewski was sidelined with
fatigue and his program dangled in traction after a 13-18 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long time coming,'' said Langdon, a fifth-year
senior guard and the only mainstay of Duke's Final Four-less years.
``Coming back off the year where coach missed part of the season,
he was very disappointed. He has the most dedication of anyone in
the nation in getting the program back up. The motivation comes
from him and the team just follows.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils had to trust Langdon and Carrawell Sunday to
break down the Owls' matchup zone defense _ a shape-shifting zone
called Rover that allowed No. 6-seeded Temple to win at least some
categories on the statistic sheet. Temple had fewer turnovers, 10
to 14; more second-chance points, 22 to 11; and wrestled the
top-seeded Blue Devils under the glass for a 32-32 tie in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first half, the Owls (24-11) had the Blue Devils in
their first trouble of the tournament when they jumped out to a 9-5
lead by outhustling their higher-profile opponents. Langdon,
apparently, took it personally.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 11 consecutive points in the next 2 minutes 30
seconds, a streak that began with a graceful running one-hander and
was followed by three consecutive 3-pointers that were set up by
bone-rattling picks from Elton Brand, Chris Burgess and Shane
Battier.
</P>
<P>
   It was an outburst that keyed a 17-2 run and allowed the Blue
Devils to cruise into halftime with a 43-31 lead, despite Brand,
the consensus all-American, being held to just 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Temple Coach John Chaney had prepared his team to concede
long-range jumpers, but warned his players that Langdon needed an
opening the size of an eye of a needle to get his shot off. But
after the Duke guard torched his Owls for 23 points on 6-of-7
shooting _ including five 3-pointers _ even he appeared stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Langdon was going to hit shots, but you don't know how
well,'' said Chaney, who lost his fourth regional final in 11
years. ``He was coming off screens, twisting and hitting three
pointers over 6-10 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Carrawell told how he could watch tapes of upcoming
opponents and differentiate between suburban players and playground
types. He called his Langdon a ``picture-perfect suburban gym''
shooter. He said he knew Temple was a collection of city players,
like himself, that was intent on shutting down the Blue Devils'
inside game.
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell called himself a ``money player'' who had won a few
dollars against older guys on his East St. Louis playgrounds. He
predicted he might be able to hurt the Owls themselves. And he did,
by knifing his 6-foot-6-inch frame into the defense's massive guts
_ 6-10 Lamont Barnes, 6-9 Kevin Lyde and beefy 6-5 Mark Karcher _
and kicking the ball out to Langdon and Duke's other dead-eye
shooters. The Blue Devils found the bottom of the net 60 percent of
the time from the field and 58 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could get by them because they are so big,'' said
Carrawell, who had seven assists without a turnover. ``Then I
wanted to keep my head up and get the ball to the open man.''
</P>
<P>
   But the junior's play was far more complete than just setting
the table. He grabbed 7 rebounds, added 12 points and hounded
Karcher into 7-of-25 shooting and 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He arguably is as important as anybody on this team,''
Krzyzewski said o Carrawell. ``When he does his role at a high
level, we are an outstanding basketball team. When he plays like he
did today, it's beautiful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his roles is to be the level head of a young
super-talented team. With 10:35 left, the Owls cut Duke's lead to
10 points with full-court pressure. Carrawell quietly reminded his
teammates of how the Blue Devils blew that 18-point lead with nine
minutes left in last year's South Regional final in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he went to work. He harassed Karcher into a bad shot,
threaded a nifty bounce pass inside to Brand for a dunk, then got a
hand on a pass intended for Barnes. It was Barnes, whose 19 points,
6 rebounds and terrific defense on Brand (21 points), kept the
Owls' hopes alive. But by the time Carrawell was done, the Blue
Devils had snuffed the Owls' run and were on their way back to the
site of last year's heartbreak and another Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   So, with 41 seconds left, in front of the Duke bench, the
inner-city money player wrapped his arms around the shooter from
the Great White North. They both smiled. ``Last year, I was smiling
too early and we blew 18 points,'' Carrawell said. ``I looked up
and saw we were up 18 points and there were just a few ticks left.
I figured we were in the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week in Florida, they get the opportunity to write a few
more chapters.

 &HT;    Duke too hot for Owls
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ From John Chaney's perspective, the only
thing that will stop Duke from winning the NCAA championship is
divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever plans on beating them.... I just hope they believe in
the Lord,'' the Temple coach said after watching the No. 1 Blue
Devils overwhelm his Owls 85-64 Sunday for the East Regional
championship at Continental Airlines Arena. ``Beyond that I have no
idea how you can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (36-1) extended its school-record winning streak to 31
games and gave coach Mike Krzyzewski his eighth Final Four
appearance since 1986 and fifth this decade. The Blue Devils will
play Michigan State in Saturday's semifinals in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Duke's first Final Four appearance since 1994 and
comes just four seasons after the program hit rock bottom in 1995
with a 13-18 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming. What a great, great feeling,''
said senior guard Trajan Langdon, who hit 6 of 7 shots (5 of 6 from
3-point range) and finished with 23 points. Langdon, who scored 24
in the semifinal victory against Southwest Missouri State on
Friday, was selected the regional's most outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (24-11), winless in four regional finals under Chaney,
could not overcome a Duke team that shot 60 percent (69.6 in first
half) against one of the nation's best defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, the No. 6 seed, had held its first three NCAA opponents
to fewer than 55 points and had given up 70 points only three times
in 34 games while holding teams to 37.8 percent shooting. It was
the most points Temple has ever allowed in an NCAA Tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought that we were the only team in our bracket
that could beat them,'' Chaney said. ``We played as well as we
could play. If we had shot a little better it might have looked
better. But the results would have still been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which has won its four tournament games by an average of
30 points, had too many weapons for Temple to defend. When the Owls
shut off center Elton Brand inside, Langdon went on a tear of 11
consecutive points in the first half. When they finally got a
defender on Langdon, Brand pounded Temple inside to finish with 21
points and eight rebounds. When they put pressure on point guard
William Avery, forward Chris Carrawell split the Owls' defense for
12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a lot better than anyone we've played,'' Temple
guard Rasheed Brokenborough said. ``Every time we stopped one
thing, they came up with something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Up 43-31 at halftime, Duke quickly stretched the lead to 61-41
on a Langdon 3-pointer with 14:36 left. That's when Temple put
together its only meaningful run, a 13-3 spurt that cut it to 64-54
with 10:25 left. Temple could get no closer as Duke regained
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never worried,'' said Avery, who scored 13. ``This team
does not panic.''

 &HT;    Langdon's timing as good as his touch
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When Duke won three games without Trajan
Langdon after he injured his left foot in the ACC Tournament, some
suggested the Blue Devils were so talented they really didn't need
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this proves we need him,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski said
after Langdon scored 23 points in the East Regional championship
against Temple. ``We really, really need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's talented but young team had a chance to get rattled
early, falling behind 9-5. That'r when Langdon took control,
scoring 11 consecutive points, including three 3-pointers in a row,
to help put his team up 16-11.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's scoring had a calming effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little nervous at the beginning, but Trajan
wasn't,'' Krzyzewski said. ``...What he did was bigger than the
points. Instinctively, he knew he had to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's teammates agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit those 3-pointers, he probably didn't have to hit a
shot the rest of the game,'' forward Chris Carrawell said. ``It
just opened everything else up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games, Langdon has hit 15 of 21 shots, including
9-for-12 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell our guys that he could look at the basket
through the eye of a needle and get his shot off,'' Temple coach
John Chaney said. ``He is absolutely one of the best pure shooters
I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Milestones for Krzyzewski
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski moved into a tie with former UCLA coach John Wooden
for second on the career NCAA Tournament victory list with 47. In
first place is Krzyzewski's old nemesis, former North Carolina
coach Dean Smith, who had 65 wins. This is Krzyzewski's eighth
Final Four appearance, which is third behind Wooden (12) and Smith
(11).
</P>
<P>
   One for the highlight reel
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enduring images of this tournament is bound to
be a dunk on a follow shot by Duke freshman Corey Maggette with 2.5
seconds left in the first half. It came off a miss by William
Avery. Maggette jumped over several players in front of him.
``That,'' Krzyzewski said, ``was pretty awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At home in New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   Duke has advanced to the Final Four five times by winning the
East Regional in East Rutherford. N.J. The others were in 1986,
'88, '89 and '90, and Duke is 10-0 in NCAA games played here.

 &HT;    Duke joins Spartans in St. Pete
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Two of the teams will play a rematch of
a tough December game. Two of the coaches will renew their lopsided
rivalry. Those are just a couple of the story lines for the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Duke (36-1) defeated Temple 85-64 Sunday in the East
Regional final to advance to its fifth Final Four of the decade.
The Blue Devils will meet Michigan State (33-4), which knocked off
defending national champion Kentucky 73-66 Sunday in the Midwest
Regional. The two teams previously met on Dec. 2 in Chicago, with
Duke winning 73-67.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's other semifinal in St. Petersburg, Ohio State
(27-8), the South Regional champion, will meet Connecticut (32-2),
the West Regional champ. Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien was 0-18
against UConn's Jim Calhoun when he was at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at Saturday's games:
</P>
<P>
   _ Duke vs. Michigan State: With their victory against Temple,
the Blue Devils have won 31 consecutive games. But they have had
some challenges along the way. One of those came three months ago
against Michigan State, the Big Ten champion.
</P>
<P>
   In that regular-season meeting, Duke jumped to a 17-point lead
in the first half and then held on despite getting out-rebounded
41-25. Duke held Mateen Cleaves, the Big Ten Player of the Year, to
3-for-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better than we were in December,'' Michigan State coach
Tim Rizzo said. ``Unfortunately, Duke's a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is in its first Final Four since 1979, when Magic
Johnson led the Spartans to the national championship over Indiana
State and Larry Bird. Duke is in its first Final Four since 1994
and its fifth in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ UConn vs. Ohio State: After losing three regional finals under
Calhoun, UConn has finally reached its first Final Four. Ohio State
is in the Final Four for the first time since 1968, when the
Buckeyes lost to North Carolina in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it will be a matchup of two of the nation's
best backcourts: Ohio State's Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd vs.
UConn's Khalid El-Amin and Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   THE FINAL FOUR

RUSSELL ROSS, PIONEER IN ARTERY RESEARCH, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wash., Calif., Fla.)   By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Ross, a medical researcher whose theories radically
changed the understanding of why arteries harden, died Thursday at
the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. He was 69
and lived in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ross had been suffering from cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades Ross explored atherosclerosis, a
primary cause of heart attacks and strokes, at the university's
medical school. He was best known for a series of discoveries about
it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he advanced the proposition, now widely accepted, that
atherosclerosis begins with an injury to the lining of the artery
that may be caused by anything from cholesterol to bacteria. Over
the years, he demonstrated the role that platelets play in forming
the clots that can result from those injuries, and he later showed
that the process might be halted with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard A. Rifkind, chairman of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute for Cancer Research in New York, said Ross had
revolutionized the thinking about atherosclerosis. Rifkind, who
studied with Ross at Columbia University in the 1950s, recalled
that doctors at that time believed cholesterol played a role in the
disease, but thought that ``it somehow got stuck in your arteries
and clogged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the extent of the vision of what atherosclerosis was
all about,'' Rifkind said. ``What Ross contributed was a complete
paradigm, a frame shift, to look at atherosclerosis as a cellular
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross graduated from Columbia in 1955 with a degree in dentistry.
Surrounded by some of the most interesting medical research of his
time, he surveyed the prospect of a dental career _ and
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really did not want to be putting fillings in people's
mouths,'' said a friend, David P. Hajjar, dean of the Graduate
School of Medical Science at Cornell University. ``He really wanted
to be studying heart disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and his wife, the former Jean Teller _ whom he met at
Columbia, where she was an occupational therapist _ decided to move
to Seattle so that he could earn a doctorate in experimental
pathology at the University of Washington. After receiving his
degree in 1962, he stayed on at the university, eventually becoming
chairman of the pathology department.
</P>
<P>
   Ross initially studied the process by which wounds heal. But he
gradually shifted his focus to atherosclerosis. Claire W. Raines, a
researcher who worked with Ross at his Seattle laboratory, said she
believed his early work on the healing of wounds gave him a
different perspective on blockages in arteries.
</P>
<P>
   After helping to develop a technique to culture the smooth
muscle cells that form the walls of the arteries, Ross examined
what happened as the vessels, in response to injury, began to
harden. His theory became widely known as the response-to-injury
hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first to try to focus attention on the blood vessel
walls, rather than the contents of the blood,'' said Dr. Michael A.
Gimbrone Jr., a pathology professor at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Ross announced that he had identified a protein
that seemed to play a key role in atherosclerosis. The protein,
platelet-derived growth factor, is released by the body in response
to an injury to the blood vessel, and helps the wound heal. But in
patients suffering from hardening of the arteries, he found,
something in the healing process goes amiss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ross again drew attention when he announced that
administering an antibody to laboratory animals significantly
reduced the blockages that often occur after angioplasty, in which
a balloonlike instrument is used to clear blocked arteries.
Although the surgery clears the blockages, it can also damage the
blood-vessel walls.
</P>
<P>
   The antibody has not yet been tested in humans. But medical
experts believe it is only a matter of time before drugs and other
interventions, all the result of Ross' work, become available.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ross was born on May 25, 1929, in St. Augustine, Fla.,
the son of Samuel and Minnie Duboff Ross. He grew up in
Jacksonville and graduated from Cornell University before going to
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Douglas, of
San Francisco, and a daughter, Valerie, of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, Ross' research colleague for more than two decades, said
the various projects in which he was involved would go forward at
the University of Washington laboratory, which she said had no
official name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always answered the phone, `Ross Laboratory,''' Raines
said. ``And I don't think I'm going to change that.''

WAREHOUSE MAY EASE CONGESTION AT THREE LIBRARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ohio, Pa.)  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia University is double-stacking library books,
stashing them in every nook and cranny. Princeton is stowing books
out of sequence that could no longer be crammed in where they
belonged. And the New York Public Library is projecting that it
will run out of space for its research collections by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing out books is not an option. Nor is cutting off
acquisitions or finding more contiguous space.
</P>
<P>
   So the three institutions _ owners of three of the largest book
collections in the New York metropolitan area _ are planning to
create a climate-controlled, no-frills library warehouse near
Princeton, N.J., where they can send some of their least-used
books, periodicals and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will be able to receive articles and book excerpts
electronically from the storage library the same day; other
material will be delivered within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a desperate attempt to cope with the explosion in
books, journals and other hard-copy material _ a crisis facing
research libraries everywhere. The proliferation of digital media,
librarians say, has done little to ease that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three libraries have digital programs,'' said William
Walker, senior vice president and the Andrew W. Mellon director of
the Research Libraries at the New York Public Library, which add
about 200,000 books and other materials to their 40-million-item
collections annually. ``But we also think the artifact has great
importance to the scholar, and the digital representation does not
replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the three institutions also plan to work together to
convert more of their materials to electronic form, they are racing
ahead on the storage library, which is expected to be built in
Plainsboro, N.J. They hope to open in less than two years. The
first phase, which will cost more than $15 million, will include
three storage rooms, each with a capacity of about 2 million
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Books and other materials will be filed by size and shape rather
than by subject or author, the traditional method. Each will have
its own bar code and they will be stored in boxes on long trays
stacked 30 feet high. Researchers will be able to browse through an
electronic catalog from their offices and send requests
electronically to the warehouse, where workers will retrieve the
materials, riding a cherry picker to reach those stored high up.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium will maximize space by removing duplicates where
possible. Each institution will share the costs based on its use of
the warehouse, and the three founding members hope to invite other
institutions to join them, to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   One clear disadvantage is that scholars will not be able to
wander through the stacks, thumbing through old volumes, looking
for serendipitous discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is kind of a learning curve that people go through in
getting used to this,'' said Curtis Kendrick, director of access
services for the Columbia libraries. ``The first choice is to build
a brand-new library in the middle of campus with all sorts of fancy
technology. But the cost is prohibitive. And once they understand
that won't happen, depositories are seen as a good solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other research libraries have paved the way. Harvard
University was one of the first, and its 13-year-old depository,
located about 30 miles from Cambridge, Mass., is the model for the
New York area project. Other universities, including Cornell, Ohio
University and the University of Pennsylvania, have either built or
are building similar book depositories.

OIL CHIEFS EXUDE OPTIMISM ON PLANS TO CUT PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

VIENNA, Austria _ OPEC oil ministers began arriving here Sunday for
their spring meeting, voicing confidence that they will quickly be
able to ratchet down oil production in an effort to boost world
crude prices.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the 11-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, as well as officials from Mexico and other
non-OPEC oil-producing nations, are expected to ratify an accord
reached earlier this month to pull more than 2 million barrels a
day off global markets.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi, flush from a Saturday
meeting with other Persian Gulf producers, told reporters he
expects the parties to fully implement the proposed cuts within a
month. Libyan Energy Minister Abdalla Salem El-Badri said he
expects compliance even earlier, by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the members are agreed ... and will comply with the
agreement,'' said Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Few oil analysts, however, believe this coalition of OPEC and
nonaffiliated producers actually will meet the 2 million-barrel
goal, which would represent about 2.7 percent of world production.
The OPEC producers alone would account for about 1.7 million
barrels of that reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, struck by the role OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia
played in spearheading the accord, are convinced they will follow
through with a sizable production cut of at least 1 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   For Saudi Arabia, the agreement will mean cutting production by
585,000 barrels a day, pushing the kingdom's production below an 8
million-barrel floor for the first time since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saudis, facing the prospect of government revenues
plunging by a third if crude prices do not recover, decided
propping up prices was a greater priority. Saudi Arabia loses about
$2.5 billion in annual revenues for every $1 drop in the price of
crude.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials, in a sign of their growing cooperation with
the OPEC producers, are joining the summit. Mexico has been a key
player in all three efforts over the last year to cut production in
a bid to kick up prices.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure oil ministers would arrive in Vienna with a deal
already in hand, the Saudis agreed to a key concession demanded by
Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer and Saudi Arabia's chief
rival. The Iranians insisted that Tehran be allowed to cut
production from a starting point of 3.6 million barrels, rather
than a 3.3 million-barrel baseline that the Saudis and others would
have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations about the production cuts have helped send crude
prices up more than 10 percent in less than two weeks. On Friday,
oil for delivery in April rose 24 cents to close at $15.24 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam Sharief, director of energy policy for Hornsby &AMP; Co., a
Houston-based energy risk management services firm, estimates crude
prices could rise to $18 or even $20 a barrel by the fourth quarter
if the parties were to comply with only 75 percent of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to trim production is complicated, however, by Iraq's
effort to expand its production capacity. Iraq's production is
restricted by sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council and
its own production constraints in the wake of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad is producing far less than U.N. sanctions would allow
for the purchase of much-needed food and medicine. Iraqi Oil
Minister Amer Rasheed said Sunday that his country already is
producing about 2.7 million barrels a day and plans to expand
production by another 200,000 barrels or so by the end of the year.

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Talk about Elite Eight contrasts. On the one hand
there's Georgia and Andy Landers, sometimes churlish, sometimes
charming, trying to take another team of Lady Bulldogs to the
familiar terrain of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Iowa State and the eternally giddy Bill
Fennelly, who moved to his native state on a lark four years ago,
even took a pay cut and figured if resurrecting a woeful program
didn't pan out, he could always get a job at his brother's tavern
in Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the old guard of the SEC and the new
kid on the block from the Big 12 tangle at the Shoemaker Center
tonight in the Mideast Regional finals.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan ``40 minutes from the Final Four'' rolls easily off
Fennelly's lips, as easily as when he talked about the task of
toppling top-seeded and high-profile Connecticut on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After Iowa State sent the glamor girl Huskies packing, he
pondered his, and his program's, first foray into the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I never knew if I'd get here,'' said Fennelly,
who coached Toledo to six 20-win seasons and three NCAA trips.
``It's a dream come true. We've won 25 games and have gotten this
far, and I think we now have some credibility that we didn't have
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia perennially is faced with living up to its lofty
accomplishments as one of only four programs to go to at least four
Final Fours. But Landers has made any more talk about playing next
weekend in San Jose _ which the Lady Dogs did after beating Clemson
on Saturday _ strictly verboten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset because their minds have wandered away from what's
in front of us,'' Landers said. ``Instead of thinking about the
challenge of Iowa State, they're thinking about being one step away
from the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   His players got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name `Georgia' establishes a target on our back,'' guard
Kiesha Brown said. ``But as far as Cinderella teams go, I don't
believe all that. Every team that's here now is supposed to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones, second in the country in 3-point shooting all
season, made five of six 3-pointers in a three-minute stretch to
stun UConn. Unlike Georgia, they're not fast, athletic or deep, but
they have a habit of sticking around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if other teams are going to overlook us
anymore,'' Iowa State forward Monica Huelman said.

   Late one afternoon on Madison Avenue, I fell into step behind
two young people apparently heading home, as was I, from a day at

``looking for a color printer, copier and fax.'' Mrs. Adler,
increasingly angry as she descended each step, called out, ``And
I'm looking for a boy who is going to get A's on his report card.''
At this, Michael looked up and retorted, ``Then I suggest you look
into adoption.''

Robert Wagner and his wife were to be hosts to the shah of Iran and
Queen Soraya at City Hall at noon. But, the caller said, he had
just discovered that ``someone forgot to send out invitations to
the prelunch reception.'' Could I bring a couple of dozen

left the exalteds to resume our humdrum lives across the street.

LONG-SHOT BADGE TROUNCES FAVORITES IN GOTHAM STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his 7{-length, come-from-behind victory over favored
Apremont in the Gotham Stakes on Sunday, Badge proved he could do
more than handle six furlongs on the inner track at Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   But was the victory, Badge's fourth in his last five starts,
enough to propel the 3-year-old chestnut colt into the Kentucky
Derby?
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Bridgmohan, Badge's jockey, said he would love a trip to
Churchill Downs on the first Saturday of May, and for James Vena of
Southbelle Stable, who bought Badge as a yearling partly because
the colt reminded him of Secretariat, it would be a dream come
true.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the colt's trainer, Joe Aquilino, wants to
concentrate on the next step _ the $600,000 Wood Memorial on April
10, a race won by Badge's sire, Air Forbes Won, who also took the
Gotham in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I want to see how he comes out of this race, but he
looks terrific and I don't expect any problems,'' Aquilino said.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few problems for Badge in the one-mile Gotham,
which was expected to pit the California-based Apremont, winner of
his first two starts by a combined 11{ lengths, against the John
Kimmel-trained Successful Appeal, winner of the Cowdin last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Apremont, who finished second, ran as expected _ at least
until the final 200 yards _ Successful Appeal ran into trouble on
the turn and was not a factor in the drive to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgmohan, meanwhile, allowed Badge to settle toward the back
of the 11-horse field during the early going as Apremont set
fractions of 22 1/5 seconds and 44 3/5 while being pressed by the
long shot Country Deed.
</P>
<P>
   Badge moved into striking position on the turn, despite being
crowded near the three-eighths pole, gathered himself and powered
between horses to grab the lead in the stretch as Apremont began
drifting out badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw that hole, he went right for it,'' said
Bridgmohan, who then rode the colt to the wire in 1:34 3/4. ``I
think it says a lot about him to overcome that trouble and still
come back to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The long shot Robin Goodfellow finished third. Apremont did not
win for the first time for the trainer Ron McAnally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only his third race and he's still green,'' the jockey
Chris McCarron said. ``He doesn't know yet what he's supposed to do
out there. He puts that game face on and rolls. He was getting out
bad at the end; that's what concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Badge, who returned $25.60 for a $2 bet to win, earned $90,000
for his first graded-stakes victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the many reasons members of Congress gave for
attending a bipartisan civility retreat in Hershey, Pa., over the
weekend, Rep. John Dingell's was simplest: His wife made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation sounded a little too pat only if you had never
met the woman in question, a whirlwind of will as adamant about the
possibility of congressional healing as her husband was skeptical.
(``A prodigious waste of my time,'' he grumbled.)
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Dingell not only suggested Hershey as a family-friendly
location for the first bipartisan retreat two years ago and planned
many of the social activities this time around; she also wrote a
101-page master's thesis at Georgetown University last fall about
the discord rending Congress and ways to alleviate it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those ways, she said, was to give lawmakers and their
families exposure to one another away from Capitol Hill, where the
pace is too frenetic and the stakes too fraught for friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know each other,'' Mrs. Dingell said on Saturday
as she scuttled between events at the retreat. ``You can't feel a
sense of community if you don't know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as John Dingell, D-Mich., is the most senior member of the
House, where he has served for more than 40 years, Mrs. Dingell is
arguably its most ubiquitous spouse, her fingers in just about
everything, which seems to be the way she likes it.
</P>
<P>
   There is nary a spouse's committee she has not supervised, a
charity she has not patronized, a party she has not attended (and
probably, in fact, planned).
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, she is a throwback to an era when political
spouses, almost always women, tailored their lives to accommodate
and augment those of their mates. After she married Dingell 18
years ago, she switched political parties because, she said,
``there's no room for a Republican married to John Dingell.''
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Mrs. Dingell's experience illuminates the
problems facing the modern political spouse who maintains an
independent career and outlook. Her longtime job as an executive
with General Motors, a potent political force in Michigan,
continually raises questions about conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, her nascent advocacy for more stringent gun
control laws collides with her husband's position. When she called
the National Rifle Association ``a bunch of nuts,'' it outraged
some supporters of her husband, a former member of that
organization's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a political spouse, if you've got a good partnership,''
Mrs. Dingell said last week over breakfast in a Washington hotel,
``you never want to do anything to embarrass your husband.'' But,
she added, the high profile of such a role compels her to speak her
mind, even if her position on an issue contradicts her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingells make a striking pair. He is infamously gruff, 72
years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall; she is famously ingratiating,
45 and more than a foot shorter. He refers to her as ``the lovely
Deborah,'' using the formal version of her first name. She refers
to him as ``John Dingell,'' using both of his.
</P>
<P>
   They gush. Describing his wife as ``charming, beautiful,
intelligent,'' Dingell said, ``She packs more of those qualities
into that little body of hers than any woman I know.'' Mrs. Dingell
said, ``If anything ever happens to him, I'll die.''
</P>
<P>
   They met on an airplane 20 years ago, when his first marriage
lay in ruins and she had only been out of Georgetown University,
where she did her undergraduate work, for a few years. They were
wed in 1981, prompting Mrs. Dingell to ask General Motors to
reassign her from a job as a lobbyist to a less political position.
</P>
<P>
   She is now president of the General Motors Foundation, a
philanthropic wing of the corporation, and the couple divide their
time between houses in McLean, Va., and Dearborn, Mich., just
outside Detroit. They never added any children to the four that he
already had.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dingell grew up wealthy in Michigan, a descendant on her
mother's side of the Fishers who founded Body by Fisher. As the
oldest of four children, she was perhaps most attuned to what she
described as violent quarreling between her parents.
</P>
<P>
   She said her father, David Insley, kept a collection of firearms
and sometimes waved them around during these fights. Insley
confirmed that he owned guns but said he could not recall
brandishing them, then sighed: ``I didn't do a very good job of
parenting with guns, and I feel badly about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dingell described her subsequently peaceful years at a
convent boarding school as the seeds of her conviction about the
value of bipartisan retreats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nuns gave me a community and taught me about its
importance,'' she said. ``I think the House as an institution is a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she acknowledged, it is an increasingly fractured one. She
said that was partly because fewer spouses were moving to
Washington and getting involved in its routines. ``I think spouses
were a softening, or a glue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic and Republican aides privately grumbled that
Mrs. Dingell was more like an abrasive, always angling for credit
and glory, forever sniffing out power and serially befriending
anyone who had it. Then again, they conceded, that pretty much
summed up the average Washingtonian.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, there has long been speculation about Mrs.
Dingell's own political ambitions. She said that for now she was
content to be as much referee as player. But she added, ``Never say
never.''

COMMENTARY: THE LAGRANGIAN CODES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Editor's Note: PIFFIAB in graf 10 stands for the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board)   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though dead for nearly two centuries, Joseph Louis
Lagrange, the greatest French mathematician, is about to make news
in the developing Chinese espionage scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A book frequently checked out of the library at Los Alamos
National Laboratory is a seminal 1970s work by David Pierre
entitled ``Mathematical Programming via Augmented Lagrangians: an
Introduction to Computer Programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Montana, Pierre explained that Lagrange multipliers,
weighted with algebraic constraint equations, form composite
functions.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't help, so I read off a question that investigators of
China's penetration of our laboratories are now asking: ``How can
the Lagrangian codes be applied to the history of our nuclear tests
to develop, with supercomputers, three-dimensional modeling that
obviates the need for explosive tests?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better check with a physicist,'' said Pierre, a
mathematician unconnected with secrecy. ``They can model dynamic
systems _ like airplanes or missiles _ based on Lagrangian
functions. If they have a big enough computer, and a good enough
program _ and the benchmarks of previous tests _ they can
mathematically simulate what you're after.''
</P>
<P>
   In so checking, I was able to get an idea of the New Nuclear
Espionage, a spy system combining open dual-use purchasing with
clandestine collection, both protected by politico-diplomatic
enticements. This is a far cry from the simple stealing of specs
for the Soviets by the Rosenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the lax, sell-'em-anything decisions of the Clinton
White House and Commerce Department, China bought advanced
computers or their key components. That gave them the ``big enough
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then China's mathematicians and physicists were able to learn
from their friendly associates in the U.S. what types of augmented
Lagrangians were used in nuclear as well as missile programs, or
``codes.'' That gave them the ``good enough program.''
</P>
<P>
   Then into the Lagrangian-coded supercomputers went the
``benchmarks'' _ the experience of our tests as well as their own _
to give them the information on which to base their simulations.
Feed the benchmarks into the codes on the supercomputer, and _
presto! _ the People's Liberation Army leaps a decade ahead in its
the race to nuclear-weapon parity.
</P>
<P>
   That's my theory, based not on leaks but on common sense. When
the thousand-page Cox Committee investigative report is finally
cleared by a nervous National Security Council; when the CIA's
belated jeremiad assesses the damage caused by the derelict
guardians of our security; when Senate and House intelligence
committees issue reports, and when Piffiab conducts its usual
internal whitewash absolving the Clinton White House of creating a
culture of permissiveness to China's political, trade and
scientific penetrations _ we'll see if my theory holds heavy water.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we can expect the president to continue his
familiar legal obfuscations, where ``to the best of my knowledge''
he says he cannot be ``sure'' of any espionage at all. National
political-security adviser Samuel Berger will tell different
stories in public and in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, will lock e-mail barn
doors only after press pressure and will rely on misleading ``lie
detector'' tests (that the spy Aldrich Ames showed lead to false
security).
</P>
<P>
   But little by little, the interrelated truth will out. Logic
suggests that the theft of our W-88 MIRV'ed missile will be
followed, as the night the day, by news of the loss of the secrets
of our W-87 or W-89, whatever warhead technology that may be.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the much-maligned media. A column here remembering
the CIA mole Larry Wu-tai Chin on Jan. 2, 1997, was a howl in the
night, but shoe-leather reporting by Jeff Gerth in The Times on May
15 and 17, 1998, of Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying's penetrations pushed the
House into appointing the bipartisan Cox committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's still-secret findings then energized the Reno-restrained
FBI and the moribund DOE. Though The Washington Post is doing a
fine job on local coverage, NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and ABC's
``Nightline'' _ with The Times' Gerth, James Risen and editor
Stephen Engelberg in the lead _ have advanced this global story and
help protect your safety. Vive Lagrange!

PRESIDENT EMBARKING ON EARLY MONEY-RAISING DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after the November elections, Democratic
congressional leaders huddled with President Clinton to plot a
strategy for keeping the White House and recapturing the House and
Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides recruiting top-flight candidates for open seats and
unifying Democrats around an agenda, the consensus was to do one
other thing _ get Clinton out of the White House and on the money
trail as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the president has been freed from the threat to remove
him from office and relieved of the pressure to keep his
job-approval rating high during a sex scandal and impeachment, he
has increasingly turned his focus to raising money for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Party strategists say Clinton, always a prodigious fund-raiser,
has embarked on perhaps his earliest fund-raising start in a
non-election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a little different is the timing,'' one Democratic
strategist said. ``He's starting in the off-year rather than
waiting for the election year'' when the competition for campaign
cash will be more fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy of hosting coffees and overnight stays for
major Democratic donors in 1995 and 1996 backfired and led to
several investigations after his reelection.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the president seems to be leaving nothing to chance,
going to donors rather than having them come to him. With his vice
president and possibly his wife on ballots next year and with a
huge debt owed to Democrats who stood by him during the yearlong
scandal, he has taken to traveling across the country early to
raise money for fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics say fund-raising is about all that is left for
him to do, given he is in the next-to-last year of his presidency
and the attention paid to the presidential ambitions of Vice
President Al Gore and speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's
run for the Senate from New York. They also say the emphasis on
fund-raising is a function of a White House that has run out of
ideas and one without an urgency to showcase Clinton looking
presidential in the post-impeachment atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the impeachment process knocked a lot of wind out
of this administration,'' said Mark Rozell, who teaches political
science at the University of Pennsylvania's Washington campus.
``The danger is that during a period when he's trying to create a
legacy for the future, he's spending his time on what appears to
most of the country as petty politics, partisan politics, and
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president's defenders say politics has not taken a
backseat to policy, and Clinton is focused on both.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy works an incredible amount,'' said Douglas B. Sosnik,
a senior White House adviser. ``I don't think anybody in America
feels shortchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   After limiting his fund-raising activities in January and early
February during his Senate impeachment trial to just three events
in reliable Democratic turf _ Boston, New York, and Washington _
Clinton has broadened his travels, reaching out to donors across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his efforts have paid off. He has headlined fund-raisers
that collected more than $8.3 million for Democratic candidates
during what is traditionally the slowest period for raising
campaign money _ the first quarter of the year following an
election.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the president will again take his fund-raising show
on the road, traveling to Cincinnati and Las Vegas on Thursday and
to Los Angeles on Friday. On Tuesday, Clinton will appear at two
fund-raisers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the following three weeks, he will be featured at
fund-raisers in Detroit, Houston, Dallas, and Washington, as well
as Boston on April 16. And that schedule does not include any
planned trips to fill the campaign coffers of individual candidates
and state Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a Texarkana fund-raiser for Representative
Max Sandlin, a Texas Democrat, Clinton said, ``I can now go around
and I can go to fund-raisers like this and none of them are for me.
And I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I love the idea that if I can stay healthy, I can
spend quite a few years trying to give back to this political
system and to candidates and to people I believe in who have given
me so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategist Ed Rollins later countered, ``This is a
guy who would much rather be out being adored by partisan crowds
than sitting in the White House doing policy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not the first president to use his office as a
platform to raise money for his party or its candidates. In the
1970s, President Nixon actively campaigned and raised money for
Republican congressional candidates, said Norman Ornstein, a
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington
think tank. But President Reagan was the first to make a major
effort to raise money for his party, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon spent most of his fund-raising time raising money for
Nixon, though some of it was for specific congressional
candidates,'' Ornstein said. ``Reagan raised it for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton ``has been more active'' on the
fund-raising front, he said, ``but it really is a matter of scale.
He is, after all, a bit more energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of the $8.3 million Clinton has helped raise so far
this year has gone directly to the Democratic National Committee,
which would benefit Gore if he becomes the party's nominee for
president. The DNC is expected to spend some of the funds on
party-building activities, such as issue-advocacy ads that
highlight the Democrats' positions and also help sell the
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has committed to attend nine fund-raisers for the
Democratic Senatorial Committee and the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee that are expected to collect at least $9 million
as part of a campaign called ``Majority 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters said he is determined to use his
appeal to help the Democrats overcome the traditional disadvantge
of being outspent by Republicans. ``We've learned our lesson,''
said one senior Clinton aide. As a result, the aide said, ``You
will see us do a steady run this year of fund-raising.''

DISPUTE OVER HOMEWORK PRECEDED FATHER'S KILLING SPREE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Just before she was shot and killed, police said,
Maurice Young's 12-year-old daughter Jasmin begged for her life
when Young pointed a gun at her in her bedroom Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as police surrounded the apartment building where Young
lived with his common-law wife, Waleska Cruz, he shot and killed
his two other children, Jessica, 9, and Maurice, Jr., 6, at
point-blank range with a .357 revolver, before killing himself,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The triple-slaying stemmed from a dispute over his children's
homework that Young had last week with their mother, officials
said. Cruz managed to escape from their apartment at 35 Hammond
Street after knocking the gun from his hand, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence rocked a neighborhood of brightly-colored
three-story Victorian homes where residents heard the drama being
played out. Young, said neighbors, had been a good father with no
history of problems with his family or police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it went on for weeks,'' said state
Representative Anastasia Williams, who lived directly across the
street from Young, of the Saturday night incident, although police
say Young was only in the apartment for minutes before the
shootings. ``One of the kids said `No daddy! No daddy!' and then
you heard two shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taking also involved Cruz's sister, Veneza Vallejo,
her boyfriend, Edwin Lauriano, and their 10-year-old son, who had
arrived just that day from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The two adults were tied up but managed to escape from the
apartment while their son hid. He, too, was uninjured during the
killings. Williams said she'd heard a man on the corner screaming,
`Get my son out! Get my son out!''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who planned a vigil for the victims Sunday night, saw
police bring out the body of a young boy and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday, a shaken mayor, Vincent A. Cianci
Jr., said ``Can anybody fathom that, killing your own kids? This is
the mark of a deranged, strange, crazy man.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Cruz is being treated at Rhode Island Hospital for
stress and trauma. ``My guess is, if she didn't knock the gun out
of his hand and flee, she'd be dead too,'' Cianci added.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Young assaulted Cruz, then fled, after becoming
upset when he found one of his daughters doing homework at 6 a.m.
Tuesday. Cruz did not report the incident at the time, police said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz said she did not see Young again until Saturday night.
While Cruz dropped her two daughters off at a relative's East
Providence home, Young showed up.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Cruz told Young she was ending their
relationship. Later that night, Cruz's sister and her boyfriend and
their son arrived.
</P>
<P>
   At about that same time, Young went to the home of his cousin,
William Perry asking for a gun, police said, but Perry refused.
``Young then left, but a short time later, returned and assaulted
Perry with a hammer, all the while continuing to demand Perry give
him a gun,'' Cianci said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Young attempted to strangle Perry with an electrical
cord, but let him go when he found the gun. Young loaded the gun,
threatened Perry with it, and then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Young then traveled back to East Providence, awoke his
daughters, and brought them back to the family's second-floor
apartment. When Young arrived, only his son and 10-year-old cousin
were home. The adults had gone to the store for sodas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upon entering the house, the three adults were confronted by
Young who brandished a .357 revolver,'' Cianci said. After Cruz
knocked the gun away and fled, Young forced Lauriano to tie up his
girlfriend before Young tied Lauriano.
</P>
<P>
   Cianci said Jasmin then came out of her room but was brought
back there by Young. Soon thereafter, Lauriano and Vallejo heard a
gunshot but freed themselves and fled. When police, alerted by a
call from Cruz, got into the apartment, they found the four bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very nature of this violent act makes it
incomprehensible,'' said Cianci. ``It fills my heart and all of our
hearts with immense sadness.''.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who along with his family, was liked by neighbors, held a
full-time job as a teacher's assistant at Sackett Street elementary
school in Providence. ``He was a very good employee and received
excellent evaluations,'' said Dr. Robert DeRobbio, acting
superintendent of Providence schools.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors will be on hand Monday at Roger Williams Middle
School where Jasmin was a seventh-grader and at Carl Lauro
Elementary School where Jessica was a fourth-grader and Maurice,
Jr. was in first grade.
</P>
<P>
   Young's neighbors said they couldn't believe what had happened.
``That was the shocking part of it. That you wouldn't suspect
this,'' said Anastasia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   An upstairs neighbor was equally troubled by the killings. ``The
father seemed like a nice guy. I don't understand what went
wrong,'' said Chris Madison, 28, who has lived on the third floor
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her family and Young's family never visited each
other's homes, but often spoke to each other. She also described
the neighborhood as a ``wonderful quiet neighborhood. Everybody is
looking out for each other.''

 &HT;    Jack Tarver, former Atlanta Journal-Constitution publisher and
AP chairman, dies at 82
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell and Tom Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jack Tarver, who rose from a country editor to
publisher of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution and
chairman of The Associated Press, died Sunday at his Atlanta home.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   His internist, Dr. Charles Upshaw, said the probable cause of
death was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral, for which a date and time were not set as of Sunday
night, will be held at Arlington Memorial Park. H.M. Patterson and
Son, Spring Hill, is in charge of arrangements. The body will be
cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver wielded great influence in the fortunes of the
Journal and Constitution and in Atlanta. He was a newspaperman
first and last, a columnist with a biting wit, a business
executive, civic leader, corporate board member and raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   He served the newspapers as general manager from 1952-56 vice
president from 1956-57, president from 1957-58, publisher from 1958
to 1976 and vice chairman of the parent Cox Enterprises Inc. from
1976 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The late Ralph McGill hired Mr. Tarver, then a Macon News
editor, to be a humor columnist for The Atlanta Constitution in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he was made general manager of the corporation. Mr.
Tarver's years in the management of the newspapers brought some
controversy. He was too close with a dollar for the papers' good,
his critics said. His supporters said Mr. Tarver made the papers so
prosperous that they could afford to take some unpopular stands.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest payoff came in the years when publisher Ralph McGill
was preaching racial moderation in his front-page column. That was
an enormously controversial task, but one that won Mr. McGill a
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Williams Tarver was born March 2, 1917, in Savannah, the
only son of Otis M. Tarver, a hotelkeeper, and Mrs. DeLuth Williams
Tarver. He graduated from Mercer University in Macon with a degree
in journalism in 1938. He joined the paper five years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution and Journal came under the same ownership in
1950, and Mr. Tarver was named assistant to the president of
Atlanta Newspapers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver joined the elite circle of powerful people in
Atlanta. In 1960, for example, He was one of the 14 original board
members of the Commerce Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to make more fun of the power structure than anybody
else,'' former Journal editor Jack Spalding recalled. ``He would
stand up and fight anybody who tried to influence the paper. He'd
say, `Hell, no!' He was absolutely incorruptible..''
</P>
<P>
   Tarver became president of Cox Enterprises in 1969, and vice
chairman of Cox in 1976. In 1977, he was named chairman of The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver was chairman and director of Theaters Service Co. and
a director of Southern Bell, American Motors and Maccabees Mutual
Insurance Co. until retiring from those three boards at age 70. He
also was a member of the American Society of Newspaper Publishers,
chairman of its Bureau of Advertising from 1962-64 and president of
the society in 1976-77; member of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors; and member of Sigma Delta Chi.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the state Board of Education in 1942-43 and a
trustee of Mercer University. He belonged to the Capital City Club,
Piedmont Driving Club, Commerce Club and Stadium Club.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tarver was awarded the humanitarian of the year award of the
Institute for Human Relations in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Margaret Birch Taylor Tarver; a son,
Jack Tarver Jr. of Atlanta; a daughter, Margaret Tarver Jason of
Jacksonville, Fla.; and four grandchildren.

Herron soars with birdie
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ In a strong rebuttal against fit-for-lifers, Tim
``Lumpy'' Herron proved Sunday that it's OK to be addicted to the
remote control and potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   Herron earned his third PGA Tour victory in four years as a pro
when he two-putted for birdie on the second playoff hole to beat
Tom Lehman in the Bay Hill Invitational, capping a blustery day
when birdies were few and far between for the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It said something about the windy conditions that the three
contenders could play a combined 54 holes Sunday and come up with
only four birdies among them _ and none after No. 11 _ until
Herron's winner at the par-5 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Herron, the 5-10, 210-pounder who manages to make Craig Stadler
look athletic, was too good for all the flat-bellies on Sunday. He
led or shared the lead after each round, then survived an
out-of-bounds shot early on Sunday to nick Lehman and Davis Love
III, with whom Herron was tied at the start of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to play the last two days with Davis, a
world-class player, and Tom, also a world-class player who has been
as good as anybody in the majors the last few years, and come out
on top,'' Herron said. ``It's just awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm not far behind those guys. I'm trying to work on
my consistency, which I think is the difference between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron shot a final-round 72 for a total of 14-under 274. Lehman
matched his 72-hole total with a 1-under 71 on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I had got under par, I'd have a good chance,''
Lehman said. ``We all hung in there, Davis, Tim and myself. Tim
just hung in there a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   After a riveting finish in regulation, in which Lehman bogeyed
the par-3 17th hole to let Herron into the playoff, both players
made routine pars on the first extra hole, No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff then proceeded to the par-5 16th, which none of the
leaders had birdied earlier in the day even though it plays as one
of Bay Hill's easiest holes.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, hitting first, opened the door when he hit his drive in
the right fairway bunker for the second time Sunday. He had a poor
lie and hit a pitching wedge across the fairway into the left
rough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Herron pumped one of his best drives of the
tournament down the fairway, then knocked a 5-iron 188 yards to
within 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman hit his approach over the green and scrambled for par.
But Herron hit his first putt just a foot behind the hole for a
tap-in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of putts and that's what it's all about,'' Herron
said. ``On the first hole, I made a 40-footer for birdie and Davis
had it in there five feet, but missed. That's the way it went. If
Davis had made some putts, he could have probably run away with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The day had featured Lehman, Herron and Love in a virtual
deadlock throughout the 18 holes. Neither could gain an advantage
because of constant 20-to 30-mph wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it was four or five shots harder today with the wind
than it was the first three days,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Herron said he didn't plan on celebrating with any wild
partying, just in his traditional fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use to do that party thing,'' he said. ``But I'll just go
out to eat with my girlfriend and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of eating, Herron was asked if he gets tired of
questions about his portly stature.
</P>
<P>
   He shot back to the room of sportswriters: ``Why, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Point well taken.
</P>
<P>
   Herron and Love started the day with a one-shot edge over
Lehman. But that quickly was reversed as Lehman birdied Nos. 4 and
8 while Love was walking a tightrope of consecutive pars on the
front nine and Herron bogeyed twice after an early birdie. That
left him two strokes behind Lehman going into the final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   Herron got a shot back with a 40-foot birdie putt on No. 10. But
nothing changed on the leader board over the next five holes. With
Lehman up by a shot over Love and Herron, all three players parred
Nos. 11-16 and the marathon looked like it would last forever. But
it set up a terrific finish on the final two holes.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the cream-puff 16th, a 511-yard par-5 that most of
the pros were reaching in two shots, produced no movement atop the
leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman played it first and blew the opportunity to pad his lead
when his drive hit a bunker on the right of the fairway and he had
to blast out. From 160 yards, he knocked a 7-iron 10 feet short,
but missed the putt for a par.
</P>
<P>
   Love hit the green in two, but 3-putted from 40 feet after
running his first putt seven feet past the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Herron's second shot rolled over the green. He chipped down to
six feet, but his putt lipped around the hole and stayed out for
par.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lehman had an 8-footer to save par at the
par-3 17th rim out. He had bunkered his 4-iron approach.
</P>
<P>
   So all three players were tied at 14-under. Lehman had one hole
left, Love and Herron had two to play.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was a battle of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Love found out that what goes around comes around. In the second
round, Love had buried a 4-iron in the front bunker and, after
blasting out 40 feet past the pin, he slammed his sand wedge onto a
water valve, starting a gusher that flooded the sand trap. Sunday,
it hit back.
</P>
<P>
   Love again saw his tee shot plug into the sand of the same
bunker, this time with a 5-iron. ``I didn't quite catch it all,''
he said. ``I was trying to hit a short club a long way rather than
feather a 4-iron in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Love blasted out eight feet away but missed the putt for a bogey
that would be his undoing. Unable to birdie the finishing hole, he
was out of the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Herron, meanwhile, got up-and-down from the thick grass in front
of the 17th green. Then, as Lehman made a routine par on 18, Herron
rifled his tee shot down the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th is a menacing hole with water hugging the right side of
the green, which curves into a gentle ``U'' shape. The pin was cut
on the right edge of the green, with water front and right of that
portion of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Herron hit his approach onto the back of the green, then watched
it back up down the slope to within seven feet of the flag. He
couldn't capitalize as the putt slid by on the right edge of the
hole, forcing the playoff with Lehman.

Duke's superiority borders on unfair
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The 3-pointer heaved up by William Avery
was almost from the distance that can win you a car or a bundle of
cash in one of those halftime contests. So it was no surprise when
it bounced high off the rim instead of settling into the bottom of
the net.
</P>
<P>
   The shock came next. That's when Corey Maggette soared in from
the right baseline as if he'd been shot from a cannon and closed
the first half with a circus play.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette's head and neck were above the rim when he grabbed the
ball and kept right on going toward the ceiling of the Continental
Airlines Arena. You're not supposed to be able to jump that high
without the aid of a trampoline. Or clearance from the controllers
in the tower.
</P>
<P>
   He hovered above the basket like a traffic helicopter over a
gridlocked freeway, slammed the ball, then used both hands to chin
himself skyward until his waist was even with the rim as the horn
sounded and Duke was running to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this for the No. 1-ranked and untouchable Blue
Devils. They are using the rest of the NCAA field to do
calisthenics. Gotta break a sweat somehow.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a tournament, it's an exhibition. Each round merely a
canvas Duke uses to paint another masterpiece. Every game another
ordinary lump of clay that winds up looking like Michelangelo's
statue of David.
</P>
<P>
   Titanic effort
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the Temple Owls who were matted, framed and
hung on the wall of the gallery 85-64 in the East Regional title
game as Duke marches on. And on. And on.
</P>
<P>
   So fitting that it was Oscar night, because Mike Krzyzewski's
Blue Devils were looking like the producers of Titanic at the 1998
Academy Awards, making endless walks to the stage to accept another
gold figurine.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't we just give them ``Best Picture'' right now and save
everybody a trip to St. Petersburg, Fla.?
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing aspect of Maggette's high-wire play was not
that he was able to pull it off. It's the fact he is only a
freshman in the awesome Duke machine, coming off the bench to play
just 14 minutes, and yet he might be the most individually talented
player on the roster, if not the entire country. No, that's not a
typo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this bracket, the only team capable of beating Duke, I
thought, was our team,'' said Temple coach John Chaney. ``For a
time, we were able to hold them down inside and it looked OK. But
we still knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that story about the great old football coach, I
guess he was from Green Bay. It was a couple of days before a big
game and he told all the reporters that his plan was to run the
ball around the right end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporters asked, `Coach, why are you saying all of this
before the game, letting them know your game plan?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the coach said: `Yes, they'll know what we're going to do.
They just don't know how well.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with Duke. You don't know how well they do
it until you get out there with them and feel like a carrot in a
food processor. You get sliced, chopped, pured.
</P>
<P>
   Bruising, aggressive Temple trailed only 9-5 after the first
five minutes of the game and for maybe a half-second, you entertain
the silly notion this could finally be a real game. Then Trajan
Langdon, the fifth-year senior and sweetest shot in the college
game, takes over.
</P>
<P>
   First Langdon took a feed from William Avery and hit a running
10-footer down the right side of the lane. Then he squeezed off a
trio of 3-point baskets _ back-to-back-to-back bullets _ in the
space of just 80 seconds that shot the feathers off the Owls and
lifted Duke's confidence to its usual heights and another rout was
on.
</P>
<P>
   Best actor, supporting cast
</P>
<P>
   After Langdon (23 points on 6-for-7 shooting) softened up Temple
from the outside, things opened up on the inside for Elton Brand to
rumble for 21 points and eight rebounds. There was also Avery
collecting 13 points and four assists and Chris Carrawell with 12
points, seven assists and seven rebounds while drawing the toughest
defensive assignment, harassing the Owls' Mark Karcher into missing
18 of 25 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hope whoever plays them next believes in the Lord,''
Chaney said. ``Or maybe they can take Frank and Jesse James with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke has won 31 games in a row and has won its four Tournament
games by an average of 30 points. Now it's Michigan State on
Saturday, somebody else next Monday and cutting down the nets
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney, the stuffed Owl, nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we played as well as we can,'' he said.
``If we had shot the ball better, it might have looked better. But
the end would have been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils doing chin-ups on the rim to keep themselves
interested.

SEPTEMBER REMATCH OF HOLYFIELD AND LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A week after the controversial draw between Evander Holyfield
and Lennox Lewis at Madison Square Garden rocked the boxing world,
the stage has been set for a rematch of their heavyweight
unification bout sometime in September. But a date and site for the
fight have not been been selected.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, said Sunday the promoter Don
King had reached agreement with Holyfield late Saturday night and
had signed him to a contract for the rematch. King already had a
rematch clause in Lewis' initial contract. Each fighter is to be
paid $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   One major sticking point in signing Holyfield for the rematch
was resolved when Holyfield decided not to seek the $20 million
that he had earned for the first bout, or even more. Lewis, who
earned $10 million for the first bout, was guaranteed $15 million
for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with Lennox and his people shooting the wrap show
at HBO earlier this week, Lennox said in the clearest possible
terms that he would only do the fight if there was parity in the
purses,'' Thomas said. ``There is a very strong, legitimate
argument on behalf of Evander that he is still the major
pay-per-view draw. But Evander decided to give up that argument and
make it easier. He said it was in the best interest of the sport to
have a unified champion. He believes if it didn't happen now, it
would never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (36-3-1) is the World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation champion, and Lewis (34-0-1) is the
World Boxing Council champion. The draw, in a fight clearly
dominated by Lewis, meant that both boxers kept their titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only corrective we have in boxing when we have a
dispute, to have a rematch,'' King told the Fox News Channel
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the controversial decision, the heads of all three
sanctioning bodies agreed that there should be a rematch and
ordered that it occur within six months. A September date would
fulfill that requirement; King still has to sell the fight to a
site, possibly in Las Vegas, Nev., or New York.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues beyond the date and site remain to be resolved.
A television deal will need to be negotiated with TVKO, the
pay-per-view arm of HBO, which would carry a rematch because it has
an exclusive contract with Lewis. TVKO has set aside a September
pay-per-view date for its other star, the welterweight champion
Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no deal struck for a rematch,'' the HBO senior vice
president Lou DiBella told The Associated Press. ``We haven't sat
down yet and spoken to Lewis and his people.''
</P>
<P>
   The first bout between the two boxers on March 13 drew 1.2
million pay-per-view buys at $49.95 each and sold out Madison
Square Garden. The Garden paid $8.3 million for the bout and
grossed $11 million. It remains to be seen how much the taint of
the draw will affect the market for a second bout. Three different
investigations have been launched to investigate the judging of the
bout, including a criminal investigation by Manhattan District
Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch could be a tough sell, not only because of the draw,
but because the first fight was dull, with Lewis content to use his
jab to keep Holyfield at bay and Holyfield ineffective in his
efforts to work inside.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question as to whether Lewis' promoters,
Panos Eliades of London and Dino Duva of Main Events in Paterson,
N.J., will agree to King's being the lead promoter of a rematch.

CHANEY GETS BEAT `BY THE RIGHT GUYS'
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Behind the blue curtains where the
coaches cross paths on their way in and out of the interview room,
John Chaney embraced Mike Krzyzewski without a tear, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel all right,'' Chaney of Temple told Krzyzewski of Duke,
after the door to the Final Four had shut in his face, a fourth
time, one step away. ``I got beat by the right guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the raspy-voiced coach got a personalized introduction to
the Krzyzewski family, walked down the hall and had a good cry.
</P>
<P>
   Duke 85, Temple 64 was the least of it, the outcome as academic
as Duke is after Trajan Langdon stepped outside the outer
boundaries of Temple's matchup zone for a trio of 3-pointers in a
89-second span, less than 10 minutes into the East Regional final
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This was Chaney crying over one of his kids, which he often does
because he obviously cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you have to realize in this business is that
someone has to be responsible for motivating youngsters,'' he was
saying. ``If you find out they're not interested, you get rid of
them. You're not going to save everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The player he did help rescue, the one he would weep for, was
Rasheed Brokenborough, a 6-foot-4-inch guard out of a tough West
Philadelphia neighborhood known as the Bottom. Raised by his
grandmother _ the mother of 18, grandma of 30 _ Brokenborough went
to Temple as a learning disabled and was ineligible to play as a
freshman, thanks to collegiate legislation that was recently
overturned in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Work that took most students an hour took Brokenborough hours,
he admitted, but he had made it to his senior year, graduation in
sight. He just won't be getting back a fourth go-round with Chaney,
unless the NCAA bureaucrats cut him a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to come back and play basketball and work toward
my master's,'' he said. ``If I don't get to come back to Temple,
life will go on, and I'll work toward another challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It was when Chaney was asked about Brokenborough that his eyes
moistened and his voice quivered. ``That's what I would've wanted
him to say,'' he said, and then the owlish coach covered his eyes
to intercept the flow of tears. The interview proceeded, Chaney
choking out more. ``Rasheed's meant so much to us,'' he said.
``He's come so far.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to class and to those sunrise practices and he got after
opponents in the matchup zone and Chaney could ask for nothing
more. Not from Brokenborough, or his team, which held 19 of 34
opponents under 60 points this season, eight under 50. Duke's
response was to shoot a tranquilizing 60 percent from the field, 59
percent (10 of 17) from behind the 3-point line. Stretched by
Langdon, stuffed by Elton Brand, Chaney decided that ``we've never
played against a team better than this, all these guys with four
weapons _ dribble, pass, shoot and see.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than athletic superiority, Chaney understood, more
than the freshman pogo stick named Corey Maggette practically
suspending himself above the rim on the way to a put-back slam that
registered on the Richter scale. This was another one of those
highlights for the sports news shows that are draining fundamental
artistry from the game, the kind that make most Duke possessions a
joyful expression of simplicity, a compelling watch in a
noncompetitive romp.
</P>
<P>
   How does one convince children of the highlight generation that
there might be a better shot than the one that gets you on ESPN? In
the second half Sunday, Duke's William Avery pushed the ball on the
break, with Chris Carrawell filling the right lane, a half-step on
the retreating defender. For a millisecond, Avery considered a lob,
thought better of it and waited for the trailer. Langdon appeared,
prompt and primed, only to miss the open jumper, his only misfire
of the game. But that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy to just rationalize Duke's success by calling it
Princeton with talent. As Chaney has proved for years now at
Temple, this is about coaching and the willingness to be coached,
more than it is about SATs. It is about commitment by adults as
much as it is about cooperation by kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can teach kids to be winners, if they're interested,''
Chaney said. ``Mike doesn't save everyone either, but he and I both
work to develop will and discipline. There is a class about that
team, a respect for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had to lose, better it should be to Duke, than, say,
Michigan, which denied Chaney a few years ago with its Fab Five,
derided by Chaney as nothing more than a bunch of ``head jobs
running around fabulously, individually perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney did win a national championship once, at Division II
Cheney State. ``I really don't have many more mountains to climb,''
he said. ``It's about developing kids like Rasheed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about persuading his team to play like one. Temple had a
good run, but drew Duke, and that was that. You don't cry about the
breaks, only the kids. He cried yesterday for the one he lost.

MENIFEE TAKES A DETOUR TO THE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A Kentucky Derby dream did not exactly shatter
here Sunday on a neat little track about a thousand miles from
Churchill Downs. But the dream, the design and the investment being
made by two old friends took a bit of a pounding when their
undefeated 3-year-old colt, Menifee, ran second to Pineaff by the
length of a horse in the Tampa Bay Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you humility,'' lamented Jimmy Stone, an oil and gas
executive from New Orleans who owns Menifee with Arthur Hancock of
Paris, Ky. Hancock, who has won the Kentucky Derby with Gato del
Sol and Sunday Silence, spoke bravely about the ``learning
experience'' that carried Menifee ``for the first time around two
turns,'' but he also mourned the detour in their Louisville dream.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee was not supposed to lose this race. He arrived in Tampa
with three victories at three tracks and with high hopes of
maturing into that elusive prodigy known as a ``Derby horse.'' He
was the solid favorite when he went to the post in sunshine Sunday
against five other colts for a purse of $150,000 and Triple Crown
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Menifee broke awkwardly from the gate and swung too wide on
the first of those two pesky turns. He ran fifth in the middle
stages of the race even though he was still parked wide, rallied
nobly in the home stretch, but then failed to run down Pineaff. In
third place came Doneraile Court, four lengths farther back and
soundly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Was the distance, a mile and one-sixteenth, too far for Menifee,
or the two turns too troublesome, or the track too deep? None of
the above, said his trainer, Elliott Walden, who also trains
Victory Gallop, a hero of last year's Triple Crown series and the
winner of the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm pleased with his race,'' Walden said, not
sounding too pleased but also not sounding too critical of his
veteran jockey, Pat Day. ``Pineaff is a solid horse. We got carried
extremely wide on the first turn, and another horse kept him out
there to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Menifee still pursue the dreams of Hancock, Stone and
Walden along the tortuous road to May 1 in Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   ``The next race will tell us what we've got,'' Walden said. ``We
will play it by ear, and probably go on as planned to the Blue
Grass Stakes in three weeks and the Derby three weeks after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who owns 16 horses trained by Walden and who has won the
Ascot Gold Cup twice, remembered that he once lost the Arc de
Triomphe by a nose. That taught him humility, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never tell Elliott how to train a horse,'' he said. ``I have
a deal with him. If he never tells me where to drill for oil, I
won't tell him where or when to run a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The team surrounding Menifee flew into Tampa from different
directions: Stone from New Orleans, Hancock with his wife and six
children from Palm Beach, Fla., and Walden from north of Miami,
where he has been sheltering and training Menifee in Payson Park's
countrylike setting. Right after the race, they all flew back out,
with Walden following the longest itinerary: to Dubai in the Middle
East, where he will run Victory Gallop in the $5 million World Cup
this week. Menifee headed back home to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Pineaff, a son of Pinebluff trained by Ken McPeak and ridden by
Jose Santos, ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:45 1/5 and paid
$14 for a $2 bet to win. He had lost three straight since winning
in November, and Santos paid full credit to his colt for upsetting
Menifee, one of the stronger contenders in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in the newspapers,'' Santos said, ``you can't beat
that horse. But we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito knows about dreams won and lost. He has won the
Kentucky Derby twice in this decade with Strike the Gold and Go for
Gin. His speedy colt Doneraile Court ran 10th in the Fountain of
Youth Stakes last month and third Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't run too bad,'' Zito said, without cheer. ``But
there's no Kentucky Derby in his picture anymore.''

USC RETURNING TO OLD FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when it looked like the defending national
champion USC baseball team might not even make it to the playoffs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   That time has passed. The Trojans, who were seven games under
.500 on Feb. 27, beat No. 23 Arizona on Sunday afternoon 8-5 in
front of 654 at Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   USC, which played one of the strongest nonconference schedules
in the nation, improved to 14-14 overall and 5-1 in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a fresh start in league,'' said senior Jason Lane, who
had a home run and also pitched the final two innings against the
No. 23 Wildcats. ``We have to basically do well in league to make
the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking two of three from Arizona (20-11) is a good sign. USC
fell behind the Wildcats 4-1 early but rallied for six runs in the
fifth. All-American catcher Eric Munson's two-run homer, his
team-leading 10th of the season, was the highlight of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty characteristic of our team to come back like
that,'' Munson said. ``Most of the time we dig ourselves a hole,
and when it isn't a big hole, we come back and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson's homer easily cleared the 365-foot mark in right field
and he said he didn't see where it landed. He was more impressed by
Lane's homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (my home run) went father than Lane's ball,''
Munson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a left-hander who started the game in left field, said he
found out later that his blast went over the screen in center
field, more than 400 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the ball I hit,'' Lane said, ``but Munson's went
a long way. I had a good look at that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Home-run derby aside, the Trojans are gaining confidence. Their
lowest point came in a 5-2 home loss to Stanford that dropped them
to 4-11.
</P>
<P>
   USC, which won its 12th College World Series title last year,
has rebounded to win 10 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last month we've been playing a lot better baseball,''
Munson said. ``Lately we've been finding a way to win. We're
starting to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Better pitching has been the key. On Friday night, left-hander
Barry Zito (Pierce College) struck out 16 in USC's series-opening
17-1 win. Senior right-hander Justin Lehr (2-1) overcame a slow
start and won his second consecutive game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had a combined six hits in the second and third
innings against Lehr, and Shelley Duncan's two-run homer gave
Arizona a 4-1 lead. It was Duncan's 11th of the season, setting a
school record for freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr retired 13 of the next 14 batters. He struck out six and
walked none in 62/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making better pitches,'' Lehr said. ``It's been a big help
showing the coaches I could throw all four pitches for strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   The unranked Trojans play at No. 6 Pepperdine on Wednesday at 2
p.m.

HERRON DEFEATS LEHMAN IN PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It was the most difficult victory of Tim
Herron's career, and by far the most impressive. It took two
playoff holes for him to prevail. He outplayed two former major
winners, Tom Lehman and Davis Love III, who battled with Herron on
Sunday in a pressure-packed, final-round showdown at the Bay Hill
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   But as dusk fell, so did Lehman and Love. Love was the first to
go, making a crucial bogey at No. 17, and finishing one stroke out
of the playoff. Then on the second hole of the playoff between
Lehman and Herron, it was Lehman who faltered on the par-5 No. 16,
hitting a poor tee shot into a bunker that made it impossible for
him to reach the green in two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Herron did reach the 16th green in two shots. And
after he 2-putted for a birdie to clinch the tournament, Herron
earned a prestigious victory, a spot in next month's Masters, and
added respect that will force people to pay more attention to his
game, and less attention to his physique.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the first-place check worth $450,000, and winning his
third tournament on the PGA Tour at age 29, Herron finished at 14
under par for the tournament (274) after Sunday's par 72. Lehman
(14-under 71 on Sunday) settled for second place, while Love (276,
13-under 73 on Sunday) was third.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed Lumpy for his portly dimensions, Herron raised his
game and his stature with a victory that was worth savoring. He
showed coolness under pressure, superb ball-striking in windy
conditions and a refusal to be intimidated by Love or Lehman, two
players who know how to close on Sunday. On this Sunday, Herron
closed the deal. And afterward, there was no reason to hide his
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot, playing the last two days with Davis Love, a
world-class player, and Tom Lehman, a world-class player,'' said
Herron, who began the final round tied with Love and one stroke
ahead of Lehman. ``It's a great feeling. It's hard to reflect right
now, because I'm still on the high. But it was just awesome. The
putts were rolling and things were happening. I was comfortable,
kind of in a zone. I made a lot of putts coming down the stretch,
and that is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   While Herron avoided crucial miscues, Love and Lehman did not.
Love was betrayed by his putter, missing birdie putts of 5 feet on
Nos. 1, 3 and 4, which could have given him an early cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had made some putts, Davis could have almost run away
with it,'' said Herron, who was Love's playing partner on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Love never made a birdie on Sunday, and he never recovered
from his bogey at the par-3, 219-yard No. 17, which was
particularly difficult because of swirling winds that gusted up to
25 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Love and Herron reached the 17th tee, they were locked in a
three-way tie at 14 under par with Lehman, who was one group ahead
playing No. 18. Love's 5-iron tee shot at No. 17 landed in the
front bunker, the same bunker that Love hit into on Friday, when he
broke a sprinkler head with his club in frustration and triggered a
steady flow of water that flooded the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Love held his temper on Sunday, but he failed to get up and down
for par, missing a 10-foot putt after his bunker shot.
</P>
<P>
   That dropped Love to 13 under, and when he failed to birdie No.
18, he knew he couldn't win. Bay Hill continued to be a tournament
with bitter endings for Love, who finished second in both 1989 and
1993 but has never won the tournament hosted by Arnold Palmer, who
was standing near the 18th green to console Love. ``One of these
years,'' Love said to Palmer as they shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   Herron almost ended the tournament at No. 18 in regulation,
after hitting a terrific 6-iron approach shot within 8 feet. But
Herron missed the putt and settled for par, forcing the playoff.
Then Lehman missed an opportunity to win on the first playoff hole,
No. 18, when his 14-foot putt for birdie was short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big disappointment not winning,'' said Lehman, the 1996
British Open champion, who was in contention for the first time
since shoulder surgery in November. ``I had a really good chance to
win on the first playoff hole. I misread it. But you have to take
the good with the bad. If you had told me before the week started
that I would have been in a playoff, I probably would have been
overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second playoff hole, Lehman hit the poor tee shot, and
then Herron hit a great drive, reached the par-5 green in two
shots, and watched as Lehman eventually made a 25-footer to save
par. But it wasn't enough. Herron hit his first putt from 14 feet
on the final hole 2 feet long, and then made the comeback putt for
birdie and the win. Herron won the Honda Classic in 1996, and the
LaCantera Texas Open in 1997. But this victory meant more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my girlfriend some things are going to change,'' Herron
said. ``I was going to go up to Minnesota to see her. We're going
to the Masters instead. That's not a bad deal.''

SECRETIVE COACHES DON'T TIP THEIR HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ind.)  (lb) 
 By ZACK BURGESS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAL, Ill. _ Just the mere thought of losing has both coaches
_ Rutgers' Vivian Stringer and Purdue's Carolyn Peck _ a little
secretive about what to expect from each other's very tenacious
basketball teams Monday night in the Midwest Regional final of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association women's basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Peck refused to say anything about third-seeded Rutgers' matchup
zone and how to beat it. And Stringer talked about the
extraordinary guard play of Purdue's Ukari Figgs, Stephanie
White-McCarty and Katie Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is probably healthy for both coaches to express
what they respect, admire or just do not like about each other, the
talk will have to be delayed until the two teams meet.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for Stringer, it is an opportunity to get back to the
Final Four and finally win the one thing that has eluded her
throughout her collegiate coaching career _ an NCAA championship.
For Peck, it is a chance to cement her place in Purdue history
before she becomes the coach this summer of the Orlando franchise
of the Women's National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   So the talk of setting picks, splitting the defense or cutting
off the angles of an excellent offense were going to have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have to continue to work,'' said Stringer, who
took her University of Iowa team to the Final Four in 1993. ``We
have to be in control. Our defense arrived _ always does. It
arrives much earlier than our offense. The offense is beginning to
arrive with the same level of expectation and intensity that the
defense has. But it's still chugging a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year in the tournament, Rutgers will
face a No. 1-ranked team. Last year it was the eventual champion,
Tennessee, which was on its way to a 39-0 season. This time it's
Purdue, a team with a 29-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Rutgers may be the best defensive team left in
the tournament, Purdue hasn't just given away points. The
Boilermakers have allowed 49.3 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must keep focused for 40 minutes because the only way we
are going to beat Purdue is a nip-and-tuck game,'' Rutgers forward
Shawnetta Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams come into Monday night's matchup with a great deal of
confidence, after trouncing their opponents on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (31-1), which shot 62 percent from the field, overwhelmed
North Carolina, 82-59. Rutgers (29-5) defensively frustrated Texas
Tech into innumerable season lows and won by 53-42.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights thwarted Texas Tech into tying a record low
in a half with 11 first-half points. And Texas Tech's leading
scorer, Angie Brazeil, was held to a season-low six points.
</P>
<P>
   This is Purdue's second consecutive year in the final eight and
Rutgers' first time here since 1987. For Purdue, it's a chance to
go where it believes it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year we've gone out and we've attacked one game at a
time,'' Figgs said. ``This is the game that's going to get us
there. But if we keep our focus on the Final Four, it's not going
to help us in the game. We know that. We're just going to go out
and do the things we need to do in the game. We'll worry about the
Final Four after the game.''

TRUCK BLOWS UP ON HIGHWAY SENDING FIREBALL SKKWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Southeast Expressway burst into a ``field of
flames'' Sunday afternoon when a tanker truck carrying more than
10,000 gallons of gasoline slammed into a guardrail and slid along
the southbound lanes before exploding into a spectacular fireball
100 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, the truck's driver and the occupants of two other
cars that were incinerated in the explosion suffered only minor
cuts after they scrambled out their vehicles and vaulted over a
guardrail to escape the trail of flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I saw was a tanker truck sliding by me on its side going
60 or 70 miles an hour,'' said Andrew Cappuccio, a resident of
Boston's Dorchester section who was walking his dog on Savin Hill
Beach shortly before the 4:30 p.m. explosion. The blast occurred
near the Savin Hill area of Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard the explosions, then a couple more. I saw maybe
six people jumping over the barrier to get away. I don't know how
anyone survived, it looked like an oil field on fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The expressway _ both north and southbound _ turned into a
parking lot for more than two miles as emergency crews tried to
clear the scene and contain environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   Foam was spread to prevent the gasoline from leaking into
fragile adjoining marshland and beaches and Coast Guard officials
were vacuuming the gasoline from drainage pipes to prevent it from
igniting in waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino said Sunday night that state officials
assured him that both sides of the highway would be open by the
morning commute. He said that if the lanes were still closed,
transportation and public safety officials would be on hand to make
alternate plans. He urged commuters to use public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, drivers reported up to an 1 1/2-hour delay as
police rerouted traffic to local streets.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the truck's driver, William S. Leonard, 43, of
Duxbury, had just picked up 10,200 gallons of gasoline from an
Exxon station in Everett and was taking it to another Exxon station
in Holliston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `something snapped in the truck,' '' said State Police
trooper Gary Smith, who was the first police officer to arrive on
the scene. Leonard was driving the truck for Volta Oil of Plymouth.
He will be not charged in the accident, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said it appeared that the truck drifted into the right
guardrail, flipped on its side and then slid several hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   Residents from Boston's Jamaica Plain section to the town of
Arlington paused to gaze at the thick, black plumes of smoke
billowing over the city's skyline. Drivers in Dorchester and the
city of Quincy abandoned their cars to search for the smoke's
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard told police it appeared that the tanker was already on
fire when the truck flipped. He escaped by punching out a window in
the truck when it stopped sliding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like napalm going off,'' said Smith, a
16-year-veteran of the force. The truck was so badly melted that a
heavy plow had to be brought in to get it off the road. ``I've
never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northbound side of the expressway was filled with
traffic at the time of the explosion, only two cars were near the
tanker when it exploded on the southbound side, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Randall J. Hallett and Donna Johnson fled from their
car, jumping over bushes and barriers to escape the flames.
</P>
<P>
   A family of three from Malden, Andre P. Marc, 48, Marie M. Marc,
43, and their daughter Marie, 18, also escaped with cuts and
bruises. Marie Marc also had a sprained ankle. They were
transported to Boston Medical Center for treatment. An unidentified
firefighter also received minor injuries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared around 5 p.m., the truck could be seen on
its side, its body reduced to a smoking steel skeleton. The other
burned cars were parked in the passing lane, both charred and
unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Toner, of Dorchester, said he was walking through McConnell
Park and happened to look up and see the truck in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flipped and started scraping,'' he said. ``It was like
something you see in the movies. I saw a wall of flame 30 feet high
and 900 yards long. You could feel the heat from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash set off several explosions, which nearby residents
first said they thought were gunshots. Later, they said, it
appeared several compartments of the tanker exploded separately,
and then the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars all exploded. That's all you could hear,'' said
Christine O'Leary, of Dorchester, who was helping a friend paint
her kitchen when the truck veered out of control and overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The MBTA shut down its Red Line service for an hour because of
the explosion and resulting smoke. Logan airport officials said the
wind was favorable and did not blow the acrid, black smoke near
runways. Police said the wind also prevented cars in the northbound
lanes from catching fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the scene were most concerned about the unburned
gas leaking into the ocean, and possibly reigniting.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Devine, from Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Boston
said clean-up crews were waiting for a cleaning truck to try and
vacuum out gasoline that had seeped into the sewer drains and
emptied into the discharge point on the otherside of the northbound
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more it gathers the more you have to deal with fumes. It
doesn't take much to set gasoline on fire,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   But for commuters, the tanker's explosion will likely be felt
into this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about it,'' said Brian Donovan, of
Quincy, who was diverted from the expressway and found himself or
Dorchester Avenue. He said he had gone about a mile in an hour at
5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I about it on the radio and thought how bad could it be? Well,
its bad. If it's like this tomorrow, I'm giving up. It's going to
take me four hours to get five miles at this rate.''

ZAMBONI DELAYS THE INEVITABLE: RANGER LEAD SLIPS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Zamboni machine that resurfaces the ice
accidentally delays a game for 35 minutes by gouging long gashes
into the playing surface, the witnesses seek meaning in such an
omen. Does it suggest that winter is over and it is time for the
ice to go away? Or could it be that the Rangers' playoff hopes,
already on thin ice, are about to be ripped to shreds?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the symbolism, the Rangers squandered a lead again
Sunday at Madison Square Garden. After leading the Pittsburgh
Penguins by two goals, they settled for a 2-2 tie that left them,
temporarily at least, in ninth place, 3 points behind the Boston
Bruins for the eighth and final playoff berth in the National
Hockey League's Eastern Conference. The Rangers also were 1 point
ahead of 10th-place Florida before the Bruins and Panthers played
Sunday night. As they begin a three-game trip Monday night at Tampa
Bay and wait for the NHL trading deadline Tuesday night, the
Rangers face some intriguing personnel decisions involving injured
players.
</P>
<P>
   One of them involves Ulf Samuelsson, the veteran defenseman, who
may be available to a Stanley Cup contender willing to exchange a
player of value for an intimidator who can become an unrestricted
free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became complicated late in Sunday's game when
Samuelsson broke his right foot when he blocked a shot. It forced
him to leave the game and will idle him for two to three weeks, the
Rangers said. Should Samuelsson heal in that time, he could return
in time for the end of the regular season and the beginning of the
two-month Stanley Cup tournament. But what if the injury does not
heal as expected?
</P>
<P>
   The other injured player is Wayne Gretzky, the star center, who
has not played since Feb. 22 because of a protruding disc in his
neck. Gretzky, who recently had a cortisone injection, traveled
with the team to Tampa, Fla., and said he hoped to return on
Saturday at Philadelphia or next Monday night, when the Rangers
return to the Garden to play the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rangers have slumped to 1-3-2 in their last six
games and do not have a victory in their last three, they are 6-3-3
in Gretzky's absence, thanks in part to the play of centers Petr
Nedved, Marc Savard and Manny Malhotra, who have skated in
Gretzky's place.
</P>
<P>
   Blending Gretzky back into the mix without limiting the
contributions of the others will be a challenge for John Muckler,
the veteran coach, who calls Gretzky his game breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved scored the second Rangers goal Sunday, giving them a 2-0
lead, on the power play just 15 seconds after the beginning of the
second period. The first intermission lasted 53 minutes because the
ice-making machine accidentally scooped up a rubber-and-metal piece
that helps anchor the goal net. By dragging this piece around, the
Zamboni created ruts that were, at worst, about an inch wide and an
inch deep, according to Rangers goalie Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could have broken their ankle,'' Richter said. At
first, players for both teams tried to fill the ruts by standing in
what looked like a dance line and using their skates to scrape snow
and ice chips. When that didn't work, the referee, Paul Stewart,
ordered the two Zambonis back on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   They were followed by nine workers with shovels, water bottles
and squeegees. Also assisting were Stewart and his linesmen.
Stewart, on hands and knees, jammed fistfuls of shavings into the
cracks. To soothe impatient fans, the Garden announced that soft
drinks and bottled water would sell for half-price for the
remainder of the game. Jaromir Jagr, the Penguins' captain, lay
back on the bench and put a towel over his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He used to play with Nedved and Kevin Stevens when they were on
the Penguins, and he joshed with Stevens after finishing his nap.
Stevens had given the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 6 minutes 19 seconds of
the first period. Both Rangers goals were scored on their first
shots of the periods against Jean-Sebastien Aubin, subbing for the
injured Tom Barrasso. But Pittsburgh cut the Rangers' lead to 2-1
at 7:11 of the second on a goal by Bobby Dollas, who finished off a
play created by Jagr, who is a leading candidate for the Hart
Trophy as most valuable player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   German Titov made it 2-2 at 16:26 of the second on the power
play after the Rangers captain Brian Leetch, trying to clear the
puck away from the crease, unintentionally kicked it to Titov.
</P>
<P>
   The best moment of the overtime, and of the game, came when Adam
Graves of the Rangers lost the puck to Jagr near the Pittsburgh
blue line. Jagr roared in alone on Richter, brought him down with a
fake, but was stopped on a backhanded shot by Richter's left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read it,'' Richter said of Jagr's fakes. ``You mirror what
he does to you. You hope he hits you.'' &QL;

YOU COULD SEE IT COMING: ANOTHER DEFLATING LOSS FOR NETS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Anyone who has watched a couple of Nets games knew
that Keith Van Horn was going to take a few dribbles, spin and
shoot. That is the heralded forward's go-to move, and Sunday night,
when the Nets needed a basket, he went to it.
</P>
<P>
   But Cavaliers forward Shawn Kemp has watched the Nets on
videotape. So he was waiting for the spin. When it came, with the
Nets trailing by a point with 17 seconds remaining in the game,
Kemp stripped Van Horn of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Brevin Knight made two free throws eight seconds
later and, when Stephon Marbury's last-gasp 3-point attempt bounced
high and off the rim, the Cavaliers claimed an 88-85 victory before
a crowd of 13,806 at Gund Arena. The loss dropped the Nets to 4-20.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who highlighted the fourth-quarter rally with 8 points,
led the Nets for the fifth time in his five games with the team
with 20 points. Van Horn scored a season-low 12, and the
little-used reserve Chris Carr scored 18.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpshooting Wesley Person led the Cavaliers (12-11) with
22 points, and Andrew DeClercq added 14. Kemp and Cedric Henderson
followed with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three quarters of lethargy, the Nets awoke to
challenge the Cavaliers down the stretch. Trailing by 84-75 with
four minutes remaining, Marbury made two 3-pointers and a driving
layup to spark a 10-2 run that put the end in doubt. His final
3-pointer, from 26 feet and over Knight, cut the Cavaliers' lead to
86-85 with 1 minute 46 seconds left. But the Nets' offense crumbled
after that, as Van Horn and Kerry Kittles missed shots in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Carr kept the Nets alive early. Hitting two 3-pointers, dropping
midrange jumpers and driving aggressively to the basket, the
6-foot-6-inch swingman scored 16 points before the break. It was an
astounding display, considering Carr had played only eight minutes
and scored just 2 points since joining the Nets in the Marbury
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's inspiring play was not enough to get the Nets a lead,
though, as his teammates struggled. Marbury, with 7 points, was the
only other Nets player to score more than 4 in the half, and with
the Nets shooting their usual 37 percent, Cleveland built a 49-40
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The only change the third quarter brought was Carr's return to
earth. He went scoreless in six minutes, and the Nets continued to
trail, entering the final period with a 72-64 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets hope their coming four consecutive home games will help
them mount a turnaround. The stretch starts Monday against Toronto,
a 100-85 winner over the Nets last Tuesday. Though the Raptors won
that one easily, they are beatable, as are Detroit, Indiana and
Cleveland, which also visit Continental Arena this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadowlands will be a welcome site for the Nets, one that
coach Don Casey says can rejuvenate a reeling team that is sorely
in need of a spark. ``I think that's very important, to play at
home, especially with what we did against Dallas,'' said Casey,
referring to last Wednesday's victory over the Mavericks. ``The
energy was there, the effort factor was there. I think it'll be
good for all of us. We need it.''  &QL;

20 YEARS LATER, ANOTHER MAGICAL TRIP TO THE FINAL FOUR FOR MICHIGAN
STATE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Magic Johnson stood on a folding chair about 10 rows
from the crowded court, smiling and acting like a proud father as
he watched Michigan State celebrate after defeating Kentucky,
73-66, in the championship game of the Midwest Regional on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The joyful scene brought back so many memories for Johnson, from
as long as 20 years ago, when he was the starting point guard and
as recently as 10 months ago, when he was an imposing practice
player against these Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Call Michigan State's businesslike triumph over Kentucky
magical, although there was no mystery about how the Spartans did
it. They never wilted when the Wildcats rushed to a 13-point lead
in the first half, they played a smothering defense that frustrated
Kentucky and they performed like the more experienced team while
dominating the final eight minutes of a crisp and classic game.
</P>
<P>
   Why else was Sunday magical? Because the Spartans are returning
to the Final Four for the first time since Johnson was a sophomore
and they won the national title over Larry Bird and Indiana State
in 1979. Because Johnson, the most famous pickup player to join
games with Michigan State, has helped nurture these players on
humid days when the Final Four was simply two 20-year-old words and
not a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great because after playing against these guys every
summer, I know what they've been through,'' Johnson said. ``I know
how hard coach Izzo has worked. You can see how each of them has
developed every year. This just feels wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Izzo, the coach with the red face and the overflowing
emotions, who watched his team win its 22nd straight game to earn a
matchup with Duke on Saturday, said, ``Other than my daughter being
born, this is the greatest day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone tossed Johnson a white T-shirt and a tan cap with
``Final Four'' emblazoned across them, and Johnson immediately wore
the cap. Even as Johnson answered questions, he never stopped
staring at the Spartans on the court. There was so much to see, so
much for Johnson and everyone clad in green around him to absorb on
this magical day.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson saw Mateen Cleaves, his buddy and fellow point guard who
had 11 assists and a critical 3-pointer to end the first half. He
saw Morris Peterson, who poured in 19 points and had 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He saw Antonio Smith, who scolded his teammates during a timeout
to jolt them and helped limit Scott Padgett to four points for the
first 38 minutes. He saw A.J. Granger, who had 14 points in 18
minutes. He saw a team that wanted some respect against the
tradition-rich defending champions and snatched it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a blessing that everyone did that,'' Johnson
said about classifying the third-seeded Wildcats as the favorites.
``Making us the underdog made us play harder. One thing about us is
we played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (28-9), who were trying to scoot into the Final
Four for the fourth straight season, found out just how hard the
Spartans (32-4) would play. Michigan State trailed by 17-4, 19-6
and 26-14 in the first half and Kentucky seemed to be one streak
away from making reservations for St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they did that, we would have been in trouble,'' Izzo said.
But it never transpired. Kentucky's senior threesome of Padgett,
Heshimu Evans and Wayne Turner did not score for more than 25
minutes, and the Spartans uncorked a 9-0 blitz to make the game
competitive again. Kentucky's lead never surged above five points
and Cleaves nailed a 3-pointer with two seconds left in the half to
bring Michigan State within 36-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they had turned it around when Mateen hit that three,''
Johnson said. ``I turned to my father and told him that was the
shot we needed. We hadn't played well in the first half and we were
only down one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, whose team played the other three Final Four teams this
season and defeated only Ohio State, was sheepish about the shot,
saying: ``It could have been a little luck. I just thank God it
went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half was artistic, aggressive and awesome to watch.
Neither team had more than a four-point lead for the first 12
minutes, but, again, it was Cleaves who guided the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   The former high school quarterback fired an 80-foot bomb to
Andre Hutson, who corralled it over his shoulder and made a tricky
layup to give Michigan State a 55-54 lead with 7 minutes 30 seconds
left. The Spartans never trailed again, erupting for 10 of the next
14 points for a 65-58 lead with 3:11 on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get back a few different times, a few different
situations,'' said Kentucky coach Tubby Smith. ``We were trying to
get the ball to the guards, but they made all the right moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Wildcats also made some wrong moves. They missed
three straight shots and two of four free throws after Michigan
State rolled to the seven-point lead, then had to rely on desperate
3-point shots. Peterson connected on six free throws in the last 29
seconds for Michigan State.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted it a lot more than us and they showed
it,'' Kentucky's Desmond Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   They will never win a contest for basketball beauty, they have
perhaps one player in Cleaves who is known nationally and they are
trying to do something that has not been achieved at their school
since Johnson was running the show 20 years ago, but the Spartans
looked gorgeous, gained a ton of national prominence and made their
former point guard howl like an undergraduate Sunday. Yes, it was a
magical day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get to the Final Four, anything can happen,'' Johnson
said. ``You have to go out there and make it happen. Now we have
the chance because we're there.'' &QL;

OAKLEY SHOWS THE KNICKS WHAT'S MISSING: HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Charles Oakley was surrounded by a bunch of dancing
and whirling kids bouncing on the purple-trimmed court as if it was
a box-spring mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley is too old for such nonsense. He is too grizzled and too
hardened to gloat, too crotchety to act like his fresh-faced,
hardly legal-aged teammates in Raptors jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Typically Oak, he lumbered slump-shouldered away from the
celebration with his head of dreadlocks tilted down. As he exited
after a hard day's work, the Knicks could watch every personality
trait they used to embrace leave the court, too.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks used to dig around for victories like
scavengers and rope rebounds with intimidation tactics. They used
to have nerves as steady as a bomb technician's and an uncanny
knack for big plays. They used to have Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a Toronto Raptor. And as he proved Sunday, the
clothes don't make the man. Oakley did everything he used to do as
a Knick while leading the Raptors to a franchise-high fifth
straight victory, 85-81, in a raucous overtime at Air Canada Center
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veteran teams would have found a way to pull that one out,''
Oakley said of the Knicks after grabbing 12 rebounds and scoring
all four of his points in overtime. ``We didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks, though younger and more athletic with
Marcus Camby instead of Oakley, could not find a way to win. For at
least the sixth time this year, the Knicks came unglued at the
finish. In the last 10 minutes 21 seconds of the game _ including
the 5 minutes of overtime _ the Knicks lost a seven-point lead by
shooting 3 for 14 from the field, hitting 3 of 9 free throws and
turning the ball over three times.
</P>
<P>
   Just as mind-blowing, the Raptors (11-12) embarrassed the Knicks
(15-11) with a gaudy 65-44 gap in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to get to where we want to be,'' said Patrick
Ewing, who was slow-footed Sunday but scored 21 and had the height
to grab 15 rebounds, ``we can't continue to make the unnecessary
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever fleeting chance the Knicks had was turned to dust when
Oakley's hustle got the best of them. After he grabbed two key
rebounds in overtime, he drifted open and coolly released his
familiar 18-foot jumper. Ewing, his defender, was nowhere near him
as Oakley gave the Raptors an 83-78 lead with 51.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After Latrell Sprewell failed to box out the rookie who walks on
air, Vince Carter (23 points), for a rebound of Dee Brown's miss
with 12.9 seconds left, the ball found Oakley again. He was fouled
by Chris Childs, walked to the free-throw line and calmly made both
shots with 7.6 seconds left to provide the Raptors with an
unreachable 85-80 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oak, he played like Oak,'' said Ewing, who was often guarded
by Oakley. ``I'm not sure how many shots he took, but he hit the
ones he had to at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beneath Oakley's gruff exterior was a smile after this
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nothing against the guys on the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley felt jilted by the Knicks' president, Ernie Grunfeld,
when he was traded in June for Camby. He felt betrayed by the
franchise that decided to reward him for a decade of service by
sending him to the outpost of Toronto, and he was embarrassed when
the organization decided to stage a tribute to him during the
halftime of his return to Madison Square Garden last month.
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, Oakley refused to jab back at the Knicks. The
game had been enough of a reply. The Knicks missed him and that was
enough. They have not been the same since he left. In each failure
down the stretch, the Knicks have been hounded by the same
culprits: rebounds, free throws and turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to keep losing in the same way,'' coach Jeff
Van Gundy said. ``Just frustrating. We haven't made the significant
shots or rebounds to finish a game. That's the difference.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The difference was in the frontcourt. Carter, Oakley and another
former Knick, John Thomas, combined for 32 rebounds. And Tracy
McGrady came off the bench for nine rebounds. Meanwhile, a limping
Larry Johnson had one rebound, Kurt Thomas had five, and Ewing had
a team-high 15 while Camby, who fouled out with 3:50 left in
overtime, grabbed just four off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' weak rebounding could not be smoothed over with an
offensive effort. Sprewell, frustrated by chasing Carter all day,
was 3 for 11. Allan Houston, dogged by defensive blunders and four
turnovers, hit 7 of 15 shots, but none in the fourth quarter or
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outworked,'' Childs said. ``We got outhustled, too.
They had 31 offensive boards. That's probably a record. The
question coming into the season after the moves the team made was
were we going to rebound. We have yet to prove we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have yet to prove they can make game-deciding,
Oak-like plays without Oakley on their side. &QL;

BIG MOMENT FOR UCLA WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech was a big fish in the Bayou 20 years ago but a
sardine in the sea that was women's college basketball. Then it
made its first trip to the Pacific Ocean's edge and upset the food
chain.
</P>
<P>
   In January of 1979, the Lady Techsters put away Pepperdine, UCLA
and USC to establish itself as a whole lot more than a regional
power.
</P>
<P>
   Their 85-81 upset of UCLA was a whale of a win, not just because
Billie Moore's bunch was the defending AIAW champion but also
because the Bruins were riding a 36-game winning streak at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The game, which swung on two free throws by Louisiana Tech's
Mary Mell Kendrick with 16 seconds left, effectively marked the end
of one era and the beginning of another.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which hadn't finished lower than second in the nation in
the four seasons prior to 1979, hasn't finished higher than ninth
in the 18 years the women have been under the auspices of the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Techsters would go on to play (and lose to) Old
Dominion in the 1979 national championship game. They since have
won three NCAA titles and graced 10 Final Fours. Last year a
perfect Tennessee team was all that stood between the Lady
Techsters and a fourth national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Louisiana Tech and UCLA will meet in the NCAA West
Regional title game at the Sports Arena. Once again, there's an
impressive winning streak on the line and one of the teams is
looking to make a name for itself at the other's expense.
</P>
<P>
   This time the winning streak belongs to the Lady Techsters, who
are unbeaten in 21 games, and the Bruins are the status seekers.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA advanced to the NCAA's Elite Eight for the first time in
school history Saturday with a 77-68 win over Colorado State. A
victory over the Lady Techsters would give the Bruins national
validation and maybe even some credibility in their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for the women, cavorting as the other
basketball team on a campus caught up in the aura of those 11 NCAA
men's championship banners. The men threw the women a beauty of an
outlet pass last week, bowing out in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So the ball's in the women's hands. If they can just finish with
a flourish, with a slam dunk on one of the premier teams, then
maybe people will stop asking center Janae Hubbard questions like,
``Do you practice in the men's gym?'' Or her personal favorite:
``Do you even get to step on Pauley Pavilion's court?''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Hubbard, a genteel giant, chuckled. She and the
rest of the Bruins' Fab Five junior class never doubted they'd one
day enjoy the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, Maylana Martin, Cathy Funicello, Melanie Pearson and
Marie Philman came to Westwood in the fall of 1996 from parts near
and nearer _ Fresno and Perris and North Hills and Huntington Beach
and Irvine. They came with a collective goal: to return UCLA to the
glory days it enjoyed when Ann Meyers and Denise Curry were running
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to do was build a program,'' Pearson said.
``That's what makes getting to the Elite Eight so special. We built
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, as Hubbard savored her biggest (but
hopefully not best) victory as a Bruin, she hardly knew what to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to express how good it feels,'' Hubbard said. ``With
the men going out in the first round, I think a lot of people at
school are starting to come around to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men's players came around for one of the women's
postseason games. Rico Hines and Ryan Bailey were turned away at
the door, though. They thought they could get in free and didn't
have enough money between them for a soda, much less two tickets.
</P>
<P>
   As the door shut in their faces, Hines and Bailey knew exactly
how it once felt to be a member of the women's basketball team. &QL;

A TALENTED RESERVE MAKES CONNECTICUT EVEN MORE OF A FORCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Connecticut, a 32-2 team, trucks to the Final Four
with this deployment:
</P>
<P>
   Center Jake Voskuhl. Tough. A mean game. Does not back down on
the offensive or defensive boards and gives the Huskies meaty
post-up defense. Forwards Richard Hamilton and Kevin Freeman.
Hamilton is the go-to guy. Silky smooth in the clutch. Freeman is a
warrior rebounder. Athletic and dangerous on put-back baskets.
Guards Ricky Moore and Khalid El-Amin. Moore is an unusual mixture
of dribbler, passer, shooter, defender and leader. El-Amin runs the
point. He is the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Connecticut, winner of the West Regional of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament with a 67-62
victory over Gonzaga here on Saturday, will pack to St. Petersburg,
Fla., for its semifinal match with Ohio State. It is a lethal and
symmetric starting five. A group that plays a singular and
collective brand of defense that can be overwhelming. Three juniors
on the front line, one senior guard (Moore) and one sophomore
(El-Amin). Stars all around.
</P>
<P>
   And then, once the opponent gets a handle on the starters, here
comes, off the bench, Edmund Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders is the X factor for Connecticut. He takes an excellent
team and makes it superior. He is the sugar topping. Every team
wants a player like Saunders, who can push it over the top.
</P>
<P>
   He is a sophomore forward, a lanky 6 feet 8 inches and 220
pounds. He is a new ingredient for Connecticut. He did not play
last season because he was academically ineligible. This season he
was ready off and on the court. Against Gonzaga, he could not wait.
He played 23 minutes, plenty for a backup; in fact, it was four
more minutes than the starter Voskhul, who was in foul trouble,
played. Saunders scored 8 points and grabbed 7 rebounds (4
offensive). But it was the manner in which he did it: full of
emotion, inspiring his team, deflating Gonzaga. And his interior
defense was superb, sliding left and right against the Gonzaga big
men, denying post points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmund is one of the most talented players on our team,'' said
Hamilton, the most talented of the Huskies. ``He can put the ball
on the floor and score on you or he can hit the jump shot. He is a
leader even though he's young. Edmund is the reason we have a team
at Connecticut that finally made it to the Final Four. If we had
him last year, we probably would have made it. We had him this year
and we made it. It's that one extra, special force. How good can he
be? As good as he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders has been hearing that for some time.
</P>
<P>
   He is from Waterbury, Conn., about an hour's drive from the
Connecticut campus in Storrs. Several coaches began recruiting him
when he was in eighth grade. Even then, they could sense his
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Before his big game against Gonzaga, he was in Connecticut's
bruising tournament tussle with Iowa, mixing it up easily with the
Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to get caught up in the physical stuff,'' Saunders
said. ``It was definitely a game where they were bringing it and we
were, too. But we've got the kind of team when it's all said and
done, that can just play basketball. After the pushing and the
talking, can you play? We can.''
</P>
<P>
   He can.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Big East schools wanted Edmund and North Carolina
wanted him early in the recruiting,'' said Dave Leitao,
Connecticut's associate head coach. ``We had some guys like Scott
Burrell who stayed home in the Connecticut area to play with us and
that set the tone. They showed you didn't have to go far to have
success, and that worked for us in getting Edmund. He has lots of
family and they live close enough so they can come to his games and
support him. He's a family guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmund is very athletic, has a feel for the game and gives us
a high intensity on the defensive end. He is emotional and we try
to channel that in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a young man who has special gifts, and if
he works hard there is no limit to what he can become.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut sees Saunders growing instantly, in his first
eligible season, right there in front of them. The Huskies see a
player who late against Gonzaga was tense and missed two free
throws but made up for that with hustle, determination and talent.
They see a player who all season has contributed in many ways,
always giving them something extra.
</P>
<P>
   The starting five for Connecticut snaps opponents to attention.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth man, Saunders, the X factor, makes Connecticut a Final
Four team.

MO VAUGHN BRINGS BAT AND LEADERSHIP TO THE ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Before the Boston Red Sox, before the Anaheim
Angels, there was Haimish Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher and Mo Vaughn were classmates at the New Canaan (Conn.)
Country School, but athletic ability was not something they shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had to play athletics, but he just wasn't an athlete,''
Vaughn recalled Sunday. ``We were blowing somebody out in a
basketball game, and I'm trying to get this kid to make a basket. I
wanted him to score one hoop before this season was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running down the floor on a fast break and I pitch him the
ball. Just me and him. He shoots and it banks off the iron. They're
running down. I give it to him again. I said, `You got to make
this.' He put a shot up and it went in and he felt good about it,
so I felt good about it. I just wanted him to make that shot. I
wanted him to experience it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare gesture the young Vaughn made that day, but it
foreshadowed the kind of leadership an older Vaughn would
demonstrate on a baseball field and in the clubhouse and dugout. He
has become known as much for his leadership as for his run
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to make people feel positive about
themselves,'' said Vaughn, dressing in the Angels clubhouse after
eight seasons in the Red Sox clubhouse. ``If I know that a guy who
has talent is not being aggressive enough, it upsets me because I
want everybody to feel they can do whatever they want if they
concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the burly first baseman speaks, his teammates listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many guys that when they yell at you in the
dugout and the clubhouse, you listen to,'' Mike Stanley said
earlier in spring training in the clubhouse that no longer houses
Vaughn. ``He's one of them. Other guys you kind of just say, `Sit
down and be quiet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn adopted a paternal position with his Boston teammates.
``Those guys were my friends,'' he said. ``I lived and died with
the success of those individuals. I felt I needed to protect them
as players. I knew I could handle the adversity, the intensity of
it and take the weight of it. But the only thing I felt was
necessary was to work as hard as you possibly can to get ready so
that when you go into a situation, you have no fear of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox lost Vaughn as a free agent last November because
they undervalued him both as a player and as a leader. After they
spent a year insulting him, he accepted a six-year, $80 million
deal from the Angels and instantly enhanced both their playoff
chances and the spirit among their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still getting to know guys, but you can tell looking in
his eyes, he has that fire,'' said Darin Erstad, who will move to
the outfield from first base to make room for Vaughn. ``He wants to
win; it's very obvious. I've never played with someone like that in
baseball who has that kind of presence about him, who has carried a
team, who has the reputation he has. I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, Erstad added, is the one who takes care of things if
they go wrong or if teammates bicker. ``That's very valuable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Collins, the Angels' manager, wanted to make it clear that
the Angels signed Vaughn for his bat, the one that last year hit a
career-high .337, slugged 40 home runs and drove in 115 runs.
``That's why he's here; that's how he's earned his money,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the manager then said: ``What he brings to this team
besides a great player on the field is a guy who approaches the
game like every manager and coach thinks the game needs to be
approached _ with dedication, with preparation, with a desire to
win. He's not afraid to say something to somebody if their effort
is not as much as his. That's what I think every clubhouse needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for a manager or a coach to walk in there and say
you need to pick it up. It's a little different when one of your
fellow teammates says it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's presence should make the Angels a serious threat to the
Texas Rangers in the American League West Division. Only three
games separated the teams last season. Vaughn's absence from the
Red Sox is expected to render them a noncontender even for the
wild-card spot they won last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't focus on the past,'' Vaughn said, choosing not to talk
about the circumstances that sent him west. ``I played in Boston, I
left no stone unturned, I played hard. I have no regrets. Coming
here was a change, a nice change. They wanted me over here. That's
the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people thought Vaughn would never leave Boston because of
the work he did there with children, including his creation of the
Mo Vaughn Youth Center in Dorchester. But, he said, they did not
understand what drives him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus always was the job site and how my employers
perceived me,'' he said. ``When that changed, it was time to make a
change. Now I'm in a situation where these people want me here.
It's a nice, easy transition.'' &QL;

DAVE LONGABERGER, BASKET MAKER, DIES AT 64
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)    (rk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Longaberger, a born basket weaver and business visionary
who figured out that the way to make basket weaving pay was to get
a lot of other people to do the weaving and a lot more to do the
selling, died on Wednesday at his home outside Newark, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He was 64 and had turned a small basket-weaving venture into a
$700 million-a-year business even as he transformed a slice of
central Ohio into a sprawling theme park based on Longaberger
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was kidney cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the charm of an old-fashioned hardwood maple
basket, especially one made by hand and signed and dated by the
maker. Still, it seems far-fetched to suppose that there would be a
modern-day demand for more than eight million such baskets a year,
or that they would become such sought-after collectors' items that
they would support a flourishing Internet trade with more than
1,000 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Longaberger was a master of the far-fetched. He was,
after all, the man who celebrated the success of his Longaberger
Co., which was based in Newark, by building as his corporate
headquarters a $30 million, seven-story structure in the form of a
market basket, complete with a pair of 75-ton handles on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Even his childhood was far-fetched. The son and grandson of
basket weavers, Longaberger was born in the little town of Dresden,
about 25 miles northeast of Newark, and grew up in a house with
three bedrooms, one bathroom and 12 children, all schooled in
basket weaving by their father, J.W. Longaberger, who made baskets
for local potters and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Longaberger, who got a job stocking grocery store shelves when
he was 6, always demonstrated a certain tenacity. Partly because he
had a severe stutter and suffered from epilepsy, he repeated the
first grade, was held back in the fifth grade twice and did not
graduate from high school until he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a series of jobs, including one as a Fuller Brush
salesman, and serving in the Army, he began his business career by
buying and operating a small restaurant in Dresden and later
acquiring a local grocery store and pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1973 that Longaberger, noticing that baskets
were becoming popular in shopping malls, began his basket business,
coaxing his father out of retirement and taking on four other
weavers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were so sluggish in the first years that in 1978, he
revamped his business. Taking the Tupperware page from the
direct-sales book, he enlisted sales associates to hold Longaberger
basket parties and added am Amway twist, giving associates a
percentage of the commissions earned by associates they recruited.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the baskets and the standard sales pitch, which
incorporated lore of the Longaberger family and the Dresden
basket-weaving tradition, were so powerful that the business grew
rapidly. Today the company employs 7,000 people, including 1,500
weavers, and there are more than 47,000 salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 80 styles and sizes of baskets, which sell for
$25 to $150, the company also sells, but does not make, pottery,
wrought-iron products, curtain fabrics and bedding. But it is the
baskets that have made Longaberger a household name.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the women who bought the baskets were so
enamored of them that they began making pilgrimages to Dresden,
which Longaberger obligingly turned into a tourist town, complete
with Longaberger restaurants, Longaberger shops and a Longaberger
museum.
</P>
<P>
   A man who gave away millions of dollars, Longaberger bought and
restored several Dresden buildings and even provided new sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   When the company outgrew Dresden, Longaberger moved its main
operations a few miles down State Road 16 to Frazeysburg, which
also became a tourist destination, as Newark did, in turn, when the
Longaberger basket building opened at the end of 1997. An estimated
500,000 tourists visit the area each year.
</P>
<P>
   After his cancer was diagnosed two years ago, Longaberger
promoted his elder daughter, Tami of Zanesville, to company
president and put his other daughter, Rachel of New Albany, in
charge of the family foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tami Longaberger seems to be a shrewd manager, it
remains to be seen whether she, or anyone else, can match her
father's soaring vision. She tried to talk her father out of
building the basket building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughters, Longaberger, who was married and
divorced twice, is survived by his mother, Bonnie of Dresden; six
sisters, Genevieve Hard of Thornville, Ohio, Wendy Little of
Dresden, Mary Ann McCafferty of Frazeysburg, Judy Swope of Dresden,
Ginny Lou Wilcox of Dresden and Carmen Fortney of Dresden; five
brothers, Larry of Newark and Jerry, Rich, Gary and Jeff, all of
Dresden, and five grandchildren.  &QL;

FINLEY SHARP FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Pitcher Chuck Finley made his second start of the
spring Sunday afternoon, going three innings and 51 pitches in the
Angels' 7-6 win over the Oakland A's at Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Finley looked sharp, allowing one run and three hits while
striking out three and walking none. His next start will be Friday,
when he tries to get up to about 65 pitches and five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have went out there again (for the fourth inning), but
I didn't want to push my luck,'' said Finley, who was slowed by a
muscle strain in his upper back/neck for most of camp. ``I'm so
advanced from where I would normally be in my second start. The
good thing today is that I got to work out of a stretch. And I came
out of it all right, which is good the way guys have been dropping
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley added that he is ``surprised at my command of all three
pitches (fastball, splitter, curveball). It seems like everything
is working.''
</P>
<P>
   He was named the opening-day starter by manager Terry Collins
weeks ago, but where his turn falls in the rotation probably will
push him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to pitch opening day, but if they think I'd be better
off to go to the end of the line, that's fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count on it,'' Collins said when asked about Finley's
opening-day start. ``Right now I don't think two more (spring)
starts is enough for him. Chuck's one of those guys who makes 115,
120 pitches a game. We need to get him up to 110 before he goes out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's normal turn would fall on the off-day Monday before
Tuesday's opening day (April 6). But if Finley needs another start
to be ready, he would pitch in minor-league camp in Mesa that
Monday and then make his season debut five days later.
</P>
<P>
   As it lines up now, Tim Belcher's turn in the rotation falls on
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Big-play day: Tim Unroe's three-run homer in the ninth inning
capped the Angels' rally from a 6-4 deficit. Unroe, a non-roster
invitee, has three homers this spring to tie him with Tim Salmon
for the team lead. Anaheim improved to 9-9 in Cactus League play.
</P>
<P>
   Hot corner update: Dave Hollins is still bothered by a sore left
hamstring, but because the starting spot at third base is on the
line he was in the lineup Sunday for the second game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins went 1 for 3 with a double and a run scored, raising his
spring average to .263 (5 for 19). Hollins knows there is no time
to waste, not with his competition, Troy Glaus, enjoying a
productive spring _ .438 (14 for 32), two homers and a team-leading
16 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting down to about 10 games left,'' Hollins said.
``If I woke up (Sunday) and it was hurting and I wasn't battling
for a job, then I might have sat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins obviously isn't close to 100 percent. On his double, he
slowed up going into second even though he might have had a chance
at a triple. He limped noticeably when scoring from second on Todd
Greene's single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pop it out,'' he said. ``This thing is
(normally) a 10-day to two-week thing. And it's been only a week
since the pull.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Hollins is well aware of what's going on,'' Collins said.
``It's why he's out there. He knows he needs to get at-bats and get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Upset over Edmonds: Jim Edmonds missed his third game in a row
because of a tight groin and is listed as day-to-day, and Collins
isn't exactly pleased with his Gold Glove center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Edmonds is hurt that has irritated Collins, but
how Edmonds got that way. During outfield drills a few days ago,
Edmonds was a little too playful and hurt himself diving for balls.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Left fielder Darin Erstad was scratched from Sunday's game
because of the stomach flu. Collins will give him the day off again
today. . . . The Angels cut three pitchers Sunday, sending Joe
Jacobsen, Ryan Hawblitzel and Darrin Winston to minor-league camp.

 &HT;    Braking technology keeps getting better
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology is an ongoing process, with one innovation often
leading to another. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the
automotive industry, specifically indriver-assisting safety
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   First there were anti-lock braking systems, or ABS, followed by
traction control systems. Now the industry is offering what may be
the best of the lot, stability control systems. But without ABS and
traction control systems, stability control systems could not
exist. All of the systems, regardless of automaker, work in concert
in one fashion or another.
</P>
<P>
   ABS is a system that uses wheel sensors, which measure wheel
rotation. An on-board computer determines if the wheels are locking
up and adjusts the hydraulic pressure accordingly to maintain
traction, allowing the driver to maintain steering control of the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, skid marks that lead to a crumpled spot on a
guardrail get darker as they get closer to the point of impact. The
marks tell you the driver kept pushing harder and harder on the
brake pedal trying to get the car to either stop or steer. To
regain control of the vehicle, the driver should have reduced brake
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A locked wheel has lost traction, and to regain it, you have to
allow the wheel to rotate. The only way to do that is to back off
the brake.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough call for any driver to make when he or she is
about to hit something. Computers, on the other hand, are not
distracted by outside events and go about their business quite
nicely. The only thing that is required of an ABS system is that
the driver push hard on the brake pedal and not release any
pressure until it has accomplished the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Next, add traction control. As the name indicates, these systems
are about maintaining a positive relationship between the tire and
the road surface. Typically, they work by measuring the difference
in wheel speeds. If one wheel is rotating faster than the others,
the system assumes it is spinning. Although systems differ from one
automaker to another, the ultimate goal is to make the spinning
wheel rotate at the same speed as the other wheels.
</P>
<P>
   These systems are particularly useful on slippery surfaces like
wet pavement, snowy roads, ice-covered bridges or sandy beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Many drivers think that when they have lost traction, applying
more gas will fix the problem. The real solution is less pedal
pressure. Basically, that is what a traction control system does.
It requires absolutely no input from the driver. It decreases the
amount of power to the wheel that is spinning so it can slow to the
point where is has the same rate of rotation as those wheels the
system assumes have traction.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption is an important one. For any traction control
system to work, there has to be the potential for traction present.
The fanciest computer-driven system in the world can't make a tire
grip a surface upon which there is no possibility of traction.
</P>
<P>
   Now come stability systems. They are the latest toys on the
automotive block. Through information gathered by yaw sensors,
which measure the sideways or lateral motion of a vehicle, and
working in concert with the ABS and traction control systems,
stability control systems help keep a car going in the direction
the driver wants.
</P>
<P>
   Remember your driving instructor's directions to steer in the
direction of a spin? If you have a stability control system, the
odds are that is a situation you will never have to address.

 &HT;    Versatile Integra exudes flair
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Acura Integra GS-R front-drive coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $22,654 (base: $22,100)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams and pads,
power anti-lock disc brakes
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (170
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: floor mats, $99
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 25 mpg premium unleaded city, 31 mpg highway
</P>
<P>
   The Integra is the lowest-priced model imported by Acura, the
upscale Honda division, but it's possible to make an argument that
it comes with the most potential for enjoyable driving.
</P>
<P>
   Various design and engineering features figure into that
characteristic, but the standout element is the Integra's
1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine. Available in 140- and
170-horsepower versions, it has good performance and decent fuel
economy, and gets good reliability ratings from the
consumer-concerned watchdog organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Integra line also offers the versatility of coupe
and sedan versions, with all three trim levels carrying impressive
lists of standard features. The LS, GS and GS-R models come with a
power moonroof, air conditioning, a six-speaker stereo with CD
player, power windows and mirrors, and tilt wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Base prices start at $19,200 for the LS coupe and slide up to
$22,400 for the GS-R four-door. The test GS-R totaled $22,654,
which includes a $455 delivery charge and one option, a $99 set of
floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Although not a large car, the Integra, due for a makeover for
the 2001 model, has plenty of room and extremely good visibility
for its driver and front passenger. Height and tilt adjustment give
the driver's seat optimum flexibility for all but extremely large
folks, and both it and the passenger seat are firmly comfortable
and supportive. The best thing about the rear seats in the coupe is
that they fold down to expand the cargo area.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected of a Honda/Acura car, the interior is
neatly arranged and, for the most part, nicely fitted and
furnished, except for some varying types of plastic. The dash is
set low to aid visibility, and the white-on-black instrumentation
remains very visible.
</P>
<P>
   Glance at the GS-R's instrumentation, and what will immediately
strike most buyers drawn to a car in this class _ luxury/sporty
subcompact _ is the tachometer with its red line at 8,000 rpm.
Acura isn't putting you on, either. The 170-hp four-cylinder in the
GS-R willingly revs, wails and pulls right on up to the red line,
but its sophisticated innards have enough trickle-down technology
from Formula One Grand Prix racing and the $80,000 Acura NSX sports
car to still provide low-end torque.
</P>
<P>
   Little ride comfort is sacrificed for the sake of the GS-R's
strong handling ability. No traction control system is offered, but
the balance and stability of the 2,700-pound Integra, along with
straight-stopping power anti-lock brakes, make that a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles on city streets, expressways and two-lane roads will
explain why both the coupe and sedan can appeal to young buyers who
like the panache and older drivers who want some sports-car-like
performance but also need a family-friendly four-door.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the Integra can get near the upper end of the price
range for a class with strong offerings from Chevrolet, Ford,
Chrysler and other foreign manufacturers. But as last year's
American sales total of about 34,000 indicates, the Integra will
move buyers, and the GS-R version does it best.

 &HT;    Who'll fix 'Jetsonmobiles' of the future?
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I went, I saw, I marveled and I walked away from this
year's International Auto Show in Atlanta feeling a bit awed,
somewhat confused and deeply concerned. Lots of dazzling paint,
chrome and creature comforts were evident, but the vehicles'
complexities and how they interact with the environment can spell
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As I wandered through each of the manufacturers' sections of
vehicles, I couldn't help but notice how the minivans seemed to be
forgotten while the crowds gathered around all makes and models of
sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The minivans have all or more of the amenities offered in the
SUVs. They are certainly as roomy. They get much better fuel
economy and are, for the most part, less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big love affair with these cushy trucks? They're hard
to park. They get terrible gas mileage and pollute the air a lot
more.
</P>
<P>
   But with the price of gasoline being so low, fuel economy is not
really an issue. But what about the pollution? Don't the soccer
moms who have traded in their minivans on one of these gas-guzzlers
realize what they are doing to their kids' air? I wonder if gas
masks come in team colors?
</P>
<P>
   the new ``Valdez'' There are, however, stylish alternatives that
show that cool doesn't have to be big.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's PT Cruiser is a retro-looking small alternative to a
big SUV. It is based on the Neon car and has the potential to be
the next ``woody.''
</P>
<P>
   And high performance doesn't have to be high pollution.
DaimlerChrysler also showed the natural gas-powered Charger R/T
concept car. That's an attempt to deal with the environmental
problem and be the leader of the pack, not part of it. A little red
car caught my eye. The representative asked me if I wanted to sign
up for a test drive. We talked for a moment, and I told him I was
an automotive instructor. He asked me if I knew how to reprogram
the chips, the computer controls that regulate engine performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean other than the manufacturer's specs?'' I asked. He
nodded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal,'' I said and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Reprogramming outside of specifications to enhance performance
can compromise emissions, fuel mileage and safety. That's why
making the changes is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   I ambled over to the luxury section of the show. All the
comforts of home from the driver's seat and an engine with power to
spare _ eight cylinders, 32 valves with variable valve timing.
Seats that sense and conform to your body weight and movement. Side
impact air bags. Night vision heads-up display using infrared
technology.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I knew these options were on
the horizon. I guess it was the reality of finally seeing them in
real life that jolted me.
</P>
<P>
   What is going to happen when this stuff breaks?
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about the current, sparse enrollment in our
automotive program at school. It's beyond the limits of most
mechanics to repair the vehicles we are driving today, let alone
``Jetsonmobiles.'' Who in the world is going to fix these things?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started teaching, I would tell my students, ``Just
imagine it, and someday cars will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's here now, and I don't know if my imagination can take
much more. What's worse, I don't know where tomorrow's
rocket-scientist mechanics are going to come from.

PATAKI FAULTS GIULIANI'S RESPONSES TO `MORAL OUTRAGE' AT DIALLO
SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the grand jury investigation of the Amadou
Diallo case wrapping up and the daily protests over Diallo's
slaying in a hail of police gunfire gathering momentum, Gov. George
Pataki described the case Sunday as horrific and suggested that the
Giuliani administration was not ``responding appropriately to
criticism'' over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as Ed Koch, a former New York City mayor,
state Comptroller Carl McCall and the Bronx borough president,
Fernando Ferrer, all said that they planned to be arrested outside
Police Headquarters Monday to protest the Diallo shooting and the
administration's response to it.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was killed on Feb. 4 in the
vestibule of his apartment in the Bronx by four officers from the
Police Department's Street Crimes Unit. Diallo was unarmed and had
no criminal record. The incident has led to continuing protests,
including almost daily acts of civil disobedience outside Police
Headquarters in lower Manhattan, including the arrest of ex-Mayor
David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced those protests as
``publicity stunts'' and said that they were getting ``silly.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most pointed comments on the Diallo case to date, Pataki
said on the ABC news program ``This Week With Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts'' that the shooting had created an understandable
sense of moral outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has done an excellent job on issues like crime,'' he
said, ``and the police have done an excellent job, but the Diallo
incident was so horrendous and so horrific that it has created a
sense of moral outrage, an understandable sense of moral outrage
where all of us have to take a look.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear reference to the mayor's caustic response to the
protests, the governor added, ``I think the city is doing very
well, but part of governing is being tolerant and listening to
criticism and responding appropriately to criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the governor's comments, Giuliani, who was in
Phoenix for a speaking engagement, said: ``I haven't seen exactly
what the governor said. I think the New York City Police Department
conducts itself appropriately and has an excellent record of
restraint which, unfortunately, is not getting the attention that
it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth between the mayor and the governor is another
indication that their political relationship, never very warm, has
chilled even further in recent months as they have done battle over
issues ranging from school construction to which highway should be
named after Joe DiMaggio. It also comes as the two, both
Republicans, are seeking a higher profile nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's criticism capped a week in which the Police
Department and the Giuliani administration seemed increasingly
under fire. Dinkins and Rep. Charles Rangel were arrested to
protest the shooting; state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
announced a civil-rights inquiry into the Police Department's
stop-and-frisk practices; federal prosecutors announced their own
civil rights investigation into the street crimes unit, where the
four officers who shot Diallo were assigned, and Public Advocate
Mark Green called on Police Commissioner Howard Safir to resign.

to park. They get terrible gas mileage and pollute the air a lot
more.
</P>
<P>
   But with the price of gasoline being so low, fuel economy is not
really an issue. But what about the pollution? Don't the soccer
moms who have traded in their minivans on one of these gas-guzzlers
realize what they are doing to their kids' air? I wonder if gas
masks come in team colors?

<P>
   the new ``Valdez'' There are, however, stylish alternatives that
show that cool doesn't have to be big.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's PT Cruiser is a retro-looking small alternative to a
big SUV. It is based on the Neon car and has the potential to be
the next ``woody.''
</P>
<P>
   And high performance doesn't have to be high pollution.
DaimlerChrysler also showed the natural gas-powered Charger R/T
concept car. That's an attempt to deal with the environmental
problem and be the leader of the pack, not part of it. A little red
car caught my eye. The representative asked me if I wanted to sign
up for a test drive. We talked for a moment, and I told him I was
an automotive instructor. He asked me if I knew how to reprogram
the chips, the computer controls that regulate engine performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean other than the manufacturer's specs?'' I asked. He
nodded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal,'' I said and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Reprogramming outside of specifications to enhance performance
can compromise emissions, fuel mileage and safety. That's why
making the changes is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   I ambled over to the luxury section of the show. All the
comforts of home from the driver's seat and an engine with power to
spare _ eight cylinders, 32 valves with variable valve timing.
Seats that sense and conform to your body weight and movement. Side
impact air bags. Night vision heads-up display using infrared
technology.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I knew these options were on
the horizon. I guess it was the reality of finally seeing them in
real life that jolted me.
</P>
<P>
   What is going to happen when this stuff breaks?
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about the current, sparse enrollment in our
automotive program at school. It's beyond the limits of most
mechanics to repair the vehicles we are driving today, let alone
``Jetsonmobiles.'' Who in the world is going to fix these things?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started teaching, I would tell my students, ``Just
imagine it, and someday cars will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's here now, and I don't know if my imagination can take
much more. What's worse, I don't know where tomorrow's
rocket-scientist mechanics are going to come from.

CARDINAL URGES A DIALOGUE TO REBUILD TRUST IN POLICE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a Sunday Mass dedicated to officers of the New
York City Police Department, Cardinal John O'Connor entered the
emotional and political storm around the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo by expressing his gratitude for the officers' service and
urging an end to the hostile rhetoric between city officials and
leaders of the daily protests against the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of people, anyone with any sense, in
my judgment, recognizes that the majority of police officers in New
York are people of integrity and decency,'' the cardinal said,
``that they are people struggling like all of us. You make
mistakes. Some have made grave mistakes, mistakes that have been
damaging, mistakes that have been damaging to people and damaging
to families.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the packed sanctuary at St. Patrick's Cathedral
_ at least half of the crowd in pressed navy-blue uniforms _ he
said: ``You also make tremendous sacrifices. Many of you put your
lives on the line every day. It is a sacrifice for you and for your
families. And we are grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the cardinal said city officials must
not dismiss widespread perceptions that law enforcement officers
mistreat black and Hispanic suspects, nor blame the tensions on
media coverage. He said he had met with many community leaders and
advised them that the only way to rebuild trust between the police
and the community is through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the cardinal said he will lead an ecumenical prayer
service on April 8. Emphasizing that it would be for prayer, not
protest, he invited the police to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there has been discrimination against blacks and Latinos
and Asians,'' the cardinal said, ``then we do no good by denying
those injustices. As long as those perceptions are there, then they
must be dealt with. And it is rare that perceptions have no basis
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also directed remarks at those who have staged daily
protests outside police headquarters. ``We cannot have
reconciliation,'' he said, ``if the talks begin with assumptions
that the police department is rotten to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Mass was dedicated to the Holy Name Society, an
association of Roman Catholic officers within the police
department. The cardinal said he felt nervous about the sermon
because of the intense anxiety generated in the city by the slaying
of Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant. To make matters
worse, the cardinal said, when he tried to print the sermon that he
had typed on his computer, he lost the computer file and could not
retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the glitch meant God must have wanted him to
speak from his heart as much as from his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have wanted me to say what I believe the overwhelming
majority of people in New York, whatever their race or religion,
want to say,'' the cardinal declared, ``and that is we deeply
believe in you. We trust you. We are grateful for you. We love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the police brutality crisis to the scandal that
plagued the archdiocese at the end of the 1980s, when several
priests were accused of sexually molesting youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church suffered severely,'' he said. ``Every priest felt a
cloud descend upon him. Here were men who had sacrificed their
families and other loved ones to serve the church, and all they got
from society was suspicion, some of it bordering on contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said that while he grieves for Diallo and his
relatives, he also grieves for the four officers accused of firing
41 shots that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus weeps over all the suffering in the world,'' he said.
``Jesus weeps for Amadou Diallo. Jesus weeps for Mrs. Diallo. Jesus
weeps for all those who have been victims of tragedy. And Jesus
weeps for those who feel the cloud has fallen over them because of
a tragedy. Jesus weeps for those who are suspects in causing a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the service, the officers gathered in front of the
cathedral, turning Fifth Avenue into a river of blue, and marched
together to a hotel for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Louis Richardson, a 38-year veteran who serves in the
Sixth Precinct, watched for a while before joining his colleagues.
He said most officers felt tainted by the Diallo shooting. And he
said he has heard concerns about the police from many relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not know what happened in the vestibule of
Diallo's Bronx apartment building the night he was shot. But he
said only officers understand the difficulty of making
lightning-fast decisions about whether a suspect is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you act too fast, you might hurt someone who is innocent,''
he said, ``and if you don't act fast enough, then the suspect could
kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sgt. Rudy Hamilton, who is posted at police headquarters and
walks past Diallo protesters every day, O'Connor's sermon was a
source of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that even though there's a cloud over us right now, we
still have to get up and go out there and show our faces,'' he
said. ``That crowd has a complaint, and I respect their right to
protest. But I will never duck when I walk by.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife beaming beside him, Hamilton, who has been on the
force 15 years, said, ``I am proud to put on this uniform.''

Michigan State storms back, ends Kentucky's hopes of repeat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ ``We're playing the men in the jerseys, not the
jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State players repeated that phrase so often over the
past two days you could almost hear their pep band providing
background music for the mantra.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first 10 minutes after the opening tip against
defending national champion Kentucky, it appeared the Spartans _
like frightened singers on stage for the first time _ had forgotten
the words to their own song.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, a demonstrative tongue-lashing by senior
forward Antonio Smith got the Spartans in rhythm before it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State closed an early 13-point deficit to a single
point by halftime, then controlled the second half with defense and
rebounding to stop Kentucky 73-66 Sunday before a record crowd of
42,519 in the Midwest Regional final at the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Michigan State (33-4), which is playing its 100th
season of basketball, advanced to the Final Four for just the third
time in school history and the first time in 20 years. For
third-seeded Kentucky (28-8), a run of three consecutive
appearances in the national championship game came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you dream about as a kid _ getting to the
Final Four _ but most people only get to dream about it,'' Michigan
State guard Mateen Cleaves said. ``I'm floored by it, and it
probably hasn't hit me yet, but I'm excited. I wish we could fly to
Florida tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves will have to wait a few days before heading to St.
Petersburg, site of this year's Final Four, where Michigan State
will face No. 1-ranked Duke in the NCAA Tournament semifinals on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans found it hard to quell their enthusiasm for going
farther in the Tournament than any team at the school since Magic
Johnson, who was among the Spartans faithful in the
Kentucky-dominated crowd, led Michigan State to the national title
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the opening period, it looked as if
Cleaves and the Spartans would only have to worry about a flight
home. Kentucky came out of the gate on the run and led 17-4 after
seven minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 6-8, 250-pound bruiser who was the first recruit
Michigan State coach Tom Izzo signed when he took the job four
years ago, went face-to-face with every Spartan and challenged his
teammates to get back to the type of play that had gotten them to
the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew we weren't about to go down without a fight,''
Smith said. ``We were timid, and we weren't getting after it
defensively or on the boards, and that's not like us. I don't know
if we were scared or not, but we weren't playing like we normally
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause for the slow start, Smith's pep talk got the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   It also did not hurt matters that Morris Peterson, who led all
scorers with 19 points, and A.J. Granger came off the bench to
provide some instant offense for the struggling Spartans, who were
just 3-of-15 from the floor to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   Granger hit 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to ignite a
blitz during which Michigan State scored on 12 of 16 possessions
and hit 10 of 13 field-goal attempts to pull within 36-35 at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Normally poised Kentucky, which had won nine straight Tournament
games, went from being oh-so-close to throwing a knockout punch to
being in a nip-and-tuck battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, we were the team that got excited about the big
start,'' Wildcats forward Scott Padgett said. ``They kept their
poise and didn't try to get it all back right away. We still felt
like we were going to win the game, but they made the big plays
down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cleaves hit a long 3-pointer at the first-half buzzer _
Kentucky coach Tubby Smith called it a ``momentum changer'' _
neither team led by more than four points until Michigan State
opened up some room with a late run.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans completely turned the halftime statistics around
with a spirited effort following the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, the Wildcats held a 19-11 rebounding margin and a
12-2 advantage in second-chance points, thanks to 10 offensive
rebounds. By the end of the game, Michigan State had won the
rebounding battle 33-29 and evened the second-chance points at 15.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Tayshaun Prince and senior Heshimu Evans led the
Wildcats with 12 points each, but Evans got in foul trouble and did
not score in the final 30 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense in the second half was outstanding,'' said
Smith, who suffered his first Tournament loss as the Wildcats'
coach. ``Actually, it started midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with my team, especially the seniors. It was
a great run. We can hold our heads up as we got beat by a very good
team today.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading 54-53 with 8:03 to play, Kentucky suffered through a
drought that lasted nearly four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett, who was just 1-of-6 from the floor, including 0-for-4
from the 3-point line until hitting a pair of 3-pointers in the
final 30 seconds, misfired on a trey to start the five-possession
dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Evans traveled, Wayne Turner turned the ball over, and Padgett
missed the front end of a one-and-one before Turner missed a layup
and Desmond Allison grabbed the rebound and missed an easy follow
attempt to keep the Wildcats stuck on 54.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Spartans got a couple of layups from Andre Hutson
and a 3-pointer from Cleaves to open a 60-54 lead with less than
five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Things got interesting in the final minute with Padgett's 3s,
but Peterson, who also had a game-high 10 rebounds, went 6-for-6
from the foul line in the final 29 seconds to seal the win for the
Spartans.

COMMENTARY: IDEAS FOR DATES INCH CLOSER TO REALITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even hardened veterans of the Manhattan singles scene
were depressed by Michael Russo's performance in ``Unmade Beds,''
the quasi-documentary film by Nicholas Barker that came out last
year. Russo was one of the four people who played themselves in
re-enacting the worst moments of their dating careers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who was 53 years old, was using personal ads and dating
services to search for a very specific partner: a woman between 25
and 45 who looked like Cindy Crawford, Linda Evans or Veronica
Webb. ``I only go out with beautiful women,'' he said into the
camera as he sat _ alone _ in his small apartment in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   For quality control, he carried a beeper on blind dates so that
he could activate it to make a quick escape. ``They say they are
all beautiful women, and when they show up, they're mutts,'' he
said disgustedly. ``I've never gone out with a mutt, and I'm not
going to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would someone who looked like Cindy Crawford want to go out
with him? That remained a mystery in the film. Russo acknowledged
that he was balding and overweight and looked nothing like Robert
Redford. He said that women often disdained him for lacking money
and social status and glamour. He admitted that despite trying to
pass himself off as a screenwriter, he had never sold a script. Yet
he still considered himself a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is Michael,'' he explained. ``The woman who gets me
now is going to get one hell of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be suffering from a form of self-delusion that
psychologists call the Lake Wobegon effect, in honor of Garrison
Keillor's fictional town in Minnesota where all the children are
above average. People habitually overestimate their own talents, as
demonstrated by studies in which huge majorities of the respondents
rate themselves above average in intelligence, in work
productivity, in driving skill _ in just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Single New Yorkers are vulnerable to this delusion, judging from
the many who can't find anyone worthy of marriage, but Russo's case
was so extreme that further research seemed in order. When I tried
to track him down last year, I discovered that his problems were
even more complicated than I'd imagined.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Susan Russo, told me that shortly after the movie
was filmed in 1997, he began acting strange and lost his job as
assistant director of New York University's security force. Then he
stopped paying his bills and lost his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He was occasionally spotted living on the streets, wandering
around in ragged clothes and a long unkempt beard. Eventually, in
October of last year, he collapsed and was taken by the police to
Bellevue Hospital Center, where doctors discovered the cause of his
personality change: an enormous tumor in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from three operations, he moved home with his
mother in the Village, and last week he felt strong enough to talk
once again about life and love. Sitting with his sister in her
apartment in the Flatiron district, he sounded much more charming
than he had in the movie. His ordeal on the streets and in the
hospital had made him reconsider his dating philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling lonely,'' he said. ``I spent 30 years
avoiding long-term commitments. Now I want to find someone who
would like to make a commitment. I'm ready to start making
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister looked relieved. ``He's just starting to learn you
can't live your life alone. None of those beautiful women he was
chasing in the old days came to visit him in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely moment, but then Russo said there was a limit to
his spirit of compromise. ``She can't be a mutt,'' he said. ``If
she's a mutt I'll lose interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about his own liabilities in the marketplace? Despite
his sister's efforts to get him rehired at NYU, he still had no
job, and he was still trying to make the first sale of a
screenplay. ``I'm not in the best position to go after someone
now,'' he acknowledged. ``I don't have any money and I'm living
with my mother. But I can show someone a good time if they're
willing to give me a try. I always have to set my standards high.''
</P>
<P>
   So he was still looking for Cindy Crawford?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she doesn't have to be Cindy Crawford,'' he said with a
grin. ``Martha Stewart would be fine.'' Perhaps, by the standards
of the New York singles scene, that qualifies as emotional growth.

NEW YORK MAYOR TALKS PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani spent the weekend
meeting with Arizona Republicans to discuss national politics, and
taking a rare break to play golf and relax before giving a speech
Sunday evening to an American Medical Association conference.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, the mayor's stated reason for being here, was
delivered at the association's National Leadership Development
Conference, which featured other prominent Republican speakers,
including former President George Bush and U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who has expressed strong interest in running for
the U.S. Senate next year, has also been building a close
relationship with Arizona's other senator, John McCain, who has
expressed similarly strong interest in running for president, and a
visit to Arizona allows the mayor to strengthen his ties to the
McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in Washington this weekend, but Giuliani said he met
with several members of McCain's staff and other Republicans to
discuss presidential politics. The mayor said that his visit did
not involve any fund raising and that discussions did not focus on
his own political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have discussions about the presidential race,'' the
mayor said after his speech. ``I had a meeting last night with a
number of Republicans in Arizona, but really it was more concerned
with national politics and various presidential bids, including
Senator McCain's.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Giuliani discussed the usual subjects that he
mentions in out-of-town talks, including New York's steep drop in
reports of crime and its booming economy and tourism. He opened
with his standard imitation of a mob gangster.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a nod to the broiling dispute back home, Giuliani was
careful to repeat his praise of New York City's police force,
saying that officers' use of firearms had been reduced more than
crime itself. It is a point the mayor has made consistently since
the shooting of Amadou Diallo by four police officers.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Giuliani answered several questions about the
continuing protests outside New York City Police Headquarters. Told
that Floyd Flake of Queens, a former representative who has been a
supporter of the mayor, planned to join the protests, Giuliani said
that the demonstrations had become redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any purpose in people getting
themselves arrested,'' he said. ``I think everyone understands the
point that's being made. Continuing to do this is merely piling
on.'' And, in what has become practically a daily exercise,
Giuliani praised the police force and its street crimes unit, which
he said has been under ``relentless attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who spent Friday afternoon in Ithaca, N.Y., has been
spending an increasing amount of time away from New York City. He
acknowledged that he worked in some time for golf in the desert
sun.

Rockets retain focus in spite of distractions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets officially moved past the feeling-out stages, past the
learning processes and lockout-season realities.
</P>
<P>
   But the change was not a matter of counting games in the 50-game
season and finding themselves at the midpoint of the season. It was
more intentional, less incidental than a date on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, finding themselves halfway through the regular
season and 25 games from the postseason, began a playoff push. And
they moved to that with a shove from coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the guys about that (Saturday),'' Tomjanovich
said. ``I told them, `We have the same amount of losses as San
Antonio and the Lakers (nine). Well, why can't we be the third
seed?' That should be our focus right now, going after that deal.
If we don't get it, we don't get it. We'll play the hand that's
dealt. But I think that's a fair and reasonable goal to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the Jazz and Trail Blazers' fast starts with unchanged
teams have put them out of regular-season reach, the retooled
Rockets find themselves at midseason chasing nearly the same
regular-season accomplishments they might have considered within
reach when the season started full of hope and promise.
</P>
<P>
   At midseason, that might remain the Rockets' status, full of
possibilities made evident by a recent run. But that status also
reflects a sudden turnaround, covering far more ground than would
seem when comparing preseason plans to midseason accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks earlier the Rockets were whipped in Portland and
in line for a first-round playoff meeting with the Lakers and
likely no home-court advantage in the postseason. Even just a week
ago, they had lost to a Suns team not certain to make the playoffs
and were shaken by Scottie Pippen's complaints he had no clear role
in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But at midseason, they are tied with the Spurs for fourth in the
Western Conference, one game behind the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Rockets are on their best sustained run,
winning six of seven and eight of their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the fourth-best record in the West and we haven't
played that long together,'' forward Charles Barkley said. ``We're
going to be good before the end of the season. We're playing well
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing better overall, in every area. The chemistry is
better. We won six of seven. I told you when I got hurt it would
take about two weeks to get everybody back on the same page. That's
been about right.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago they did not seem to be reading from the same
playbook. Pippen's comments stung, especially because the Rockets
knew they were a work in progress, trying to address the problems
that had frustrated him. But they also do not seem to have caused
any damage, and if anything might have increased a sense of urgency
to make the mix of talents work.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen would not say what effect his comments have had on the
team or his play. But there has been a marked difference in his
posture when pressed about the offense.
</P>
<P>
   He was more of a focal point in Tuesday's win over Portland. But
the offense was centered on Hakeem Olajuwon down the stretch in the
win over Denver and Barkley in Saturday's victory over Phoenix.
Pippen was often stationed at the 3-point line or on the opposite
baseline, often opening opportunities for other outside shooters by
bringing a defender out of range to double team or rotate.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen described himself as more comfortable with and clear
about his role and the offense as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I was fitting in in the offense,'' Pippen said.
``Right now, I'm more of an integral part of the offense. We're
starting to play better as a whole, as a team. When Charles and
Dream down in the low post don't have it going, they're able to
step out and set picks and help everybody else get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for me. When we have guys with the types of
offensive skills these guys have got, it makes us better as a team.
We're still trying to get familiar with each other. But we're
picking our spots. We're sort of sharing a lot more than when I
first got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more games we play, the better we'll be. We'll jell more
as a team. And we're sharing the spotlight. Some nights Dream has
it going, or Charles or myself or one of our younger players.''
</P>
<P>
   Without addressing any role his public comments might have had
in shaping his role, Pippen even said he was happier with the way
he is being used, particularly as a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better,'' Pippen said. ``I feel like I'm being
utilized, and I'm able to be a big part of the team's offense. I
think it's made a difference to our team. It was probably my fault
more so than anything. But this has allowed me to have more
leadership and control of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of being able to control the tempo, make
the decisions and get the ball to the right person's hands, I can
hopefully get it to where we can execute. When you have the ball in
your hands you control the tempo of the game. It allows you to stay
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't put you in position to be down 15 points and having
to battle your way back into games. You control the tempo. That's
the most important thing. It's just a matter of you coming down and
executing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than Pippen's feeling about the offense that has
brightened the Rockets' perspective. In the past two weeks, Barkley
has improved rapidly from the effects of his knee surgery five
weeks ago. Antoine Carr, who was one of the additions that inspired
so much preseason confidence but has played in just one game, is
close to returning from the injured list. The addition of Sam Mack
has given the Rockets another 3-point shooting threat, taking
pressure off the Rockets' rookie backcourt of Michael Dickerson and
Cuttino Mobley and some of the playing-time burden from Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Rockets' streak of six wins in seven games, Olajuwon
has become increasingly effective inside, averaging 22.1 points per
game during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can always play much better,'' Olajuwon said. ``Where we
are now, we have much room for improvement. We should be peaking,
trying to come together going toward the playoffs. Everybody should
be at their peak collectively and individually for the playoffs. We
want to have at least some home-court advantage in the first round
or the first two rounds. Now is the time to position ourselves for
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets can think that way because after the past two weeks,
they can think again of doing damage in the postseason. They remain
among the league's most efficient offensive teams, have recently
begun to pick up their defense, and have begun to cut back on
turnovers, clearly their biggest weakness in the first half. And
the mood is nearly as hopeful as it was a half-season ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start winning, everybody is happy,'' guard Brent
Price said. ``That's the way it goes. When you're winning, you
start feeling good. When you're losing, you start to question. The
important thing is as a team, we have to stay together and battle
all the way through the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches would tell you we're doing great. I know the fans
had huge expectations. It just takes time. If you could just throw
a bunch of guys together and win, it wouldn't mean anything. We've
battled and had our share of controversy. I think it's starting to
come together. We're sitting in a good spot right now. The rest of
this month the schedule is in our favor. We feel good where we're
at right not.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to think of the playoffs and enjoy the thought.

Lockout causes NBA teams different kinds of woes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Perhaps the most amazing thing about this NBA season is that it has
reached the midway point.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just a few weeks ago we were embroiled in a lockout?
Wasn't it just a few weeks ago ``training camp,'' that one-week
period into which teams tried to cram a month's worth of work,
began?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it was just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   So, here we are, halfway through. Already.
</P>
<P>
   And what a ride it's been.
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, many questioned whether the abbreviated
post-lockout schedule of 50 games would produce a worthy NBA
champion. That such a brief season would put a dreaded asterisk
next to this year's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   With the crush of games and a hectic travel schedule, teams have
not only had to fight each other, but fight themselves as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's almost more legit,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich of the validity of this year's champion. ``I think it's
a bigger test. I think the mental and physical part you have to go
through is so much tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (normal) NBA season is a grind, but this is a 440(-yard
dash). A couple of 440s. I've already mentioned this _ the
irritability, fatigue and frustration level that people go through
is going to be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The team best able to avoid the above-mentioned distractions
will be standing at the end. Several teams have cracked under the
pressure, with the New Jersey Nets and the Minnesota Timberwolves
being the most obvious examples.
</P>
<P>
   But the one team that seems impervious to all outside forces,
the Utah Jazz, just keeps pick-and-rolling along.
</P>
<P>
   There have been enough injuries to keep the cast of ER working
for years to come, and enough bricks to build an arena for every
city in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is down all around the league, almost as low as the
shooting percentages.
</P>
<P>
   And heads have rolled. The Lakers' Del Harris, New Jersey's John
Calipari and Charlotte's Dave Cowens are out of work, and many
suspect New York's Jeff Van Gundy soon will join them.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long, crazy season. And it's only half over.
</P>
<P>
   Surprises
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves, if only because they have Kevin Garnett
playing with Joe Smith and over-the-hill Terrell Brandon instead of
Tom Gugliotta and Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Money, what else? Owner Glen Taylor wanted to
make Marbury and Garnett the John Stockton and Karl Malone of the
next millennium, so to keep the foundation in place, Taylor gave
Garnett the now-infamous six-year, $126 million extension.
</P>
<P>
   But Gugliotta left because he couldn't stand playing with
Marbury, and it turns out the high-strung point guard couldn't
stand playing in Garnett's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Or the shadow cast by his wallet, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is KG (Garnett),'' said Minnesota coach Flip
Saunders. ``(Marbury) said, `Right now, whether it's right or
wrong, I have a tough time playing with KG when he's making the
amount of money he's making and I'll be making only $71 million.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried, No. 1, to explain the idea of `only making $71
million' to him. And two, we shouldn't be penalized because of the
system. But if a guy doesn't have his heart in the right place,
then we have to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, if Gugliotta knew the way this situation was going
to play out, Tommy would still be here. His agent (Richard Howell)
told us, flat out, that Tommy had a problem playing with Stephon.
But we weren't willing to trade Steph to keep Googs.''
</P>
<P>
   With Allen Iverson leading the way, the Philadelphia 76ers have
come on like gangstabustas, playing .600 ball and doing it their
way. Iverson made the move to shooting guard (like he wasn't a
shooting guard before, right?) and the team took off.
</P>
<P>
   With non-demanding (the ball) types like Eric Snow, George
Lynch, Matt Geiger and Theo Ratliff on the court, Iverson is free
to create for himself. The difference is he's creating for his
teammates as well.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers are also probably the most fun to watch, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Bucks, enthusiastically embracing George Karl's
system, have bolted out of the blocks with a 14-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   They have no center to speak of, but they have more shooters
than a firing squad. Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Dell Curry, Vinny
Del Negro, Armon Gilliam and Sam Cassell can fire it in with the
best of them. You can't leave anybody open on this team.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers have shaken off their bad-boy image
to become one of the league's best, and certainly its deepest,
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's just a matter of time before Isaiah Rider explodes,
but with Damon Stoudamire, Brian Grant, Rasheed Wallace, Arvydas
Sabonis, Jim Jackson and Greg Anthony coming at you in waves, these
guys could have what it takes to go all the way. Except maturity,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Armstrong. While most view the Orlando Magic as Penny
Hardaway's team, this flea-like point guard has established himself
as the front-runner for Sixth Man of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   An incredibly quick, gifted athlete, Armstrong also has a rare
work ethic that has turned him from 10-day tryout to million-dollar
sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list in this department is the NBA, which put
together a schedule that has teams playing without the benefit of
training camp or practice time. Yeah, that makes for some pretty
good basketball. Shooting percentages have plummeted to ridiculous
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a lot of talent and you're playing more
games, it magnifies everything,'' Charles Barkley said. ``You have
to use those terrible players more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a lot of minutes now. Those guys that used to play
10 minutes a night are now playing 25 minutes a night.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nyets have taken underachieving to a new level
this season, so they fired the coach and the team, essentially.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari was canned soon after the blockbuster trade that
brought in Marbury from Minnesota and put Cassell on the road to
Milwaukee was completed. Still, any team that can put Marbury (or
Cassell), Keith Van Horn, Jayson Williams, Kerry Kittles and
Kendall Gill on the court has no business playing sub-.500 ball,
much less the sub-.200 ball the Nots are ``playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets have shown a history of doing everything
possible to rid themselves of talent, so why should this year be
different?
</P>
<P>
   The team that has dumped Geiger, Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson,
Vlade Divac, Muggsy Bogues and Del Curry had another fire sale and
ridded itself of Glen Rice, who was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers
for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will be a free agent after next season, so the clock is
ticking on his career in Charlotte-ry.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix entered the season with glowing visions of contending
for a championship in the Valley of the Sun after acquiring center
Luc Longley from Chicago and signing free-agent forward Gugliotta
to add to a roster that included Jason Kidd and Rex Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   But after their overtime loss to the Rockets on Saturday night,
the Suns slipped below the .500 horizon at 12-13. Make that the
Valley of the Stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Vin Baker has been a study in frustration, starting
the season in a horrible free-throw slump and then losing his
confidence inside because he feared being fouled.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star and future Dream Teamer found himself on the bench
when Seattle coach Paul Westphal was forced to go with someone who
wanted to do something other than launch 20-foot jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   And now, our midseason awards: &QL; 
Most Valuable Player _ Alonzo Mourning, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year _ Vince Carter, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year _ George Karl, Milwaukee.

`BLEACHER CREATURES' BRAVE THE COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jennifer Miramon spent four cold, sleepless, rainy
nights on the streets of Los Angeles with only thoughts of Brad
Pitt to keep her warm.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, her perseverance was rewarded when she and several
classmates from Woody Creek High School in Roseville, Calif.,
scored front-row bleacher seats bordering the red-carpeted entry to
the the 71st Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   She waited breathlessly for a glimpse of the one star she was
dying to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad Pitt,'' the teen said dreamily. ``Write it in big, bold,
bright letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all that waiting was for naught. Pitt wasn't
among the hundreds of celebrities who paraded past.
</P>
<P>
   But her presence there wasn't a waste. Donned in military garb,
she was among the many ``bleacher creatures'' who were rooting for
``Saving Private Ryan'' as best picture.
</P>
<P>
   And, heck, how many people get to be (ITALICS BEGIN)that(END
ITALICS) close to so many stars?
</P>
<P>
   The fortunate few who secured coveted seats in the bleachers
that surrounded the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion were about as proud
as the runners who finished the L.A. Marathon. They told tales of
rain, cold, hours of standing in line and the endless buzz of
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were soooo many ambulances,'' said 13-year-old Kelly
Coward, who was hoping her front-row bleacher seat would offer a
close-up look at Tom Cruise. ``I stayed up all night. People were
yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the comment, `It's canceled, go home,' '' joked her
mother, Nancy Coward of San Clemente, who withstood the teasing
from passers-by. ``We're not here just to see celebrities. This is
an American tradition, and we wanted to come be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kari Dietrich of Newport Beach had just dozed off around 4 a.m.
on Sunday when the other bleacher fans got up and started forming a
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been standing for six hours and 15 minutes. All I want to
do is sit,'' she said. ``It will be really sad if I don't get a
seat at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, an elated Dietrich was escorted into the
bleachers, where she got a free disposable camera, an official
Oscar souvenir seat cushion and a blueberry muffin. Her survival
secret: ``Peppermint Patties.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, bleacher attire was marked by a decidedly
militaristic theme, a nod to the Steven Spielberg World War II
epic, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' One fan wore an old Army helmet, and
the Woody Creek High School gang was dressed in fatigues, ``Ryan''
T-shirts and singing their own version of a military marching
chant: ``I don't know what I've been told, but `Private Ryan' will
take the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg will notice us and
smile so we can get a good picture,'' Miramon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oscar vets Judy Eiland and Tina Hernandez _ a
front-row fixture in the Oscar bleachers for 16 years _ passed the
afternoon dreaming of catching more elusive stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for Jack Nicholson,'' Eiland said. ``One day
that little booger is going to walk down this carpet. He always
sneaks in the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right. He snuck in the less conspicuous way again.

`BLEACHER CREATURES' BRAVE THE COLD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jennifer Miramon spent four cold, sleepless, rainy
nights on the streets of Los Angeles with only thoughts of Brad
Pitt to keep her warm.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, her perseverance was rewarded when she and several
classmates from Woody Creek High School in Roseville, Calif.,
scored front-row bleacher seats bordering the red-carpeted entry to
the 71st Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   She waited breathlessly for a glimpse of the one star she was
dying to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad Pitt,'' the teen said dreamily. ``Write it in big, bold,
bright letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all that waiting was for naught. Pitt wasn't
among the hundreds of celebrities who paraded past.
</P>
<P>
   But her presence there wasn't a waste. Donned in military garb,
she was among the many ``bleacher creatures'' who were rooting for
``Saving Private Ryan'' as best picture.
</P>
<P>
   And, heck, how many people get to be (ITALICS BEGIN)that(END
ITALICS) close to so many stars?
</P>
<P>
   The fortunate few who secured coveted seats in the bleachers
that surrounded the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion were about as proud
as the runners who finished the L.A. Marathon. They told tales of
rain, cold, hours of standing in line and the endless buzz of
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were soooo many ambulances,'' said 13-year-old Kelly
Coward, who was hoping her front-row bleacher seat would offer a
close-up look at Tom Cruise. ``I stayed up all night. People were
yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the comment, `It's canceled, go home,' '' joked her
mother, Nancy Coward of San Clemente, who withstood the teasing
from passers-by. ``We're not here just to see celebrities. This is
an American tradition, and we wanted to come be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kari Dietrich of Newport Beach had just dozed off around 4 a.m.
on Sunday when the other bleacher fans got up and started forming a
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been standing for six hours and 15 minutes. All I want to
do is sit,'' she said. ``It will be really sad if I don't get a
seat at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, an elated Dietrich was escorted into the
bleachers, where she got a free disposable camera, an official
Oscar souvenir seat cushion and a blueberry muffin. Her survival
secret: ``Peppermint Patties.''
</P>

NISHIJIMA A TRUE FREEDOM-FIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yosuke Nishijima thinks of himself as a simple boxer, a boxer
with typical dreams. He wants to win a major world championship and
make a good living to support his wife and toddler son.
</P>
<P>
   However, fate appears to have more grandiose plans for the
taciturn cruiserweight from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Nishijima is nothing less than a pioneer: He is the first to
escape a boxing system in which fighters are as much indentured
servants to their managers and trainers as they are athletes and,
if he succeeds in the ring, could be a catalyst for change that
could rock the boxing establishment back home.
</P>
<P>
   Call Nishijima, scheduled to fight Aljenon DeBose tonight at the
Forum, the one who got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may actually change the system forever,'' said Tetsuji
Yano, a filmmaker working on a documentary about Nishijima since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, as dictated by the powerful Japanese Boxing Commission
and a culture that values loyalty, boxers are bound to their
managers and trainers for life. When Nishijima walked into a Tokyo
gym at 16, precedent said he wasn't walking out.
</P>
<P>
   And then he did.
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1997, Nishijima, now 25, left his country and the
only gym he'd known and came to the United States, where he
believed he would receive better training and control his own
destiny. He has found freedom, but still deflects the tentacles of
a Japanese system determined to bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   Nishijima first felt helpless in the grip of the system in
mid-1997. He wasn't getting the sparring he believed he needed for
lack of capable big fighters in Japan. His handlers _ including
manager Osamu Watanabe _ wanted to exploit him by having him fight
George Foreman, Nishijima said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as it was, they collected an unconscionable percentage of
his paydays. Yano said those on the periphery collect more of the
profits than the fighters do in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like his predecessors, Nishijima felt trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you could say I was frustrated,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``. . . I was always told, `If you leave the gym, you
will never box the rest of your life.' It was almost like a threat.
I thought there was no way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a lot of agony.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as hopeless as he believed.
</P>
<P>
   Nishijima had something no other Japanese fighter before him
had: A friend from Japan who lived in the U.S. and was intimately
familiar with the boxing business here.
</P>
<P>
   This friend, who has asked to remain anonymous, set Nishijima up
with respected trainer Freddie Roach and promoter Don Chargin and
helped arrange the logistics of the unprecedented move.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to pay a price emotionally, but he's convinced he
made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say now it's the best thing,'' he said. ``I finally felt
free. . . . It takes a long time to sort things out, though.
Sometimes I still struggle. I think about it even now.''
</P>
<P>
   So do Japanese boxing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The JBC, described by one American boxing authority as a
conglomeration of managers and trainers rather than an objective
body that regulates the sport, has followed through on threats to
obstruct Nishijima's career.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently trying to use language American authorities will
understand, the JBC claims to have a legitimate contract with
Nishijima while the fighter says it has expired. At the moment, the
matter is in the hands of lawyers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   However, the JBC hasn't left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   The California Athletic Commission has received a half-dozen
letters from the JBC asking that authorities here honor what they
believe are their legal rights by refusing to allow Nishijima to
fight. The last letter, dated March 2, 1998, was an attempt to
scuttle the Forum fight.
</P>
<P>
   California has rejected each request for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just haven't presented us with a legal contract that
would prohibit (Nishijima) from fighting,'' said Rob Lynch,
executive director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch wrote in a letter to Shigeru Kojima, executive secretary
of the JBC, dated May 12, 1998: ``Apparently the contract expired
January 31, 1997 and was to be automatically renewed. This
commission does not permit such automatic renewals of contracts as
all boxers and managers must personally appear before a California
Commission representative to sign an original or renewal contract.
This automatic renewal must also be considered an option clause
which is not permitted by this commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the JBC doesn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, where Nishijima is well known, the media has been
reluctant to report on him for fear the JBC will restrict access to
its fighters, according to Yano and other sources. Almost all of
the limited publicity Nishijima has received since he left Japan
has been negative.
</P>
<P>
   And, here, representatives of the JBC have contacted him by
phone and confronted him at awkward times. For example, Roach said
his fighter was once approached by several Japanese men in the
hallway of an arena before a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Nishijima swears he's able to shut out all such distractions. He
said his focus is where it should be: on the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   Roach isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the gym, he's focused and trains hard,'' Roach said. ``When
they start making calls to him and his family, when they show up at
fights, it's a distraction. I try to keep everything private, but
what can you do when (they) stand in the hallway and start speaking
Japanese to him? It does affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they ever tried to come into the locker room, though, they
wouldn't get too far. They think they own him, like he's a slave.
It's crazy. Let the kid get on with his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nishijima is reluctant to discuss his situation.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment on the boxing system in Japan, allowing
only that he much prefers the American way.
</P>
<P>
   And it's difficult to understand the toll it has taken on him.
He admitted he doesn't show his emotions. He said only that he
``still struggles inside'' and remains bitter toward his Japanese
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, however, Nishijima's struggle could ultimately
place him in the forefront of sports in his country.
</P>
<P>
   The (begin ital)magnitude(end ital) of his impact could hinge on
his success. If he fails as a fighter, his cause could go largely
unnoticed. If he succeeds, he becomes a fighter of international
stature and the JBC's greatest fears could become reality.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Nishijima?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty good, according to Roach. He has good power _ he's 19-1
with 12 knockouts _ and exceptional speed for a cruiserweight. His
skills are evolving though he's fought only twice in two years
because of an eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a potential threat to anyone in the cruiserweight
division,'' Roach said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the JBC and Co. have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   If Nishijima makes a name for himself, the Japanese media will
have no choice but to chronicle his career. Then comes the domino
effect: Other fighters will see they (begin ital)do(end ital) have
a way out of the chains and follow his path.
</P>
<P>
   Then, logic says, the old system will crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Nishijima's handlers and the JBC) are very fearful of
what Nishijima may pull off,'' Yano said. ``. . . If he's able to
really make it here, the news cannot be controlled by the JBC.
Nishijima would be too big. The media couldn't ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is he has to be successful. And I think he will. He
has the will, the courage, the determination and also the support
of many people.'' &QL;

suffering noticeably, despite somewhat slower gains recently. By
past standards, profits should be hurting, caught as they are
between rising pay and stagnant prices. But many corporations have
come up with numerous ways to dodge the bullet, and confound the
view, so widely shared, that inflation is an inevitable result of
sustained prosperity. By Louis Uchitelle.

   INDUSTRIAL-DESIGN (Undated) _ This has been the decade in which
software moved, big time, into the industrial designer's world. In
corporate offices across the country, engineers have been booting
up programs that let them tinker, in three dimensions, with every
permutation and combination of a product's design. It was just a

NEIGHBORHOOD SECESSIONISTS TRADE L.A. FOR BEVERLY HILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today refers to Monday.) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Along a secluded cul-de-sac lined with lush trees,
today is historic: Residents of the 10 homes officially will move
from the city of Los Angeles to the city of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   They don't need moving vans. These are a band of successful
secessionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all elated when this happened. Knowing it's over is
quite a thrill,'' said Marie-France Salaun, a longtime resident of
Hillgreen Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners of Hillgreen Drive, near Pico Boulevard and
Century Park East, had complained for years that police and fire
crews were too slow to find their homes because they are cut off
from Los Angeles by Beverly Hills streets.
</P>
<P>
   And then a decade ago, Salaun's 66-year-old husband, Al, died
after paramedics had difficulty finding the house.
</P>
<P>
   So the residents took up the fight not for independent cityhood
but for annexation to nearby Beverly Hills, the nation's most
celebrated city of high incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it takes a catastrophe for these things to
happen, and they have,'' said Abe Knobel, the resident who started
the campaign to secede from Los Angeles. ``One person has died, and
a fire along our street could have gotten out of control quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a decade of lobbying for residents to persuade
Beverly Hills to claim the tail end of their secluded street.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement required property owners to pay $32,500 per home
to Beverly Hills for expenses associated with the change, Los
Angeles city Legislative Analyst Jim Krakowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee, which homeowners happily paid, represents buying into a
glamorous town with higher property values as well as municipal
costs for changes in utilities, legal fees and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills City Council approved the annexation earlier
this month, nine years after Los Angeles and the county Local
Agency Formation Commission agreed to let these people go.
</P>
<P>
   The secession comes at the same time that Los Angeles is
battling Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment over the
possibility of the 1.3 million residents of the San Fernando Valley
seceding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 10-home annexation is not even close to the issues
involved in the Valley,'' Krakowski said. ``That's comparing apples
and oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Arlington, a senior planner for Beverly Hills, said city
officials originally questioned the annexation because they felt
the residents should have bought homes in Beverly Hills if they
wished to live there. They feared the exposure of Pico Boulevard
and its businesses to the city boundary would cause more traffic
and noise complaints that Beverly Hills would need to handle.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal became more attractive when the residents agreed to
pay for the annexation of a nearby alley called Heath Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The alley runs behind dozens of Beverly Hills homes but was
under Los Angeles jurisdiction, which required homeowners to get
parking permits in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt, and those residents felt, that the alley would be
safer if it were a part of Beverly Hills,'' Arlington said. ``That
was the single most compelling issue for us to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Krakowski said Los Angeles usually ignores the handfuls of
requests for property adjacent to Beverly Hills to be detached from
Los Angeles and annexed to the more glamorous city. The proposals
seldom make sense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to live in Beverly Hills, and that's not a
reason for us to act on those requests,'' Krakowski said. ``In this
case, police and fire (officials) agreed that getting to these
homes causes confusion. That made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Knobel and other homeowners united in 1989 when Salaun's husband
collapsed in a diabetic coma and Los Angeles paramedics were
confused about how to get to the cul-de-sac, Knobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Salaun's husband died after he reached the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in bad health then, but I think if the paramedics (had
been) able to get there quicker, he would not have had the
complications and would not have died so soon,'' Salaun said.
</P>
<P>
   Knobel maintains that the annexation was never about money.
Critics and some Beverly Hills city officials dismissed it as an
attempt by the Los Angeles homeowners to gain perks such as
increased property values and access to Beverly Hills schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason for this is fire and life safety,'' Knobel
said. ``Our gain is in our safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The annexation was the 14th by Beverly Hills since it was
incorporated in 1914. There are about 85 properties that straddle
the Los Angeles-Beverly Hills boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Hillgreen Drive homes will eventually be hooked up to
Beverly Hills' water and power sources, but it was unclear if there
would be any change in the utility rates. Residents will have to
deal with the school district directly to see if their children
will be allowed to attend classes in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Those possible headaches and costs don't bother them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to deal with any increased costs _ and with the
schools,'' Knobel said.

 &HT;    Fashion: Oscar night noteworthy, not surprising
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They just don't make 'em like they used to . . . the Oscar night
outfits, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Now that designers campaign as enthusiastically as congressional
candidates to get their clothes onto the right stars' backs, and
now that high-priced stylists _ not the stars themselves _ do the
actual shopping, the fun's gone out of watching the Oscars to gape
at who wore what.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone makes a see-through spectacle of herself the way
Cher used to do. No one shows up at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
done up like an early Bette Midler bimbo.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there were still a number of noteworthy looks worth
recalling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beyond the Pale: Gwyneth Paltrow was the evening's
standard-bearer for style and grace. Though her pink satin gown by
Ralph Lauren could have been tailored a bit more seductively, it
was at least in the shade of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And Paltrow's hair, parted and pulled back into a flawless
chignon, typified the way stars strove for a look that couldn't be
poked fun at.
</P>
<P>
   _ Father knows best: Undoubtedly, actress Liv Tyler, who wore
Pamela Dennis, takes style pointers from her father, Steven, who
fronts the Oscar-nominated (``Armageddon'') band Aerosmith. Not
only has Liv shorn her hair to the length of her dad's; she also
wore a heavily jeweled choker that matched his as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heavy hitters: They may rule the box office and the record
charts, but neither best actor nominee Tom Hanks nor Mariah Carey _
who performed in a duet (``When You Believe'') with Whitney
Houston, who also wore Valentino _ looked as if they'd been
anywhere near a StairMaster lately. Hanks' boxy Valentino tuxedo
did nothing to conceal the paunch he's developed (presumably for a
new role) since ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after appearing in so many music videos wearing the
skimpiest outfits imaginable, Carey looks as if she's put down Puff
Daddy and picked up puff pastry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better (with time): Geena Davis has shown before on Oscar
night that she looks good in pale peach. So the sight of her in a
peachy gown during the pre-awards telecast was a bit of a letdown.
But when she took the stage to introduce a dance interpretation of
the Oscar-nominated film scores, she looked stunning in a
semi-sheer, jewel-encrusted gown that had Armani written all over
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hair don'ts: A pair of actors showed off for the Oscars
sporting new, don't-try-this-at-home hairstyles. ``Austin Powers''
star Mike Myers had a brunet buzz cut that made him look like Dr.
Evil got hold of him.
</P>
<P>
   And ``A Simple Plan'' star Billy Bob Thornton had bleached blond
locks that threatened to make him prettier than girlfriend Laura
Dern.

ENIGMATIC LAKERS ROLL INTO TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ This is not your father's ``Showtime''
Lakers that roll into town tonight to play the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Call this version ``Team Tabloid.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's not Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant arm wrestling for
control of the team, it's the controversial acquisition of Glen
Rice. It's firing ordained minister Del Harris while courting
cross-dressing power forward Dennis Rodman. It's 66-year-old, blue
jeans-wearing owner Jerry Buss trying to lift his team to an NBA
championship for the first time in 11 years while finding time to
bring girlfriends half his age into the postgame locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers aren't the league's best team, but they are the most
talented. Their story lines are much more fascinating than their
layup lines, lifting ticket sales and fan interest while lowering
moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're good for the NBA,'' Lakers guard Kobe Bryant
said. ``People either love us or hate us, but they seem to care a
heck of a lot about what happens either way.''
</P>
<P>
   LA struts into Dallas predictably enigmatic.
</P>
<P>
   They have surrendered 100 points in four of five games, but have
a chance to earn a 3-3 road trip with a victory tonight after
rallying from 24 points down to win in Orlando yesterday. The
Lakers have the league's best center in O'Neal, one of the best
shooting guards in Bryant and one of the best pure shooters in
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The focus, however, is on Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-day sabbatical that he attributes to neither
drinking, gambling or marital problems, Rodman returned yesterday,
apparently to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back, and I'm here to stay for good,'' Rodman said. ``I
had to find out if I wanted to play basketball. People have to
understand that I have to do these things. If not, they can just
tear up my contract and I'll leave.''
</P>
<P>
   After wavering for weeks on whether to pursue the 37-year-old
with a wall full of championship and rebounding skins, the Lakers
suddenly, sadly rely on him. Because LA traded backup center Elden
Campbell and waived Corie Blount to get Rice, Rodman's rebounding
and low-post defense is crucial to the team's title equation.
</P>
<P>
   During Rodman's absence _ rumored to be a trip to retain wife
Carmen Electra from the courtship of Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee
_ the Lakers didn't play interior defense, they didn't rebound and
they didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodman the Lakers are 10-0; without him they are 8-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're rolling the dice a little,'' general manager
Mitch Kupchak said recently. ``But obviously what Dennis gives us
on the floor could pay huge dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman scored four points, grabbed six rebounds and picked up a
technical foul for throwing an elbow against the Magic. He says his
personal problems are fixed and that he'll stay with the team
through the season.
</P>
<P>
   LA, a fragile team walking the tightrope between greatness and
disaster, better hope so. With Rodman, the Lakers are a deep,
veteran team with the talent and savvy to be the favorites to win
the championship. Without him, they degenerate into a team with a
rookie coach, an impatient and eccentric owner, a 20-year-old
taking key shots and a dominating big man guaranteed to miss
crunch-time free throws.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA title that for years rested on the play of a man who
wagged his tongue may be in the hands of a talented misfit who
wears floppy Dr. Seuss hats.

ORDER RESTORED AS THREE TOP SEEDS MAKE FINAL FOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Now that we know who is packing for college
basketball's first Final Four spring break in Florida, it's
apparent that history will be a compelling theme next weekend at
Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Our invited guests are Duke (36-1), Connecticut (32-2) and
Michigan State (33-4) _ all No. 1 seeds _ and No. 4 seed Ohio State
(27-8). This is the third time that three No. 1 seeds have reached
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a glittering gathering. The combined winning
percentage of .895 bests the winning percentage of the two previous
Final Fours with three No. 1 seeds (1993 and 1997).
</P>
<P>
   All four teams are in position to make history. Here's the
rundown:
</P>
<P>
   Duke. The Blue Devils enter with a 31-game winning streak.
They'll be trying for their third title of this decade. Duke has
won four tournament games by the average margin of 30 points. The
biggest average winning margin by a national champion is 23.7
points by UCLA in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   With a national championship, the Blue Devils could cement their
claim to team of the 1990s. And for coach Mike Krzyzewski, it is a
return to the Final Four for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be back in this spot, it's kind of dangerous,''
Duke junior forward Chris Carrawell said. ``He knows how to win.
He's got two national championships. We've got a great
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State. The Spartans return to their first Final Four
since 1979, when they won their national title behind Magic
Johnson. The Spartans are Big Ten Conference champions and have won
22 games in a row. The Duke-Michigan State semifinal is a rematch
of a Great Eight game that the Blue Devils won, 73-67.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut. The Huskies have erased nearly a decade of
frustration by reaching the school's first Final Four. Connecticut
is the only team other than Duke to spend time ranked No. 1 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Three times this decade, Connecticut and coach Jim Calhoun
reached the regional final only to lose. The first disappointment
came in 1990 when the Huskies lost to Duke on a Christian Laettner
buzzer beater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Coach that we didn't want him to be known \Rany
longer\S as `the best coach who never got to the Final Four,' ''
said sophomore guard Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State. Other than Duke, the Buckeyes have the most Final
Four history in this field. This is Ohio State's ninth Final Four,
but its first since 1968. The Buckeyes will be trying to win their
first national championship since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   And Ohio State has authored one of the most amazing turnarounds
ever. Last season, the Buckeyes were 8-22 overall and 1-15 in the
Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crying after every game, wondering when it would get
better,'' said Ohio State sophomore guard Michael Redd of last
season's struggles. ``This season has been a dream.''

PATTERSON READY, BUT RANGERS KEEP FINGERS CROSSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The Rangers need Danny Patterson back to have
any chance of a decent bullpen. That becomes even more dire if John
Wetteland isn't ready to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has been troubled by back spasms and a bad ankle and
is questionable for Opening Day. Patterson is among the first line
of defense if the All-Star closer isn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that opportunity, I just don't want it this way,''
Patterson said. ``I want to earn the job, I don't want to be forced
into it. But if they give me the ball, I'd be more than willing.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates hopes Wetteland will be ready. But Oates is
also formulating a backup plan that calls for Patterson,
right-hander Tim Crabtree and left-hander Eric Gunderson to share
duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got three guys who can get me through the final two
innings,'' Oates said. ``If one of them gets hot, I could go with
him a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson could be that one because of his talent. Oates said he
compares favorably with Wetteland as far as ``stuff.' But questions
remain about Patterson's health and durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wetteland can pitch three days in a row and have the same
stuff,'' Oates said. ``With Patterson there can be a dropoff. You
just don't know. There's still a question of resiliency and
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were impressed with Patterson when he had a 1.68
earned-run average and 10 saves for Oklahoma City in 1996 and was
10-6 with a 3.42 ERA as a Rangers rookie in 1997. But he required
shoulder surgery after the season and was not as effective last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson relies on a sinking fastball _ similar to what Kevin
Brown throws and the ``Vulcan,'' a split-fingered fastball. Bullpen
coach Larry Hardy said Patterson needs both pitches to be
effective. Neither were effective last year as Patterson struggled
to come back from rotator-cuff surgery. By the end of the season he
had fallen into despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing; I didn't have anything left,'' Patterson said.
``I had no movement and no velocity. If I didn't put the pitch in a
perfect spot, it got hit. I felt like a monkey throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers say Patterson is throwing the ball the way he did
before the surgery. But the results this spring have been mixed. He
followed two scoreless outings by allowing two runs in an inning
against the Reds yesterday. He has a 7.37 ERA after six outings and
opponents are hitting .324 off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about resilient, but it wasn't consistent,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still night and day from last year,'' Hardy said. ``The
first thing is his strength is back and, with that, his mental
approach is better than it was last year in the fact that last year
he was always wondering how he was going to feel. I see him getting
better the whole year as he gets into it and sees he's healthy and
confident it's only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is a vital part of the Rangers' bullpen even with
Wetteland healthy. The Rangers were outscored 81-79 in the eighth
inning last season, the inning in which the setup relievers bridge
the gap between the starter and the closer.
</P>
<P>
   But come Opening Day, it could be Patterson facing down the
Detroit Tigers' Bobby Higginson, Tony Clark and Dean Palmer with a
one-run lead in the ninth inning.

Blue Devils rip Temple 85-64
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was a time when they took this sort
of thing for granted. It was simply part of the annual rites of
spring, a three-week romp through the bracket, twice ending with
smiles and high-fives and nets draped around necks.
</P>
<P>
   Final Four? Been there, done that, got a drawer full of
T-shirts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Continental Airlines Arena, the scene along the Duke
bench was a little different. It had been awhile _ at least by Blue
Devils standards, and there was nothing ho-hum about it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was genuine joy in the faces after an 85-64
victory over Temple in this East Regional final, none more than in
the one belonging to a coach who wondered if this sort of
experience would come his way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting back to the Final Four, for me, is incredibly
fulfilling,'' Mike Krzyzewski said after his team advanced for the
first time in five seasons, earning a national semifinal date
Saturday with Michigan State in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94-95, there was part of me that wasn't sure if we'd ever
do this again. It's not promised to anybody. For awhile there, it
seemed like it was. Seven out of nine years, it just seemed like
you just get it. Then a whole bunch of things were taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning a school-record 31st straight game, Duke (36-1) got
many of them back, earning its eighth Final Four trip of the
Krzyzewski era, the fifth by way of the New Jersey Meadowlands. In
returning to the game's biggest stage, the Blue Devils also quieted
the ghosts of last year's collapse against Kentucky in the South
Regional final, where they blew a 17-point lead and watched the
Wildcats go on to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we've had a lot of things happen,'' Duke guard
Trajan Langdon said. ``We got back to where we were last year, and
this time, we fought through.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, the fifth-year senior, made sure of it. With his team
struggling early, he assessed a shaky situation and decided it was
time to take charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little bit nervous today at the beginning of the
game,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Trajan wasn't, but I sensed that they
were not afraid, but they were young.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon was neither young nor afraid. With Temple off to an
early 9-5 lead, he scored on a runner, then drained a pair of
3-pointers. A spurt that eventually stretched out to 17-2 took much
of the starch out of an underdog that knew it would need a
near-perfect performance to pull off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Trajan went into that spree was bigger than the points,''
said Krzyzewski. ``It really settled everyone down. He amazed me,
knowing that he had to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Langdon got his team the lead, the rest of the Blue Devils
happily fell in line. They finished with 60 percent shooting from
the field, hitting 27-of-45. They made 10-of-17 from 3-point range,
with Langdon alone sinking five of six. And when they got tired of
nailing the long-range shots, they got the ball down low to Elton
Brand, who hit eight of 10 from the floor on his way to 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this, Temple was game, but Duke eventually
was too much to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils led 43-31 at the half and extended the advantage
to 61-41 on another Langdon trey with 14:36 remaining, but Temple
wasn't quite done. A Mark Karcher 3-pointer capped a 13-3 run to
make it 64-54 with 10:23 still left, and memories of the collapse
against Kentucky were beginning to stir.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get scared or anything like that,'' Duke point guard
William Avery said.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon again delivered, quelling the uprising with two free
throws. Brand provided the last five points in an 11-2 run that
settled the issue once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Karcher and Lamont Barnes finished with 19 points each for the
losers, but Temple made just 25 of 67 shots (37.3 percent).
Karcher's line typified the struggle, as he missed 18 of 25 shots,
including 12 of his 15 3-point tries.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done, Temple coach John Chaney had little trouble
identifying the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew someone was going to hit from the outside, we just
didn't know who or how well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon provided the answer, and the Blue Devils were headed off
to a rematch with Michigan State, a team they defeated 73-67 in the
Great Eight on Dec. 2 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming, and it's a great feeling,''
Langdon said. ``I knew coming into the game that this was my last
chance to go to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Blue Devils are going. Being away for a while
may simply make the trip a little more fun.

BURTON TAMES DARLINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ His race car was too wrecked to run.
Fortunately for Jeff Burton, the race track ``Too Tough to Tame''
was too wet to race on yesterday afternoon _ a bizarre combination
that added up to a rain-shortened victory in the TranSouth
Financial 400.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when racing against threatening skies was as important
as racing the treacherous Darlington Raceway, Burton and his Roush
Racing crew transformed an early pit stop for track position and a
late stroke of luck into his second victory of the 1999 NASCAR
Winston Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   Burton also will be the Cup points-leader for the first time in
his career when he rolls into Texas Motor Speedway this week for
the Primestar 500 on Sunday. Burton scored the first of his seven
career victories at the 1.5-mile track in Fort Worth in April 1997,
and he will return after having won two of the past three races of
this season. Burton leads Gordon by seven points after five of 34
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus on Monday turns to Texas,'' said Burton, who will
have to break out a backup No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus for
the reconfigured and repaved TMS. ``We had this car slated to run
in Texas. We're disappointed we can't take it there. But the car
we're taking finished fourth at Atlanta. We think it's a car
capable of running up front.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Burton was racing _ ahead of Gordon and Mayfield _
when the rain almost ruined his day. As it was, Burton got swept up
in a chain-reaction wreck down the frontstretch involving the
spinning cars of Ernie Irvan, Kenny Irwin, Kenny Wallace and Jerry
Nadeau. Burton tapped the rear of Nadeau's Ford, and slid hard into
the outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   It painted a serious ``Darlington Stripe'' on Burton's car, but
not enough to keep him from crossing the start/finish line ahead of
Mayfield and Gordon. The latter had dropped to third after running
into Irwin's disabled Taurus and damaging the right front section
of his Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   With the rain falling, NASCAR officials red-flagged the race to
a halt for the second time. The first stoppage came after only 45
of the 293 scheduled laps had been completed and consumed 2 hours,
46 minutes and 52 seconds. The race had become official after
reaching the halfway point, and with dusk settling in, NASCAR
declared the day over after 164 laps/224 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Burton already had exited his battered car, looked it over, and
performed a half-baked rain dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah, I was waving for the rain to come on,'' said
Burton, who led three times for a race-high 59 laps. ``First of
all, I was mad because I knew it wasn't going to rain very long. I
just knew it wasn't, but it didn't have to rain very long. The
first thing that went through my mind was that we had the best car,
we had the best pit-stop decision, we did the right job _ and I
wrecked. So I was mad at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The car was so whipped that crew chief Frankie Stoddard was
elected to direct it into Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every crew chief is a wannabe driver,'' Stoddard said. ``When
I saw my chance to drive into Victory Lane, I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was appropriate, because it was Stoddard's call to
``short-pit'' under green for track position that proved to be the
move of the race. Burton was running third to leader Mayfield and
Gordon when he and Dale Jarrett pitted under green on Lap 113.
Burton took on four tires and a full load of fuel in 16.5 seconds.
When that cycle of pit stops was completed, Burton assumed the lead
on Lap 120 and held it to the race's rowdy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great pit stop _ a great call in the pits to come in
and pit early _ and then we got on and off pit road better than
anyone else,'' said Burton, one of eight drivers involved in 13
lead changes. ``It was a true team effort to win this race, and add
that with a dramatic wreck and all that stuff, it's hard to top
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Runnerup Mayfield, who finished a frustrating 36th at Atlanta
Motor Speedway last weekend, took pride in his second top-five
finish in five races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great car, an awesome car,'' said Mayfield, driver of
the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford. ``But my hat's off to the 99 team. They
did a good job, pitting early and getting track position.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon _ like Burton a two-time winner this season _ posted his
fourth finish of third or better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could be leading the points right now, but we're
close and that's all right,'' said Gordon, driver of the No. 24
DuPont Automotive Finishes Monte Carlo. ``I'm frustrated because of
what happened to me on the last lap. But I'm the opposite of
Jeremy. I'm kind of glad it got called, because I would have never
ended up third.''
</P>
<P>
   And Burton never would have ended up the winner.

NL Central teams missing important components
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ORLANDO, Fla. _ The National League Central race might not be
decided on the field this season, but instead in the trainer's
room.
</P>
<P>
   A part of any sport, injuries have played an increasingly
important factor this spring _ and the regular season still is two
weeks away. Nowadays, a doctor is as valuable to a club as a
cleanup hitter or dominant pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams around baseball have been lucky enough to avoid the
injury bug, with several key players suffering significant injuries
and others being diagnosed with severe illnesses. In the NL
Central, at least four teams currently have key players nursing
some kind of ailment, including the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make the rounds:
</P>
<P>
   The Astros learned during the first week of camp they would be
without the services of Moises Alou at least until August and
possibly for the entire season because of a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in the All-Star outfielder's left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs, arguably the most banged-up club in the
division, will have to get use to life without pitcher Kerry Wood.
The 1998 NL Rookie of the Year is out for the season with a torn
right elbow ligament. To make matters worse, closer Rod Beck has
been slowed by a bulging disk in his lower back that threatens to
sideline him until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle was expected to anchor the Cincinnati Reds'
pitching staff. But with his recovery from a weakened right
shoulder and strained left quadriceps (thigh) muscle slowed, the
club is anticipating Neagle's starting the season on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Edgar Renteria (knee bruise) and center fielder Ray
Lankford (knee surgery) have the Cardinals scrambling to find
alternatives in the likelihood neither is ready for the season
opener. Want more bad news, Cardinals fans? Righthander Matt
Morris' sprained right elbow may a lot worse than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, the remaining clubs in the six-team
division, have managed to dodge bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems right now that the team with nine healthy players
(opening day) might be the one to get out of the box the fastest,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``You're almost afraid
to put your team out there anymore (in exhibition games) with the
way players are going down. I can't remember a spring when there
have been so many significant injuries to so many different
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit this spring? The Atlanta Braves lost slugging first
baseman Andres Galarraga for the season because of a cancerous
tumor in his lower back, and closer Kerry Ligtenberg is on the
shelf indefinitely with an elbow injury that threatens his season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, the 1997 American League
Rookie of the Year and runner-up in last season's AL Most Valuable
Player voting, left the team this weekend and flew to California
for an MRI on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The bad luck even extended to the manager's office when the
Yankees' Joe Torre was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to control it,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The key is addressing the problem when it happens. Depending on
timing, most teams can evaluate talent within the system or
consider trades if an injury to a star player occurs early enough
during the spring. Otherwise, clubs are scrambling to fill gaps as
the season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, well-stocked in the outfield and loaded with
All-Star players throughout the lineup, appear to be one of the
teams best equipped to handle injuries over the long haul, with
reliable replacement Richard Hidalgo already showing he can compete
on the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say depth is a problem when you can't find playing
time for all these people,'' Hunsicker said. ``I feel it's a nice
problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it is known how Alou responds to rehabilitation on his
knee, the Astros will make do with what they have. So will the
other teams in the division and around baseball. Just don't feel
sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division, for some reason, seems to be the hard-luck
division this year,'' said Cubs general manager Ed Lynch. ``There
is no sympathy asked for and none given. We are not going to feel
sorry for ourselves, because no one feels sorry for us.''
